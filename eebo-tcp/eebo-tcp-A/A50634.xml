         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

not to aspire to that name,
if it should not like them want
measures. But, seing your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty
makes you think even what is
justice to your merit to be flattery,
as the greatness of your merit keeps
the highest Elogies I can give you
from being so; I shall retain my
respects for you in a breast, which
may dispute sincerity as to your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests,
with the first of those who
pretend to it: With which I shall the
sooner rest satisfi'd, because no paper
nor any thing else except the heart,
which sends you this, is capable to
retain or expresse that kindnesse
it feels for you. In the above-written
enumeration of your Titles,
I have neither design'd to flatter
you, or to contribute to your fame;
but rather to remember you how
much you are debtor to Providence
for it's kindness, and we to you for
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53048:3"/>
your repeated cares, that thereby ye
may be thankfull to it, and we to you.
In order to which, I have present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
you and my Country with these
Discourses, which by inciting
both to be vertuous, will not allow
either to be ungrate: and therein
if I evidence not abilities, I will
at least kindness and respect; which
cannot but far out-value the other,
seing the last relate to you, and
the first respects only my self. Since
then holy Altars have not disdain'd
to offer up Pigeons, and such like
value-lesse things, which nothing
but the sincerity of the offerer could
render considerable, refuse not to
accept and revise these, though
unfiinsht Discourses: And if a mans
last words may be believ'd, I (who

it unsuitable to place it under the
Bushel of a private Protection, but
rather to fix it upon such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous
Elevation, as your exalted
names, that Vertue might lance
out from thence its glorious beams
more radiently, and the better di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
these who intend to be led by it.
Narrower Souls then yours, have
not room enough to lodge such vast
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53048:5"/>
thoughts, as <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Honour</hi>
should inspire: And that which rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
you to that hight, which deserves
this complement from Vertue, does
deserve that ye should not, when ye
have attained to that hight, neglect
its address, though sent you by the
meanest of it and your servants.</p>
            <p>Ye may (<hi>My Lords and Gentlemen</hi>)
make your selves illustrious by your
Vertue; and which is yet nobler
(because more extensive) ye may
illustrat Vertue by your Greatness,
and as the <hi>Impressa</hi> of a great Prince,
makes Gold more current, though
not more pure; So your Patrocinie
and Example may render Vertue
more fashionable and useful then now
it is. Undervalued Vertue makes
then its application to you, as to
those whom, or whose Predecessors it
hath obliged; And persecuted Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
deserves your Patronage, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
Vertue is worthy of your
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53048:5"/>
Imitation. And seing it did raise your
families, and offers still to raise monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
for your memory, ye do in that
assistance but pay your debt, and buy
fame from succeeding ages. And as
what is ingraved upon growing Trees,
does inlarge it self as the Tree rises, so
Vertue will be serious to advance you,
knowing that it will receive exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
accordingly as ye are promoted.
Vertue is nothing else, but the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of these principles which respect
the universal good of others; and
therefore, Nature out of kindness to
its own productions, and mankind in
favour to their own interests, have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobled
and adored such as were strict
observers of those. The only se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
and noble way then to be admir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and honoured, is to be vertuous;
this will make you as it did <hi>Augustus,</hi>
the ornament of your age, and as it
did <hi>Vespasian</hi> the delight of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.
This is (though to my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grate)
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53048:6"/>
the way to be nobly <hi>singular,</hi>
and truly great. For men follow
you, when ye are vitious, in comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to their own depraved hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
but when they shall assimulat
themselves to you in your Vertues,
they will shew truly their depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and that they follow you and
not their own inclinations. In Vice
ye but follow the mode of others,
but in re-entring Vertue into the
Bon-grace of the World, ye will
be leaders; by this your lives will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
patterns, and your sentences
Lawes to posterity, who shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
into your actions, not only that
they may admire, but (which is
more) that they may imitat you
in them. I intend not by this
discourse (My Lords and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men)
that all Vertues should shrink
in to the narrowness of a Cell or Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers
Gown. No, no, publick
Vertues are in their extension as
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:53048:6"/>
much preferable to private, as the
one place is more august then the
other, of which to give you but one
instance (for the Principle is too well
founded to need moe) there is more
Vertue in relieving the oppressed,
then in abstaining from oppression,
for that comprehends this, and adds
to it the nobleness of courage, and
the humanity of compassion. The
one is the employment of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
but the other of that omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
GOD, whom these Philosophers
with trembling adore: In the one
we vanquish, but in the other we on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fly temptations. Vertue then has
employment for you, Great Souls! as
well as for retired Contemplators,
and though Justice, Temperance, and
these Vertues wherein none share
with you, be more intrinsecally
noble, then the atchieving the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Victories, wherein fate souldiers
and accidents challenge an interest;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:53048:7"/>
Yet Vertue loves to bestow Lawrels
as well as Bayes, and hath its Heroes,
as well as Philosophers. Rouse up
then your native courage, and let it
overcome all things except your cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency,
and fear nothing but to stain
your innocence; undervalue your
Ancestors no otherwise, then by
thinking their actions too small a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern
for your designs; and assist your
Prince, till ye make the World
(which is washt by the Sea on all
quarters) that Isle which should ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
his Scepter; your time
makes the richest part of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
treasure, and every hour ye mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
of that, is a sacrilegious theft
committed against your Countrey.
Throw not then so much time away,
(though some be allowable) in
hunting and hauking which are not
the noblest exercises, seing they fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
alwayes the strongest, and do
incline men (though surdly) to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:53048:7"/>
and cruelty (for which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
(I beleeve) <hi>Nimrod</hi> the first Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
is in Scripture observed to have
been a mighty Hunter) and with
<hi>Lucullus</hi> that glorious Roman think
it the noblest hunting, to pursue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors
by Justice in peace, and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reclaimable
enemies by Armies in
War. Raise siege from before these
coye Ladies (I speak no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of the nobler
sort, for to court such will obliege
you to learn Witt, Liberality, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
and Courage) who do highten
their obstinacy of design to make you
lengthen your pursuites, and lay it
down before these strong Cities,
which are by no forc'd metaphor
called the Mistresses of the world, le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
their proud walls when they refuse
your just commands, with the ground
whereon they stand, and leave it as a
doubt to your posterity, when they
see ruines, to judge whither your
fury or the thunder has lighted there.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:53048:8"/>
But if ye will justifie your comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to deserving beauties, employ
your courage, as well as affection in
their service (for till then ye serve
them but by halfs) And as <hi>Cesar</hi> at
his parting told <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> think
your selves unworthy of them, till ye
have raised your own value by such
exploits, as courage has made great,
and Vertue has made generous.
Court them as he did her, with no
other Serenades, then the pleasant
noise of your Victories; and after
ye have returned, covered not with
perfumes, or tissue, but with deserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and blossoming Lawrels, then that
same vertous Courage, which hath
forced a passage through Walls and
Ramparts (piercing where shot of
Cannon languisht, or gave back) will
find an entry into the hardest heart,
which if it yield not to those gallant
importunities of fate and fame, it
is certainly more unworthy of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:53048:8"/>
your pains then ye of its choice.
But forget not amidst all your Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phees,
rather to chastise pride, then
to be proud of any your plumpest
successes (which become cheats, not
victories, when men are vain of them)
for by so doing you shall become
Vassals to it: Whilst ye toil to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slave
others to you, endeavour rather
to deserve, then to court Fame: for
in the one case ye will make it your
Trumpet, whereas in the other it will
become your Imperions Mistriss; and
ye will thus oblige it to follow you,
Whereas otherwayes you may weary
your selves in following it. The
noblest kind of vanity, is to do good,
not to please others, or to expect a
reward from them, (and Fame is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else) but do so of design, to
gratifie your own gallant inclinations,
judging that the having done what is
good and great, is the noblest reward
of both, and scattering, like the Sun,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:53048:9"/>
equal light, when men look, or look
not upon it. The noblest kind of
detraction, is to lessen those who ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
your Vertue, not by obscuring
their light, as the dull earth eclipses
the Moon; but by out-shining it as
the Sun renders all these other Stars
inconspicuous, which shine, but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
not at the same time with it.
Raise your spirits by these Heroick
efforts, to so generous a pitch, that ye
need not think Heaven it self too
high for you: And as if all things

Calculation then that
of my sins, be found
to be old; yet in that
small parcel of time
which I have already
transacted, I have, by my own practice,
been so Criminal, and by my example
adopted so many of other mens sins into
the number of my own, that though I
should spend the residue of my allowance
without one error (which is equally
impossible and desireable) yet that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative

it could attone my foregoing sins no
more, then the not contracting new

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:53048:11"/>
the old. The consideration of which
prevailed with me, to endeavour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
others from their vices, by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
of this tenor, that in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solited
practice I might be vertuous,
as I have been vitious in the practice of
such as have followed my example; And
that I might in the time they should
imploy well, redeem what I my self had
so mispent. In order to which, I did
resolve to address my self to the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and Gentry, as to those whose
reason was best illuminated; and by
prevailing with whom, the world (who
imitats them as they depend upon
them) may be most compendiously
gained to the profession of Philosophy,
and to such as have most leasure to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
upon what is offered, and fewest
temptations to abstract them from obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their own perswasions: And as
Physitians do judge their Medicaments
will be most successfull, when they ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
second, then force Nature. So I
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:53048:11"/>
resolved to use the assistance of their
own inclinations in my discourses to
them, laying aside an enemy, and gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus a friend by one and the same
task. Wherefore finding, that most of
them were either taken by an itch for
honour, or a love to ease, I have fitted
their humors with two Discourses; in
the one whereof, I endeavour to prove,
<hi>That nothing is so mean as Vice;</hi> and
in the next I shall prove, <hi>That there is
nothing so easie as to be Vertuous.</hi> I
had, I confess, some thoughts of this
Discourse, when I first undertook the
defence of <hi>Solitude,</hi> but I thought it
fit to acquaint my self with writing, by
writing to privat persons, before I at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
to write to such as were of a
more elevated condition: And that it
was fit to invite all men first to Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
which I prefer as the securest
Harbour of Vertue. But if some would
pursue a publick life, as the more noble,
I thought it fit to demonstrate to them,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53048:12"/>
That there is nothing truly Noble, but
what is sincerely Vertuous. I doubt
not but some will out of mistake (I hope
few will out of malice) think that the
Writing upon such forreign Subjects,
binds this double guilt upon me, That
I desert my own imployment, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vades
what belongs to those of another
Profession: But if we number the
hours that are spent in Gaming, Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or Bodily Exercises (at none of
which I am dexterous) If we consider
what time is spent in Journeys, and in
attending the Tides and returns of
Affairs, we will find many moe vacant
interluds, then are sufficient for wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
ten Sheets of Paper in two years
space, especially upon a Subject which
requires no reading, aud wherein no
man can write happily, but he who
writes his own thoughts. With which,
pardon me to think him a sober wit,
who cannot fill one sheet in three hours;
by which calculation there needs go
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:53048:12"/>
only thirty select hours to ten sheets:
And his life is most usuriously imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
who cannot spare so many out of
two years to his divertisements; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
where the materials are such dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
observations, as are thrust upon me
and all others by our living in the
world, and are so orthodox and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable,
that an ordinary dress cannot
but make them acceptable. And so few
(I may say none) have written upon
the Subject, that I am not put to forge
somewhat that may be new: But what
ever others judge of this or me, I find
that it is a part of my imployment as a
Man and Christian, to plead for Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
against Vice. And really, as a
Barrister, few Subjects will imploy
more my Invention, or better more my
unlabour'd Eloquence, then this can
do. And I find, that both by writing
and speaking Moral Philosophy, I may
contract a kindness for Vertue, seing
such as repeat a lye with almost any fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:53048:13"/>
do at last really believe it.
Neither is there any thing more natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
then to have much kindness, for
either these Persons, or Sciences where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
we are daily conversant: And by
this profession and debate, I am obliged
(though I fear that I satisfie not that
obligation) by a new and strong tye to be
Vertuous; lest I else be inconsequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
to my own principles, and so be
repute a fool, either in not following
what I commend, or in commending
so much what by my practice I declare
is not worth the being followed: And
therefore if I cannot pleasure others
(which is my great aime, and will yeeld
me great satisfaction) I will at least
profit my self: Which, because it is
more independent, is therefore more
noble, and so will suit best with my
Subject, though the other would suit
better with my desires.</p>

the world grows older,
by so much (like such
as wax old) its light
grows dimmer; and in
this twilight of it's declining age, it
too frequently mistakes the colours of
good and evil, and not infrequently
believes that to be the body, which
is but its shaddow. But amongst all
its errors, those which concern ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
are the most (because conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous,
therefore) dangerous; every
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:53048:14"/>
fault being here an Original sin, and
becoming, because of the authority
of the offender, an Law, rather then
an Example. Some conceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
obliged in honour to endeavour
to be second to none, and therefore
to overturn all who are their Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors:
Others to think every thing
just whereby they may repay (though
to the ruine of Publick Justice) the
favours done to their private Persons,
or Fortunes. Some imagine that
they are in honour bound to live at
the rate, and maintain the grandour
of their Predecessors, though at the
expence of their starving Creditors
(obedient to Nature in nothing oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
but in this fantastick keeping
of their Ranks) and there want not
many, who judge it derogatory to
theirs, to acknowledge these errors
of which they stand convinced.
Young Gallants likewise look upon
Vertue, as that which confines too
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:53048:14"/>
narrowly their inclinations, judging
every thing mean which falls short of
all the length, to which power or
fancy can stretch it self: And as a
Gentile Wit hath handsomly exprest
it, they believe that</p>
            <q>Honour is nothing but an itch of blood,
A great desire to be extravagantly good.</q>
            <p>And thus whilst every man mistakes
his Fancy for his Honour, they make
Honour to be like the Wind (from
which at that rate it doth little dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer)
then which nothing sounds
higher, and yet nothing is less under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood.
To vindicate Honour from
these aspersions, and reclaim persons
otherwayes Noble from these errors,
I have undertaken this Discourse:
the nobleness of whose Subject de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves,
that it had been illuminate by
the victorious hand of mighty <hi>Cesar,</hi>
and to have been Writ by a Quill
pluckt from the Wing of a Fame.
But I hope the Readers will consider,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:53048:15"/>
that seing I am able to say so much
upon it, that more sublime Wits
would be able to say much more.
And as in refining of Mettals, the
first work-men require usually least
skill; so I hope that after I have
digged up with rather pains, then
Art, the first Ore, it will hereafter
be refined by some happier hand.</p>
            <p>I have in great esteem these Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
which are derived from An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors
(though that be to be great
by our Mothers labours,<note place="margin">Native Honour commen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded.</note> rather then
our own) and to those which Princes
bestow (though that be but to be
gallant in Livery) and I believe that
we may justly interpret <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzars</hi>
Image (whereof the Head is
said to have been Gold,<note place="margin">Dan. 2.</note> the Breast
Silver, the Belly Brass, the Legs
Iron, and the Feet Clay, to be a
Hierogliphick of this lower World,
wherein Nature hath imprest the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Ranks of Mankind, with gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:53048:15"/>
advantages suitable to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective
imployments; The meaner
sort falling like dregs to the bottom,
whilst the more refined Spirits do
like the Cream rise above; these like
sparkles flying upward, whilst the
others do like the contemned ashes
lye neglected upon the level. And
seing the Wise Former of the World,
did design by its Fabrick, the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation
of His Glory; it is most
reasonable to conclude, that He
would adorn such as are most conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous
in it, with such charms and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishments
as might most vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
ravish the beholders into the
admiration of that Glorious Essence
they represent. The Almighty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hereby so kind to such whom he
hath deprived of the pleasure of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
others, as to give them the
pleasure of being commanded by such
as they need not be ashamed to obey,
and so just to those whom he hath
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:53048:16"/>
burdened with that command, as to
fit them for it by resembling indow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
And as by the Heroickness
of these who represent him, he mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
his own wisdom in that choice;
So by their publick spiritedness,
he manifests his love to these who
are to be governed. Thus as amongst
the Spheres, the higher still roll with
the greatest purity: and as in natural
Bodies, the Head, is as well the
highest as the noblest part of that
pretty Fabrick (from being vain
whereof, nothing could let us, but
that, as the Apostle sayes, <hi>it is given
us, and is not our own workmanship</hi>)
so amongst men (each whereof is a
little World, or rather a nobler
draught of the greater) the highest
are ordinarily the more sublime; for
such as attain by election to that
hight, must be presumed best to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
it, such as force a passage to it,
could not do so without abilities far
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:53048:16"/>
raised above the ordinary allowance,
and such as by their birth are accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Noble, have ordinarily (like
water) their blood so much the more
purified, by how much the further it
hath run from its first Fountain: An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity
is an abridg'd eternity, and
that being one of GODS Attributes,
these do oft resemble him most in his
other Attributes, who can pretend
with greatest justice to this. And
as in natural bodies, duration doth
argue a fineness, and strength of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,
so we cannot but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that those Families have been
most worthy, who have worn out
the longest tract of time without
committing any such enorme crime,
or being guilty of either such rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
or infrugality, as moth away
these their Linages, which like <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nahs</hi>
Gourd, rather appear to salute
the world, then to fix any abode in it.</p>
            <p>Yet there is a Nobility of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:53048:17"/>
much raised, above what
can owe its rise to flesh or blood:
and that is <hi>Vertue,</hi> which being the
same in souls, that the other is in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
and families, must by that Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
surpasse it as far, as the soul is to
be preferred to the body, and this
Moral Honour and Nobility prizes
its value so far above all other quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
that the Stoical Satyrist follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Dogma's</hi> of that School, is
bold to say, that nothing but vertue
deserves the name of Nobility,</p>
            <q>Nobilitas sola est at<expan>

               </expan> unica Virtus.</q>
            <p>And in opposition to this Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but most consequentially to that
Doctrine, <hi>Seneca</hi> a Partisan of the same
Tribe, doth with a noble haughtiness
of Spirit tell us, that <hi>licet Deus ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciret,
nec homo puniret peccatum, non
tamen peccarem ob peccati vilitatem,</hi>
though GOD could not know, nor
man would not punish Vice, yet I
would not sin, so mean a thing is sin.
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:53048:17"/>
For proving of which, I shall advance
and confirm these two great truths,
that men are in point of Honour
obliged to be vertuous, and that
there is no Vice which is not so mean
that it is unworthy of a Gentleman;
and shall lead you unto that Seraglio
of privat Vices, of which, though the
weakest, seem in our experience to
have strength enough to conquer
such who pass for great geniouses in
in the World: A Philosopher will
yet find, that these defeats given by
them to noble Spirits, do not proceed
from the irresistableness of their
charmes, but from the inadvertance
of such as are captivat, and is rather a
surprize then a conquest. For these
great souls being bussied in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit
of some other Project, want no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but time to overcome these
follies, or else these vices and passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
(which is a great Argumemnt of
their weakness) do then assault such
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:53048:18"/>
Heroes, when they are become now
mad with their prosperity. But if
we will strip Vice or Passion of
these gaudy ornaments, which error
and opinion lends them, or advert to
our own actions, we will find, that
these overcome us not, but that we
by our own misapprehension of them
overcome our selves, as will appear,
First, by some general reflections, to
which in the second place I shall sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn
some particular instances, and
shall by a special Induction of the
most eminent Vertues and Vices
clear, that there is nothing so noble
as Vertue, nor nothing so mean as
Vice.</p>
            <p>As to the general reflections,<note place="margin">Vertue contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes more to advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then Vice can do.</note> I
shall begin with this, that if Advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
be a noble Prize, doubtlesse
Vertue most by this be more noble
then Vice, seing it bestowes oftest
that so much desired reward. For fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
proving of which from reason,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:53048:18"/>
consider, that no man will cabal with
vitious persons (without which no
project for advancement can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved)
for, who will hazard his life
and fortune with one whom he cannot
beleeve? and who can beleeve one
who is not vertuous; trust fidelity and
sincerity, being themselves Vertues?
or who should expect to gain by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
the friendship of such as by
their Vices are ingrate to GOD and
Nature? who have been to such libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
infinitly far above humane reach
(and thus likewise vitious persons are
contemptibly mean seing they are so
infinitly ingrate) and in this appears
the meannesse of Vice, that it can
effectuat nothing without counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitting
Vertue, or without its real
assistance: When Robbers associat,
they entertain something Analogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
to friendship and trust, else their
Vices would be but barren; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
humility shewed to inferiors, the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:53048:19"/>
proudest men and Tyrants would
owe but little to the greatnesse of
their spirit: When Undertakers
league together, either they trust
one another, because of their oaths or
because of their interests only; If
the first, they owe their Success to
Vertue; If the second, then they
never fully cement, but assist each
others by halfs, reserving the other
half of their force to attend that
change, which interest may bring to
their Associats, and do such as fight
for hire (interest being nothing else)
acquit themselves with such va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor?
as those, whose courage receives
edge from Duty, Charity, Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or any such vertous principles?
Vitious persons have many rivals,
and so meet in their rising with
much opposition: The Covetous
fear the promotion of him who is
such, and the Ambitious, of him
who is of the same temper. But
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:53048:19"/>
because, all expect civility from
the debonair, and money from the
Liberal; They therefore wish their
preferment, as what will contribute
to their own interest, and Princes
are induc'd to gratifie such, as
knowing that in so doing, they
transmit to their people what they
bestow upon such Favourits, and
that they preclud the challenges of
these who repine at their Favours
as misplac't when not bestowed upon
themselves.</p>
            <p>If there be any thing that is
noble or desirable in fame,<note place="margin">Vertue is more condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive to Fame then Vice.</note> Vertue
is the only (at least as the straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
so the nearest) road to it, Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
taking our actions under their
review, without the byasse of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice,
passion, interest or flattery,
and of such as Story cannonizes for
its Grandees. <hi>Alexander</hi> is not so
truly glorious, for defeating the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,
as for refusing to force <hi>Darius</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:53048:20"/>
fair Daughters; for in the one, a
great part is due to the courage of
his souldiers, and the brutishness of
his opposers, whereas in the other
he overcame the charms of such, as
might have overcome all others, and
was put to combat his own youth,
which had gained for him all his
Victories: the meanest of his souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
could have forc'd a prisoner, but
fame reserved it as a reward worthy
of <hi>Alexander</hi> in this chastity to van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish
a monarch and to gratifie a
generous Lady; to displease whom,
was as great a crime as it was to ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish
others. Nor was <hi>William</hi> the
Conqueror more honoured, for sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting
a War-like nation, then for
pardoning <hi>Gospatrick</hi> and <hi>Eustache</hi>
of <hi>Bulleign,</hi> after so many revolt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings:
For in the one he conquered
but these who were lesse then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
but in the other he conquered
himself, who was their Conqueror.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:53048:20"/>
               <hi>Aristides</hi> was esteemed more noble,
in under-going a patient banishment,
then these Usurpers who condemned
him to it, whose names remain as
obscure as their crimes are odious,
whilst his is the continual orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of pulpits and theaters: And
all the Roman glories do not cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brat
<hi>Neroes</hi> memory to the same
pitch with that of <hi>Seneca's,</hi> who did
(like the Sun) then appear greatest,
when he was nearest to the setting.
<hi>Alexander</hi> is only praised, when we
remember not his killing <hi>Parmenio,</hi>
and the famous <hi>Hugh Capet</hi> of <hi>France</hi>
ends his glory, where we begin to
talk of his usurpation: and (to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch)
this is one great difference
betwixt Vertue and Vice, in relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to fame, That Vice like a Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letan
is applauded by the unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted;
or like rotten Wood may
shine in the dark, but it's lustre
lessens at the approach of either time
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:53048:21"/>
or light; whereas, though Vertue
may for a time ly under the oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of malice (which Martyrdom it
suffers only when it is mistaken for
Vice) yet time enobles it, and light
does not lend it splendor, but servs
only to illuminat it's beholders:
and so to enable them to discover
what native Excellencies it po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesses.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Amphialaus</hi> or <hi>Orondates</hi> had
been charged in these Romance,<note place="margin">Au Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from Roman<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces.</note> ye so
dote upon with drunkenness oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or envy, certainly it had lessened
their esteem, even with such as most
admire, though they will not imitat
these Vertues. And to shew how
much kindness Vertue breeds for
such as possesses it, Consider, how
though ye know these to but ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary
<hi>ideas</hi> of Vertue, yet ye can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but love them (as ye can love
them for nothing else) seing they
never, obliged you or your relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:53048:21"/>
and since abstract Vertue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliats
so much favour, certainly
Vertue in you will conciliat much
more: For besides that <hi>idea</hi> which
will be common to you with them,
some will be obliged thereby to love
you, as their Benefactors, and others,
because they know not when ye will
become so. And at least they will
honour your Vertue, as that which
will secure them against your wrongs,
and which will assure them of your
good wishes, if you cannot lend them
your assistance. Would not the most
prostitute Ladies hate <hi>Statira,</hi> or
<hi>Parthenissa,</hi> if they had been repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented

the Authors of <hi>Cassandra,</hi> or <hi>Parthenissa</hi>
glorying in having made their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rades
brutish by drinking, or poor
Maids miserable by uncleanness, and
though Whoring be cryed up as one
of these gentile exercises, that are
the price of so much time and
pains; yet we hear of none of these,
who are so much as said to have
had a Whore, beside to glory in it.
But to turn the medal, consult your
own experience, and it will remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
you of many hopeful Gentlemen,
whose advancement hath been so far
disappointed by these Vices, that
they fell so low as to become objects
of pitty to such as feared them once,
as their accomplisht Rivals. And to
let us see the folly of sin, I have
known such as hated Nigardliness so
much, as that to shun it, they spent
their abortive Estates before they
were full Masters of them; Brought
by that excess to flee Creditors,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:53048:22"/>
starve at home, walk in raggs, and
which is worse, beg in misery, and
so to fall into the extremity of that
Vice, whose first, and most innocent
degrees they laught at in others: And
when they beg'd from these who
were both Authors and Companions
in their Debordings, (expecting to
be supplied, as well by their justice
as their compassion) did get no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
but that laughter which was a
lesson taught by themselves; or at
best, a thousand curses, for having
bred them in a way of living, that did
naturally occasion so much mischief.
If then poverty be mean and ignoble,
certainly Vice must be so too, seing
beside sickness, infirmity and infamy,<note place="margin">Vertue railed the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires.</note>
it hales on poverty upon such as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
it.</p>
            <p>When the world was yet so young,
as to be led by sincerity, in place of
that experience, which makes our
age rather witty then honest. Its
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:53048:23"/>
               <hi>Hero's,</hi> who equally surpassed and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobled
mankind by their Vertue, were
for it deified, even by these their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporaries,
who in possessing much
more both riches and power then
they, wanted nothing but this Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
to be much greater then they
were. And thus <hi>Nimrods</hi> Kingdom
could not build him Altars, though
sincere <hi>Rhadamanthus</hi> had fire kindled
on his, by the heat of their zeal, who
knowing him to be mortal, could not,
even in spight of his dying, but wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
that Immortal Vertue which
shined in him. And as <hi>Cicero</hi> informs,
these gods of the Pagans were at first
but illustrious <hi>Hero's,</hi> whose vertue,
rather then their nature rendered
them immortal, and worthy to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped,
even in the estimation of
such undisciplin'd Bruts, as thought
the Laws of Nature a bondage, and
the Laws of GOD a fable. We find
though <hi>Licurgus</hi> in <hi>Lacedemon,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:53048:23"/>
Aristides</hi> in <hi>Athens,</hi> and <hi>Epamenon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi>
in <hi>Thebes,</hi> were not born to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
yet their Vertue bestowed on
them what their Birth denyed, and
both without, and against factions,
they were elected by their Citizens
to that rule, which they did not
Court, and were preferred to such
as both by birth and pains had fairer
pretences to it. And whilst <hi>Greece</hi>
flourished, <hi>Reges Philosophabant, &amp;
Philosophi regebant:</hi> these Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths
being more numerous then
their Neighbours, in nothing but
their Vertues, and stronger then they
in nothing but in the sincere exercise
of Reason: And when Tyranny and
pride had by wasting these Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths,
made place for the <hi>Roman</hi>
glory, nothing conquered so much
the confiners of that glorious State
(whose Center was Vertue, and
Circumference Fame) as their
Vertue. Thus the <hi>Phalerians</hi> are
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:53048:24"/>
by <hi>Plutarch</hi> said to have sent Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors
to <hi>Rome,</hi> resigning themselves
over to the <hi>Roman</hi> Government, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they found them so just and
noble, as to send back their Children
who had been betrayed by a School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master:
when <hi>Pirhus</hi> was advertised
by the <hi>Romans</hi> to beware of Poyson
from one of his own Subjects, who
had offered to dispatch him, he did
then begin to fear that he should be
conquered by their Armes, who had
already subdued him by their civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
And such esteem had their
justice gained them, that they
were chosen Umpires of all neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Nations, and so gained one
of the opposites, first to a confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and then to a dependency upon
them. And <hi>Attalus</hi> King of <hi>Perga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi>
did in Legacy leave them his
Kingdom, as to these whose Vertues
deserved it as a reward; which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned
St. <hi>Augustine</hi> to fall out in
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:53048:24"/>
this eloquent expression, <hi>Because
GOD (saith he) would not bestow
Heaven upon the</hi> Romans, <hi>they being
Pagans, he bestowed the Empire of the
World upon them, because they were
Vertuous.</hi> And many have been raised
to Empires, by no other assistance
then that of their Vertue. As <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma
Pompilius, Marcus Antonius, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinax</hi>
and <hi>Vespasian,</hi> whilst the want
of this, hath in spight of all the
power with which vicious Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
have been surrounded, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded
others from the same Imperial
Honours, as <hi>Tarquinius Superbus,
Domitian, Comodus.</hi> And generally
there is but one Emperor to be seen
in that long <hi>Roman</hi> List, who was
unfortunate,<note place="margin">Vertue hath made Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi red above Princes.</note> being Vertuous: And
not one whose Vice was not the
immediate cause of ruine to its Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.</p>
            <p>Antiquity hath also transmitted to
us the memory of <hi>Socrates, Zeno,</hi> and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:53048:25"/>
other Philosophers, under as obliging
Elogies, as these of the most famous
Emperors, whom Vertue (to let us
see that Riches and Honours are but
the Instruments of Fame, and not
the Dispensers of it) hath, without
any assistance, raised to this pitch,
above these Princes, that they have
conquered our esteem, without the
aid of Armies, Treasures, Senats, or
flattering Historians; and cease not
like them to command when they
ceas'd to live; but by their precepts
and discourses, force worthy souls
yet to a more intire obedience, then
the others did whilst they were alive,
by their Sanctions and penal Statutes.
For Princes govern but a short time
one Nation: and by these Laws, they
aw but such vitious persons, whom
it is more trouble then honour to
command. But these Illustrious Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers,
and such as imitate their
Vertue, have thereby attained to a
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:53048:25"/>
Soveraignty over both the Wills and
Judgements of the best of all such as
are scattered amongst all the other
Kingdoms of the World. And <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus
Aurelius,</hi> who was one of the
greatest Emperors, doth recommend
to Kings as well as Subjects, to think,
that one of these Philosophers is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
all their actions, as a most ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacious
mean to keep men in aw,
not to commit that Vice to which
they are tempted.</p>
            <p>I have seen very great men shun to
owne even their beloved Vices in the
presence of such as they needed not fear
for any thing but their Vertue:<note place="margin">Vice must Lurk, and is coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</note> And
it is most remarkable, that <hi>Nero,</hi> who
exceeded all who then lived in power,
and all who shall live (I hope) in cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
did still judge himself under some
restraint, whilst <hi>Seneca</hi> was at Court
to be a witness to his actions. And
every vitious person must flee pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
and the light (which showes the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:53048:26"/>
meanness and cowardliness of Vice)
when he is to resign himself over to
any of these Criminal Exercises, by
which likewise when committed, men
become yet more cowards; for who
having spent his life at that unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
rate, will not (if he be master of
any reason) tremble and be afraid to
venture upon such exploits? as by
taking his life from him, may, and
will present him before the Tribunal
of that GOD whom he hath offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
and from whom (which will
not a little contribute to his coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness)
he cannot expect that success,
vvhereof the expectation lessens, or
hightens to its own measures, the
courage of such as are engaged.</p>
            <p>We may easily conclude the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Vice from this also,<note place="margin">Servants equal Masters in Vice.</note> that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
without pains or Art, equal
us in them; for these can Whore,
Drink, Lie, and Oppress: But to
be Temperat, Just and Compassio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:53048:26"/>
are qualities whereby we deserve,
and are by such as know us not,
judged to be Masters and well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended.
And have not Servants
reason to think themselves as deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
persons as their Masters, when
they find themselves able to equal,
or surpass them, in what they glory
in as their great accomplishments?</p>
            <p>Seing what is imitated,<note place="margin">Vice but coppies Vertue.</note> is still nobler
then what imitats, certainly Vice
must be the less Noble, because it
but copies Vertue, and owes to its
mask, and our errors, what it posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of pleasure or advantage. Cruelty
pretends to be Zeal, Liberality is
counterfeited by the Prodigal, and
Lust endeavours to pass for Love.</p>
            <p>Is there any thing more ignoble
then fear,<note place="margin">All Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces imply fear.</note> which does as slaves, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
us to every attempter? And have
not all Vices somewhat of that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly
passion? In Covetousness we
fear the want of Money, in Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:53048:27"/>
the want of Honour, in Revenge
the want of Justice, in Jealousie Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals;
and when we lie we fear to
speak openly.</p>
            <p>Is there any thing more mean then
dependence? and maks not Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us to depend upon such as have
Honours?<note place="margin">All Vices make us de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pend upon others.</note> Covetousness upon such
as have Riches? and Lust upon the
refuse of Women? Whereas Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
seeks no other reward, then is
paid in doing what is vertuous, and
owes it's fee only to it's self, leaving
Vice in the servile condition of serv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for a fee even those whom it most
hates. And generally in all Vices
we betray a meannesse, because in all
these we confess want and infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
In Avarice, we appear either
fools, in desiring what is not necessar
and in dissoblieging friends, hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our health, and other necessars
for what is not so it's self or else we
confess that our necessities are both
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:53048:27"/>
greater, and more numerous, then
these of others, by heaping toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Riches and Money, which serve
for nothing, when they serve us not
in supplying our wants. In Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
we confess the want of native Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and Excellency, In Lust want
of Continency, In Anger we want
Command of our selvs, and in Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie
we declare we think not our
selves worthy of that love alone,
wherein we cannot fear rivals upon
any other accompt; and in Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
men likewise wrong their own
Honour, in suspecting that of their
Ladies or Friends; Whereas Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
perswads us, that our necessities
may be confin'd to a very small
number, and that these may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired,
without any loss of friends,
and but little of time: it teaches us
that Riches were created to serve
us; And that therefore we disparage
our selves, when we subject our hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:53048:28"/>
to our Servants. And from it
we learn, to rate so justly the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies
of that rational Soul, which is
the Image of GOD Almighty, as
to expect from it, and no where else
under the Sun, any true and solid
happinesse: And to accompt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more noble then it, except the
Almighty GOD, whose offspring it
is, and whom it represents.</p>
            <p>There is nothing more mean then
to be cheated,<note place="margin">Vertue allows us a just value of our selvs.</note> and all Vices cheat
us, Treason promises Honour, but
leads to a Scaffold; Lust pleasure,
but leads to sickness, and Flattery
cheats all such as hear it, and such as
are proud are doubly miserable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are both the cheaters,
and the persons cheated. Thus
Vice cannot please without a crime,
and these are even then gaining the
hatred and contempt of others,
when they are enquiring, or hearing
from flatterers, that the people
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:53048:28"/>
seek no where without them ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of Love and Admiration.
Whereas, Sacred Vertue allows us
to admire our selves, and which is
more, to beleeve that all these things
for which vitious men neglect the
care of their Souls, are unworthy of
our re-search; and certainly the Soul
is a more noble creature then that
earth, or mettal, which we stain our
Souls to get: for, our Souls do censure
all these things; it finds defects in
the noblest buildings, and shews by
desiring more, an unsatisfiablenesse in
all extrinsick objects; It determins the
price of all other creatures, and like
the Magistrat in this Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
assigns to every thing it's rate;
to day it cryes up the Diamond, and
to morrow it allows preference to the
Rubie: these treats, and colours,
which ravish this year, passe the next
for no beauty. Red hair pleases the
Italian, and our Climat hates it, and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:53048:29"/>
it is probable, that this change of
inclination, is not a culpable incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy
in man, but a mark of his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignity
over all his fellow-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
Vertue teaches him not to
owe his happinesse to the Stars, nor
to be like some foolish Emperours,
so fondly vain, as to think that he
shall have no other reward for his
Vertue, then the being transform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into one of these lesser lights,
which he knowes to have been creat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
only for a Lantern to him, or at
best but to adorn, with their number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Associats, that firmament which
was created to be one of these least
Arguments, whereby he was to be
courted into a beleife of, and love for
that GOD, who thinks him so excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
a Creature, that he is said to be
glad at the Conversion of a sinner,
and to grieve at his obstinacy; And
if we will consider the miraculous
Fabrick of our bodies, which though
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:53048:29"/>
we be but dull, yet we may see to be
all workmanship; and wherein the
number of wonders, equals that of
Nervs, Sinews, Veins, Bones or Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaments,
the curious Fabrick of that
Brain, which lodges (without croud
or confusion) so many thousands of
different and noble thoughts, the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice
of those various Organs, that
expresse so Harmonious Airs and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishing
expressions, the charming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of these Lynes and Featurs in
Ladies, which like the Sun scorch as
well as illuminat the beholders. We
may conclude that our Soul must be
a most excellent piece, seing all this
contexture, is appointed to be but a
momentany tabernacle for it, when
it is in its lowest and unworthiest
estate; And which when the Soul
deserts, is thrown out with all it's
wonders, least it should by its stink
trouble the meanest of these Senses,
which servs the Souls of these who
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:53048:30"/>
are alive. Consider how this Soul
grasps in one thought all that Glob
for which ambitious men fight, and
for some of whose furrowes, the avari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
man doth so much toil. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
how it despises all that Avarice
has amas'd, how it is pleased with
no external object, longer then it ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
considers it, and what a great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity
is left in our desirs after these
are thrown into them; and by all this
we will learn, that Vice disparages
too much the Soul, when it imagins,
that any finit thing can bound it's
thoughts, and we are but cheated
when we listen to these proffers,
which Vice makes use of Honour,
Pleasure or Advantage: for who can
be so mean, to think that all these
faculties were bestowed upon our
Souls? these featurs upon our bodies,
and so much care taken of both by
Providence, for no other end, then
that we should admire that Wine
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:53048:30"/>
which Peasants make, those colours
which prostitute Whoors weare, that
we should gain fortunes, which serve
too oft to corrupt these for whom
they are prepared, or respect from
such, as bow not to us, but to our
stations?</p>
            <p>Having thus overrun these gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Considerations, whereby men who
are gallant may be Courted to a love
for Vertue; my Method leads me
now to fall down to those instances of
particular Vices and Vertues, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I may make nearer approaches to
the actions of mankind: And seing
there is too much of ease, and too
little of cogency, in writing full and
tedious essays upon these common
Theams, I shall consider them only
as they relate to Gallantry, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
no other tract of Art in all this
Discourse, but that I shall pursue my
design so closely, as not to imploy
any Argument against Vice, nor assist
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:53048:31"/>
Vertue with one thought, but such
as may decry the one as mean, and
cry up the other as gentile and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some.</p>
            <p>We owe that deference to great
men,<note place="margin">Dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> that even their Vices should
have the precedency of all others, and
therefore I shall begin this invective
with <hi>Dissimulation,</hi> which is peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly
their sin, for when the meaner
sort are guilty of the same thing, it is
in them called falshood, from which
dissimulation differs nothing, but that
it is the Cadet of a Nobler Family.
And this evinces what an ugly and
ungentile Vice Dissimulation is, seing
he is no Gentleman who would not
choise rather to die, or starve, then
to be thought false: All Dissemblers
shew an inability to compass without
these pitifull shifts, what in dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
they design, for this is the last
refuge, and by this Courage becomes
unnecessary, and we oft see that
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:53048:31"/>
Cowards dissemble best, gallant men
laying that weight upon their Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
vvhich the others do upon Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simulation.
And at this unworthy
Game, it is not requisite to be gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant,
providing men be vvicked. Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simulation
is but a Courtly Coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,
and a Stately Cheat: and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
he is too much afraid of his
own, either Courage, or Fate, and
values too much his prize above his
honour, or innocence, who can stoop
to play this under-boord Game:
Whereas a gallant and generous soul,
will not fear any event so much, as to
leave his Road for it; and will owne
vvhat is just, vvith so much nobleness
of resolution, that though Fate should
tumble down upon him Mountains of
misfortunes, they may perhaps over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm,
but they shall never be able
to divert him. Where are then these
gallant resolutions of our fore-fathers?
who scorned even victories gained by
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:53048:32"/>
teachery, falshood, poysons, and
such other unhandsome means?
Where is the <hi>Roman</hi> fortitude? which
advertised <hi>Pirhus</hi> of his Physicians
offer to poyson him, though their
greatest enemy, And which caused
<hi>Marcus Regulus</hi> choise to return to
be a Martyr for Vertue, rather then
stain the <hi>Roman</hi> Faith? Where are
these resentments of the Lie in frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
cases, when great men magnifie
in their Dissimulation what is in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
lying and treachery? To deceive
one who is not obliged to believe us,
is ill; but to cheat one whom our
own fair pretences have induced to
believe us, is much worse, for this is
to murther one whom we have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
to lay aside his Arms. And
as Dissimulation thrives never but
once, so to use it cuts off from the
Dissembler that trust and confidence
vvhich is necessary in great under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings;
for, who will depend on these
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:53048:32"/>
whom they cannot trust? And after
Dissemblers are catcht (as seldom
they escape) the abused people hate
and persecute them as violators of
that without which the World can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
subsist. I appeal to the Reader,
if he hath not heard enemies lov'd for
their ingenuity; and if he hath not
seen these Cut-throat Lights blown
out, and end in a stinking snuff: And
as if every man had escaped a Cut-purse,
if every man did not bless
himself, and rejoyce to see these dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblers
fall. And I may justly say,
that Dissimulation is but the Theory
of Cut-pursing, and Assasination.
Consider how unpleasant any thing
appears that is crooked, and ye will
find an natural argument against Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simulation,
and though it hath great
Patrons, and can pretend to an old
possession, and much breeding at some
Courts (though all who are Gallant
there hate it) yet it is never able to
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:53048:33"/>
gain esteem, and can defend it self no
other wayes, then by a cowardly lur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
and shunning to be discovered.
Neither can there be so much Wit in
this Art as can justifie its error; for
Women, and the meanest Wits are
oft-times most expert in it: all can do
it in some measure, and none ever
used it long without being discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
and such only are rendred its
prey, as make it no great conquest,
they being either our friends, who
expected not our invasion; or fools,
who are not worthy to be gloried in,
as our Trophees.</p>
            <p>There are none of these Vices which
rage amongst men,<note place="margin">Envy &amp; detra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> more destructive
to either their honour, or to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of that Common-wealth which
they compose, then Envy, and (which
both follows it, and aggravats its
guilt) Detraction. Envy is mean,
because it confesses that the envyer is
not so noble or excellent as the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:53048:33"/>
envied: for none are envied, but
such as possess somewhat that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaches,
or excells what is possest by
such as do envy. This Vice acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
that he who useth it, wants
much of what is desireable, and which
is meaner, much of what another
possesses, and as if we despair'd of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
to anothers hight, it makes us
endeavour to pull him down to the
stature of our own accomplishments.
Most men essay to imitate the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of these whom they envy; so that
in detracting from these, they leave
others to undervalue what they
themselves design ardently to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.
And thus, if these detracters
be so much favoured by Fate, as to
atchieve any such great action, as that
is which they undervalue in others,
they get but a barren victory, and
which is more insupportable, they
see themselves punished by their own
Vice. And to convince us how mean
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:53048:34"/>
Vices, Envy and Detraction are, we
may observe, that such as are victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
judge it their honour to magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
these who were vanquisht; and
men wound extreamly their own ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
when they detract from persons
who are more deserving in the eyes of
the world then themselves, for they
force their hearers to conclude, that
the Detracters themselves must be
undeserving, seing these who deserve
better, are by their confession, cry'd
down as being of no merit, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members
me of this excellent passage
in <hi>Plinius</hi> the Second, <hi>Tibi ipsi mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistras
in alio laudando, aut enim is
quem laudas, tibi superior-est, aut
inferior; si inferior &amp; laudandus, tu
multo magis; si superior, neque jure
laudandus, tu multo minus.</hi> Thou
serves thy own interest when thou
praises others, for either he whom
thou praisest, is thy inferior, and
then if he deserves to be praised,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:53048:34"/>
much more thou, if he be thy supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior,
and deserves not to be praised,
much less thou. All men are either
our friends, or our enemies, or such
who have not concerned themselves
in our affairs. We are base, because
ingrate, when we detract from our
friends, and we assert our own folly,
when by Detraction, we endeavour
to lessen the worth of those whom we
have chosen for such: we lessen like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
our honour, when we detract
from our competitors, and enemies,
because to contest with undeserving
persons, is ignoble, and to be vanquisht
by them, has little of honour in it;
Whereas, as all events are uncretain,
if we be overcome by such as our
detractions have made to pass for
undeserving, our overthrow will by
so much become the more despicable,
and to detract from such as expected
no wrong from us, and who are
strangers to us and our affairs, is not
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:53048:35"/>
only imprudent and unjust, but is
as dishonourable and little gallant, as
that is to wound one who expects
not our aggression, and whose in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency,
as to us, leaves him dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm'd;
and the word <hi>backbiting</hi> clears
to us, that detraction is a degree of
cowardlienesse, for it assaults only
such as are unprepared, or absent,
which is held dishonourable amongst
the least of such as have gallantry
in any esteem. He who praises,
bestows a favour, but he who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts,
commits a Robbery, in tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from another what is justly his;
and certainly to give, is more noble
then to take. Envy is also most
prejudicial to great undertakings,
seing such as are engaged, must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
either not to act, what is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessar
for compleating so great
projects, or if they do, to fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the envy of these for whom
they act them, and the undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:53048:35"/>
do obstruct by envy their own
greatnesse, because they are by that
Vice, perswaded to crop such as
but begin to perform in their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
attempts worthy of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
considered: How destructive
likewise this Vice is to the glory
of Kingdoms, and Common
Wealths, does but too clearly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
from this; that all who are in
them, are either despicable, by not
being worthy of the being envyed,
or else will be destroyed by that
Vice, which levells it's murthering
engines at such only, who are the
noblest Spirits, and who deserve
most promotion from their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.
<hi>Carthage</hi> was destroyed by
the envy which <hi>Hanno</hi> and <hi>Bomilcar,</hi>
bore to <hi>Hannibal;</hi> who by denying
him Forces, to prosecut his Italian
Conquests, did involve themselves
with him in the common ruins of
their Countrey; which shews the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:53048:36"/>
dishonourable folly of envy in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiring
against it self, with these who
being enemies to both the opposits,
sides first with the one, in gratifie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his envy, and then destroyes the
other, whose passion it first serv'd.
Pitifull examples whereof, our own
Age affoords us, wherein many
great men were by envy driven to
oppose principles, whereon they
knew the publick safety, and their
own private interest to depend. <hi>Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minius</hi>
the Roman General endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered
<hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Terentus Varro</hi> did
almost losse it out of envy to <hi>Fabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
Maximus;</hi> and such was the force
of envy, that it did defeat the
great <hi>Scipio,</hi> and banished him from
that <hi>Rome</hi> which he had made both
secure and great; and did by his
example cool the zeal of such who
retained their blood in it's Veins, as
in an arsenal, for no other end
then the service of their Countrey,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:53048:36"/>
as a consequence of which envy, it
was observ'd, that in the next
Age most of <hi>Rome</hi>'s Citizens de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd
rather to entertain that fame,
which the former courted, then to
be exposed to the cruelty of that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,
which did usually attend it.
Detraction brings likewise these
great disadvantages to our reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that it engages both these from
whom we detract, and their friends
partly out of revenge, and partly for
self defence, to enquire into our er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
and frailties, and to publish such
as upon enquiry they have found, or
to hatch calumnies, if truth cannot
supply them: And in that case, rate
of Game obliges us to favour the
Counterer, for we defend what may
be our own case, in favouring what
is at present but the defence of
others. It legittimats likewise
these calumnies which are vented of
us, by such as our detraction hath
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:53048:37"/>
not yet reacht, who will think it
their prudence (like these who fear
Invasion) to carry the War into the
Territories of such, from whom
they do upon well founded suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
expect Acts of Hostility. If
then our own Honour be dear to us,
we should not invade the Honour of
others: For, Revenge, the activest of
Passions (when added to that love of
Honour which is equal in us and
them) will obliege them to do more
against our Honour, then we can do
in it's defence.</p>
            <p>Whoring renders men contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible,<note place="margin">VVhoor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing.</note>
whilst it tempts them to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
such as are not only below
themselves in every sense, but such
as are scarce worthy to serve these
handsomer Ladies, whom they either
do, or may lawfully enjoy. Doth
not this Vice perswade men to ly in
Cottages? with Sluts, or (which
is worse) Strumpets, to lurk in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:53048:37"/>
to fear the encounter of such as
know them, and to bribe and fear
those servants, who by serving them
at such occasions, have by knowing
their secrets, attained to such a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile
mastery over them, that I have
been ashamed to hear Gentlemen up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided
by these Slaves, in terms,
which were the adequat punishment,
as well as the effect of their Vice.
Men in Whoring must design either to
satisfie their own necessities, or their
fancy; if their necessities, then as
Marriage is more convenient, so it is
as much more noble then Whoring;
as it is more gentile for a person of
honour, rather to lodge constantly
in a well appointed Pallace, then to
ramble up and down in blind Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houses;
in the one a man enjoys his
own, whereas in the other he only
lives as Theeves do, by purchase: If
to satisfie fancy, certainly it should
please more, at least it is more honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:53048:38"/>
to be secure against rivals, then
to be sure to be equal'd by them who
will fancy a divided affection? and
who can be sure? that she who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroys
her honour for us, will not
risign the same to a second, or third?
for besides the experiment we have
of her change, oaths, honour and
obligations can be no convincing evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
of, or sureties for what she pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
seing she is then breaking
these, when she gives strangers these
new assurances. And this makes me
laugh to hear Women so foolish, as to
rely upon such promises as are given
by men who destroy their Nuptial
Oaths, when they make them. And
if Women be such excellent persons,
as to deserve that respect, and these
adorations, which are passionat enough
to be payed before Altars; certainly
every man should endeavour to secure
the esteem of one of these rare crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
which is more noble, then to
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:53048:38"/>
rest satisfied with a tenth, or sixteenth
part, like men sharing in a Caper.
And therefore, seing fancy nor ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
allow no rivals, I am confident
that no man can satisfie his fancy, or
secure his honour, in preferring a
Whore to a Wise, or in using Whores
when he wants one. Have not Whores
ruined the repute of some great men
who entertained them? by causing
them neglect to pursue their victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
as <hi>Thais</hi> did to <hi>Alexander,</hi> and
<hi>Cleopatra</hi> to <hi>Mark Anthony?</hi> Have
they not betrayed these secrets
wherein their same was most interes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
as <hi>Dalila</hi> did to <hi>Sampson?</hi> And
there is nothing more ordinary, then
to hear such (like <hi>Herod</hi>) swear that
they dare not refuse their Mistrisses,
what ever is within their reach; and
thus, they must either prove base, in
perjuring themselves, if they think
not what they say; are contemptible
slaves, both to their passions, and to
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:53048:39"/>
these who occasion them, if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
to perform what they promise:
which makes likewise these to be
dangerous masters, who depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the humour of a woman, and so
concluds them unfit to be great. It
were then a generous expiation of
this Vice in such as are opprest by
it, to use it (not it's objects) as
<hi>Mahomet</hi> the Great, did his gallant
Mistriss <hi>Irene,</hi> whose Life and Head
he sacrificed to the repinings of his
Court, and <hi>Jannisars,</hi> who challeng'd
him justly, for loving rather to be
conquered by one silly woman, then
to conquer the World, wherein she
had many, but he no equals. It is
noble to deliver Ladies out of dang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
but not to draw dangers on them,
and to punish such as scoff at them,
rather then to make them ridiculous;
and what thousands of dangers, are
drawn upon Ladies, by being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched,
when married, and if they
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:53048:39"/>
be not married, are they not thereby
made the Proverb of all such as know
them: And to these I recommend
<hi>Tamars</hi> words, who when <hi>Ammon</hi>
offered to ly with her, told him,
<hi>thou shalt be as one of the fools in
Israel, and I whither shall I cause my
shame to go?</hi> And after this let
them remember, that when he had
satisfied his lust, then he instantly
(as is too ordinar) despised her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
And since Ladies will not stain
their Honour with this Vice, till
they be married, I conceive they
should much lesse after, for there the
obligation is doubled. From all
which it followes, that lust is equally
base and ignoble, whither it discharge
it self upon equals or inferiors, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
which two, there is only this
difference, that it is brutal in the one
case, and cruel in the other.</p>
            <p>There is no Vice whereby gallant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
is more stain'd, then by breach of
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:53048:40"/>
promise, which becoms yet more
Sacrilegious, when Ladies are
wrong'd by it. And of this, whoor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
makes men likewise guilty, when
it robbs from Ladies their Husbands,
robbing likewise such upon which it
bestowes them, both of their Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
and Quiet. And thus, though
it makes such as use it barren (GOD
in this resistig the propagation of
Sin) yet it self brings forth it's
faults in full clusters. And <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans</hi>
Parable to <hi>David,</hi> proves it
likewise to be so high an oppression,
that no man of Honour would
commit it, if he would but seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
reflect upon his own actions;
From which Parable, this new ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
may be likewise made,
that though <hi>David</hi> was guilty of
murther and whooring, yet the
Prophet made choice only of this
last to astonish this Warlike Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch,
and raise his indignation against
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:53048:40"/>
this Vice, when shaddowed out un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a forreign and borrowed represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
Though murther be so bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
a crime in it self, that the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians
did instantly conclude <hi>Paul</hi>
guilty of it, when they saw the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
fasten upon his hand. The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justest
caprice of lust is that whereby
men contemn such as become their
Wives, though they admir'd them
when they were their Mistresses, for
in this they confess, it is a mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to be theirs; for since that time,
the neglecters thought them amiable,
they, sweet creaturs have oft con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
no guilt, nor lessen'd the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of that esteem no otherwise,
then by marrying their inconstant
Gallants, who seemed to have so
warm a passion for them. And it
is strange, that men should admire
their own Eloquence, Courage,
Estates, and all things else they
possesse, for no other cause, then
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:53048:41"/>
because they are their own; and yet
should undervalue their Wives (the
noblest thing they possesse) upon
this and no other account.</p>
            <p>I cannot think Nature such a Cheat,
as that if Women had not been the
excellentest of Creatures, it would
have beautified them with Charms,
and Armed their eyes with such pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
glances, that to resist them is the
next impossibility to the finding a
Creature that is more accomplisht
then they; And I confess, the love
we bear them, is not only allowable
in it self, as an inclination that is of
its own nature Noble and Vertuous,
but likewise, because it obliges such
as are engaged in it, to despise all
mean Vices, such as Avarice, or Fear,
and is incompatible with all dissinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous
Arts, such as Dissimulation, or
Flattery. And though such as are
guilty of Whoring, do justifie their
debordings by a love to that glorious
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:53048:41"/>
Sex, yet by this pretext they are yet
more unjust and vitious then their
former guilt made them; for by roav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
amongst so many, they intimat
that they are not satisfied with their
first choice; and that not only there
are some of that Sex, but that there
is none in it who deserves their intire
affection. Or else, by dividing them
amongst so many, they think their
kindness sufficient to make numbers
of Ladies happy; by both which er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
they wrong not only themselves
by swearing otherwayes to the Ladies
to whom they make love, but they
wrong likewise the innocence and
amiableness of that sweet Sex, in
whom no rational man can find a ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish,
besides their esteem for such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
as these, who indeed admire them
no where but in their complements,
and who are oft so base, that not only
their society is scandalous, but they
are ready to tempt, such as they fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent;
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:53048:42"/>
or if they fail in this, are oft so
wicked, that they, to satisfie either
their revenge, or vanity, do brag of
intimacies, and allowances which
they never possest. If then Gallants
would be loved by their Mistrisses,
they must be Vertuous, seing such
love only these who are secret, many
things passing amongst even <hi>Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks,</hi>
which should not be revealed.
These who are couragious, seing this
is appointed to be a protection to the
weakness of their Sex, and these who
are constant, seing to be relinquisht,
inferrs either a want of wit, in having
chosen such as would quite them
without a defect, or else that they
were abandoned because of defects, by
such as the world may justly from
their first ardency, conclude, would
never have abandoned them without
these: What Lady without a cheat,
will be induced to love one wasted
with Pox and inconstancy? one whom
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:53048:42"/>
Drunkenness makes an unfit Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellow,
as well as a friend? and though
some worship the Reliques of Saints,
yet none but these who are mad, as
well as vitious, will worship the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques
of Sinners.</p>
            <p>Neither is the meanness of this
Vice taken off, by the greatness of
these with whom it is shar'd: which
may be clear from this, that either
affection, interest, or ambition, are
in the design of these offenders. If
affection, it should excuse no more
her who is Whore to a Monarch,
then her who is such to a Gentleman;
for affection respects the person, but
not the condition of such as are lov'd:
And it is certainly then most pure,
when it cannot be ascribed to, nor
needs the help of either riches to
bribe, or power to recommend it.
But if riches be design'd, then the
committer is guilty both of Avarice
and Whoring, and she is not worthy
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:53048:43"/>
to be a Mistriss, who can stoop to a
Fee like a Servant. And she who
designs honour and repute by these
Princely Amours, is far disappointed:
For though she may command re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
yet esteem is not subject to
Scepters: And I am confident, that
<hi>Lucretia,</hi> who choos'd rather to open
her Veins to a fatal Lance, then her
Heart to the Embraces of a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign,
is more admired then <hi>Thais,
Poppaa, Jean Shore,</hi> and Madame
<hi>Gabriel,</hi> whose obedience to their
own Kings, was a crime in them,
though it was loyalty in others.
Blushes are then the noblest kind of
Paint for Ladies, and Chastity is
their most charming Ornament: And
if these would send out their Emissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
to learn by them how to reform
their errors, as they oft do to inform
their revenge, they would easily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
that loose men laugh at their
kindness, vertuous men undervalue
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:53048:43"/>
them, and it. And when ever any
Judgement is poured out upon the
Kingdom, or misfortune overtakes
these Minions, then all is ascribed by
Divines, to their looseness; and it is
one of the allowablest Cheats in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,
to invent miraculous resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
from Heaven upon their fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours.
Young Ladies, to recommend
their own Chastity, are obliged, in
good breeding, at least to say they
hate them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Such as are married, are
bound by their interest to decry such
as may debauch their Husbands; and
these who are old, rail against them,
as those who place all happiness in
what, because of age, they cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to: Whereas such as are chast,
are recommended with magnifying
praises, for patterns to such as are vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,
and are coppied as admirable
Originals, by such as are Vertuous.
And I cannot omit this one reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that chast Women are more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:53048:44"/>
tainted with Pride, then
with any other Vice; Nature, as it
were, allowing to them to raise their
own value far above others, whom
they have (almost) reason to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn,
as persons who prostitute them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
(which, and the word <hi>hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling,</hi>
are the lessening Epithets of
Whoring) and as such who are nasty,
spotted and unclean.</p>
            <p>Lust and obscenity in Discourse,<note place="margin">Obsce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</note>
run in a Vitious Circle, and by an odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Incest beget one another; for as
lust prompts men to obscenity, so
obscenity pimps men in to lust; but in
this, obscenity is more culpable then
lust, that in the one, men alledge a
natural advantage, and some a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity;
but in the other, they have no
temptation, and so fall under that
curse, <hi>Wo unto them that sin without
a cause.</hi> In the one, men sin covert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
making by their blushes, as by a
<hi>tacit</hi> confession, some attonement for
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:53048:44"/>
their guilt; But in the other, men
divulge their sin, and by graceing it,
with what, if the subject were honest,
might pass for wit, do invite such as
wish to be repute wits, first to admire,
and then to imitat them in their sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
and the best of such as use that
eloquence, become thereby most ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble,
being in effect but Cooks, who
prepare Sawces for provoking a lust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
appetite in their hearers. And I
admire, that seing Comedians are
hist off the Stage, when they attempt
it, that such as are so far greater then
these, as Masters are above Buffons,
should imagine they can magnifie
themselves by it. This Vice may
well enough be ranged under one of
the species of <hi>Sodomy,</hi> seing such as
use it, employ in their lust these mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
which were so far from being
destinat for so low uses, that the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist
in saying, <hi>he will praise God with
his glory</hi> (which Interpreters render
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:53048:45"/>
to be the Tongue) doth shew us, that
our Tongues are amongst the noblest
parts of our Body. And when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
how melodious it is in its har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies;
how eloquent in its expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions;
how whole multitudes are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
from their greatest furies by
it; and how <hi>Cicero</hi> is in spight of all
his other faults, so admired for it,
that thousands sweat and toil daily,
to make one in that number, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he is acknowledged to be by them
all, far the first. When I consider
how miraculously it expresses, with
the same motion, so varying sounds,
that though mankind be innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
yet each in it hath his distinct
tone and voice, and how, with little
different positions, it signets the same
Air with words so extreamly diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
that one may think that each
man hath a spirit speaking out of him.
I must fall out in regrates and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
that, and how, so excellent a
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:53048:45"/>
faculty is so much abused! Neither
must we conclude, that because such
go away unanswered, that they owe
this to the sharpnesse of their wit, but
rather to the depravednesse of its sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
wherewith the greatest part of
accurat spirits are so little acquainted,
that some know not the terms, and
others know them only to hate them.
We must not think that we admire
for wits, such still, at whom we laugh:
and I believe many laugh at such as
are prophane, as they do at such as
they see slip and catch a fall, though
never so dangerous. I regrate in this
Vice, both to see sharp men so Vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and so much wit so missimployed;
for though we may say here, that
<hi>Materiam superabat opus,</hi> yet such is
the abjectnesse and worthlessenesse of
the matter, that it is not capable of
ornament, no more then excrements
are to be admired, though they were
gilded, and carv'd out by the most
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:53048:46"/>
curious hand; and their wit is at least
to be charged with this error, that it
choises not subjects worthy of their
pains: for whereas the quaintnesse of
fancy doth, when imployed about in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
subjects, beget its Masters
respect; and when upon excellent
admiration, all that it can do here is
but to excuse the faults it makes, and
so at least is so beggerly an imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that it is scarce able to defray
its own charges. I account him no
wit, who cannot deserve that name,
though he be barr'd any one subject,
especially such a subject as obscenity
is, wherein former Trafficquers have
been so numerous, and so vacant from
other imployments, that as nothing
which is excellent, so little that is new
can be said upon it; and what is said, is
transmitted from ear to ear, with so
much of secrecy, that as no Historian
will write it, so fewer will know it,
then will know any of these witty
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:53048:46"/>
productions of learning, or moral Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy,
which all men indifferently
desire to read and repeat, Whereas
this will be altogether supprest from
succeeding ages, and of the present
Ladies, States-men, Lawers, Divines
and Phisicians are not allowed to
give it audience. I have heard Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
though loose, say, that they
loved none of these who published
their shame, though they satisfied
their Lust; and that such did oft
evaporat their Lust in these raile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
or design to supply their defects
in such discourses. And I know that
Lackeys, or Bawds, will be more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate
in that kind of eloquence, then
the noblest of such as use it (if any
who are Noble use it at all.) Men
must either think Women great
Cheats, in loving what they weep
or blush at, or else they are very cruel,
in tormenting their ears with so
grating sounds. And if Women be
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:53048:47"/>
such excellent Creatures, as Mens
Oaths and Complements make them,
certainly Obscenity must be a mean
Vice, seing of all others, such decry it
most. For complyance with whom, it
is strange that these who offer to die,
will not much rather abandon a piece
of imaginary wit; and which passeth
not even for such, but amongst these
who are scarce competent Judges. It
is most ungentle many for such as fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Ladies, to spend so much time
in studying a kind of wit, that not
only cannot be serviceable, but which
cannot in any case be acceptable, or
recreative to these lovely persons,
for whose divertisement and satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
even these obscene Ranters do
pretend that they imploy all their
time and pains, and whom they will
doubtlesse at some occasions offend,
by slipping into one of these criminal
expressions, which custome will so
familiarize, that it will be as impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:53048:47"/>
for them to abstain, as it will be
for these others to hear what is so
spoke, without trouble and dissatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.
Such as have their noble
Souls busied about great matters, find
little time to invent expressions, or
mould thoughts concerning such pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
subjects; And I appeal to the
worst of these, if they do not abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minat
such as are in History noted
for Obscenity, and if they would not
hate any, who would adorn their
Funeral Harangue, with no other
praises, but that they were so wittily
prophane, that they would force
Ladies to blush, Debauchees to laugh,
States-men to undervalue them, and
chase Divines from their Table.</p>
            <p>Avarice is so base a Vice,<note place="margin">Avarice and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality.</note> that the
term <hi>Sordid</hi> is improperly used in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality,
when it is otherwise applyed,
and by terming one a <hi>Noble Person,</hi>
we intend to signifie, that he is libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral:
This is that Vice, which by
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:53048:48"/>
starving great designs, hinders them
to grow up to their full dimensions.
None will carry about dismembered
bodies, and wear scarres in their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
or to gain victories for these,
whose avarice will so little reward
their pains, that they oft-times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
to supply these necessities which
were contracted in their own imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
No great man can have both
the hearts and the purses of his infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors:
And few have been famous, or
prosperous, but such as have been as
ready to bestow riches upon their
friends, as they have been ready to
take spoil from their enemies. <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mistocles</hi>
finding himself tempted to
look upon a great Treasure, blush'd
at his error; and turning to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
said, Take thou that Money,
for thou art not <hi>Themistocles. Rome</hi>
then begun to be jealous of <hi>Cesars</hi>
greatness, when he begun to put the
Army in his debt; It was said of that
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:53048:48"/>
Noble Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> that he was
the greatest Usurer in <hi>France,</hi> for he
laid out his Estate in Obligations;
And <hi>Tacitus</hi> observes, that <hi>Vespasian</hi>
had equal'd the greatest of the <hi>Roman
Hero's,</hi> if his Avarice had not lessen'd
his other Vertues: Which is the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
made by <hi>Philip de Comines,</hi>
upon <hi>Lewis</hi> the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>France. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seus,</hi>
out of love to his Treasures, lost
both his Kingdom and these, being
as a punishment to his Avarice, led
in triumph in the company of his
Coffers, by a <hi>Roman</hi> General, who
gloried, and is yet famous for having
died almost a Beggar. The World
love, esteem, and follow such as are
liberal; Historians celebrat their
Names; Souldiers fight their Battels,
and their Beeds-men importune Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
for success to their Arms; but no
man can have a kindness for such as
will prefer to them a little stamped
earth, or value no obligations, but
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:53048:49"/>
these which bind to a paying of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.
And it is well concluded by the
World, that no vast soul can restrict
all its thoughts to that imployment,
which is the Task of Porters and
Coblers. In this Vice we make our
Souls to serve our Riches, whereas
in its opposite Vertue, Riches and
every thing else (whose price these
may be) are by such as are truly li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral,
subjected to the meanest im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,
to which the Soul can
think them conducive: And the Soul
is too Noble and well appointed an
appartment, to be filled with Coffers,
Baggs, and such like trash; which
even these, who value them most,
hoord up in their darkest and worst
furnisht Rooms: And such as are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral,
are the Masters (for it belongs
to these only to spend) whereas the
Avaricious are in effect but their
Cash-keepers, who have the power
to keep, but not the allowance to
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:53048:49"/>
spend what is under their custody. I
am confident, that <hi>Zeno</hi> is more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
(and to be rich serves for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else) for throwing away his
Money, when it begun to trouble his
nobler thoughts, then <hi>Cresus,</hi> whose
Mountainous Treasures served only
to bribe a more valiant Prince, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
them and it. And <hi>Marcus Cras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi>
the richest <hi>Roman,</hi> was so far
undervalued by <hi>Julius Cesar,</hi> that
he said he would make himself richer
in one hour, then these riches could
their Master, which came according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to pass, when by his liberality he
gained the <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiery, and
they gained for him the Empire of
that World, whereof <hi>Cresus</hi> Estate
was but a small one, though his Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice
made it a great spot in him. This
Vice implyes a present sense of want,
and a fear of future misery, to be
hoording up what serves for nothing
else, except to prevent, or supply us
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:53048:50"/>
in these conditions. But Noble Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
who design Fame and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests,
Vertue and Religion, raise
their thoughts above this low Vice,
and design not to gain Riches, but
Men, who are Masters of these; and
with whom when gain'd, thy can
soon bring all things to their devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
And therefore in point of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
we are obliged to hate Avarice,
and cherish Liberality.</p>
            <p>Though treason cheats with fair
hopes of glory and advancement,<note place="margin">Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and perfidie.</note> and
at least this Vice pretends to have
whole Woods of Lawrels at its dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal,
yet the most ordinary preference
it gains men, is the being first amongst
fools and vicious persons; for they
are then wronging both that honour
they possess, and that to which they
aspire, when they by their usurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
learn others how sweet it is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel
against their Superiors. And such
as imploy the Commons against their
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:53048:50"/>
Soveraign, must expect to allow them
greater liberty then suits with the
honour of Governours, and must stile
themselves the servants of the people;
How meanly must these flatter that
unreasonable crew? Swear friendship
with such as have wronged their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
lye, dissemble, cheat, beg,
meet in dark corners with their asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciats,
and suffer as much toil and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery,
as wants nothing but the noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the quarrel to make them
Martyrs. It is not safe for any man
in point of Honour, to undertake
designs wherein it is probable he will
fail, and wherein if he fail, it is most
certain that his honour will suffer:
And there is no crime wherein men
are more like to fail, then in this, the
rable whom they imploy, being as
uncertain, as they are a furious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument:
And like the Elephant,
ready still to turn head against such as
imploy them in Battel; And who
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:53048:51"/>
will trust the promise of these Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
(for without large promises,
Rebellion can never be effectuat)
who in these promises are betraying
their own Alledgeance? and such as
these imploy, will (at least may)
consider, that how soon they have
effectuat these treacherous designs,
they will either disdain the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
as useless, or destroy them
as dangerous, and as such, who by
this late experience, are abler to ruine
them, then they were their Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors.
And when such Traitors are
disappointed of their designs, they
are laught at as fools (for nothing
but success can clear them from that
imputation) and exposed to all the
Ludibrie, and thereafter to the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of Enemies, who cannot but be
violent Executioners, seing their ruine
was sought by the Rebellion. Is
there any thing more ignoble then
ingratitude? And these Traitors are
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:53048:51"/>
ingrate, seing none can pretend to
these Arts but such as have been by
the bounty of these, against whom
they rebell, advanced to that hight,
which hath made them giddy; and
to that favour with the people, upon
which they bottom their hopes. And
do not Men and Story talk more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagiously
of Footmen and Slaves,
who have relieved their Masters, then
of the greatest of such as have rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
against their Princes? all mankind
being concerned to magnifie that
wherein their own safety is concerned,
and to decry these Arts, whereby
their ruine is sought. That same
people who cut <hi>Sejanus</hi> in as many
pieces as he had once favorites, did
raise a Statue to <hi>Pompey's</hi> Slave, for
staying by the Carcass of his dead
Master. And as <hi>Alexander</hi> hang'd
<hi>Bessus,</hi> who had betrayed to him his
Master <hi>Spitamenes</hi> and <hi>Antigonus</hi>
caused Massacre these <hi>Hygeraspides,</hi>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:53048:52"/>
who had betrayed the gallant <hi>Eume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes:</hi>
So <hi>Charles</hi> the ninth of <hi>France,</hi>
did refuse to punish such as had oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
him, when he was in Rebellion;
for, said he, such as have been faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to the King, against me, when I
was but Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> will be
faithfull to me, when I am raised from
being Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> to be King
of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Inconstancy is likewise an ignoble
Vice,<note place="margin">Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy.</note> seing it shews, that either men
were foolish in their first choise, or,
that they were foolish in relinquish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it; it shews that men are too
much subject to the impressions of
others, and small or light things are
these which are soonest blown off
from their first stations: Whereas
vertuous and constant persons do shew
their greatness in the impossibility of
their being removed. This Vice like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
is unfit for such as design great
matters, seing no party will care much
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:53048:52"/>
to gain such for friends, whom they
cannot retain; and when they tell you
that such are not worth their pains,
they tell you how mean an esteem
they put upon inconstancy. All affairs
in the World are subject to change;
and it is most certain, that some oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,
or other, will somewhat raise
all parties: To be constant then to
any one, will gain him who is fixt,
the honour of being sure to his friends,
which will magnifie him amongst
such as are indifferent, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
him respect even from his
enemies, who will admire him for
that quality, which by ensuring their
own friends to them, will advantage
their interest more then they can be
prejudg'd by him, as their enemy,
how considerable soever he be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine's</hi>
greatness cannot perswade the
World to pardon him this fault, nor
can <hi>Cato's</hi> severity; nor self-murther,
disswade them from admiring that
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:53048:53"/>
constancy, which had as much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Gallantry in it, as may be
a remission for his crime: Besides,
that it made <hi>Cesar</hi> (even when his
Victories had raised him to his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
hight and vanity) regrate the
losing an opportunity to gain so great
a person.</p>
            <p>There is amongst many others,<note place="margin">An In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vective against uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships.</note> one
effect of inconstancy, which I hate,
as mean, and unworthy of a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and that is, to alter friendships
upon every elevation of Fortune; as
if (forsooth) men were rais'd so high,
that they cannot from these Pinacles
know such whom they have left upon
the first levell: but really this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes
a weakness of sight in them, and
no imperfection in their friends, upon
whom they cast down their looks, and
who continue still of their first sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
though the others eyes continue
not to possess the same clearness. A
generous person should not entertain
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:53048:53"/>
so low thoughts of himself, as to think
that what is the gift of another, can
add so much to his intrinsick value,
as to make him confess in the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuing
of his former friends, the
meanness of his own parts, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
condition: And he obstructs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
his own greatness, who obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
his friends to stop, and retard it,
as what may be disadvantagious to
their interest, by robbing them of
so rare an advantage as is a friend.
Whereas the noblest trial of power is,
to be able to raise these whom men
honoured formerly with that Title:
For by this, others will be invited to
depend upon them, and they may
thereby justifie their former choice,
and let the World see, that they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
entred upon any friendship that
was mean, or low.</p>
            <p>Friendship, the greatest of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders,
hath commanded us to stay
by our friend, and he who quites the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:53048:54"/>
Post assigned to him, is either coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
or a fool; and a Gentleman should
think it below his courage, as well
as his friendship, to be boasted from
a station which he thought so advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious,
out of fear of either Fate, or
Interest: Which recommends much
to me that gallant Rant in <hi>Lucan,</hi>
when after he had preferred <hi>Cato</hi> to
other men, he, in these words, extolls
him above the gods,</p>
            <q>Victrix causa diis placuit sed victa <hi>Catoni.</hi>
The gods did the Victorious approve,
But the great <hi>Cato</hi> did the Vanquisht love.</q>
            <p>But lest my tediousness should make
the constancy I plead for, seem a Vice,
I shall say no more of a Subject, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
I can never say enough.</p>
            <p>Drunkennels is so mean a Vice,<note place="margin">`Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenness.</note>
that I scorn to take notice of it, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that none will allow it, but such
as are mad; and such as are mad are
not to be reclaimed by Moral Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses.
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:53048:54"/>
Yet I cannot but press its
meanness from this, that though <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi>
was a person of the greatest autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
his once being drunk, is remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
in Scripture, to have made him
despicable in the eyes even of his own
Children (whom he had also lately
obliged to a more then natural respect,
by saving them from that deludge,
which drowned in their sight the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent
of mankind.) And yet he
might have excused himself, more
then those of this age, as not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the strength of that new-found
Wine: And having been drunk but
once, might have defended himself
by curiosity, which too few now can
alledge. It is a mean and mad com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement,
to requite the kindness of
such as come to visit us, with forcing
them (after the fatigue of travel) to
drink to such excess, that they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
and speak such follies, as make
them return home from that strange
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:53048:55"/>
place, without being remarked for
any thing else, then the ridiculous
expressions they vomited up with
their stinking Excrements. Why
are Servants turn'd out of doors, and
each man (which is very mean) obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to serve himself, when men en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
upon that beastly imployment?
Is it not, that Servants may not hear,
or see, what extravagancies are there
to be committed? And is it not an
ignoble part in persons of honour, to
do resolutely what they dare not
owne before the meanest who attend
them? Men by this Vice bring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to need their Servants Legs to
walk upon, and their Eyes to see by;
but which is worse, they must be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd
at that time, by the servile
discretion of such (who will be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldned
by this, to undervalue both
them and their commands) and these
Masters are accounted wisest, who do
most submissively follow their directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:53048:55"/>
Judge if that exercise can be
Noble, which in disabling us to serve
our friends, makes us uncapable to
discern the favours they do us, and
measure its disadvantages by this,
that when men have their Senses be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nighted
with the vapours of Wine,
they are thereby unfitted to lead Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
to assist at Councils, to sit in
Judicatories, to attend Ladies, and
differ nothing from the being dead,
but that they would be much more
innocent if they were so. Men are
then very ready to attaque unjustly
the honour of others, and most unable
to defend their own: And such as
they wrong then, do with a scornful
mercy pardon their failings with the
famness of disdain, which makes them
forgive fools, or furious persons: And
that in my judgement should be the
most touching of all affronts. And
if we esteem Roots according to the
prettiness of these Flowers they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:53048:56"/>
(as if they would give a grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
accompt to the Sun, of what its
warmness has produc'd) certainly we
will find drunkenness (as the Apostle
speaks of Avarice) the root of all
bitternesse. For this is that Vice,
which keeps men at present from at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
such of their own, and of
their friends interests, as concern most
their Fame: And as to the future,
begets such diseases, and indispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as makes their bodies unfit instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
for great atchievments. And
seing to talk idly, is the most pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
of its errors (which is so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
a Character, that no Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
would suffer another to give it
of him, without hazarding his life
in the revenge) it's other madnesse
must be beyond all remission. By
this, men are brought to disgorge the
deepest buried secrets, to reveal the
intimacies, or asperse the names of
Ladies, to enter upon foolish quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:53048:56"/>
and the next morning, either to
abjure what they said, or fight in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly
their Commerads; and Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
is not in that case rewarded with
Fame, but is tainted with the asper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of a drunken quarrel, and is as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crib'd
not to courage, but to necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>I confesse, whooring is in this a
more extensive Vice, then others;
that it corrupts still two at once, for
no man can sin so alone, but drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
(as if it scornd not to be the
greatest Vice) does surpasse it in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
quality, which is, that one vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
person can force, or tempt
whole tables, and companies to be
drunk with him: and if great men
should be known to love this Vice,
all such as have need to accoast them,
would be in danger, either by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency,
or interest, to plunge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
into this miserable excess. In
other Vices, men debauch only their
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:53048:57"/>
own rational Souls; but here men
add to that, the ingratitude of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying
against GOD, and Nature,
these Rents and Estates, which were
kept by providence, from more pious
persons, that great men might by
that testimony of his kindness, be
engaged to a religious retribution.
So that such as employ their Estates,
in maintaining their Drunkennesse,
commit almost the same Sacriledge
with <hi>Beltshazzar,</hi> who was terrified
by a miraculous hand upon the Wall,
delivering him his fatal sentence, for
carousing with his Nobles in the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Vessels, that were robb'd from
the Temple of <hi>Jerusalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Employment, as well as Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy,<note place="margin">In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice.</note> oblidges me to implead In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice
as the worst of Vices; because
it wrongs the best of men, and the
best of things; the best of men, seing
they have still the best of Plea's.
And so, Injustice can only reach
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:53048:57"/>
them, and these will not by Flattery,
Bribing, or Cheats, conciliat the
esteem of such, as have a latitude to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
them this unjust advantage; which
good men neither need, nor will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept.
Injustice likewise, debauches
the Law, which is the best of things;
and in affronting whereof, of all
others, great men are (when guilty)
most ungrate: because, it is their
Guardian, &amp; Fence by which they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
respect and treasures from others;
and without which, such Magistrats
are unjust, could not escape these
hourly massacres, which a robb'd and
opprest people would poure upon
them. And though such, as are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerously
injust, intend thereby to
complement their friends, or repay
old favours; Yet in effect, this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quital,
is as base, as if one should rob
a Church, to pay his particular debts.
He is not worthy of your friendship,
who will expect such returns: And
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:53048:58"/>
Vertue is not like Vice, so penurious
or poor, as that it cannot build up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
any other foundation, then the
ruins of another. Such as intend by
their injustice to gain esteem, from
the party advantag'd thereby, are
much mistaken; for though, they
should gain the esteem of one there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
yet they would lose that of many
thousands; and he who is wrong'd,
will disclose the injustice done him,
more then the other dare brag of the
favour. And I have my self heard,
even the gainer hate and undervalue
his injust Patron, loving not the
traitor but the treason: Considering,
that by that precedent, himself was
laid open to more hazard, then he
thereby reapt of advantage; for that
same injustice, which ensured him of
his late conquest, made him unsure
both of it, and all that he had or
should gain thereafter. And to be
injust for a bribe, is as mean, as to
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:53048:58"/>
serve in the worst of employments
for a fee, it is to be as base as a thief,
and lesse noble then a robber; and it
deserves all these base reproaches,
that are due to Avarice, Lying,
Flattery, Ingratitude, Treachery and
Perjury: All which, are sharers in
this Caper when it prospers, and
when it prospers not, it leads to these
ignoble Ports, Infamy, Poverty, the
Scaffold, Pillory or Gibbets.</p>
            <p>Though my having usurp'd so far
upon the Readers patience,<note place="margin">publick Spirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednesse.</note> makes
all I can say for the future, criminal,
Yet such respect I owe, and such I
bear, to the memory of these noble
Patriots, who have by their publick
Spiritednesse, settled for us that
peace, whose native product, all our
joyes are: that I cannot but recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend,
that protecting Vertue to such

of a great Soul, and if our actions be
specified and measured by their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:53048:59"/>
certainly these Souls must be
accounted greatest, which center
all their cases upon the publick good,
scorning to wind up their designs
upon so small a bottom, as is privat
interest. By this, the Heathens be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
Gods, and Christians do by it
(which is more) resemble theirs.
This is the task of Kings and Princes;
whereas privat interest is the design of
Churles and Coblers: who can so
justly expect universal praise, as these
who design universal advantage?
and none will grudge, that riches
should be carried into his treasurs,
who keeps them but as <hi>Joseph</hi> did his
corn in granaries, till others need to
have their necessities supplied.
These are deservedly stiled <hi>Patres Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triae,</hi>
and it is accounted moral Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricide,
to wound the reputation of
such as the Common-wealth terms
its Parents. And when these Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
which privat interest have rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:53048:59"/>
from the publick, shall, after
they have stain'd the acquirer with
the names of avarice and crueltie, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite
posterity to recall them from his
offspring, as not due to them; Then
such as have like Providence toiled
only for the good of their Countrey,
and Mankind, shall find their Fame
like Medals, grow still the more illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious,
by all accessions of time; and
that the new born Generations shall
augment the numbers of their admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
more then following years can
moulder away these heaps of Coyn,
which avaritious men raised as a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument
for their memory. <hi>Epami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nondas</hi>
is more famous and admired,
then <hi>Cresus;</hi> and Fame may be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
believed concerning him, seing he
left neither Gold, nor Money, to
bribe from it a suffrage. And albeit
he was so busied in raising the glory
of his Countrey, that he had no time
to gain as much Money, as to raise
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:53048:60"/>
the meanest for his own; Yet we find
him at no loss thereby, seing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> each
<hi>Theban</hi> assisted at his Funeral, as a
Mourner: And Nature lays it as a
duty upon all whom it brings to the
World, to magnifie him who endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to resemble it, in the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salities
of his favours. That glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>Roman,</hi> who threw himself into
the devouring Gulf, to avert the
wrath of the gods from his Countrey,
did, in exchange of a few years (which
he but might have liv'd) add an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of Fame to his age; and by the
gloriousness of that action, has bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
nothing in that Gulf, but
his personal faults. And <hi>Brutus,</hi>
by dying for his Countrey, is
not more justly called the last of
Romans, then he may be called the
first of men. And for my part, I
think that he sacrificed <hi>Cesar,</hi> rather
as a Victime to his injur'd Countrey,
then to his private malice. For as
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:53048:60"/>
Mr. <hi>Couley</hi> well remarks, the pretext
of friendship<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> can be no reason, why a
man should suffer without resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
his Mother to be violated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his eyes. <hi>Paul</hi> likewise, whom
grace had raised as much above these,
as reason had raised these above
others, was so zealous in this Vertue,
that after he had known the joyes of
Heaven more intimately, then
others, who had not like him travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
through all these starry Regions;
Yet such was his affection to his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Countrey, that he was content, to
have his name deleted out of the
Book of Life, that room might be
made for theirs. But if men will love
nothing but what will advance their
privat interest, they will at least, upon
this score, love their Countrey, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,
when it becomes famous, they
will share in the advantage: As the
being a <hi>Roman,</hi> was sufficient to make
one terrible, when <hi>Rome</hi> flourished.
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:53048:61"/>
And I imagine, that it was sufficient
to incite one of that glorious Re-pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
to undertake, or suffer the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
of things, to remember him that
he was a <hi>Roman:</hi> and at all times the
unacquainted still esteem us, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the presumptions they can ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from our Countrey, Race, and
Education. For besides that a Hawk
of a good nest is still preferred: We
see, that example and emulation, are
the strongest motives that can either
induce, or enable men to be noble
and valorous; and though some term
this but a fancy, yet, granting it were
no more, it is such a fancy, as tends
much to our honour, because it high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens
in others a fear of us, and lessens
in us the fear of them. I may then
conclude with this, that as the Rays
of the Sun are accounted a more noble
light, then any that is projected
from a private Candle. And as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
Perfumes, these are accounted
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:53048:61"/>
noblest, whose emanations dart to the
greatest distance; so amongst Souls,
these are the most excellent, which
respect most the advantage of others.</p>
            <p>I confess there are some Vices,<note place="margin">Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is a mean, vice.</note>
which by shrouding themselves under
the appearance of good, do advance
themselves too far in ill govern'd
esteems, as we see in ambition, and
revenge; Yet to our severer inquiries
it will appear, that <hi>Ambition</hi> is ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble,
seing such as desire to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted,
confess the meanness of that
state they press to leave. This Vice
oblidges men to serve such as advance
its designs, exchanging its present li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
for, but the uncertain expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation
of commanding others; and
paying greater respects to Superiors
for this expectation, then it will be
able to exact from those whom it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
to subject. What is advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but the peoples Livery? and
such as expect their happiness from
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:53048:62"/>
them, must acknowledge, that the
Rable is greater and nobler then
themselves; and by exchanging their
natural happiness, for that which is
of its bestowing, they confess their
own to be of the least value; for no
man will exchange for what is worse.
A Courtier admiring the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,
gathering his Herbs, told him,
that if he flattered the Emperor, he
needed not gather Herbs; was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
that if he could satisfie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with Herbs, he needed not flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Emperor; and without doubt,
flattery inferrs more dependence, then
gathering of Herbs. And in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute
for liberty, <hi>Diogenes</hi> had the
advantage of the <hi>Stagarit,</hi> when he
told him, <hi>Diogenes</hi> did dine when it

till it pleased <hi>Alexander.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Vanity is too airie a Vice to be
noble,<note place="margin">Vanity.</note> for it is but a thin crust of
<hi>Pride,</hi> and but a pretending cadet of
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:53048:62"/>
that gallant sin; It is I confess, lesse
hurtful then Pride, because it mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
it self, without disparraging
others, (for if we admire others when
compar'd with our selves; we are not
vain, but proud) and it is oft the
Spur to great actions, being to our
undertakings, what some poysons are
to Medicins; which, though they
be hurtful in a dose apart, yet make
the compounds they enter, more op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perative
and pointed. And I have
heard some defend, that Vanity was
no sin, because, in admiring our
selves, at a greater rate then we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd,
we without detracting from
our Neighbour, hightned our debt to
our Maker, which might be an error,
but was no fault. But Vanity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an error in our judgement, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but be mean, as all errors are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble:
And he is avery fool (which
is the ignoblest of names) who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands
not himself. He who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:53048:63"/>
not his own measurs, cannot
govern himself, and so is unfit to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
others; and it is the employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a great Soul, rather to do
things worthy to be admired, then
to admire what himself hath done;
but leaving to pursue the croud of it's
ill effects, I shall single out some of
these I judge most enemies to true
gallantry, amongst which, I scruple
not to prefer inmeanesse, the being
<hi>vain of prosperity,</hi> and derived
power: which shews, that we prefer,
and admire more what others can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow,
then what we possesse our
selves. Whereas, vertuous persons,
may justly think, that nothing can
make them greater, and to be vain of
prosperity, shewes we cannot bear it;
and so concludes us under a weakness:
To take advantages of others,
when we are more powerful then
they, is as base, as it is for an arm'd
man to force his enemie to fight,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:53048:63"/>
when he has no weapon: this is
cowardlienesse, not courage, and who
defers not his revenge, till his rival be
equal with him, implys a fear of
grapling upon equal termes. That
one expression, of one of the Kings of
<hi>France,</hi> that he scorn'd when he was
King of <hi>France,</hi> to remember the
wrongs done to the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi>
makes his name grateful in history,
and if great men would reflect seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
how a word from him they
serve (though but a man who must
himself yeeld oft times to a mean dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aster)
or how the least error in their
own conduct, can overturn the fixt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
of their endeavours, and make
them in being unfortunat, ridiculous
withal, certainly they would call this
presumption, rather madnesse, then
Vanity; and would conclude it more
gallant, to bear adversity, with a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
courage, then to be a fool or
flattered by prosperity, which van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quishes
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:53048:64"/>
as oft, these for whom, as
these against whom it fights.</p>
            <p>Neither can I leave this Period,
till I inveigh against that meannest of
Vanities;<note place="margin">The meanness of being vain of riches and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estates.</note> whereby, men are vain of
Estates and Territories: For, seing
Man is born Lord of all the World,
why should he retrinch his own right,
by glorying in so little a part of it,
that his share will escape an exact Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ographer.
I wish such would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
that <hi>Pompey</hi> bestowed King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
upon his slaves, and yet
<hi>Epictetus,</hi> who was a slave, is more
admired, then he; and yet admired
for nothing, but his Vertue: and
why should men be proud, of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying
that, upon which the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
begger pours out his excrements
If these be vain, because they may
call it their own, what hath the
Master but that (as <hi>Solomon</hi> says) he
beholdeth it with his eyes, and at
this rate, I may glory, in that the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:53048:64"/>
glorious heavens are spread over me,
for I may behold the one, with as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriating

which these have, have the Heaven

            </p>
            <p>But if the answer be, that these
Rents will allow them the keeping
of a table for their Grandour (which
I wish, were the only excuse) that
answers makes them Servants, and
burdens them with a necessity, to
provide for such as they entertain;
and so they are vain of being Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
and Servants to such, as will
rise from their table, to read and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
above them, <hi>Plato, Socrates,</hi> or
which is lesse, the author of a well

these may have some pretext, for
preferring their own Estates, above
these of others, but why should they
admire themselves for their Estates?
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:53048:65"/>
which is no part of themselves, and
so they should not in reason
think better of themselves then
others for it. Under the same con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
fall such, as are vain of
theis Horses, Lackeys, or such like
things, which is most injust, except
their Horses and they were all one.</p>
            <p>Such as crust themselves over with

silly toyes, which are the creaturs and

certainly very low, and mean spirited,
when they imagin to add to their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
value, by things that have no
value in them, but what our Fancy
(which is the most despicable quality
of that Soul they neglect) gives them.
And do not they amongst the rest of
mankind, disparage very much even
these Mistrisses upon whom they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow
these adorations? which they
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:53048:65"/>
deny their mighty Maker, when they
imagine by such contemptible means,
to scrue themselves into their esteem.
How ignobly undervalue they their
own thoughts, the noble conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of excellent men, and accurate
Books (to write some whereof, <hi>Cesar,</hi>
and the greatest of the Emperors
have laid aside their Swords) when
they impend upon Ribbans, and Laces,
that age of time, which would be
missimployed, though it were let out
but in moments, upon such Woman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Exercises. But if Ladies, or their
Suitors, will magnifie these handsome
shapes and colours, which are too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
bestowed upon them, to repair
the want of these noble qualities, of
which those who are Masters may be
more justly vain: Why are not they
afraid? by whoring, fairding, drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
gluttony, or macerating envy,
to blast these florid advantages upon
which themselves do, and would have
others to dote.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:53048:66"/>
I must here endeavour to subdue
one error,<note place="margin">Preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not still honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</note> which is by so much the
more dangerous, that it wears the
fairest mask of all other Vices: and
this is that whereby men are induced
to believe, that true honour is but an
appanage of preferment, and that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment
is seldome without honour,
but honour comes never without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment;
and not only are the Lees
of the people taken with this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but the gallantest of men, who
are Spheared far above those, do in
this, slide easily into the sense of the
Neighbourhood. Yet it remains still
an error, for true honour is an innat
elevation of the Soul, whereby it
scorns every thing which is more
mortal then it self, and nothing is
more frail then preferment; whose
paint is washt off by the least storm,
and whose being depends upon the
fancy, or humour of others: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
true honour is independent, and as
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:53048:66"/>
it cannot flow from any other, so can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
stoop to them. He is truly gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant,
whose innocence fears not the
jurisdiction of men; and who looks
upon Scepters, and such Gilded
Trifles, as impertinent toyes,
when they are not sway'd by the hand
of Vertue; and who would not value
power for any other end, but to be a
second to these inclinations which are
so reasonable, that they should not
need power to make them be obeyed?
Tyrants can bestow the tallest pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments,
but they cannot make men
truly honourable; which shews that
these two differ. And <hi>Heliogabulus</hi>
cooke was still but a base fellow,
though his Masters doting made him
as great, as were his own Vices; A Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
becomes not taller by the hight
of its Basis, nor a Head more wise, or
noble, for being adorned with a shaggie
Plummage. <hi>Julius Cesar,</hi> though
no Emperor, has a more lasting glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:53048:67"/>
then <hi>Tiberius</hi> who was so. And
<hi>Cato</hi> gloried more in that the people
asked why he was not preferred, then
he would have done in enjoying the
greatest honours these had to bestow.
Preferment is but the creation of
men, but true honour is of GODS own
creation; and as we should esteem
this last as a Piece done by the Nobler
Master, so we should love it best, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is more our own, then what
rises from anothers favour. Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
when most advantagiously be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed,
can but produce love, or
fear; to beget fear, is not noble, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Devil doth this most, and
these who come next to him in base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
come nearest him in this Brutes,
Savages and Mad-men, have suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency
enough for that undertaking;
but to beget love, is peculiar to true
honour: and so generous a passion is
Love, that it is soonest elicit, when
least commanded. A vertuous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:53048:67"/>
is likewise a greater Governour,
then he who suffers himself to be
commanded by a Vicious Woman; a
thirsty appetit, then that King who
suffers himself to be led by the ears
with flatterers, and to be forced by
his own pride to disobey his reason,
by which alone he is truly great, and
which when any man disowns abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely,
he is to be thrown into a Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon,
or Bedlame: Preferment leaves
and obliges us to bow to others, for
satisfying our interest, so that interest
is confest by great men, to be greater
then they. But Vertue and true Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
teacheth us to subject our inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
to our selves, and puts it in our
own power to make our selves happy.
And what a Pilot is in the Ship, a

does not the Philosopher, who denys
that he can be wrong'd more nobly?
then he who confesses, that he is both

so great a one, that he cannot but

whil'st he who revenges his wrong,
is wrong'd in publick: and certainly,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:53048:68"/>
the publick wrong is more ignoble.
And seing we conceive our selves
concern'd in honour, to punish such
as would divulge an affront, that was
smothered, as soon as given: we can
not but be said to wrong our own ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
when we in seeking revenge,
proclaim such wrongs, as had else
either evanisht, or been lessened by
the concealment; which remembers
me of a Story, that goes of an old
man, at whose bald head, a rotten
Orange being thrown in the street,
clapt his Hat upon it; and said, I shall
spill that Villans sport, who expected
to see me come shewing my head all
besmeared over, and complaining of
the injury. It is one of the most
Picquant revenges, to undervalue
our enemies so far, as not to think
them worthy of our noticeing, and
we shew our selves to be greater then
they, when we let the world see,
that they cannot trouble us, when
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:53048:69"/>
children and fools do us the same
things, that we fret at in others of
more advanced years, we passe them
without a frown; which shews, that it
is not the acts done us by our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
but our own resentment, which
in effect injures us; So that it is still
in our power to vex such as design to
affront us, by laughing at, or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuing
these, and such like little
endeavours as what cannot reach
our happiness. He who pardons, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims
that by so doing, he fears not
his enemies for the future; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
implyes a fear of what we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
upon that account to lessen. Thus
cowards, and none but they, are cruel,
seing they then only account them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
secure, when their enemies have
lost all capacity to resist. In revenge,
we act the Executioner, but we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonat
a Prince when we pardon; in
the one, we bestow a favour, and so
are Noble, but in the other, we dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>close
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:53048:69"/>
our infirmity, which is ignoble.</p>
            <p>I admire Passive Courage,<note place="margin">The gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry of patience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> as a Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
which deserves its Palms best of
all others, because it toils most for
them, Honours and Rewards are but
gifts to them, but they are conquests
to it: And it merits as much praise,
as it meets with injuries. <hi>Avida est
periculi virtus, &amp; quò tendat non quid
passura sit cogitat, quoniam &amp; quod
passura est, gloriae pars est:</hi> This Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
hath rather a greediness for, then
a desire to find dangers; and seing its
sufferings make the greatest part of
its glory, it runs out to meet them,
thinking that to attend them, is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of cowardliness. And if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark
narrowly, we will find that all
other Vertues owe their Gallantry to
this: And have no other title to that
glorious quality, but in so far as they
borrow excellencies from it. Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
is then only gallant, when to
gratifie our friends, we expose to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:53048:70"/>
for them, either our persons, or
interest. Gratitude is then Noble,
when we consider not what we are to
suffer; but what we owe, or (which
is more gallant) what is requisite for
the service of such as have obliged
us. Justice is alwayes excellent, but
is then only most to be admired,
when we resist temptations, and when
we resolve to suffer for having been
just; the envy and rage of these, who
consider only how much they have
been prejudged, but not how much
the publick good hath been thereby
advanced.</p>
            <p>By this it is that a vertuous person
shews how great he truly is, and that
power and command were the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
only, but not parts of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
worth. He who yeelds to affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
shews that those who inflicts
it, are greater then himself; but he
who braves it, shews that it is not in
the power of any thing but of guilt,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:53048:70"/>
to make him tremble. It is easie for
one who is assisted by power and fate,
to urge these advantages, but to dare
these, shews a pitch beyond them:
And this induces me to think, that
passive courage is more noble then
what is active: For one who fights
gallantly in an open Field, and in the
view, or front of an Army, is assisted
by the example of others, by hope of
revenge, or victory, and needs not
much fear that death which he may
