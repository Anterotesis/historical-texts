            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>In <hi>Octob.</hi> laſt, when <hi>Lambert ſcattered the Committee of Weſtminſter</hi> (or (more modeſtly) <hi>ſent the Gentlemen to ſecure Portſmouth) his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nluckie Excellency</hi> thought it then a fit time to ſet up for <hi>himſelf;</hi> and in the Head of a <hi>Phanatique Party,</hi> to bid Defiance to all the <hi>Sober Intereſts,</hi> and <hi>Judgements</hi> of the Nation. His Principal aſſiſtant in the work was Sr. <hi>Henry Vane, the Prophet of that Inſpired Rabble.</hi> The <hi>Faction</hi> was grown <hi>Bold,</hi> and <hi>Formidable;</hi> when, to <hi>divert the Courſe,</hi> or <hi>meet the Fury</hi> of it, the <hi>General was Invited</hi> to draw a Force from <hi>Scotland</hi> into the <hi>North:</hi> and In he came, but to a Nobler purpoſe, than ever they Intended. They <hi>Called</hi> him in to ſave <hi>Themſelves,</hi> he <hi>Came</hi> to ſave the <hi>Nation.</hi> Upon the firſt notice of his <hi>Advance, Lambert</hi> was ſent with a conſiderable Army to meet him, and <hi>London</hi> left almoſt without a <hi>Publique Guard,</hi> (ſuch was the Confederacy they had in the <hi>Anabaptiſtique Party, which was privatly Armed, and Listed in and about the Town.)</hi> In fine, after diverſe <hi>Affronts upon, and Tumults in the City,</hi> the <hi>Souldiery Revolted;</hi> the <hi>Fugitive Members Returned; Lambert's Army Mouldered away;</hi> and <hi>his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency vaniſhed. General Monk</hi> having proceeded thus far without a Blow; but the more difficult part was ſtill behind, (for <hi>Treacherous friends,</hi> are much more <hi>dangerous</hi> than <hi>profeſſed Enemies)</hi> The <hi>General,</hi> reſolves next, for <hi>London:</hi> and makes it his deſign, both in his Paſſage, and after his Arrive, by all means poſſible, to avoid bloud-ſhed; His <hi>March</hi> ſpeaks him a <hi>Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> and a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> for it was <hi>Regular,</hi> and <hi>Inoſſenſive.</hi> The Country courted him upon the way, as their <hi>Deliverer,</hi> and he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved it; For he hath proved himſelf no leſſe. The ſtrict <hi>reſerve</hi> he uſed, was but what beſt became his <hi>Dignity</hi> and <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;</hi> he was too <hi>Generous,</hi> to betray <hi>Another,</hi> and too <hi>Wiſe</hi> to be betrayed, <hi>Himſelf;</hi> under this Guard of <hi>Honour,</hi> and of <hi>Caution,</hi> he paſt his Journy; not to trouble you with long ſtories, how the waies were thronged with <hi>Cries</hi> and <hi>Addreſſes</hi> of the Nation, for <hi>a Free Parliament;</hi> what <hi>Conference</hi> he had with the <hi>good Aldermen,</hi> what <hi>Complements</hi> were made him, by the <hi>Other</hi> men of <hi>Weſtminſter, &amp;c.</hi>—To come to the Point, upon <hi>Friday after noon,</hi> (the third of this Inſtant <hi>February) General Monk</hi> took up his Lodgings in <hi>Whitehall,</hi> on the <hi>Monday following,</hi> his Excellencie was conducted by <hi>Scot,</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binſon,</hi> (with the formality of a <hi>Mace</hi> carried before them,) into a place, commonly called the <hi>Parliament-Houſe,</hi> where he deliver'd himſelf according to good Diſcretion, and ſoon after return'd to his Lodgings: Laden with <hi>the Thanks of the Houſe; Tueſday</hi> and <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> were the <hi>General</hi>'s daies of <hi>reſt:</hi> but not ſo to the <hi>City:</hi> for, upon <hi>Tueſday</hi> the 100000 <hi>l. Tax</hi> came out, which Netled the Citizens ſhrewdly; and the day <hi>following,</hi> they met in <hi>Common-Councel,</hi> to advice upon it. Where they reſolved, <hi>to adhere to a former Vote of the Court in the Negative.</hi> At the ſame ſitting was communicated a <hi>Declaration from Warwick-ſhire, for a Free Parliament;</hi> it was of a fair ſignification, and Authority; the Gentlemen that brought it, received the Thanks of the Court; (not to mention the peeviſhneſſe of 2. or 3. Diſſenters,) <hi>'tis hoped they may be wiſer and honester hereafter;</hi> This was a <hi>Day</hi> of <hi>Buſineſs</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> and produced a <hi>Buſier Night</hi> at <hi>Westminſter:</hi> for the Councel of State, after a tedious Puzzle and Debate, Iſſued out Orders to <hi>General Monk,</hi> for the Reducing of the <hi>City,</hi> directing him to proceed, in ſuch a Method, as they had preſcribed him. In purſuance thereof, his Excellencie marched early upon <hi>Thurſday</hi> the Ninth current <hi>Horſe</hi> and <hi>Foot,</hi> into the <hi>City;</hi> by that means fruſtrating a Reſpect which the Court had deſigned him, the Day before; <hi>Having appointed 4. Aldermen, and 8. Commoners to attend him the next Morning.</hi> His entrance into the Town, brought all the <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction</hi> with it, Immaginable: nor did the People underſtand for a long while, whether they ſhould <hi>Curſe</hi> or <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore</hi> him: at laſt, in complyance with his Orders, he ſeized divers eminent Citizens, and ſent them to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and took up his Quarters that Night in the City; By this time, the People, beyond all doubt, pronounced him the moſt execrable Creature that ever came within their Walls, not underſtanding that the <hi>Miſchief</hi> he <hi>did</hi> them, was but <hi>Jeſt,</hi> and the <hi>Good</hi> he <hi>Intended</hi> them, was earneſt. That in conſideration of a <hi>weeks Impriſonment, he would reward them and their Poſterity, with perpetual Liberty.</hi> This however, carried an appearance of ſeverity, which was in effect, but a point of Miltary Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor; For his <hi>Inclination,</hi> and <hi>Duty</hi> in this Action, Led him <hi>ſeveral waies:</hi> as a <hi>Souldier he obeyed a Barbarous Order;</hi> as an <hi>Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> he made it his care, to take off the <hi>edge</hi> on't; and he was bound to do <hi>That, this day,</hi> by <hi>Commiſsion,</hi> Which he reſolved to undo 2. daies <hi>after</hi> upon a Nobler Principle; upon <hi>Friday,</hi> (the 10th. of the <hi>Month,</hi> and the <hi>laſt</hi> of his <hi>Commiſsion,)</hi> the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral demanded the Cities laſt Reſolve, from the Aldermen; who ſtill adhered to their former Judgement. His Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, hereupon gave command <hi>to demoliſh the City Gates,</hi> and ſo Returned to <hi>Whitehall.</hi> (Obſerve, that his <hi>Diſpleaſure,</hi> and <hi>Commiſsion</hi> died together,) For the next Morning, <hi>(Saturday,)</hi> he made the Town a large Amends: <hi>Declaring Solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to joyn with them, and their Aſſociates for a Free Parliament;</hi> (but having fairly firſt diſcharged himſelf to thoſe at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> by a Letter in commune with his Officers; <hi>who have behaved themſelves as men of Honour in the Buſineſſe:</hi> The Truth is, had not the General been nimble with them, they had undermined him; for, contrary to <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Honeſty,</hi> to their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe Agreement: they had not only entred into a <hi>ſecret</hi> combination with the Secretarie, but <hi>publickly encouraged their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblings and Petitions;</hi> and more particularlie, contrived the direct Ruine of that Perſon, who had ſo lately preſerved them. This is a Theam tranſports me; The Bloudie Votes were paſſed that Diſmal Night: Let <hi>Nedham</hi> tell you; but never was a Joy ſo Univerſal; wiſe men grew mad upon't, but ſo were mad men ſober. The Cryes, the Bonfires, and the fame of the Roſted Rumps, did quite take down the <hi>Legiſlative Stomack;</hi> 'Tis thought the thing at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> is vaniſhed. In fine, the hand of God is in't, his Name be prayſed.</p>
