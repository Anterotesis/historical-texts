         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>LONDON,</hi> thou art weighed in an
even ballance, and found too light; thou
art meaſured by an equall line, and found
too ſhort, and too narrow, and thy People
cannot ſtand in Judgement; for aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of iniquity lodgeth within thee, and
thou abounds in all unrighteouſneſſe, thy
ſins are grown over thy head, and with tranſgreſſion thou art
covered as with a garment, from the head to the foot thou art
corrupted, and there is much unſoundneſſe in thee. O how
doth pride abound, lightneſſe and wantonneſſe, and the luſt
of the eye, and all the works of the fleſh is increaſed to a large
ſum; Aboundance of Idolatry and vanity ſprings out of thee,
vaine faſhions, fooliſh cuſtomes, and all manner of evill hath
its abiding in thee; yea the very Seat of Satan is eſtabliſhed
within thy walls, and works of unrighteouſneſſe doth proceed
out of thee into other Nations. Aboundance of deceitfull Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize,
and of oppreſſing Merchants, who grind the face of
the poor, doth inhabit thy borders, thy wayes are evill in the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:118884:3"/>
ſight of the Lord, and his ſpirit is grieved and his ſoule is vexed
from day to day, every moment of time.</p>
            <p>Aboundance of treachery, flattery and hypocriſie, diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
and double heartedneſſe, poſeſſeth thine Inhabitants,
from Teachers to People, high and low, rich and poor, you
are fulfilling your own wills, and ſeeking your own pleaſures,
and following the Counſells of your own hearts, and doing
that which is right in the ſight of your own eyes; and your
hearts are corrupted before the Lord, and the very beſt of
your works are evill, and the pureſt of your wayes are filthy.
And all your Obſervations, your dayes of Humiliation, and
Thankſgivings, and all your worſhips and ſacrafices, are abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
in the ſight of the Lord: For no good fruit can
ſpring forth, for your root is not the vine Chriſt Jeſus, who
cannot own the light, with which you are enlightned, and that
makes all your Profeſſion vile, and not accepted, but it is
wholly unfruitfull in the ſight of the Lord. Much Profeſſion
there is in thee of righteouſneſſe, and Religion, and many
formes, and gatherings of people, which are but as ſo many
images, and likeneſſes of divers ſorts, which muſt be overtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and overthrown by the roots.</p>
            <p>You are all meaſured with the line of true judgement, and
your buildings cannot ſtand, when the Lord comes to try you,
and ſearch, and try you for your life, for though you profeſſe
much, yet you performe little, your knowledge puffs you up,
and you are not ſincere hearted, but looſe, and unſavoury are
you in your wayes and words. There's much wiſdome in thee,
and many wiſe men whoſe wiſdome is devi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>liſh, and it doth
not lead to God, it muſt be confounded and trodden down,
for it profits you not in the ſight of the Lord, but in it you are
wiſe to doe cvill, but to doe good you have no knowledge;
And the Lord God is forgotten, and his judgements are not
known, vanity, vanity, hath ſo ſtollen away your hearts, and
after Idolls are you run, worſhipping ſtrange Gods, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
ſtrange lovers: Aboundance of ſubtilty and craft
lodges in thee, vaine glory excells above meaſure, pride, idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;
and fulneſſe of bread abounds in thee, even as in <hi>Sodom,</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:118884:3"/>
unto whom thou art become equall in tranſgreſſion. Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
drunkenneſſe, wrath and envy, gluttony and exceſſe,
ſpending the creation upon the luſt, and all the works of the
fleſh which are evill, hath their full grouth in thee, and in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
art thou fully ripe.</p>
            <p>O <hi>London!</hi> Conſider, and be awakened ye Inhabitants
thereof, for the Lord is grieved day by day, and his ſoule is
vexed every moment, the weight of thy tranſgreſſion is upon
him, thou even makeſt him to ſerve with thy ſins; hath there
been any evill committed by any Nation which is not in thee?
hath there been any abomination brought forth, which is not
in this day to be found in thee? Oh what haughtineſſe, and
ſtretched out necks! oh what pride, and vaine glory appears
in thee, even thy Infants are nouriſhed up in vanity, and thy
old men are over-grown with craft, and deceit; Thy young
men gives their ſtrength to folly, and thy Maidens are trimd in
wantonneſſe: all ſorts of People are prophane in their way,
old and young, rich and poor, are abounding in evill, all ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their own things, and few the things of Gods Kingdome,
the way of truth is even deſpiſed, and they that depart from
iniquity are become a prey to the mouths of the ungodly, who
are grievouſly prophane, as though the Lord took no notice,
or as though no day of account were to come, ſo great is the
iniquity committed in thee, words reaches not to manifeſt it,
what lying, what ſwearing, what vaine talking, and what ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and what double dealing appears in thee at every corner,
what pride, what wantonneſſe, and wickedneſſe is manifeſt in
all thy ſtreets. Teachers and People are out of the way, given
to deceit, and to deceiving, oppreſſors, and oppreſſing one
another, ſuch is the Devills power amongſt you ruling, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
eaſily be overcome; and ſo deep is wickedneſſe ſeated in
thee, that it cannot eaſily be plucked up; ſo ſtrong is the luſt
of the fleſh grown in thee, that it cannot eaſily be removed:
How is the glorious name of the Lord continually diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and polluted, through thy wickedneſſe, which is grown
into a numberleſſe ſum. But the Lord will be avenged on all
you his enemies, and will meet you with judgements, plagues,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:118884:4"/>
and vengeance, and the wicked ſhall not eſcape.</p>
            <p>And as concerning all thy profeſſion of God, and the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
in a blind zeale, it is but abomination to the Lord, and
all thy ſeverall Sects, and gatherings of people, and ſeparate
Congregations, who is not ſeparated by the Spirit of the Lord,
they are but like ſo many molten and carved Images, which
the Lord will overthrow. All thy offerings and oblations,
preaching praying, and performances, Gods ſoule hath no
pleaſure in them, but they are a burden and wearineſſe to him;
and though thou waſh thee never ſo clean, and make thy ſelfe
never ſo faire through thine own labour, yet cannot thy ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities
be waſhed away, nor thy ſin covered, for thy iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
are marked before the Lord, and thy ſin is written as with
a pen of iron, and as with the point of a Diamond, all thy
Steeple-houſe worſhip is nought but vanity before the Lord,
all thy publick exerciſes, all thy Sabboath keeping, all thy ſet
dayes of humiliation, and all thy private duties, and all that
ever thou performeſt unto God, is not regarded of him, while
the hearts of thy people is not aright in his ſight, and upright
before him. So the beſt of thy Sacrafices are but as the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
off of a dogs neck, and the offering of Swines blood, for
in thee is found the great abomination, open prophaneſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds,
and ſecret hypocriſie ſuper-abounds, and thou art as
abominable in the eyes of the Lord in thy hypocriticall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of righteouſneſſe, as thou art in thy open ſins.</p>
            <p>In thee is found the abomination of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> mercy and
truth, juſtice and true judgement is neglected: Doe not thy
Heads judge for reward? and doe not thy Prieſts preach for
hire? and doe not thy Prophets propheſie falſly? and doe
not they divine for money? and doe not thy People love to
have theſe things ſo? Oh how art thou deceived by thy Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
and led blind by the blind leaders, even they that lead
thee cauſe thee to erre, and they that ſhould inſtruct thee
teaches thee vaine things. Woe unto them, the Lords wrath
is againſt them? how doe they make a prey upon the people?
how doe they feed themſelves, and cloath themſelves, each
one of them having a quarter from which they ſeek their
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:118884:4"/>
gaine, and through covetouſneſſe making Merchandize of
ſoules; the falſe Prophets of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was their example, and
they follow in the path of unrighteo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uſneſſe, having run and
was never ſent of God, and therefore the people are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited
at all, nor turned to God, but from year to year, and
time to time, ever learning, but cannot come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the truth.</p>
            <p>Ignorance abounds in thy old men, and rudeneſſe, and
wildneſſe in thy youths, and thy people are without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of God, and periſhes for lack of knowledge; thou art
even as a wild untilled garden, which bringeth forth no pleaſant
fruit, thy vines are as the vines of <hi>Sodem,</hi> and thy fruit is
loathſome to the Lords taſt, wild grapes, and ſoure grapes is
brought forth in thee, which the Lord hath no pleaſure in, ye
bring forth fruit unto your ſelves, and not unto the Lord, ye
kindle a fire, and warmes your ſelves with your own ſparks,
ye ſacrafice to your own net, and ye think to be heard for
your much babling, and your many performances: Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of the firſt mans wiſdome is among you, it leads you,
and guides you, and not the Spirit of God, and through your
own wiſdome which is devilliſh you conforme to the Saints
words, and to their practiſes in outward appearance, and
makes your ſelves like the Saints, and bowes unto your own
Images, and likeneſſes which ye make, and are grown wiſe
and full of knowledge, but it is not the wiſdome of God, nor
the knowledge that will endure for ever, For you neglect
the one thing which onely needfull to eternall life. Your
buildings are high, but they are not upon the true foundation,
for many of you ſtumbles at the corner ſtone; your ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of Infants is a very cheat, and all that believe therein are
deceived; and your ſinging of <hi>Davids</hi> experiences in rime
and meeter, is a very lie unto you; your worſhip is but Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
and it will not cover you in the day of the Lord, though
none be like unto thee O <hi>London</hi> in profeſſion, nor any City
hardly can compare with thee, in reſpect of the Multitude of
thy gathered aſſemblies, and ſelf-ſeparates, yet all this will not
availe thee, when the Lord ſearcheth thy heart, which is
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:118884:5"/>
found not perfect before the Lord, but full of vaine glory,
and luſt, and pleaſures of the fleſh, and diſſimulation, and
guile, with the wrath of God will be revealed againſt; a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
and an upright heart, is of greater price with the Lord,
then all the performances of ſelfe-righteouſneſſe that is done
in thee, while your hearts are given to vanity, and continue
therein.</p>
            <p>Wherefore O <hi>London,</hi> this is a Warning to thee, Let thy
Inhabitants repent, the dreadfull day of the Lord is coming,
I have heard the voyce of war againſt thee, and not of peace,
the cry of howling, and bitter Lamentation, and not of gladnes,
nor joy of heart, what wilt thou doe in the day of thy viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
when the the Lord ſtretcheth forth his hand to ſmite
thee, to whom wilt thou flee, and where wilt thou be hid
when the Lord ſhewes himſelfe thy Enemy, and appears to
take an accout of thee, what will become of all thy treaſures,
how will thy vaine glory become a ſtink, how will the dayes
of thy mirth be turned into grievous ſorrow, in ſtead of thy
pleaſures, and delicacies, and mirth, and wantonneſſe, ſhall be
ſighing, and mourning, and wofull Lamentation, all thy
Gods ſhall not be able to deliver thee, nor all thy profeſſion
ſhall not juſtifie thee, nor all thy ſelfe-ſeparating people ſhall
not be able to ſtand in the gap to ſtay the hand of the deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
none of thy carved Images ſhall ſtay his fury, nor none of
thy ſeverall Sects ſhall be a Mountaine to hide thee, when the
Lord ſtrips thee naked, and layes thee bare, and gives thee to
know what is in thy heart, which will come upon thee in a day
not looked for.</p>
            <p>Wherefore repent all ſorts of people, and turne to the Lord

            <p>And all ye who thirſteth for the Lord, and deſireth after
the knowledge of his wayes, unto whom iniquity is a burden,
by you deſired to be freed from, who have long ſought the
Lord, and have not yet found him, who have prayed, and had
no anſwer, and have been weary, and heavy laden, and found
no reſt: I ſay unto you, Save your ſelves from this unto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
generation, come ye out of theſe abominations, that you
may be delivered from the wrath; Fear ye the Lord, and doe
not offend him in any thing, ſtand in awe, and tranſgreſſe not,
love righteouſnes and truth, touch no unclean thing, and the
Lord will receive you, meddle not with their worſhips, nor
bow not to their Images, nor ſacrifice not to their Idoll gods,
have no fellowſhip with them in their prophaneſſe, nor yet in
their hypocriſie, but hearken ye to the voyce of the Lord,
that you may know his judgements in your hearts, and his
Law and Covenant eſtabliſhed with you; depart from all ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
and caſt away all your Idolls, and forſake all your lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.
Give not your ſelves to the wayes and pleaſures of this
world, but give your ſelves to chaſtity, to ſoberneſſe, and
meekneſſe, and above all things be upright in heart towards
God, and towards man, ſpeak the truth one to another, and
let no guile dwell in your lips, nor a deceitfull tongue in your
mouth. And ceaſe from all vaine glory, and vaine cuſtomes,
and faſhions of the world, which are evill.</p>
            <p>And ceaſe from all Men-teachers, which deceives the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
by flattering words, who cries peace when the Lord hath
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:118884:6"/>
not ſpoken peace, and daubes with untempered Morter, ſuch
hath not profited you at all, but your ſoules are ſtarved under
your Miniſtry, and leanneſſe is upon you, though you ever
learne of them, yet you cannot come to the knowledge of the
truth by them. Ceaſe from them all, and from all your ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
and ſelfe-ſeparate Congregations, and waite upon the
Lord that you may know him to be your Teacher, who is the
Teacher of all his people, and he teacheth in the perfect way
of peace and truth, and gives peace unto all that waite upon
him, and cauſeth the heart of the upright to rejoyce, he taketh
away ſin, and removes it from his people, and he forgiveth
all their iniquities, and healeth all their back-ſlidings, and
bleſſed are all they that put their truſt in him, for he is a God
near at hand, for he dwells in his people, and he is worſhipped
onely in the Spirit, and in the truth. He dwells not in Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
made with hands, neither is he worſhipped in outward
obſervations, his ſoule hath no pleaſure among any ſelfe-ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
People, who cryes I am holier then another, neither is he
well pleaſed with a Sacrafice of the proud; all their Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmes,
and Fellowſhips, and Meetings, is but a wearineſſe to
the Lords ſoule, and he hath no pleaſure in any of their works,
who follows their own ſpirit, and are not led with the pure
Spirit of God alone, but unto every one of ſuch will he look,
who is poor in ſpirit, and of a contrite heart, and of a ſingle
and upright mind, he gives regard unto every one that feares
his Name, who thirſts and hungers after him in truth and
righteouſneſſe, and this is of exceeding great prize in the ſight
of the Lord, yea more then all offerings and oblations what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever,
even more then thouſands of rames, and ten thouſands
of river of Oyle. Therefore hearken diligently to the voyce
of the Lord, and ſeek him with an upright heart, and thirſt for
him as for your daily food, I oſe not your precious time, but
call upon his name while he is near, for he is come near unto
many; he ſtands at the door, if any will open, he will come
in, and will dwell with them for evermore.</p>
            <p>All ſorts of People be awakened, be awakened, how doth
the Lord wait to be gracious unto you, he even tarries for you
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:118884:6"/>
till you returne to him, that his ſoule may have pleaſure in
you, who hath long been grieved by you. Therefore ſearch
your own hearts, and ſee how you ſtand prepared to meet the
Lord by following of his Counſell, who hath ſo loved you,
and all man kind, that he hath given his Son into the world to
be a light unto you all, and every one of you is lightned by
him, and with the light you will know your evill deeds, and
are convinced of them, and reproved for them, and with this
Light Jeſus Chriſt calls you ſinners to Repentance, to turne
from your evills that you may be reſtored.</p>
            <p>If you love this Light, you love Chriſt, who will ſave you
from all your ſins, and from condemnation: If you hate this
Light you hate Chriſt, and you remaine in your ſins to be
everlaſtingly condemned. And thus is the way of life, and the
way of death ſet before you all: if you follow the light of
Chriſt Jeſus, it will teach you to deny this world, and all the
vanities of it, it will teach you to deny your own wills, and the
counſells of your own hearts, and whatſoever is contrary to
God in thought, word, or action, and in all things it will teach
to follow Jeſus Chriſt, that you may be juſtified by him; But
if you follow not the light, then you chuſe your own wayes
to follow your own wills, and your own luſts, and all tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and you deny Chriſt and the way of truth, and ſo the
wrath of God abides upon you, for you continue in unbeliefe,
and in hardneſſe of heart, and are the ſervants of ſin unto
death, if you follow not the light which Chriſt hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned
you withall, who lighteth every man that comes into
the world, that they may believe and be ſaved. Therefore
take heed to the light, if you be guided by it, you ſhall not
tranſgreſſe againſt God, but you will receive the power of
God to overcome all evill; all ſin and iniquity will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
in you, and your hearts will be made clean for the
Lord to dwell in, whoſe dwelling is in his people, and you
muſt all ceaſe from profeſſing of what you doe not poſeſſe,
and from talking of what you doe not enjoy, for that is hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifie,
and to be judged. So all ye Profeſſours be awakened,
Chriſt without you will not juſtifie you, except yee know
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:118884:7"/>
Chriſt within you, the Profeſſion of him will not take away
ſin, nor juſtifie in the ſight of God, except you come to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
the operation of his Spirit in you, and to teach you, from
all evill, and into all good.</p>
            <p>Therefore come to the feeling of the Spirit of Jeſus in you,
and the working of it, which changeth, reneweth, and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth,
and brings to witneſſe the ſame truth to be manifeſt in
the heart, which the Scripture ſpeaks of without; and as you
receive the ſame Spirit which gave forth the Scriptures, ſo
you will underſtand the Scriptures, and by no other means;
For all your Preaching, and talking of the Scriptures without
the Spirit is but vaine babling, and that mouth is to be ſtopt,
for God is not known where the operation of his Spirit is not
felt in the heart, nor he cannot be worſhipped in truth, but
where his Spirit leads and guides. Much vaine Profeſſion
ther's in thee O City, in which the Lord hath no delight: And
this is the Teſtimony of the Lord which I give concerning thee,
and doe yet once more call unto thee, as often I have done,
and doe ſeale the Lords Teſtimony againſt thee, even againſt
all thy righteouſneſſe, and againſt all thy ſin, which are both
alike unto God, and both to be condemned. Thou haſt been
warned, and thy people, and the day of a glorious Viſitation
hath paſſed over thee, the Lord hath reached unto many, and
ſtriked many who have not grieved, but careleſly walked, and
ſlighted the day of their viſitation, and have not hearkned to
the Lords call, unto thouſands hath the word of the Lord been
declared, and the Kingdome of God preached nigh at hand,
and the very way of life and death hath been ſet before you,
for the Lord hath ſent unto thee to warne thee, and to ſhew
unto thee what the Counſell of the Lord is; and thouſands
have been reached with the power of God, and convinced of
the way of life &amp; peace, who yet continues in hardnes of heart,
and diſobedience, following the counſell of their own heart,
and the deſire of their own minds, which are wholly evil conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually,
and the condemnation of ſuch will be juſt in the day of
the Lord, and greater then theirs to whom the way of the
Lord hath not been known. And yet amongſt thy thouſands
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:118884:7"/>
who are in the way to deſtruction, the Lord hath a remnant,
a few among ſo many, which are precious unto him, and
whom his ſoule delighteth in, who are deſpiſed in thee, and
ſet at nought, and caſt out of the favour of all men; yet is
the Lords preſence amongſt them, and his fear in their hearts,
and his encreaſe is unto them, and his power with them, till
all their enemies be vaniſhed as a cloud, for they are of the
true ſeed, and of the true birth, which the Lord will bleſſe,
though they be accounted as thy ſlaves, and bondmen, yet
are they free in the Lord; and this is the very fulfilling of thy
wickedneſſe, and the height of the tranſgreſſion of thy Rulers,
Teachers and People, in that ſome of them that feares the
Lord, and walks with him are perſecuted in thee, even they
are made a prey unto the wicked, to the ſlanderers, to the
drunkards, to the ſcorners, to unjuſt and cruell men, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the Lord are become a very prey in thee, even as meat
for the devourers. Oh what wilt thou do in the day of thy vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation,
when the righteous Judge numbers up theſe things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
thee? thyſtaffe ſhall faile thee, thy Phyſitians ſhall be
of no value, and all thy comforters ſhall be miſerable at that
day. I have truly conſidered thy condition, and meaſured thy
ſtate, and I have often ſeriouſly weighed thy wickedneſſe,
and pondered what would be the end thereof, and there is no
viſion of peace unto thee, but even the day of deſperate ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
a recompence for all thy works from the hand of the
Lord. I have often truly lamented thee, and ſeriouſly hath
thy condition entred into my heart, thy iniquities have often
preſſed my ſoule, and my Spirit hath been grieved within me,
when I have viewed thy great abominations, and how thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
in thee wholly periſh for lack of knowledge, and even
reſiſts, and will not be inſtructed, deſpightfully uſing ſuch as
doth warne them, even loving and delighting in their abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations;
Theſe things have often made my heart ſad, who
have walked in thee as a ſtranger, and meaſured thee with the
line of true judgement, and this is thy height, and length, and
depth, Iniquity lodgeth in thee, and Iniquity covers thee, and
Iniquity compaſſeth thee about.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:118884:8"/>
And this is a Warning to thee, from the Lord in faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
declared unto thee, whether thou reſiſt, or receive, and
thus far I am clear of the Blood of all men in thee, who ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not any thing in thee for my ſelfe, but ſeeketh, and hath
often, to the Lord for thee, that thy people might know him,
and worſhip him alone, who gives unto them all good things,
and hath cauſed the fulneſſe of all good Creatures to abound,
and hath given plenty of all things, abundance of which is
ſpent vainly upon the luſt, to the diſhonour of God who
gives it; how much is vainly ſpent upon vanity in meats, and
drinks, and apparell? Its hard to be declared what abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of the good creatures of God is vainely deſtroyed in
thee upon the luſt in the exceſſe, more then what ſatisfies pure
nature, your gluttony and high minds devoureth in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
the good creatures which God gives, and he is thereby
grieved with you, who hath taken notice of this your ſin,
which is not the leaſt of your tranſgreſſions, and he will plead
with you for it, even in all things great is your wickedneſſe,
and the Lord hath numbred it. And above all things that is
done in thee, thy deceitfull profeſſion and pretence of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of God, is the Lord moſt grieved with, who hates all
your Meetings of gathered aſſemblies, which is not gathered
by his Spirit, he will confound your wiſdome, and overthrow

not ſuch with whom you deale by feigned words of guile,
whilſt ſecret over-reaching lodgeth in your hearts, to make

for whatſoever is more is evill, and what is advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taged

you, or to your children; let the truth guide you in all your
dealings one with another, and let the fear of God be in your
hearts in all your enterprizes at Sea and Land. I warne you
all, ſeek not by any evill means to enrich your ſelves, neither
oppreſſe one another in any thing wherein you deale, for you
know not how long your time ſhall be upon earth, nor how
ſoon the day of account will come, wherein every word and
every work ſhall be brought to Judgement, yea for every idle
word ſhall ye give an account, and all thoſe words are idle
which are not ſpoken in the fear of the Lord, therefore live
and act in the fear of God, that you may be bleſſed in all that
you doe. And all ye whom the Lord hath bleſſed with riches
and increaſe, ſee that you abuſe not that which God hath
bleſſed you withall, but in all things that it be uſed to the
glory of the Lord, and not waſted in exceſſe upon the luſt of

               <p>And all ye handicrafts people, and labouring people, fear
