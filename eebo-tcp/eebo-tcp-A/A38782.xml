            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
CASE
OF
GEORGE EVELYN
OF
<hi>Wotton,</hi> in the County of <hi>Surrey,</hi> 
               <abbr>Esq</abbr>
            </head>
            <p>
               <hi>GEorge Evelyn</hi> having one Daughter and three Grand-Daughters
(the Children of his Eldest Son Deceased) but no Issue Male
living; did by his Deed in the Year 1692, <hi>(a) Uoluntarily</hi>
Settle his Estate of near Two Thousand Pounds <hi>per Annum</hi>
Value, to the Use of Himself for Life, without Impeachment of Wast,
with Remainder to his Brother <hi>Iohn Evelyn,</hi> and the Heirs Male of his
Body, with Remainder to <hi>Iohn Evelyn</hi> (Son of the said <hi>Iohn</hi>) and the
Heirs Male of his Body, and for default of such Issue, to the Use of
Himself, his Heirs and Assigns.</p>
            <p>In which Settlement, the full <hi>(b) Intention and Design</hi> of the said
<hi>George Evelyn,</hi> was to preserve the Premises, after his own Decease, to
his Brother and his Issue Male; but upon failure of such Issue Male, that
the same should assuredly Revert to his own right Heirs.</p>
            <p>And the said <hi>George Evelyn</hi> trusting and depending that his Brother
and Nephew would not take any Advantage from the said Voluntary
Settlement, further than was intended thereby, and relying upon their
Fidelity and <hi>(c) Gratitude</hi> therein, did not (as in Caution he might
have done) reserve to Himself, in the said Settlement, any Power of
Revocation; nor did Restrain the Uses to first, second, or other Sons of
his Brother in Tayl (as the Course is to do in like Cases) whereby to
hinder their destroying the said Settlement; of which they taking Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
(as the said <hi>George Evelyn</hi> hath now lately discovered) <hi>(d) In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,</hi>
after his Decease, to suffer a Recover of the Premises to barr the
said Reversion to his own Right Heirs, which being contrary to his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
he hath desired his said Brother to joyn with him in such a new
Settlement, as may effectually Secure the said Reversion to his right Heirs,
after his Decease, according to his true Intention. But the said <hi>Iohn Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyn</hi>
refusing to comply therewith, and designing to take Advantage of the
said Settlement (though voluntary) to defeat his right Heirs of the said
Reversion.</p>
            <p>Therefore the said <hi>George Evelyn</hi> beseecheth the Honourable
House of Commons, to give leave for bringing in a Bill,
for the new Setling and Securing his Estate, according to his
Intentions in the said Deed of Settlement (<hi>viz.</hi>) after his
own Decease, to his Brother and his Son, and their several
Sons successively in Tayl Male, in such manner, that upon
failure of such Issue Male, the Premises may revert to the
said <hi>George Evelyn</hi>'s own right Heirs, without any Power
of his Brother, or his Son to barr the same.</p>

            <head>REMARKS
ON THE
CASE.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>(a)</hi> THe Settlement having been <hi>Uoluntarily</hi> made so long since,
and no manner of Surprize or Mistake pretended, and the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
of the Family, with respect to the Issue of each
Brother, being exactly the same now, as when the Settlement was made,
'tis humbly hoped, there's no Reason for the Parliament to interpose in
this Matter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>(b)</hi> The <hi>Intention and Design</hi> of the Settlement plainly appear from
the Settlement it self, whereby <hi>Iohn Evelyn</hi> of <hi>Deptford,</hi> 
               <abbr>Esq</abbr> and <hi>Iohn</hi>
his Son have Estates Tayl successively limited to them, without any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint
of exercising the Powers belonging to such Estates.</p>
            <p>Besides, this Settlement was drawn by a Gentleman, whose Learning,
Experience and Integrity, are so well known, that it cannot be imagined,
but that the Settlement was made agreeable to the Instructions and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
of Mr. <hi>George Evelyn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to remove all manner of Doubt concerning Mr. <hi>George Evelyn</hi>'s In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
herein, He was, whilst this Conveyance was preparing, Advised,
and Importunately press'd by his Councel, to Reserve to himself a Power
of Revocation; but he reasonably suspecting what Clamours he might be
Subject to from his Grand Daughters (all which had been very largely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
for; yet one of them lately Marrying one Dr. <hi>Fulham,</hi> a Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
he has raised this Clamour after so many Years Satisfaction under
the Settlement) and also maturely considering the Circumstances of his
Family, positively refused to have any Restraint upon the Estates Tayl,
limited to his Brother and Nephew successively, as aforesaid.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>(c)</hi> There never has the least Reason yet appear'd for suspecting their
Gratitude, but 'tis humbly conceiv'd, 't will not be thought Reasonable,
that as an Evidence of their Gratitude, they should depart with an Estate
Tayl, and Fetter three Generations, by making Grandfather, Father and
Son, bare Tenants for Life, to Gratifie the Unreasonableness of Dr. <hi>Full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>(d)</hi> What Revelation Dr. <hi>Fulham</hi> has had of this Intention is not
known, but 'tis as certain no one Act has ever been done to create any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Distrust, as that there has never hapned any Variance in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
between the two Brothers for 60 Years and upwards, till Dr. <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s
Marrying into the Family, to whom onely this present Clamour is
to be attributed.</p>
            <p>'Tis most humbly Prayed that no such Bill may be brought
in and Pass'd.</p>
