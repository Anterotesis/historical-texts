         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

LETTER
Written from the TOWER by
Mr. Stephen Colledge
(the Proteſtant-Joyner) To
Dick Janeways Wife.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>
                  <hi>Dear</hi> Jane,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>MY Commitment was the more ſurprizing to me in that it broke
thoſe meaſures we had taken for a <hi>Rendezvouz</hi> that Evening,
where we were to repeat thoſe ſatisfactions Thee and I have often mn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
taſted from the ſolaces of <hi>Venus</hi> abroad, while <hi>Dick Janeway</hi> toil'd
contentedly upon his <hi>Mercury</hi> at home; I wiſh him better reward of his
Labour, then I am like to reap by mine.</p>
            <p>This place affords little pleaſure, beſides the ſweet thoughts of thy
Dear ſelf; and my Confinement is the more uneaſie to me, by the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilious
behaviour of my <hi>Warder:</hi> yet with the help of ſome yellow-boys,
and a few Tools, (both which I deſire Thee to ſend me) I hope to ſet
up to that Trade I ſo long neglected, and to become Scaffold, Block, and
Nine-pin-maker to the <hi>Tower.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Encourage thy <hi>Dick</hi> to go on, though I can no longer aſſiſt, in the
<hi>True Protestant Cauſe,</hi> yet he is hard enough for all their <hi>Obſervators,
Heraclitus,</hi> and other <hi>Tantivy-Scriblers;</hi> and (as I often told Thee) our
beſt Friends are ſtill behind the Curtain, <hi>Men</hi> whoſe Talent is declaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and that can out-bark all their <hi>Towzers,</hi> and out-do that She-Tory
<hi>Joa— Br—</hi> with all her <hi>Guns</hi> and <hi>Crack-farts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Had not this Commitment prevented me, I'le ſwear I was about a
piece that would have gone nigh to do their Job; I had Chalk'd out
my Deſign, and had Plain'd my Materials, and ſhould have Glew'd them
well together, and fitted it for <hi>Dick</hi>'s never-fading Paint.</p>
            <p>Return my thanks in the loweſt and moſt proſtitute manner to
Sh— <hi>B—l,</hi> (whom next to <hi>Alg. Syd.</hi> I eſteem as the chief Patron of
our Cauſe) for his <hi>True Protestant Ignoramus-Jury,</hi> which ſo honeſtly
diſcharg'd their Conſcience, and gave Verdict againſt thoſe ſeven Tory-Evidence.
Thou knowſt, 'tis in the <hi>mouth of two or three Witneſſes a Truth
ſhall be establiſh'd;</hi> doth it follow then, <hi>that ſix or ſeven ſhall do ihe ſame?</hi>
And thou knoweſt who teacheth when he holds forth, <hi>That for a few to
be Perjur'd for the benefit of the Nation, and True Protestancy, is not only
Venial, but a piece of Service becoming the Godly Party, and the favourers
of the</hi> Good Old Cauſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:105692:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
But I find that an <hi>Ignoramus</hi> in <hi>Middleſex,</hi> is no <hi>Dimittimus</hi> out of
this <hi>Limbo;</hi> and I fear thoſe at <hi>Oxford</hi> may ſpeak other Latine, and that
the Jury there may be, at this time, as <hi>Toryiſh</hi> as their <hi>Terre-filius:</hi> if ſo,
adieu <hi>Colledge!</hi> who promis'd my ſelf laſt <hi>March</hi> to ſurvive all my
Name-ſakes there, and to have ſeen them crumbled down with my
Axes and Hammers.</p>
            <p>Be ſure to convey away all Papers, Cuts, Draughts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſpecially that
of <hi>Mac-Cvt-throat,</hi> that repreſents the <hi>Oxford-Gownmen,</hi> and all the
<hi>Biſhops</hi> too, crouding with Father <hi>Patch</hi> to kiſs the Popes Toe, leſt
Goodman <hi>Hog</hi> ſeize them, as others did the Sack-full in the Hay-mow,
and leſt the Original of thoſe <hi>Tories</hi> and <hi>Abhorrers</hi> fall into ſuch hands
as will open ſome mouths wider againſt me at my Tryal. Which let it
come when it will, I hope to make a better bargain then that Gooſe-brain'd
<hi>Mac Fitz-Harys;</hi> though his Jury came ſhort of what was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
him, mine ſhall do more then I can deſire, and may help me out
with another <hi>Ignoramus.</hi> I'le never truſt Mongrel-Solicitor, nor ſhatter-brain'd
<hi>Whitaker,</hi> who thought his Law-quirks as much Treaſon-proof,
as I did my Mail and Blunderbuſſes, but will as fairly bring himſelf to
Bed, as he did his Client <hi>Fitz-Harys:</hi> I could play with other edg'd
Tools then mine own, and this Upholſterer can Hang himſelf, though
not his Room.</p>
            <p>I'le have no other Solicitors then thoſe <hi>True Proteſtants,</hi> that paſs like
Popes for Infallible, <hi>J—s, Win—n, T—y, W—p, Poll—n,</hi> and <hi>Smith,</hi>
who are the Pillars that muſt ſupport the <hi>Cauſe,</hi> and help me their Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion
at a dead lift. If three of them couid ſway five hundred, they may
eaſily cajole two or three Judges, whoſe Places they ſtand fair for next
Parliament. Theſe, dear <hi>Jane,</hi> muſt do the Job, and muſt not only talk
down the <hi>Biſhops-Court,</hi> but balder the World out of its Reaſon, and
muſt deny the King any Money, that they may have the more them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:
and 'tis not <hi>a few Millions</hi> that are yearly ſwallow'd up by our
Lawyers, Attorneys, and other half-ſtarv'd Green-bags and Petty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foggers;
'twas theſe that <hi>cow'd our Country-Gentry</hi> the laſt Parliaments,
and with a ſplay-mouth'd little Fanatical Hypocriſie, and a cramp Law-term,
appear'd as formidable as <hi>Gorgon</hi>'s Heads, and by their tickling and
noiſe became the <hi>Bell-weathers</hi> of the Flock, while the reſt were content
to bleat <hi>Amen</hi> to their Arbitrary Nonſenſe: But this to our ſelves. Above
all, retain our Friend <hi>Win—ton,</hi> who with a <hi>Good my Lord! and a peal
of Liberty and Property, Our</hi> All <hi>is at ſtake,</hi> can ſilence even Sir <hi>George,</hi>
or any other ſuch Gigantick <hi>Abhorrer,</hi> and will make more noiſe for a
grain of Popularity, then another for 5 <hi>l.</hi> and let him be Col. <hi>Pury</hi>'s
Cloak-boy, a bag ful of Nonſenſe, nay a dull man in <hi>Ignoramus;</hi> yet give
me one that will talk for my money, tho' I loſe my Cauſe; And tho' Judge
<hi>Jenkins</hi> (who knew them beſt) gives it as his Advice, and bids us (p. 138)
avoid the Lawyers of the Houſe of Commons, yet I muſt ſhortly put my
ſelf into their Clutches, as to a point of Law or two I intend to ſtart at my
Tryal; and let all <hi>True Protrstants</hi> pray for my good Deliverance. My next
ſhall be (if this Air, or that of <hi>Tyburn,</hi> choaks not my Muſe in the mean
time) in ſuch a ſtrain as pleaſed when thee and I uſed to meet at the
<hi>Swan;</hi> and ſo Adieu.</p>
            <q>
               <l>To the <hi>Cauſe</hi> and <hi>Thee</hi> moſt <hi>True</hi> I'le prove,</l>
