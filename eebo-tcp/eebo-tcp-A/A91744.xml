            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Acts 15. 20. becauſe amongſt them
it was judged a free and lawfull thing

prevail at <hi>Corinth,</hi> not only before their
embracing of Chriſtianity, as <hi>ver.</hi> 11. but
even after they had been taught by the

from the <hi>ſpecial arguments</hi> he furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
them with in this Chapter againſt it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That which alters the end and uſe

<hi>contrary uſe</hi> of the <hi>Body,</hi> then that for
which it was made, which was to be <hi>for
the Lord,</hi> dedicated to thoſe ſervices
wherein he ſhould imploy it. <hi>The body is
not for fornication, but for the Lord, and the
Lord for the Body, ver.</hi> 13. The Body for
the Lord to <hi>ſerve</hi> and <hi>honour</hi> him; and the
Lord forthe Body, to <hi>ſanctifie and ſave it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The body which is to <hi>be raiſed</hi> unto glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and which we hope ſhall be mede <hi>like
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:115628:7"/>

time to be conſpurcated and diſhonoured
with ſo <hi>impure</hi> a pollution. <hi>But God hath
raiſed up the Lord, and will us, v.</hi> 14.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Members of Chriſt</hi> ought not
to be made the members of an Harlot,
in as much as this is an high indignity unto
Chriſt, that ſo pure and holy an Head,
ſhould have ſo leaprous and filthy Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.
But our Bodies by the inhabitation
of the Spirit of Chriſt in us, are his <hi>mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi>
and therefore ſhould not be made
one fleſh with an Harlot, <hi>verſe</hi> 15, 16, 17.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That which <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap> this is more <hi>unnatural</hi>
and atrocious then other ſins, in that other
ſins do not terminate themſelvs in the body,
but go out unto other objects, is not to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.
But fornication brings a peculiar

that of the ſupreme Lord; <hi>Deriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi>

is twofold, the one by way of <hi>Dominion,</hi>
as when a man holdeth that which is truly

of his Lord; a <hi>Depoſitary,</hi> the goods of
him who entruſts him with the keeping of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:115628:8"/>
them. This premiſed, we ſay, 1. By
<hi>Original propriety</hi> none can call either him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
or any other thing, His <hi>own</hi> but <hi>only
God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 3 14.</note> who alone is the <hi>Fountain of all Being,</hi>

               <note place="margin">Rom 11. 36.</note> 
               <hi>and to him, are all things.</hi>

made all things for Himſelf, <hi>Proverbs</hi>
16. 4.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By <hi>Derivative propriety</hi> men have a
Right under God unto many good things:
There is a double grant made by God of
good things, one by way of <hi>general indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,</hi>
and ſo he <hi>hath given the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> earth to the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

in order to the good of our <hi>ſelves</hi> and <hi>others,</hi>

            <p>Again, There is a divine grant by way
of <hi>ſpecial grace and Covenant,</hi> and thus the
Lord hath given unto his peculiar people

            <p n="3">3. Again we have the Tenure and <hi>Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſsion</hi>

But this is not a <hi>poſſeſsion of Dominion,</hi> to

doth a man act as if he were <hi>His own,</hi> and
as if he had the Original <hi>Propriety,</hi> and

            <p>In the general I anſwer, when a man

doth exempt himſelf from all <hi>ſuperior juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,</hi>
will be <hi>ſubordinate</hi> unto none, and

unto none, will neither live to the
glory of God above him, or the uſe and

as it <hi>were alone,</hi> Iſa. 5. 8. And as if he had
a kind of Deity and ſufficiency within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
as <hi>Tyrus</hi> ſaid, <hi>I am a God, I fit in the
ſeat of God, and did ſet her heart as the heart
of God,</hi> Ezek. 28. 2. And as <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi>
ſaid, <hi>Is not this</hi> Babylon <hi>the great that I have

as <hi>Pharoah, Who is the Lord that I ſhould obey

            <p>But more particularly we ſhall reſolve
this queſtion in four propoſitions.</p>
            <p>A man then acteth and liveth, as if he

1. When a man makes his <hi>own Reaſon
his ſupreme Rule,</hi> reſolving as <hi>Joroboam</hi> did,
to follow what <hi>his own heart hath de viſed</hi> and
contrived, 1 Reg. 12. 33. <hi>Reaſon</hi> indeed

what is a Candle to the Sun-beam? unto

            <p>For ſtating of this point, we are to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh

there would not have been any need

            <p>And here, ſince that is a true ſaying of

               <hi>Pliny, Mala emptio exprobrat ſtultitiam,</hi>

1 A <hi>Right.</hi> 2. A <hi>Power</hi> to proſecute that
Right. The Right ſtandeth in two things.
1. In an ancient and <hi>original propriety</hi> to
the thing purchaſed. 2. In a <hi>Propinquity</hi>
thereunto.</p>
            <p>Chriſt hath a <hi>double</hi> claim and <hi>propriety</hi>
unto his people. 1 In the Right of his
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:115628:17"/>
               <hi>divine nature,</hi> and our <hi>Creation,</hi> becauſe
he made us. And we cannot by any frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulent
Contract of ours, deveſt him
of that original and inſeparable Right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his own Creatures: <hi>For by him all things
were created,</hi> Col. 1. 16. 2. In the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
Right of his <hi>Mediatorſhip,</hi> as head of
the Church, to whom we were given by
the Father, to be in ſuch manner recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
as he in his Commiſſion ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point.
He had a promiſe that he ſhould
ſee his ſeed: for there could not have been
a <hi>Redemption</hi> without the <hi>Conſent</hi> of the
perſon with whom the Contract was to be
made. In <hi>Election</hi> the Church was to be
<hi>given</hi> unto Chriſt, before in <hi>Redemption</hi>
he could <hi>purchaſe</hi> it unto himſelf.</p>
            <p>And as Chriſt had thus a propriety to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
his people, ſo he was to Redeem them
<hi>Jure propinquitatis:</hi> for the Apoſtle alludes
to the uſage in the Old Teſtament, where
he who redeemed, and brought back an
alienated Inheritance unto the family a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
was to be a <hi>near Kinſman, Lev. 25.
25. Ruth</hi> 4. 3, 4. Chriſt therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming
us, and recovering the eſtate for
us which we ſold away, was to be our
kinſman, that he might have the <hi>Right
of Redemption:</hi> for he that <hi>ſanctifieth, and
they that are ſanctified, are all one, Heb.</hi> 2. 11.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:115628:18"/>
Sinne was to be <hi>condemned in our fleſh,
Rom.</hi> 8. 3. It behoved him to be <hi>like unto
his brethren,</hi> that he might be a mercifull
and faithfull high Prieſt.</p>
            <p>Whence we ſhould learn as Brethren,
to do all offices of love, and of helpfulneſs
unto one another, to reſtore one another,
to bear one anothers burdens, becauſe we
are all of <hi>one blood, Acts 17. 26. Gal.</hi> 6. 1.
So that whatever ſervices we do to any, we
do it to <hi>our own fleſh,</hi> as the Prophet ſpeaks,
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 58. 7.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> But beſides a Right of Redemption there
is required a <hi>Power</hi> to actuate and execute
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> that <hi>Right.</hi> And this power is two-fold:
A Power of <hi>Authority,</hi> derived from that
Commiſſion and Command given unto
Chriſt to execute all Judgement: Of
which Commiſſion we read, <hi>John 5. 22.
John 10. 18, 34, 35, 36. Mat. 28. 18.
Heb. 10. 7,—9.</hi> 2 A power of <hi>ſtrength</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               <hi>and vigour,</hi> to do and ſuffer the things
commanded. In which reſpect Chriſt is

than the ſtrong man, <hi>able to ſave</hi> to
the uttermoſt thoſe that come unto God

brought about by the Exinanition of
the Sonne of God,<note place="margin">Aug. de Trin l 13 c 10 Ber Epiſt 190</note> and the humbling
of him to our Curſe: for though the Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent
Lord wanted not other means
to have wrought this deliverance; yet
herein hath he magnified his Power,
Wiſdome, Juſtice, Mercy and Love, in
doing it by the Incarnation and Suffering
of his Eternal Sonne: That as the firſt
<hi>Adam</hi> made us <hi>ſinners in ſemine,</hi> ſo the
Second make us <hi>Righteous in ſanguine.</hi> To
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:115628:22"/>
Adore the <hi>freeneſs of it,</hi> in that he came
unſought to ſeek, as well as to ſave,
<hi>Luke</hi> 19. 10. And the <hi>Diſcrimination</hi>
which is therein made between us and
Angels; for he took not the nature of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
but the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> Heb. 2. 16.
Though the Devil <hi>in Coelo in tumuit, ego in

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. To admire the <hi>Severity</hi> of <hi>divine Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,</hi>
which would not ſuffer ſin to go unpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed,
or the ſentence of death againſt it
unexecuted, though it were in his own Son.
The unſearchableneſs of <hi>divine Mercy,</hi>

depth of <hi>divine Wiſdome,</hi> in find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out a way to puniſh the ſinne, and to

that was eternal, to be <hi>made;</hi> Him that
was impaſſible, to <hi>ſuffer;</hi> Him that was
Lord of life, to <hi>die:</hi> to make our nature
in that perſon pay a debt, which all the

            <p n="3">3. To believe and apply the comfort of

Without it I am a captive to ſinne and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,

            <p>But now by the Redemption which
Chriſt hath wrought, God is placable,
ſinne pardonable; the ſoul curable, the

Mercy, and I refuſe it? Am I bought

May I not venture to believe? May I not

I will be <hi>ſervant to him</hi> that bought me,
that as he hath by his <hi>blood</hi> purchaſed

            <p>I will glorifie him in <hi>my Spirit,</hi> by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal

            </p>
            <p>Thus if we glorifie him in body and

ſpirit in a way of obedience; He will at
