         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of the States General of
the United Provinces againſt
His Majeſty, and this Nation
have been ſo inſupportably
Inſolent, that the Parliament not long ſince,
upon the Cry of the whole Nation, did ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licite
him to take ſome extraordinary way to
give Redreſs unto his Subjects for the many
and daily Injuries they ſuſtained from them
by their Depredations at Sea, for the Horrid
and Barbarous Cruelties inflicted on them in
the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> which being as
<pb facs="tcp:51477:6"/>
odious in their Nature, as they are remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable
in their Number, have been the onely
Cauſe that theſe pains are taken to give a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
ſatisfaction to the World, by exhibiting
this Brief, but moſt true Account of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
Undoubted Right, and ſole Propriety
in the <hi>Engliſh, Scottiſh,</hi> and the <hi>Iriſh
Seas:</hi> A truth as Antient, as it is Eminent,
and not only held forth and atteſted by the
Laws of our Land, and the Records of the
Tower, and the High Courts of Parliament,
but heretofore confeſſed alſo by divers of
their own Nation, as in this Book you ſhall
find it faithfully repreſented to you; But
it hath been the late practiſe of the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
(without examining the Lawfulneſs of
the Act) to put their Oares into every Boat,
where Gain and Profit doth appear. It was
this, that tempted them to invade the Iſlands
of <hi>Moluccos, Lantore,</hi> and <hi>Polleroon,</hi>
which in the Name of the Crown of <hi>England</hi>
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> for ſome years had poſſeſſed,
neither did they entertain the leaſt jealouſie
of oppoſition from the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> who they
knew heretofore had been oblidged to them
for many antient good Offices in a time, when
their greateſt ſafety did depend upon them,
and who lately were conjoyned with them in
<pb facs="tcp:51477:6"/>
a ſtrict Alliance and Confederacy for Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerſhip
in the <hi>Eaſt-Indie</hi>-Trade, in the year
1619. Neither did they fear the Natives,
whom they found to expreſs a greater Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of good will unto them then to the
<hi>Hollanders,</hi> for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> aimed at no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more, then a lawful and competent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
by Commerce and Traffick with the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
and the <hi>Dutch;</hi> And though in ſome
places the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had erected ſome Forts,
and ſetled ſome Strength, yet it was not by
any Force or Violence, nor againſt the good
will of the People of the Country, but with
their own good liking, and conſent, for the
better ſecurity of their Trade, and upon the
voluntary ſubmiſſion of the Natives to the
Obedience and Soveraignty of the Crown of
<hi>England,</hi> in which ſubmiſſion the Antient
Laws and Liberties of the ſaid Natives, and
all their own Immunities were comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and reſerved: In this Eſtabliſhment the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> did conceive themſelves to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
enough; when behold the <hi>Dutch</hi> (who
would be no better Neighbours to us in the
<hi>Indies</hi> then in <hi>Europe</hi>) began to quarrel
with us, and to hinder us in our Trade to
free Places, the which the better to obtain,
they oftentimes ſeized upon our Ships, and
<pb facs="tcp:51477:7"/>
Goods, and finding this violence not to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
their Expectation, they at the laſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived
to make themſelves the abſolute
Masters of the vaſt profits of thoſe Places;
In the purſuit whereof, they have razed and
demoliſhed the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Forts, and laying
violent hands on the <hi>Engliſh</hi> themſelves,
who made not the leaſt Reſistance; they have
tyed them to ſtakes with Ropes about their
Necks; they have ſeized upon their Goods,
they have Impriſoned their Perſons, they
have Whipped them at the Poſt in the open
Market Place, and having waſhed their
torn and wounded Bodies with Vinegar and
Salt, they have again doubled their ſcourges
to multiply their Torments; they have drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
them from thence to places almoſt inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſible,
by reaſon of their ſteepneſs and
roughneſs, and having thrown them down the
Rocks, if any Sence of life remained, they
have added new oppreſſion to their weary
and bruiſed limbs, by the heavy weights of
Iron; To theſe deliberate Torments the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties
of other Nations are but Courteſies,
and Death it ſelf a Mercy; And as if they
were the abſolute Lords in the <hi>Indies</hi> they
have aſſumed a Power to themſelves in the
deciding of the controverſies between the
<pb facs="tcp:51477:7"/>
               <hi>Engliſh</hi> and the <hi>Indians</hi> for matters paſſed
quite out of their juriſdiction, and when Law
and Right have pleaded againſt them, they
have Executed their Decrees by violence.
Theſe be they who have laid a claim to His
Maieſties Intereſts on his own Brittiſh Seas,
and rather then allow them proper unto Him,
they have declared them common unto All:
At the firſt they begged leave for their Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Seas, which being grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them by the accuſtomed Indulgence of our
Princes, they have ſo preſumed upon their
lenity, that at the laſt they have made a Law
in their own Country, That the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhal
Sell no white Herrings, nor other Fiſh there
upon penalty of Confiſcation; They are Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Seas from <hi>June</hi> unto
<hi>November,</hi> and ſeem there to dwel amongſt
the Fiſh for 26 weeks together, in which
time the havock which they make in destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Spawn and Fry of Fiſh that comes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

Before we ſhall inſiſt on theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions,
We ſhall in the firſt place,
remove ſome Objections that may be
made againſt them: Some are drawn
from the Freedome of Commerce or
Traffique, which by many are affirmed
to be ſo Naturall, that they can no
where be aboliſhed by any Law or
Cuſtome, and that by the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
it is unjuſt to Deny Merchants
the Benefit of Commerce and Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</p>
            <p>Other Objections are drawn from the
Nature of the Sea it ſelf, for it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
alleaged that the Sea is altered,
and ſhifted every Moment, and the
State thereof, through a continued ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
of new waters, alwayes uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
and remains ſo little the ſame in
all things, (the Channel onely exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted)
that it is impoſsible it ſhould
ever be retained in the Poſſeſsion of
any One Particular.</p>
            <p>As to the firſt, It is eaſie to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by the Ancient Interpreters of the
<hi>Moſaical</hi> Law,<note place="margin">Lyren. ad <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

as capable of Private Dominion,
as the Land; The Words of GOD in
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51477:12"/>
the Book of <hi>Numbers</hi> are expreſs; <hi>And
let your Borders be the Great Sea;</hi> that is,
ſay the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> the main Ocean, and
its Iſles; And it is plainly to be proved,
that a Private Dominion of the Sea no
otherwiſe then of Land aroſe from
humane Diſtribution:<note place="margin">Dion. lib<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 36.</note> We read, that
<hi>Pompey</hi> the Great, being Maſter of a
Huge Navy, had a Commiſsion given
him from the Senate, as abſolute Lord
of the Sea; The like had <hi>Mark Anthony</hi>
ſome few years after him; And many
of the Roman Hiſtorians have called
the Sea, their Sea; becauſe it was
wholly ſubdued to the Roman Power.</p>
            <p>We might here alleage many Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
how long the <hi>Lidians,</hi> the <hi>Phygi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
the <hi>Rhodians,</hi> the <hi>Phaenicians,</hi> and
many other Eaſtern Nations, one after
another have been Lords of the Sea:
Thy Borders are in the midſt or heart
of the Sea ſaith the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> of
the <hi>Tyrians: Quintus Curtius</hi> affirmeth,
that the City of <hi>Tyre</hi> builded by <hi>Agenor,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chron. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non. <hi>p.</hi> 128.</note>
made not onely the neighbouring Sea,
but what Seas ſoever her ſhips ſayled
into, to be of her Dominion: There
was an ancient cuſtome uſed in the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51477:13"/>
Eaſt, that when Great Kings had a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
to bring any Nation under their
Power, they commanded Water, and
Earth, the pledges of Empire and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
to be delivered unto them,
conceiving that the Command of the
Sea, as well as the Land was ſignified
by ſuch a token.</p>
            <p>The like may be affirmed of the
Weſt,<note place="margin">Florus, lib. 2. cap. 6.</note> for both <hi>Polybeius,</hi> and <hi>Appian</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
that the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Command of the Sea without
all Controverſy, as received from
their Anceſtors; And if we take a view
of theſe late Times, as to the Rights
and Cuſtomes of other Nations, which
at this preſent are in high Reputation,
we ſhall finde that the Common-Wealth
of <hi>Venice</hi> have enjoyed the
Dominion of the <hi>Adriatick</hi> Sea for
many Ages: The <hi>Tuſcans</hi> to this day
have an Abſolute Dominion in the
<hi>Tyrhene</hi> Sea, and thoſe of <hi>Genoa</hi> in the
<hi>Lyguſtick;</hi> the like we may alledge of
the <hi>Danes,</hi> the <hi>Swedes,</hi> and the People
of <hi>Norway;</hi> And to conclude, that the
Dominion of the Sea is admitted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
thoſe things that are lawfull,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51477:13"/>
and received into the Cuſtomes of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
is ſo far from contradiction,
that nothing at all can be found to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troule
it in the Cuſtonies of our latter
Times, unleſſe it be by ſome, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Borderers upon the Sea-Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of others, do ſtrive to violate the
Rights of their Neighbours, under the
pretenſe of Civil Community.</p>
            <p>Now as to the Objection concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Freedome of Commerce and
Paſſage pretended to be common to
All; It is moſt evident from the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes
of all Times, that Commerce,
and Free Paſſage hath ever been ſo li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
by Princes in their Territories,
that it is either permitted, or prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
according to the various Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Publick Good. Princes
are concerned to be wary and carefull,
that they admit no ſuch Strangers or
Commerce where the Common-Wealth
may receive any Damage
thereby: And <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> plainly and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
ſaith,<note place="margin">Ariſto. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lit. lib. 7. cap. 6.</note> That proviſion ought to
be made by Lawes, with whom Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
may, or may not converſe: More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
it is commonly provided in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51477:14"/>
Leagues, that it ſhall not be lawfull
for either Party to ſayle into each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Ports, Coaſts, or Harbours with
ſuch a number of Ships, as may give a
juſt occaſion of Fear or Jealouſie that
Force is intended; except leave be firſt
had of that Party under whoſe Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
thoſe Places are, or unleſs they
be driven thither by Tempeſt, or other
Neceſſity, to avoid a greater Force, or
the Danger of Shipwrack: And to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
<hi>Bodine</hi> affirmeth, That it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to prohibite any Forreigner from
entring the Borders, and alſo to force
him out, if he hath entred the Borders,
not only if a War be on foot, but alſo
in Time of Peace, that the Priviledges,
Safety, and Welfare of the Inhabitants
may not be corrupted by converſation
with Strangers.</p>
            <p>As to that Objection concerning the
uncertainty of the Sea, which (it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged)
doth render it unfit for private
Dominion, becauſe it is ever in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and in no wiſe remains the ſame:
Suppoſe we grant that it be ſo flowing,
as is uſualy ſaid of the moſt Northernly
Seas;<note place="margin">Strabo. Geograp. lib. 1.</note> yet certainly the Channels, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51477:14"/>
Places through which the waters flow
remain ever the ſame, although the
waters themſelves do ſhift, and change
continually. In the <hi>Germane</hi> Empire,
(according to the Civil Law) Rivers
are all of them of Publick Uſe, yet for
all that, they are reckoned in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours
private Patrimony,<note place="margin">Seneca Ep. 39.</note> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the Royalties belonging to his
Exchequer; So that the Emperour, or
others by his Grant, have a yearly
Revenue out of the Fiſheries in them;
Neither is there any thing more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
then an Aſſerting of the Private
Dominion of Rivers, in the Lawes of
<hi>France, Spain, Poland,</hi> and <hi>Venice,</hi> and, in
a word, of all Nations whoſe Cuſtomes
are known; ſeeing therefore that a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
and Propriety of Rivers hath
been every where acknowledged, why
ſhould it not in the like manner be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged,
that there may be Ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of any Sea whatſoever? Since the
always running and flowing Nature of
water can no more hinder a Dominion
in the one, then in the other, for the
Rivers themſelves are but little Seas;
as the Sea it ſelf, to its fluide Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:51477:15"/>
is but a River, the one differing
only in bignes from the other; and ſo it
hath been taken by the Antients; In the
very Hiſtory of the Creation, all the
Gatherings together of the waters are
called Seas: Many Lakes have been
called Seas;<note place="margin">Luke 5. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Tiberias</hi> by St. <hi>Luke</hi> is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
a Lake, but by the other Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts
a Sea. <hi>Aſphaltites</hi> is by <hi>Pliny, Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
and others, termed a Lake, but by
<hi>Moſes</hi> in the Fourteenth of <hi>Geneſis, the
Salt Sea,</hi> and by moſt of the late Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<hi>the Dead Sea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They indeed, who make uſe of ſuch
frivolous ſubtilties, as theſe to oppoſe
the Dominion of the Sea deſerve to be
turned over to the Phyloſophers, <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raclitus</hi>
and <hi>Epicharmus,</hi> who taught
that every thing is ſo altered, changed,
and renewed, that nothing in this
World continues the ſame, as it was
in the inſtant immediately going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
Our Bodies (ſaith <hi>Seneca</hi>) are
hurried like Rivers; whatſoever thou
ſeeſt, runneth with Time; Not one of
all thoſe things that are viſible contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth;
I even whileſt I ſpeak of theſe
changes am changed my ſelf: But let
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:51477:15"/>
ſuch men as dream that the fluide In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant
Nature of the Sea diſproves
the private Dominion of it, entertain
the ſame opinion if they pleaſe with
theſe Men, and then they muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsity
grant alſo, that themſelves are
not Owners or Poſſeſſors, of Houſes,
Lands, or Money, or any other thing
whatſoever.</p>
            <p>As to that Argument, that the water
is open to All, and therefore by Law,
it muſt lye open at all times to all men,
it is a very trifling Argument. Before
the firſt Diſtribution of things, there
was no Land which did not lye open
unto All before it came under particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Poſſeſsion: In many places payment
is made for the uſe of water; as amongſt
the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> they have in <hi>Delph-Land</hi>
a Cuſtome, called, <hi>Jus Grutae,</hi> which
hath ever been under the care of thoſe
Officers, called in <hi>Dutch, Pluymgraven,</hi>
whereby the Beer-Brewers are obliged
to pay them the hundreth part for the
uſe of the water.</p>
            <p>Some men may here object that ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Antonius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Forcus in cap. Juris. cap. 9.</note> 
               <hi>I am Sovereign of the
World, but the Law is Sovereign of the Sea.</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:51477:16"/>
The True and Genuine ſenſe of thoſe
words is this, I am Lord of the World,
becauſe I Govern the World by my
own Law; but the <hi>Rhodian</hi> Law, is the
Law of the Sea, becauſe by this Law <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice</hi>
is adminiſtred on the Sea; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let this caſe of <hi>Eudaemon</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Navigation be determined by the
<hi>Rhodian</hi> Law, ſo far as none of our
Lawes doth oppoſe the ſame. There
is no man unleſſe he will renounce his
own Reaſon, who will affirme, that
any Denial is made of the Dominion
of the Sea in that Anſwer, or that the
leaſt Tittle can be found in it againſt
the Dominion thereof.</p>
            <p>Having thus in general given you an
account, that almoſt amongſt all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
there hath been allowed a Private
Dominion of the Sea; we ſhall now

him being too obſcured with Fables;
but at his coming we finde many clear
paſſages of the <hi>Brittains</hi> Dominion of
the Sea flowing about them, eſpecially
the South and Eaſt part thereof, as a
perpetual Appendant of the Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Iſland; For at that time,
they not onely uſed the Sea as their
own, for Navigation, and Fiſhing, but
alſo permitted none, beſides Merchants
to ſayle into the Iſland without their
leave; nor any Man at all to view, or
ſound their Sea-Coaſts, or their Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours:
And though at <hi>Caeſars</hi> firſt Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val,
they were Terrified with the ſight
of his long ſhips beaked with Braſs or
Iron; and they fled to the ſhore, and
from it to the In-lands, being not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
provided for ſuch a Sea-fight as
was then at hand, and which they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
had been acquainted with, yet
moſt certain it is, that they had Veſſels
of their own in which they uſed to
Coaſt about the Neighbouring Seas:
And though mention is made by Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
that commonly they were framed
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51477:17"/>
with Twiggs (as the faſhion then was
in the more Antient Nations) and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
with Oxe-Hides; yet with good
ground we may conceive, that they
were wont to Build, and ſet forth ſhips
of War; of a far more commodious,
and ſolid ſubſtance, for the Guarding
of the Seas, and the Iſles: We read
in <hi>Caeſar's</hi> Commentaries,<note place="margin">De Bello Gallico. lib. 9.</note> that they
were ſtrong at Sea, and it is not to be
doubted, but that beſides their Twiggs
and Leathern Veſſels, they had a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
Navy which was able at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
to Encounter the ſhips of their
Neighbours that were beſt Armed:
But the Southernly Parts of <hi>Great Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>
being Invaded by the Emperour

            <p>From the Dominion of the <hi>Brittiſh</hi>

have proceeded amongſt thoſe who

the Sea to be a part of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion:
For placing himſelf by the
Sea ſide in the time of a High Tide up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Southampton</hi> ſhoare, he is reported
to have made tryal of the Obedience
of the Sea in this manner; <hi>Thou, O Sea
art under my Dominion, as the Land alſo
which I ſit upon is mine; And there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
any that diſobeyed my Command with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Puniſhment; Therefore I command thee
not to aſcend upon my Land, nor do thou
preſume to wet the Feet or Garments of Thy
Sovereign:</hi> But although the Event
did not anſwer his Expectation, yet
moſt plain it is, that here he openly
profeſſed himſelf to be Sovereign of

            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:51477:19"/>
From the Teſtimonies of the <hi>Saxons</hi>
and <hi>Danes,</hi> we ſhall Deſcend to the
Government of the <hi>Normans;</hi> where by
many Notable and Cleer Proofs we
ſhall finde; That</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Cuſtody, Government, or
Admiralty of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Sea did belong
unto the King, together with the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
of the Adjacent <hi>Iſlands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That the Leave of Paſſage through

            <p n="3">3. That the Liberty of <hi>Fiſhing,</hi> was

given to the Fiſher-men.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That Laws, and Limits were
Preſcribed to Forreigners; who being
in Hoſtility the one with the other,

<hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the Firſt, There is nothing
more Cleer, than that the Kings of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:51477:20"/>
               <hi>England,</hi> have been Accuſtomed to
Conſtitute Governours, or Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
who had a Charge to Guard the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Seas, and theſe were called
<hi>Cuſtodes Navium,</hi> or <hi>Cuſtodes Maritimi.</hi>
Theſe were the Officers that were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Butſecarli,</hi> as may be gathered out
of that Breviary of <hi>England,</hi> called
<hi>Doomes Day:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rot. Pat. 48. <hi>Hen.</hi> 3.</note> In this Number was <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas

We finde that in the days of <hi>Edward</hi>
the third; The Principal End of Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
that Parliament, was concerning
the Preſervation of Peace, both by
Land and Sea; giving us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
that the Land and Sea together
made one entire Body of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of <hi>England.</hi> In the time of
<hi>Richard</hi> the Second,<note place="margin">2. Rich. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Hugh Calverley</hi> was
made Admiral of the Sea, ſaith the

            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:51477:20"/>
And that the Dominion of the Seas,
is properly in the Power and Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the King, may appear by thoſe
Tributes and Cuſtomes that were Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
and Payed for the Guard and
Protection of them; The Tribute cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the <hi>Danegeld,</hi> was paid in the Time
of the <hi>Engliſh Saxons,</hi> which amounted
to four ſhillings upon every Hide of
Land, for the defending of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
by Sea.<note place="margin">Annal. 1. part, page 276.</note> 
               <hi>Roger Houerden</hi> affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
that this was paid until the Time
of King <hi>Stephen.</hi> Afterwards Subſidies
have been demanded of the People in
Parliament, upon the ſame Account;
and in the Parliament-Records of King
<hi>Richard</hi> the Second, it is Obſervable;
That a Cuſtome was impoſed upon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Ship that paſſed through the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern</hi>
Admiralty, that is, from the
<hi>Thames</hi> along the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Shoare of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
towards the <hi>North-Eaſt,</hi> for the
Maintenance of a Guard for the Seas.
Neither was this Impoſed onely upon
the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> but alſo upon the Ships of
Forreigners, payment was made at
the Rate of ſix pence a Tun upon every
Veſſell that paſſed by, ſuch Ships only
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:51477:21"/>
excepted, that brought Merchandize
out of <hi>Flanders</hi> into <hi>London.</hi> If a Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel

it payed the Rate of Six pence a week
upon every Tun; If for other kind of
Fiſh, ſo much was to be payed every
three weeks, as they who brought
Coles to <hi>London</hi> from <hi>New-Caſtle,</hi> paid
it every three Moneths; But if a Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel

or Dominion of the Kings of
<hi>England</hi> by Sea, pointed out in very
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:51477:22"/>
Expreſſe Words for very many years;
We may add to this, that it can be
proved by words plain enough in the
form of the Commisſions, for the
Command of High Admiral of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
that the Sea for whoſe Defence
he was appointed by the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
who is Lord and Sovereign of it,
was ever bounded towards the <hi>South</hi> by
the Shores of <hi>Aquitain, Normandy,</hi> and
<hi>Picardy;</hi> for although thoſe Countries
ſometimes in the Poſſesſion of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
are now loſt, and for many years
under the Juriſdiction of the <hi>French,</hi>
yet the whole Sea Flowing betwixt
our <hi>Brittiſh Iſles,</hi> and the Provinces o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
againſt them, are by a Peculiar
Dominion and Right of the King of
<hi>England</hi> on thoſe Seas, ſubject unto
them whom he puts in Command o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet and Coaſts, that
there remaineth neither Place nor
Uſe for any other Commanders of that
kinde: And as for the <hi>Iſlands</hi> of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſey,
Jerſey,</hi> and the reſt; Mr. <hi>Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>
affirmeth, that before a Court of
<hi>Delegats</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> in expreſſe terms it
hath been acknowledged, that the King
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51477:22"/>
of <hi>England</hi> hath ever been Lord, not
onely of this Sea,<note place="margin">Seld. Mare Clauſum page 334.</note> but alſo of the <hi>Iſlands</hi>
placed therein, <hi>Par raiſon du Royalmed'
Angleterre,</hi> upon the Account of the
Realm of <hi>England,</hi> or as they were
Kings of <hi>England;</hi> And in the Treaty
held at <hi>Charters,</hi> when <hi>Edward</hi> the
Third Renounced his Claim to <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy,</hi>
and ſome other Counties of
<hi>France</hi> that bordered upon the Sea; it
was added, that no Controverſie ſhould
remain touching the <hi>Iſlands,</hi> but that
he ſhould hold all <hi>Iſlands</hi> whatſoever
which he Poſſeſſed at that time, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they lay before thoſe Countries y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
he held there, or others; For Reaſon
required this, that he ſhould maintain
his Dominion by Sea; And both <hi>Gerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey</hi>
and <hi>Jerſey,</hi> as well as the <hi>Iſles</hi> of
<hi>Wight</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> in ſeveral Treaties
held betwixt the Kings of <hi>England</hi> and
other Princes, are acknowledged not
onely to lye neer unto the Kingdome
of <hi>England,</hi> but to belong unto it.</p>
            <p>But to give a greater Light to this
Truth, we may from ſeveral Records
produce many Teſtimonies; that the
Kings of <hi>England</hi> have given leave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:51477:23"/>
to Forreigners upon Requeſt to paſſe
through their Seas, he gave per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misſion
to <hi>Ferrando Vrtis de Sarachione</hi> a
<hi>Spaniard,</hi> to Sail freely from the Port of
<hi>London</hi> through his Kingdomes, Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
and Juriſdiction, to the Town
of <hi>Rochel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are Innumerable Letters of
ſafe Conducts in the Records,<note place="margin">Rot. Fran. 5 <hi>Hen.</hi> 4.</note> eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth, and Sixth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
ſafe Port and Paſſage was uſually
granted; And it is worthy of obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that theſe kinde of Letters was u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually
ſuperſcribed, and directed by
thoſe Kings to their Governours of the
Sea-Admirals, Vice-Admirals, and Sea-Captains,.
And to clear all at once,
the Kings of <hi>England</hi> have ſuch an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
Dominion in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Seas,
that they have called the Sea it ſelf
their Admiralty. And this we finde in
a Commisſion of King <hi>Edward</hi> the
Third; The Title whereof is, <hi>De Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vibus
Arrestandis &amp; Capiendis,</hi> For the
Arreſting and Seizing of Ships: The
Form of it runs in theſe Words; <hi>The
King to his beloved</hi> Thomas de Wen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock
<hi>his Serjeant at Armes, and Lievte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:51477:23"/>
To our Beloved and Truſty</hi> Reginald
de Cobham, <hi>Admiral of our Fleet of Ships
from the mouth of the River of</hi> Thames,
<hi>towards the</hi> Weſtern <hi>parts Greeting: Be
it known unto you, that we have appointed
you with all the ſpeed that may be uſed by
you, and ſuch as ſhall be Deputed by you; to
Arreſt and Seize all Ships, Flie-Boats,
Barks, and Burges of ten Tun burthen and
upwards, which may happen to be found in
my foreſaid ADMIRALTY (that is,
in the Sea, reaching from the</hi> Thames
<hi>Mouth, towards the South and Weſt) and to
bring them ſpeedily, well, and ſufficiently
Armed to</hi> Sandwich, <hi>&amp;c. All Officers
alſo in the ſaid</hi> Admiralty, <hi>are Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to yeild Obedience and Aſſiſtance upon
the ſame Condition; Thus, That the Sea it
ſelf was contained under the Name of the</hi>
Admiralty, <hi>is moſt clearly manifeſt, by what
already we have ſhown you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as a Freedome of Paſſage, ſo
alſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we do finde, that a Liberty of
Fiſhing hath been obtained by Petition
from the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
made mention, that King <hi>Richard</hi>
the Second, impoſed a Tribute up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all perſons whatſoever that uſed
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:51477:24"/>
Fiſhing on his Seas. We read alſo,
that <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth,<note place="margin">Rot. Fran. 38 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6.</note> gave leave to the
<hi>French,</hi> and other Forreigners, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
for a Year, ſometimes but for
ſix Moneths, to go and Fiſh through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
his Seas, provided that the Fiſhing-Boats
and Buſſes, were not above thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Tuns; And if any Forreigners, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>French, Dutch</hi> or others, ſhould
Diſturb or Moleſt any of the Kings
Subjects as they were Fiſhing, they
were to looſe the benefit of their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence.</p>
            <p>But in the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Sea which waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the Coaſts of <hi>York-ſhire,</hi> and the
Neighbouring Counties; It hath been
an Antient Cuſtome for the <hi>Hollanders</hi>
and <hi>Zelanders</hi> to obtain leave, by Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioning
to the Governour of <hi>Scarbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough</hi>
Caſtle. It is worth the while,
ſaith the Reverend Mr. <hi>Cambden,</hi> to
obſerve what an extraordinary gain
the <hi>Hollanders</hi> and the <hi>Zelanders</hi> do
make by fiſhing on the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Seas,
having firſt obtained leave from the
Caſtle of <hi>Scarborough;</hi> For the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
have ever granted them leave to Fiſh,
reſerving always the Honour, and the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:51477:24"/>
Priviledge to themſelves, but through
a negligence reſigning the Profit unto
Strangers; for it is almoſt incredible
(ſaith he) to believe what a vaſt ſum
of Money the <hi>Hollanders</hi> do make by
this Fiſhing upon our Coaſt; Mr. <hi>Hit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chock</hi>
alſo, in the time of Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi>
preſented a Book to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
written in the Engliſh Tongue
concerning the Commodity of Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
in which he ſpecifies, that the
<hi>Hollanders</hi> and <hi>Zealanders</hi> every year
towards the latter end of ſummer, do
ſend forth four or five hundred Veſſels
called Buſſes, to Fiſh for Herrings in
our <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Seas; but before they fiſh,
they aſk leave of <hi>Scarborough,</hi> they are
his very Words. Care was alſo taken by
K. <hi>James,</hi> that no Foreigner ſhould Fiſh
on the <hi>Engliſh</hi> or <hi>Iriſh</hi> Seas without leave
firſt obtained, and every year at the
leaſt, this leave was renewed from the
Commisſioners for that purpoſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
at <hi>London.</hi> But the Reaſon
why we do not ſo often meet with
theſe Forms of Licences is, becauſe by
the Leagues made with the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boring
Princes, a Licence, or Freedom
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:51477:25"/>
of that kinde was ſo often allowed by
both parties, that as long as the League
was in Force, the Sea ſerved as it were
a Common Feild, as well for the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigner
y was in Amity, as for the King
of <hi>England</hi> himſelf, who was the Lord
and owner of it. But a remarkable
Example of Fiſhing in this Nature
we finde in the days of King <hi>Henry</hi> the
Fourth. An Agreement was made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Kings of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi>
that the Subjects of both Kingdomes
might freely Fiſh throughout that part
of the Sea, which is bounded on this
ſide by the Ports of <hi>Scarborough</hi> and
<hi>Southampton,</hi> and on the other ſide by
the Coaſt of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and the Mouth
of the River of <hi>Sein;</hi> The time was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
limited betwixt Autumn, and the
beginning of <hi>January.</hi> And that the
<hi>French</hi> might ſecurely enjoy the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
of this Agreement, the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
ſent Letters unto all his Sea Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
and Commanders. By this we
may plainly ſee, that theſe Limits
wholy excluded the <hi>French</hi> from that
part of the Sea which lies towards the
Weſt, and South-Weſt, as alſo that
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:51477:25"/>
which lieth North-Eaſt of them as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo limited by our <hi>Henry</hi> at his own
pleaſure, as Lord and Soveraign of the

            <p>There is amongſt the Records of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>

a Protection to Fiſh, and he Limits it

to the Fiſhermen of the Neighbouring Ports,
and to others who ſhall be willing to come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them for the Benefit of Fiſhing; that they
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:51477:26"/>
may Fiſh and make their own Advantage
with Ships and Boats under the burden of
thirty Tuns, any Prohibition or Commands
of ours whatſoever to the contrary notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
we command you to permitt the
Fiſhermen of the ſaid Towns, and others who
ſhall be willing to come to the ſaid places for
the Benefit of Fiſhing, to Fiſh, and make
their own Advantage with Ships and Boats
under-thirty Tun, without any Let or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment,
any Prohibitions or Commands of
ours made to the contrary in any wiſe not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is evident alſo in the Records
of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, for he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted
three Perſons with Naval Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
whoſe Office it was to Protect and
Guard the Fiſhermen upon the Coaſts
of <hi>Norfolk</hi> and <hi>Suffolk;</hi> and the charges
of the Guard were to be Defrayed by
the Fiſhermen of the ſaid Seas at the
pleaſure of the King of <hi>England,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they have Letters of Publick
Security and Protection from Foreign
Princes; Neither were any Perſons
admitted to a Partnerſhip in this kind
of Guard, except thoſe who were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
by the King of <hi>England;</hi> leaſt
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:51477:27"/>
by this means, perhaps it might De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate
from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Right, which
is a manifeſt Sign and Evidence of
their Dominion, and Poſſeſſion of the
place; And this may yet more clearly
appear by the Laws and Limits uſually
ſet by our Kings to ſuch Foreigners as
were at Enmity with each other, but
in Amity with the <hi>Engliſh:</hi> and to this
effect, is the Proclamation of King
<hi>James;</hi> who having made Peace with
all Nations, did give equal Protection
to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and the United <hi>Nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands,</hi>
at that time exerciſing Acts
of great Hoſtility one againſt another;
Our Pleaſure (ſaith he) and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
is to all our Officers and
Subjects by Sea and Land that they
ſhall Prohibite as much as in them
lieth, all hovering of Men of War
of either <hi>Spaniard</hi> or <hi>Hollander</hi> neer to
the Entry of any of our Coaſts or Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens;
and that they ſhall Reſcue and
Succour all Merchants, and others that
ſhall fall within the Danger of any
ſuch as ſhall Await our Coaſts: And it
is further to be obſerved, that as our
Kings have very often Commanded
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:51477:27"/>
that all manner of perſons ſhould ceaſe
from Hoſtility throughout all the
ſpaces extended into their Territories
by Sea; ſo they indulged the like Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege
for ever throughout the more
Neighbouring Coaſts of the <hi>French</hi>
ſhore, that all manner of Perſons,
though Enemies to one another, ſhould
ſecurely ſayle to, and fro, as it were<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
under the wings of an Arbitrator, or
Moderatour of the Sea, and alſo freely
ſhould uſe the Sea, according to ſuch
ſpaces, and limits, as they were pleaſed
at firſt to appoint, which without doubt
is a clear Evidence of Dominion.</p>
            <p>In this next place, I ſhall cite ſome
of the Publick Records which are kept
in the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> in which the
Dominion of the Sea is expreſly Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted,
as belonging to the Kings of
<hi>England;</hi> We Read, that <hi>Edward</hi> the

do ſtrictly Require and Charge you by
the Duty and Allegiance wherein you stand

matters of that kind.</p>
            <p>We read alſo in the Reign of the

Bill in Parliament (which is the
voice of the Eſtates of the Realm) that
he was uſually accounted King or So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign

            <p>Another Teſtimony to the ſame Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
we read in the Parliamentary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth, where the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

ſuch a Tribute may be impoſed upon all
Strangers paſſing through the ſaid Sea, for
the Benefit and Advantage of our ſaid Lord
the King, as may ſeem agreeable to reaſon,
for the ſafegard of the ſaid Sea.</hi> The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
ſubſcribed to the ſaid Bill, was,
<hi>Soit aviſe par le Roy,</hi> which is, <hi>Let the
King Himſelf be adviſed of it.</hi> For the
King at that time Reſided in <hi>France,</hi>
being Lord of that Country, as well by

Duke of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> was then Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
of the Parliament, and Leivtenant

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:51477:29"/>

from the Antient, down to our preſent

            <p>Neither hath the High Court of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament

which they called, <hi>The Antient Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority

Writs and Forms of the Actions them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>Neither is this Truth confirmed on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by our Laws, but by our Medals.
There hath been a piece of Gold very
often Coyned by our Kings, called a
<hi>Roſe-Noble,</hi> which was ſtamped on the
one ſide of it with a Ship, floting in the
Sea, and a King Armed with a Sword
and Shield, ſitting in the Ship it ſelf,
as in a Throne, to ſet forth a Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> K. by Sea: The firſt
Authour hereof was <hi>Edward</hi> the Third,
when he Guarded his own Seas with a
Numerous Navy, conſiſting of Eleven
Hundred ſhips, at which time, as at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
he marched victoriouſly through
<hi>France:</hi> But what need we labour to
produce ſo many Teſtimonies at home
from our Records in the <hi>Tower</hi> and
other places, from our High Courts of
Parliament, from our Laws, from our
Coyns, &amp; from our Hiſtories, to prove
this Truth; ſince it is acknowledged
even by Forreigners themſelves whom
it moſt concerneth, by their uſual ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of ſayles, according to the antient
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:51477:30"/>
Cuſtom by every ſhip of any Forreign
Nation whatſoever, if they ſayle near
the Kings Navy, or any ſhip belonging
to it at Sea, which is done not onely in
Honour to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> King, but alſo in
acknowledgement of His Sovereignty,
and Dominion at Seas. The Antiquity
of this Cuſtome, and that it hath been
in uſe for above theſe Four Hundred
years may appear by this following te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony:
<hi>At</hi> Haſtings, <hi>a Town ſcituate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Shore of</hi> Suſſex, <hi>it was Decreed by K.</hi>
John, <hi>in the Second Year of His Reign,
with the Aſſent of His Peers, That if the
Governour, or Commander of the Kings
Navy in His Naval Expeditions ſhall meet
with any Ships whatſoever by Sea, either
Laden or Empty,</hi>
               <note place="margin">M<hi rend="sup">•</hi>. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentar de Rebus Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral, fol. 28.</note> 
               <hi>that ſhall refuſe to ſtrike
their ſayles at the Command of the Kings
Governour or Admiral, or his Lievtenant,
but make reſiſtance againſt any who be long un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Fleet, that then they are to be reputed
Enemies, and if they be taken, their Ships
and Goods to be Conſiſcated, as the Goods of
Enemies; And that, although the Maſters
or Owners of the Ships ſhall Alledge after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
that the ſame Ships and Goods do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to the Friends and Allies of our Lord
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:51477:30"/>
the King, yet the perſons who ſhall be found
in theſe Ships, are to be puniſhed with Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment
at diſcretion, for their Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
It was accounted Treaſon (ſaith
Maſter <hi>Selden) If any ſhip what ſoever had
not acknowledged the Dominion of the King
of</hi> England <hi>in His own Sea by striking
ſayle, and they were not to be protected upon
the Account of Amity, who ſhould in any
wiſe preſume to do the contrary; Penalties
were alſo appointed by the Kings of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
<hi>in the ſame manner, as if mention were
made concerning a Crime committed in ſome
Territory of his Land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But above all, that as yet hath been
ſaid, there can hardly be alledged a
more convincing Argument, to prove
the Truth of all that hath hitherto been
ſpoken, then the Acknowledgement
of the Sea-Dominion of the King of
<hi>England</hi> by very many of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Nations. At what time
the Agreement was made by <hi>Edward</hi>
the Firſt of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> the Fair
of <hi>France, Reyner Grimbald,</hi> Governour
of the <hi>French</hi> Navy, Intercepted and
Spoyled, on the <hi>Engliſh Seas,</hi> the Goods
of many Merchants that were going to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:51477:31"/>
               <hi>Flanders,</hi> as well <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as <hi>Others,</hi> and
not contented with the Depredation of
their Goods,<note place="margin">Rot. Parl. 31 Edw. 1. Membran. 16.</note> He Impriſoned alſo their
Perſons, and delivered them up to the
Officers of the King of <hi>France,</hi> and in
a very inſolent manner juſtified his
Actions in Writing, as done by Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the King his Maſters Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
This being alledged to be done
to the great Damage and Prejudice of

the <hi>Daniſh</hi> King being willing to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate

are conſtrained to abandon their Fiſhing,

which is a matter of great conſequence to

though the King, out of his tenderneſs

which at the ſame time that they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged,

               <p>I Muſt now let your Lordſhip know,

their Letters of Credence, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to <hi>London</hi> on <hi>Saturday</hi> was a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven-night,
and upon <hi>Tueſday</hi> had Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience

where being required to communicate

delivered their meditated Anſwer at

appointed my Lord <hi>Bining</hi> and me to
attend His Majeſty for directions, what
Reply to return to this Anſwer of
theirs; which I repreſented to their
Lordſhips yeſterday to this effect:
That his Majeſty found it ſtrange, that
they having been ſo often required by
your Lordſhip His Majeſties Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour,
as from himſelf, in their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
Aſſembly, to ſend over Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:51477:37"/>
fully Authorized to Treat
and Conclude, not onely of all differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
grown between the Subjects of
both States, touching the Trade to the
<hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> and the <hi>Whale-Fiſhing,</hi> and
to Regulate and ſettle a Joynt and an
even Traffick in thoſe Quarters, but
withal to take order for a more indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
courſe of determining other
Queſtions, growing between our Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
and them about their Draperies
and the Tare; And more eſpecially to
determine his Majeſties <hi>Right for the
ſole Fiſhing upon all the Coaſts of his Three
Kingdoms,</hi> into which they had of late
times incroached farther then of Right
they could; And laſtly, for the regle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and reducing of their Coyns to
ſuch a proportion and correſpondence
with thoſe of his Majeſties and other
States, that their Subjects might make
no Advantage to tranſport our Monies
by inhanſing their valuation there: All
which they confeſſed your Lordſhip
had inſtanced them for in his Majeſties
Name; that after all this attent on his
Majeſties part, and ſo long deliberation
on theirs, they were come at laſt with
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:51477:38"/>
a Propoſition to ſpeak only to the two
firſt points, and inſtructed thereunto
with bare Letters of Credance only,
which His Majeſty takes for an Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
faſhion of proceeding in them,<note place="margin">Their Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious faſhion of Treating.</note> as
if they were come hither to Treat of
what themſelves pleaſed, and to give
Law to His Majeſty in his own King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and to propoſe and admit of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but what ſhould tend meerly to
their own ends.</p>
               <p>To the ſecond; Whereas they would
decline all debate of the Fiſhings upon
His Majeſties Coaſts, firſt by Allegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of their late great Loſſes and an <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meute</hi>
of their people, who are all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſed
in that Queſtion, and would
be like to break out into ſome combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
to the hazard of their State which
hath lately ſcaped <hi>Naufrage,</hi> and is not
yet altogether calmed; What is this
put to raiſe an advantage to themſelves
out of their diſadvantage? But after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
they profeſſe their lothneſſe to
call it in doubt or Queſtion, claiming
an immemorial poſſeſſion ſeconded by
the Law of Nations; To which His
Majeſty will have them told, that the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:51477:38"/>
Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> have ſought leave to Fiſh
there by Treaty from this Crown; and
that the King of <hi>France</hi> (a nearer Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to our Coaſt then they) to this
day requeſts leave for a few Veſſels to
Fiſh for Proviſion of his own houſhold;
And that it appears ſo much the more
ſtrange to His Majeſty, that they being
a State of ſo late date, ſhould be the
firſt that would preſume to queſtion
His Majeſties Antient Right, ſo many
hundred yeers inviolably poſſeſſed by
His Progenitors, and acknowledged
by all other Antient States and Princes.
That themſelves in theit publick Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the laſt of <hi>Iune,</hi> ſent by your
Lordſhip, ſeemed then to confirm their
immemorial poſſeſſion (as they term
it) with divers Treaties, as are of the
year, 1550. and another between His
Majeſties Predeceſſors and <hi>Charles</hi> the
Fifth, as Prince of thoſe Provinces,
and not by the Law of Nations. To
which their laſt Plea, His Majeſty
would have them told, that he being
an Iſlander-Prince, is not ignorant of
the Laws and Rights of his own King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
nor doth expect to be taught the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:51477:39"/>
Laws of Nations by them, nor their
<hi>Grotius,</hi> whoſe ill thriving might rather
teach others to diſavow his Poſitions;
and his honeſty called in queſtion by
themſelves, might render his Learning
as much ſuſpected to them, as his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
This His Majeſty takes for an
high point of his Soveraignty, and will
not have it ſlighted over in any faſhion
whatſoever.</p>
               <p>Thus I have particulated unto you the
manner of our proceeding with them;
Let them adviſe to ſeek leave from
His Majeſty, and to acknowledge Him,
His Right, as other Princes have done,
and do; or it may well come to paſſe,
that they that will needs bear all the
World before them, by their <hi>Mare Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berum,</hi>
may ſoon come to have neither

               <p>WHether the final reſolution here
will be according to His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties
deſire, in that point concerning
the Fiſhing upon the Coaſts of His
Three Kingdomes, I cannot ſay; And
by ſomewhat which fell from the
Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> by way of Diſcourſe
when he took leave of me on <hi>Monday,</hi>
laſt, at his Departure; I ſuſpect it will
not, in regard the Magiſtrates of theſe
Towns of <hi>Holland,</hi> being newly pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
and yet ſcarce faſt in their Seats,
who do Authorize the Deputies which
come hither to the Aſſembly of the
States in all things they are to Treat
and Reſolve, will not Adventure for
fear of the people, to determine of a
Buſineſs, on which the livelihood of
Fifty Thouſand of the Inhabitants of

I told the Prince, that howſoever His
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:51477:40"/>
Majeſty, both in Honour of His Crown
and Perſon, and Intereſt of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
neither could nor would any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
deſiſt, from having His Right ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
by this State, as well as by
All other Princes and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths,
eſpecially finding the ſame
openly oppugned both by their States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and men of War, as the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of <hi>Grotius,</hi> and the taking of <hi>John
Brown</hi> the laſt year may teſtifie; yet
this acknowledgment of a Right and a
Due was no excluſion of Grace and
Favour; and that the people of this
Country paying that ſmall Tribute up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
every one of their Buſſes, (which
is not ſo much as diſputed by any other
Nation whatſoever) ſuch was His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
well-wiſhing to this State, that
I preſumed of his permiſſion to ſuffer
them to continue their courſe of Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
which they might uſe thereby
with more Freedom, and leſs appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
of moleſtation and let then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and likewiſe ſpare the Coſt of
ſome of their Men of War, which they
yearly ſend out to maintain that by
force, which they may have of Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:51477:40"/>
The Prince anſwered, that for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
at His Return from <hi>Utrecht,</hi> he
would do his beſt endeavour to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
His Majeſty contentment, but he
doubted the <hi>Hollanders</hi> would appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
the ſame effect in their payment
for Fiſhing, as they found in the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
of the <hi>Sound,</hi> where at firſt an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
matter was demanded by the King
of <hi>Denmark,</hi> but now more exacted
then they can poſſibly bear: And
touching their Men of War, he ſaid,
they muſt ſtill be at the ſame charge
with them, becauſe of the Pirates.
Withal, he caſt out a queſtion to me,
whether this freedom of Fiſhing might
not be redeemed with a ſumm of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney?
To which I anſwered, It was a
matter of Royalty more then of Utility,
though Princes were not to neglect
their profit.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>BY Your Letters and otherwiſe, I
perceive many jealouſies and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes
are raiſed upon the preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of His Majeſties Fleet, which is
now in ſuch forwardneſs, that we
doubt not but within this Month it will
appear at Sea. It is therefore expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
both for your ſatisfaction and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
to inform you particularly
what was the occaſion, and what is
His Majeſties intention in this work.</p>
               <p>Firſt, we hold it a principle not to
be denied, That the King of Great <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi>
is a Monarch at Land and Sea to
the full extent of His Dominions, and
that it concerneth him as much to
maintain His Soveraignty in all the
<hi>Britiſh</hi> Seas, as within His three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
becauſe without that, theſe
cannot be kept ſafe; nor he preſerve
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:51477:45"/>
his honour and due reſpect with other
Nations. But commanding the Seas,
he may cauſe his Neighbours and all
Countries to ſtand upon their guard
whenſoever he thinks fit. And this
cannot be doubted that whoſoever will
encroach upon him by Sea, will do it
by Land alſo when they ſee their time.
To ſuch preſumption <hi>Mare liberum</hi> gave
the firſt warning-piece, which muſt be
anſwered with a defence of <hi>Mare clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum:</hi>
not ſo much by Diſcourſes, as by
the louder Language of a powerful
Navy, to be better underſtood, when
overſtrained patience ſeeth no hope of
preſerving her Right by other means.</p>
               <p>The Degrees by which his Majeſties
Dominion at Sea hath of latter years
been firſt impeached and then queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,
are as conſiderable as notorious.</p>
               <p>Firſt, to cheriſh, and as it were to
nouriſh up our unthankful Neighbors,
We gave them leave to gather wealth
and ſtrength upon our Coaſts, in our
Ports, by our Trade, and by our Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
Then they were glad to invite
our Merchants Reſidence, with what
priviledges they would deſire. Then
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:51477:45"/>
they offered to us even the Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of their Eſtates, and then they ſued
for Licenſe to Fiſh upon the Coaſts,
and obtained it under the Great Seal of
<hi>Scotland,</hi> which now they ſuppreſſe.
And when thus by leave or by conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence,
they had poſſeſſed themſelves
of our Fiſhings, not onely in <hi>Scotland,</hi>
but in <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> and by our
Staple had raiſed a great ſtock of Trade;
by theſe means they ſo encreaſed their
Shiping and power at Sea, that now
they endure not to be kept at any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance:
Nay, they are grown to that
confidence to keep guards upon our
Seas; and then to project an Office and
Company of Aſſurance for the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
of Trade; and withal, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit
us free commerce even within
our Seas, and take our Ships and goods,
if we conform not to their <hi>Placarts.</hi>
What inſolencies and cruelties they
have committed againſt us heretofore,
in <hi>Ireland,</hi> in <hi>Greenland,</hi> and in the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi>
is too well known to all the world.
In all which, though our ſufferings
and their wrong may ſeem forgotten,
yet the great intereſt of His Majeſties
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:51477:46"/>
honour, is ſtill the ſame, and will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh
their Memories as there ſhall be
cauſe. For, though charity muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
wrongs done to private men, yet
the reflection upon the publick may
make it a greater charity to do Juſtice
on crying crimes. All this notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
you are not to conceive that
the work of this Fleet, is either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
or execution of Juſtice for theſe
great offences paſt, but chiefly for the
future to ſtop the violent Current of
that preſumption whereby the Men of
War and Free-booters of all Nations
(abuſing the favour of His Majeſties
peaceable and gracious Government,
whereby he hath permitted all His
Friends and Allies, to make uſe of His
Seas and Ports in a reaſonable and free
manner, and according to his Treaties)
have taken upon them the boldneſs,
not only to come confidently at all
times into all his Ports and Rivers, but
to convey their Merchants ſhips as high
as his chief City, and then to caſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor
cloſe upon his Magazins, and to
contemn the Commands of his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
when they required a farther di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance:
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:51477:46"/>
ſtance: But which is more intolerable,
have aſſaulted and taken one another
within his Majeſties Chamber, and
within his Rivers, to the ſcorn and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of his Dominion and Power; and
this being of late years an ordinary
practice which we have endeavoured
in vain to reform by the ways of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
and Treaties, the world I think
will now be ſatisfied, that we have
reaſon to look about us. And no wiſe
man will doubt that it is high time to
put our ſelves in this Equipage upon
the Seas, and not to ſuffer that Stage of
Action to be taken from us for want of
our appearance.</p>
               <p>So you ſee the general ground upon
which our Counſels ſtands. In parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
you may take notice, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
as cauſe requires, That His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
by this Fleet intendeth not a Rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
with any Prince or State, nor to
infringe any point of his Treaties; but
reſolveth to continue and maintain
that happy peace wherewith God hath
bleſſed his Kingdom, and to which, all
his Actions and Negotiations have
ohitherto tended, as by your own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:51477:47"/>
you may fully underſtand.
But withal conſidering, that Peace
muſt be maintained by the arme of
power, which onely keeps down War
by keeping up Dominion; His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
thus provoked, finds it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
even for his own defence and
ſafety, to re-aſſume and keep his
antient and undoubted Right in the
Dominion of theſe Seas, and to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
no other Prince or State to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croach
upon him, thereby aſſuming to
themſelves or their Admirals, any
Soveraign command: but to force
them to perform due homage to his
Admirals and Ships, and to pay them
acknowledgements, as in former
times they did. He will alſo ſet
open and protect the free Trade both
of his Subjects and Alies: And give
them ſuch ſafe Conduct and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy,
as they ſhall reaſonably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.
He will ſuffer no other
Fleets or Men of War to keep any
guard upon theſe Seas, or there to
offer violence or take prizes or boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
or to give interruption to any
lawfull intercourſe. In a word, his
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:51477:47"/>
Majeſty is reſolved, as to do no
wrong, ſo to do Juſtice both to his
Subjects and Friends, within the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
of his Seas. And this is the
real and Royal deſign of this Fleet,
whereof you may give part as you
finde occaſion to our good Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
in thoſe parts, that no Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brage
may be taken of any hoſtile
act or purpoſe to their prejudice in

and burning the Buſſes of <hi>Holland,</hi>
and ſetting great ranſom upon their Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſher-men,
enforced them to compound
for great ſums, that they might Fiſh
quietly for one year; whereupon the
next year after the Fiſher-men agreed
amongſt themſelves to pay a Doller
upon every laſt of Herrings, towards
the maintenance of certain Ships of
War to waft and ſecure them in their
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:51477:55"/>
Fiſhing, by reaſon whereof there was
a Record kept of the ſeveral laſts of
Herrings taken that year, and it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
thereby, that in one half year
there were taken thirty thouſand laſts
of Herrings which at twenty pound <hi>per</hi>
laſt, amounteth to Three Millions ſix
Hundred Thouſand, and at ſixteen,
twenty, thirty pound the laſt, they are
ordinarily ſold, then tranſported into
other Countries, it cometh at leaſt to
Five Millions, Whereunto if we add
the Herrings taken by other Nations,
together with the Cod, Ling, Hake,
and the Fiſh taken by the <hi>Hollanders,</hi>
and other our Neighbours upon the
<hi>Brittiſh</hi> Coaſts all the year long, the
totall will evidently ariſe to be above
Ten Millions.</p>
                  <p>The great Trade of Fiſhing imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

muſt likewiſe neceſſarily maintain as

every Shire affordeth hardy and able

ſold at eaſie rates without payment of
Exciſes, or Impoſt.</p>
                  <p>Our ſhores and harbours are near

                  <p>For drink, or nets, ſalting and pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our Fiſh; and for ſuccour in ſtreſs

or never come. And though
we had as many Buſſes as the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
yet is there vent for all, or more,
for in the Eaſt and Northern Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
and in many other places, Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
are every days meat, Winter
and Summer, as well to draw on drink,
as to ſatisfie hunger, and in moſt pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
the greateſt part of the year they be
ſcarce to be had; for preſently after
<hi>Michaelmas</hi> the Sound and Rivers are
frozen up, ſo as no Herrings can be
tranſported into twenty ſeveral King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
and free States until <hi>July,</hi> which
is for thirty weeks ſpace together; ſo
that when Lent comes, there are few
to be bought for money.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, ſince by care and induſtry
we gained from the <hi>Flemmings,</hi> doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
ſo by the means we may as eaſily
grow expert in the Art of Fiſhing, and
in time make it a ſtaple-commodity of
our own.</p>
                  <p>But this we ſhall the better and

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:51477:58"/>
which hitherto have hindred us

contrary to old cuſtom, and the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute-Laws
provided for obſerving
Fiſh-day, from whence our ſcarcity
and dearth of Fiſh proceedeth; for
where Fleſh is ordinarily ſpent, Fiſh
will not be bought, and want of ſale de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayeth
all Trade, gain being the Nurſe
of Induſtry.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Want of order and diſcretion in

liketh him: whereas amongſt the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi>
two of the beſt experienced
Fiſher-men are appointed to guide the
reſt of the Fleet, all others being
bound to follow them, and to caſt
their lines according to their directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>

                  <p n="4">4. The <hi>Hollanders</hi> Buſſes are great

Sea, not daring to adventure far in fair

6. The <hi>Hollanders</hi> have certain Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
who, during the Herring-ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
do onely come to the places where

Fiſher-men are uncertain of their

time in putting off their Fiſh by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels.</p>
                  <p>Theſe and other effects would care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully

proſperous, and ſuccesful, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conſidering the fearful miſchiefs, the
neglects hereof hath brought to the
King and Kingdom in general, and to
many good Towns and Corporations in

Becauſe the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fiſher-men
dwelling on the Sea-Coaſts did leave
off their Trade of Fiſhing in our Seas,
and went the half-Seas over, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
they did buy Fiſh of <hi>Pickards,
Flemmings, Normans,</hi> and <hi>Zelanders,</hi> by
reaſon whereof many incommodities
did grow to the Realm, <hi>viz.</hi> the decay
of the wealth and proſperity as well of
the Cinque-Ports, and Members of the
ſame, as of other Coaſt-Towns by the
Sea-ſide, which were builded, and
inhabited by great multitudes of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
by reaſon of uſing and exerciſing,
the craft and feat of Fiſhing. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the decay of a great number of
Boats and Ships. And thirdly, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay
of many good Marriners, both able
in body by their diligence, labour, and
continual exerciſe of Fiſhing, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert
by reaſon thereof in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Sea-Coaſts, as well with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
this Realm as in other parts beyond

that no manner of Perſons <hi>Engliſh, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizens,</hi>

                  <p>This Act by many continuances was

and from thence to the end of the next
Parliament, and then expired.</p>
                  <p>For Concluſion, ſeeing, by that
which hath formerly been declared, it
evidently appeareth, that the Kings
of <hi>England,</hi> by immemorable preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
continual uſage, and poſſeſſion,
the acknowledgment of all our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour-States,
and the Municipal Laws
of the Kingdom, have ever held the
Sovereign Lordſhip of the Seas of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and that unto his Majeſty, by
reaſon of his Sovereignty, the ſupream
command and Juriſdiction over the
paſſage, and Fiſhing in the ſame right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
apperteineth; conſidering alſo
the natural Scite of thoſe our Seas that
interpoſe themſelves between the
great Northern Commerce of that of
the whole world, and that of the Eaſt,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:51477:61"/>
Weſt, and Southern Climates, and
withal the infinite commodities that
by Fiſhing in the ſame is daily made;
It cannot be doubted, but his Majeſty,
by means of his own excellent Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Virtue, and by the Induſtry
of his faithful Subjects and People, may
eaſily, without injuſtice to any Prince
or Perſon whatſoever, be made the

Wealth, and his People the moſt opu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
and Flouriſhing Nation of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the world. And this the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
for that his Majeſty is now abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Commander of the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Iſle,
and hath alſo enlarged his Dominions
over a great part of the Weſtern <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;</hi>
by means of which extent of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
(croſſing in a manner the whole
Ocean) the Trade and perſons of all
Nations (removing from one part of
the world to the other) muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
firſt, or laſt, come within compaſs
of his power and juriſdiction.</p>
                  <p>And therefore the Sovereignty of
our Seas, being the moſt precious Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el
of his Majeſtie's Crown; and (next
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:51477:61"/>
under God) the principal means of

Declared in a full Convention
betwixt <hi>Ferdinando</hi> Emper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
of <hi>Germany,</hi> and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick
of <hi>Venice</hi> in the <hi>Year,

               </head>
               <p>AT this Convention the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
on both ſides were open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
And it being required in
the Name of his Emperial Majeſty,
that it may be Lawful for his Subjects
and others, to Traffick freely in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driatick
Sea; It was anſwered by the
Advocate of the Common-Wealth of
<hi>Venice,</hi> that Navigation indeed ought
to be free, yet thoſe things at which
his Imperial Majeſty found himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grieved
were no ways repugnant to
this Freedom,<note place="margin">How farr Navigation is to be free.</note> for as much as in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
which are moſt free; Thoſe who
have the Dominion thereof receive
Cuſtome, and do give Bounds, and
preſcribe Order, by which way all
Merchandize ſhall paſs, and therefore
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:51477:63"/>
none ſhould finde themſelves agrieved
if the <hi>Venetians</hi> for their own Reſpects,
did uſe to do ſo in the Adriatick Seas
which is under their Dominion, there
being nothing more known then that
the Common-Wealth of <hi>Venice</hi> were
Lords of the Adriatick Sea, and do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
that Dominion which from time
out of minde it had always done, as
well in receiving of Cuſtomes as in
aſſigning of places for the Exaction of
it; And that according to former Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulations,
the Subjects of the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi>
were to have no leſs liberty in the
Lands of the <hi>Auſtrians,</hi> then the <hi>Auſtrian</hi>
Subjects in the Sea of <hi>Venice;</hi> And if
his Imperial Majeſty within his own
State upon the Land, will not permit
that the Subjects of the Common-Wealth
of <hi>Venice</hi> ſhall go which way
they liſt, but doth conſtrain them to
go by ſuch places onely where cuſtoms
is to be paid, he cannot with Juſtice
demand that his Subjects may paſſe by
or through the Sea of the Republick
which way they pleaſe, but muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
himſelf that they paſſe that way
onely, which ſhall beſt ſtand with the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:51477:64"/>
Advantage of thoſe who have the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
over it; And if his Majeſty
cauſe Cuſtome to be paid upon his
Land, why may not the <hi>Venetians</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
do it upon their Sea? He deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of them if by the Capitulation they
would have it that the Emperour
ſhould be reſtrained or hindred from
the taking of Cuſtome? And if not,
why would they have the <hi>Venetians</hi> ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thereunto by a Capitulation, which
ſpeaks of both Potentates equally with
the ſame words; He proceeded in a
Confirmation of the Truth that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick
had the Dominion of the Sea,
and although the propoſition was true,
that the Sea is common and free, yet it
is no otherwiſe to be underſtood there
in the ſame ſence when uſually we ſay,<note place="margin">The Sea in His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions no more common nor free, then is the High-way by Land.</note>
that the high-way are common &amp; free;
by which is meant, that they cannot be
Uſurped by any private Perſon for his
ſole proper ſervice, but remain to the
uſe of every one; Not therefore, that
they are ſo free, as that they ſhould not
be under the Protection and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of ſome Prince, and that every
one might do therein Licenciouſly

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:51477:64"/>

whatſoever pleaſeth Him, either by
Right, or by Wrong, for as much as
ſuch Licenciouſneſs, or Anarchy both
of God, &amp; Nature, as well by Sea, as by
Land; That the true liberty of the Sea
excludes it not from the protection and
ſuperiority of ſuch as maintain it in
Liberty, nor from the Subjection to the
Laws of ſuch as have Command over
it; but rather neceſſarily it includes it;
That the Sea no leſs then the Land is
Subject to be divided amongſt men, &amp;
appropriated to Cities and Potentates
which long ſince was ordained by God
from the beginning of man kind, as a
thing moſt Natural; And this was well
underſtood by <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Seas appropriated to ſuch and ſuch places ever ſince the begining of Mankind.</note> when he ſaid,
that unto Maritine Cities the Sea is the
Territory, becauſe from thence they
take their Suſtenance, and Defence; A
thing which cannot poſſibly be, unleſs
that part of it be appropriated in the
like manner as the Land is, which is
divided betwixt Cities and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
not by equal parts, nor according
to their Greatneſs, but as they have
been, or are able to Rule, Govern,
or Defend them. <hi>Bern,</hi> he ſaid, was
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:51477:65"/>
not the greateſt City of <hi>Switzerland,</hi>
and yet it hath as large a Teritory, as all
the reſt of the twelve Cantons toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
The City of <hi>Norimburg</hi> is very
great, and yet the Dominions and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories
of it do hardly exceed the wals.
The City of <hi>Venice</hi> it ſelf for many
years was known to be without any
poſſeſſion at all upon the firm Land.
Upon the Sea likewiſe, certain other
Cities of great Force and Valour have
poſſeſſed a large quantity of it, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Cities of leſs force have conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
themſelves with the next waters;
Neither are there wanting Examples
of ſuch who notwithſtanding they do
border upon the Sea, yet having fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
Lands adjacent to them, have ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
themſelves with their Land Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions
without ever attempting to
gain any Sea Dominion. Others there
are, who being awod by their more
mighty Neighbours, have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
to for bear any ſuch Attempt,
for which two cauſes, a City notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
it be Maritine, and border<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
upon the Sea, may happen to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
without any poſſeſſion of the Sea.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:51477:65"/>
He added, that God did inſtitute
Principalities for the maintenance of
Juſtice, to the benefit of Mankind,
which was neceſſary to be executed, as
well by Sea as by Land; And St. <hi>Paul</hi>
ſaid, that for this cauſe there were due
unto Princes, Cuſtomes and Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions,
that it ſhould be a great Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity,
to praiſe the well Governing,
Regulating, and Defence of the Land,
and to condemn that of the Sea;<note place="margin">The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of the Seas, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Laws of God.</note> And
that if the Sea in ſome parts thereof,
for the ampleneſs and extream diſtance
of it from the Land is not poſſibly to be
Governed, and Protected, it doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from a Diſability, and Defect in
Mankind, as in the ſame conſideration
there are Deſarts or Wilderneſſes ſo
great upon the Land, as it is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
imposſible to protect them, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
the many ſandy parts of <hi>Affrica,</hi>
and the Immenſe Vaſtities of the
World but lately diſcovered; And
as it is a gift of God that a Land by
the Laws, and publiſht Power be
Ruled, Protected, and Governed, ſo
the ſame happeneth to the Sea; He
ſaid, that thoſe were deceived by a
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:51477:66"/>
groſs Equivocation, who affirmed that
the Land by reaſon of its Stability and
Firmneſs may be governed, but not
the Sea, for being an unconſtant Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
it paſſeth, and hath a motion
proper to it as well as the Aire; And
if by the Sea, and the Aire, all and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
part of thoſe fluent Elements be
intended, it is a moſt certain thing that
they cannot be governed, becauſe
whilſt a man ſecureth himſelf with any
one part of them, the other fliteth out
of his power; And this alſo hapeneth
unto Rivers, which cannot be reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in their fluent motions; But when
mention is made to rule over a Sea or
River, it is not underſtood of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
but of the Scite where they are
placed; The water of the Adriatick
Sea doth continually run out of it, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can it at all be kept in, and yet it
is the ſame Sea, as well as the Thames,
the <hi>Rhine</hi> or the <hi>Po</hi> are the ſame Rivers
now, as they were one Thouſand years
agoe,<note place="margin">The Sea not to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> and this is that which is Subject
to the Protection of Princes. He askt
the <hi>Germans,</hi> if their pretence were
that tho Sea ſhould be left without Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:51477:66"/>
Protection, ſo that any one might do
therein whatſoever he liſted, by Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Spoiling and making it Unnaviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
This he ſaid, would be ſo abſurd
in reaſon, that he durſt anſwer for
them that they had no ſuch pretence;
he therefore concluded, that therefore
his Majeſty of <hi>Germany</hi> by a neceſſary
Conſequence muſt acknowledge, that
it ought to be kept Governed,<note place="margin">The Sea to be protected by thoſe to whom it doth apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</note> and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected
by thoſe unto whom it did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain
by Divine Diſpoſition, which
if it were ſo, as indeed it is, he deſired
to underſtand if in their Judgment it
ſeemed to them a Juſt thing, that ſuch
ſhould do it with the expence of their
own Pains, and Treaſure, or rather
that ſhould contribute towards it who
equally did enjoy the Benefit; And as
to this, he ſaid, he durſt anſwer for
them, the Doctrine of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> being
clear in this particular, that all ſuch
who are under Government and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection,
are thereby bound to pay
Cuſtomes and Contribution; Much
he ſaid, might be alleaged in matter of
Law to confirm this Truth; And
thereupon he concluded, that if the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:51477:67"/>
Common-Wealth of <hi>Venice</hi> were that
Prince to whom it did appertain to
Govern and Protect the Adriatick Sea,
it of neceſſity muſt follow, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
Traffick, and Saileth on their
Sea ought to be ſubject to their Laws,
in the ſame manner as ſuch are who
travail through a Country upon Land.</p>
               <p>From hence he did proceed to ſhow
that this Dominion over the Sea from
time out of minde did belong to the
Common-Wealth of <hi>Venice;</hi> And to
prove this, he cauſed to be read out of
an Abſtract which he had taken the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
of Thirty Famous Lawyers who
from the Year One Thouſand Three
Hundred until the preſent time, did
ſpeak of the Dominion which the
Common-Wealth of <hi>Venice</hi> had over
the Sea, as of a thing moſt known, and
of which even in their Times, the mind
of man knew not the Contrary, ſome
of them affirming that the Common-Wealth
of <hi>Venice</hi> had no leſſe Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
over the Sea, then over the City
of <hi>Venice;</hi> Others maintaining that the
Adriatick Sea is the Territory and the
Demeans of the ſaid City; And to
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:51477:67"/>
render this more evident, they do make
mention of the lawful Power which
the <hi>Venetians</hi> have to eſtabliſh Laws o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Navigation, and to impoſe Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes
upon ſuch as traffique on thoſe
Seas;<note place="margin">The Power of the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign of the Seas, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Cuſtomes in his own Juriſdiction.</note> And he added, that he never
read any Lawyer which held forth to
the contrary, moreover he told the
Advocate of the Emperour, that if he
would not believe thoſe Authors who
teſtified that the Sea belonged to the
<hi>Venetians,</hi> whereof they had poſſeſſion
from time out of minde, before the age
wherein thoſe Authors lived, yet <gap reason="illegible: bleedthrough" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he
could not deny to receive them for the
Teſtimonies of ſuch things, which
they ſaw, and knew in their times, and
to hold them as witneſſes far above all
Exception, being all of them Famous
men, though dead ſo many years agoe,
and whoſe Impartial Pens could no
ways be intereſted in the preſent Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences.
And becauſe more then two
hundred and fifty years were paſſed
from the time that the Authors whom
he alleaged as Witneſſes hereof, did
Write to the time of thoſe whoſe
Names he laſt of all did mention in
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:51477:68"/>
that behalf; he urged that by their At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation
it was ſufficiently proved,
that for a long time more then ſo many
years the Common-Wealth hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the Sea, and therefore he could
not deny the aſſured and certain poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſesſion
of it to the preſent.</p>
               <p>Then Addresſing himſelf to the
Judges, he deſired them to conſider,
that notwithſtanding ſome of the above
mentioned Authors do ſpeak in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
words, and name at large the Sea
of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> neither taking care to
declare the Quality or the Quantity
thereof, yet others more expreſly do
give it the Title of the Adriatick Sea,
which evidently doth demonſtrate not
onely the Scite, but alſo the Quantity
of the Sea poſſeſſed, and hereupon he
explained himſelf, that thoſe who ſpeak
more preciſely ought to cleer the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages
of thoſe who write more general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
according to the common Precept
which is, that with cleer places the
more obſcure are to be illuſtrated;
He mentioned alſo the divers manner
of ſpeaking of the ſame Lawyers, ſome
deriving the Dominion of the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:51477:68"/>
over the Seas from Cuſtome, ſome
from Preſcriptions, others from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
Subjection, and others from a
Privilege, which did ariſe all from this
Reaſon; Becauſe, as they were moſt
aſſuredly informed of the Poſſeſsion
and Juriſdiction of the ſaid Sea, which
they both heard and ſaw to belong to
the Common-Wealth time out of
mind; So they Writing on the ſame
Subject not at the Inſtance or the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of any One, but of their own
proper Motions, and by way of Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
only, every one of them judged
it moſt convenient to expreſs the Title
of that Juriſdiction, ſome with one
Term, and ſome with another, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
coming to uſe the ſole, true pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Term, as they would have done if
they had been put to write for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
of any one, in which Caſes the
Lawyers are alwayes conformable, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
from the Perſon intereſted the
like Inſtructions.</p>
               <p>After the Declination of the <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinopolitan</hi>
Empire, the <hi>Adriatick</hi> Sea
was found to be for many years aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
in ſuch manner, as it remained
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:51477:69"/>
unregard, and without the Protection
and Government of any Prince, and
under the Juriſdiction of none, untill
it came into the Power of the <hi>Venetians,</hi>
who to receive their lively-hood there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
were conſtrained to maintain it in
freedom, and thereupon taking it into
their protection, they obtained the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and the Dominion over it:
In like manner,<note place="margin">How the Sea comes into the Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Princes</note> as by the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and of Nations, the Land, the
Sea, and other things which are not

come Juſtly into the hands of thoſe
who firſt do get the poſſeſsion of them;
by which Reaſon, the firſt Empires
were founded, as well upon the Sea, as
on the Land, and daily there are new

when any of them, either through Age,

acquired the Common-Wealth of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi>
hath daily advanced by the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Powerful Fleets, with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of much Treaſure, and the effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of as much Blood, both of their Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:51477:69"/>
and Subjects, continuing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Interruption in the ſight of all the
World their Dominion and Cuſtody
of the ſaid Sea, and overcoming and
removing all Impediments, as either
by Pirates, or by Potentates, have at
divers times been raiſed againſt them.
After the teſtimony of the Lawyers,
he added, that of the Hiſtorians, who
do relate, that the Common-Wealth
of <hi>Venice</hi> for more then three hundred
years paſt, did receive Cuſtom of ſuch
as ſail'd that Sea, and kept arm'd Veſſels
in a readineſs to compell all ſuch ſhips
ſo ſayling to go to <hi>Venice,</hi> teſtifying
moreover, that even unto their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
time the ſame cuſtom was obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:
But he dwelled not much upon
their Atteſtations, ſaying, that although
they were good Teſtimonies of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
Occurrences; yet when we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
to prove either the intereſts of
Princes, or of private Perſons, he
ought to help himſelf by Authentick
Writings, and to uſe the Hiſtorians
with great Diſcretion, ſome of them
being moved by Love, others with Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,
and others with hopes of Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:51477:70"/>
which conſtrains them often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to uſe Flatteries, or Hyperboles,
upon which cannot be laid any ſure
Foundation: He therefore did produce
an Act of the General Council held at
<hi>Lions</hi> in the year, one thouſand two
hundred ſeventy four, where the <hi>Abbot</hi>
of <hi>Nerveſa</hi> being delegated by the Pope
did Sentence, that the <hi>Venetians</hi> ſhould
not be moleſted in the Defence, and
Protection of the <hi>Adriatick</hi> Sea, againſt
the <hi>Saracens</hi> and Pirats, neither ſhould
they be Diſturbed by any from exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Rights and Cuſtoms, which
they had of Victuals, Merchandize, or
any other portable Commodities. He
added alſo that there remain the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of Licenſes granted to paſs their
ſaid Sea, with armed Veſſels, or Ships
of War, and to the Perſons and Goods
belonging to their uſe, at the requeſt
of divers Princes who had their Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
on the ſhore of the <hi>Adriatick</hi> Sea:
But for the greater confirmation of all
that had been ſaid, he remembred the
yearly Ceremony uſed at <hi>Venice,</hi> where
the Duke in the preſence of the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours
of other Princes, and more
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:51477:70"/>
particularly of the Emperours of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi>
doth conſtantly uſe to Eſpouſe the
Sea by caſting a Ring of Gold into it
with theſe words, <hi>Deſponſamus to Mare
in ſignum veri &amp; perpetui Dominii:</hi> We
do Marry thee O Sea, in ſign of our true
and perpetual Dominion over it;
Which Ceremony, as many Writers
do affirm, had its beginning when Pope
<hi>Alexander</hi> the third was in <hi>Venice,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtand
they do add withall, that it
was Inſtituted in ſign of the Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which the Republick had formerly
gotten by the Right of War.</p>
               <p>At the Concluſion he produced the
Letters of many Princes and Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates
who joyntly acknowledged the
Truth of what he ſpoke, two of them
were from the Emperour <hi>Frederick</hi> to
<hi>Giovanni Mocernigo</hi> Duke of <hi>Venice,</hi>
where having acquainted him of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
quantity of Corn, that was to paſs
through the <hi>Adriatick</hi> Sea, he deſireth
that he may be permitted to have a free
paſſage, which will be to him a great
pleaſure, and he ſhall acknowledge it
with many thanks. Another Letter
was from <hi>Beatrice</hi> Queen of <hi>Hungary</hi> to
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:51477:71"/>
the Duke above mentioned, where ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
informed him that ſhe had divers
things to paſs through the <hi>Adriatick</hi> Sea,
which could not be without his permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
ſhe deſired that for Courteſies and
Friendſhips-ſake it might be granted
her, which ſhe ſhould take for a great
Favour, and correſpond with him on
the like occaſion. Another Letter was
from <hi>Matthias</hi> King of <hi>Hungary</hi> to the
Duke of <hi>Venice,</hi> where relating how
the Common-Wealth of <hi>Venice</hi> was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed
every year to give Licenſe
for the Tranſportation of a certain
quantity of Corn, he prayed that the
ſame Grace might be ſhewed unto him,
and that he would acknowledge it for
a Favour, and correſpond according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p>Thus as in a Glaſs, you may ſee the
Dominion of His Majeſty in His <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi>
Seas clearly repreſented, aſſerted,
and fully proved by that propriety of
Title and Soverainty of Power which
the Duke of <hi>Venice</hi> exerciſeth on the
<hi>Adriatick</hi> Sea, which by the manner of
preſcription, the conſent of Hiſtories,
and even by the confeſsion of their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:51477:71"/>

But His Majeſty hath one Title more
above all theirs, which is, the Title of
Succeſsive Inheritance, confirmed as
well by the Law of Nature, as of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and is ſo much the more conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
in regard of the infinite Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges

There is enough, as may be

Cuſtom their Authority; Inſomuch,
that ſome of the moſt buſieſt of them

which is, that the Rights of the <hi>Engliſh,

Great ſupplyes of monies were

And although the ſaid Earle,
not long afterwards, returned into

were doubtful untill the fatal Battel at
<hi>Nieuport,</hi> yet Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of ever

goodneſs to the diſtreſſed, and to
thoſe that ſuffered for Religion, did as
long as ſhe lived conſtantly Aſſiſt the
<hi>Hollanders</hi> both with Men and Monies;
ſhe gave them Hope in Deſpair, ſhe
gave them ſtrength being weak, and
and with the Charity of her Princely
Hand did ſupport them being fallen;
And although the <hi>Hollanders</hi> do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefully
alledge, that it was a Benefit
great enough for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to Aſſiſt
them <hi>in reaſon of state,</hi> becauſe by ſo
doing they kept out a War from their

that they offered unto the Queen of

which ſhe would not accept, and
therefore it was not their fault that ſhe
obtained it not; It is in reaſon truly
anſwered, That the Queen of <hi>England,</hi>
well knowing that ſhe was in danger
to draw a perpetual Warr upon her
Self, and her Succeſſours, by the accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of ſuch a Gift to which ſhe had no
Right, did wiſely refuſe their Liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
And yet for all that, ſhe continued

and thereby enjoyed only the Benefit

it, as in former times it had been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed,
but not without ſome af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronting
terms; that it was the laſt time
it ſhould be payed.</p>
               <p>And it is moſt obſervable, that the
ſame Gentleman coming the year fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
with the ſame Authority and
Commandment with one only Ship of
His Majeſties to demand the Duty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid;
And with Order, if he were
denyed, to take witneſs of the refuſal
in writing, and ſo peaceably depart:
He came aboard one of their Ships, and
no ſooner demanded the aforeſaid Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but by the Maſter of the Ship, he
was denyed it, who as plainly, as pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptority
told him, That he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by the States of <hi>Holland</hi> not to
pay it unto the King of <hi>England</hi> any
more, of which he took witneſs accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his Order from His Majeſty.
This taking of witneſs did ſo ſtartle
the <hi>Dutch,</hi> that before Maſter <hi>Brown</hi>
had got off to his own Ship, the Maſter
of another Ship of <hi>Holland</hi> came pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:51477:75"/>
aboard that Ship in which he

you be the Man, I have Order to Arreſt

whereof Maſter <hi>Brown</hi> gave notice to

him to advertiſe His Majeſty of
this Inſolency; and Maſter <hi>Brown</hi> was
in this manner Arreſted, and carried
away Priſoner into <hi>Holland,</hi> where for
a while he was detained. I do read,
that much about the ſame time one
Maſter <hi>Archibald Ranthin</hi> a <hi>Scotch</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
and reſiding at <hi>Stockholme</hi> in

<pb n="128" facs="tcp:51477:76"/>
to be feared; for which Vile and
Inſolent Speeches bring afterwards
challenged by Maſter <hi>Archibald Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thin,</hi>
he had no better Excuſe, then to
ſay, he was drunk when he did ſpeak
thoſe words (for deny them he could
not;) and by this means his Excuſe of
playing the Beaſt; did excuſe him for
playing the Man.</p>
               <p>Now from theſe Inſolent Affronts
by words, let us proceed, and come to
what they have done by deeds, where
in the firſt place, we may obſerve their
rude demeanour to our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation
in the Northern Seas on the Coaſts of
<hi>Greenland,</hi> and thoſe parts, about the
Fiſhing for <hi>Whales,</hi> and the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
of <hi>Train Oyle,</hi> where violently they
have offered unpardonable abuſes by
giving of blows, and chaſing the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh-men</hi>
away, and by procuring much
loſs and prejudice unto them; their
Pride of Heart was ſo high, that it
would not give their Reaſon leave to
apprehend that Fiſhing at Sea is free
for every Man where it is not upon the
Coaſt of any Country, unto which the
Dominion of the Sea belongeth by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
Prerogative.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:51477:76"/>
And yet all this is but inconſiderable
in regard of their uſage of our Nation
in the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> where in open Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtility
they have as fiercely ſet upon
them, as if they had been moſt mortal
Enemies, having in ſeveral Encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
ſlain many of our Men, and ſunk
ſundry of our Ships; And when they
had taken our Men Priſoners, they
would uſe them in the ſight of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi>
in ſuch a Contemptible and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainfull
manner, as if at their own
Home, and in the Country of the But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Boxes;
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in reſpect of
them were but a ſordid and a ſlaviſh
Nation, and the <hi>Hollanders</hi> were either
their Superiours, and might uſe them
at their own pleaſure, or the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
were ſo ſpiritleſs, or ſo unpowerfull,
that they durſt not be revenged, but
quietly muſt put up all the Affronts
and Injuries which they received at
their Hands.</p>
               <p>And as for the Commodious Trade
which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have had in <hi>Muſcovy</hi>
for above theſe fourſcore years, and
ſome other Countries that lye upon the
Eaſt and North, which the <hi>Hollanders,</hi>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:51477:77"/>
have now gotten quite out of their
Hands,<note place="margin">Their ſpoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of our Trade in <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> and other Countries of the Eaſt.</note> to the great Grief and Prejudice
of many Merchants in this City: What
ſhall we ſay, ſeeing not long ſince
they have been acting the ſame again
with our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants in <hi>Turkey:</hi>
And it is a practiſe ſo uſual with them
to ſpoyle the Trade of other Nations,
that when they cannot find any Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to do it, they will ſhow a Nature
ſo wretchedly Barbarous, that they
will not ſtick to ſpoyle one another;
ſo great is their Covetous and moſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatiable
deſire of Gain: And yet all
this proceedeth out of an ignoble and a
ſordid ſpirit, for let them arrive to
what Wealth they will, they can never
be the Maſters of a Noble, and a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
Diſpoſition.</p>
               <p>Had it not been for their Neighbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Nation of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> they had
never arrived to the liberty of a Free
State, yet ſo ungratefull have they
been, that they have endeavoured to
forget all the Obligations of Humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and have digged into the very
Bowels of thoſe who did preſerve
them. Many Examples of this may be
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:51477:77"/>
inſtanced; I ſhall look a little back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
on the cruelty of their proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
in the Eaſt <hi>Indies,</hi> before their ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died
malice at <hi>Amboyna,</hi> and afterwards
of their horrid Maſſacre at <hi>Amboyna</hi> it
ſelf. As their Avarice was unſatisfied,
ſo their quarrels with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were
many; Covetouſneſs and Ambition
not long enduring a Co-partner.</p>
               <p>Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> being tranſlated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a better World, and the <hi>Hollanders</hi>
(to be the more ready to ſet the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
at nought,) having by the Aſſiſtance
of Sir <hi>Ralph Winwood</hi> got the Cautio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Towns into their own Poſſeſſion,
they preſently began to appear in their
true Colours, by adding Cruelty to
Hypocriſie, and Avarice to Inſolence;
The <hi>Engliſh</hi> that were Trafficking in
the Eaſt <hi>Indies</hi> being ſenſible thereof,
and finding no redreſs, preferred their
Juſt Complaints to the Majeſty of King
<hi>Iames,</hi> on which enſued the firſt Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in the year, One thouſand ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and thirteen, in the City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
and after that, another Treaty in
the year, One thouſand ſix hundred
and fifteen, at the <hi>Hague</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:51477:78"/>
which taking up much time to little
effect; there was a third Treaty which
was held in <hi>London</hi> in the year, One
thouſand ſix hundred and nineteen,
touching the Differences between the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> in the Eaſt <hi>Indies,</hi> in
which a full and ſolemn Compoſition
was made, and a fair Order ſet as to
the Management of the Affairs for the
Time to come; but ſo reſtleſs were the
Spirits of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
the entire Maſters of the profits
of the <hi>Indies,</hi> that having driven from
thence the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Portugals,</hi> they
at the laſt determined with themſelves
by ſubtility as well as ſtrength, to force
from thence the <hi>Engliſh</hi> alſo; In pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance
whereof, ſome four years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the moſt Barbarous Proceedings
at <hi>Amboyna,</hi> they endeavoured to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſs
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> of the Iſlands of <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,
Polleroone,</hi> and ſome others, famous
for the Rich Spices of Nutmeggs,
Cloves and Mace; and underſtanding
by one of their Spies, that Captain
<hi>Courtupe</hi> was gone from his Houſe and
Factory in <hi>Polleroon</hi> to one of the
adjacent Clove-Iſlands, called <hi>Lantore,</hi>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:51477:78"/>
they did ſhoot him as he was in his
Boat upon his Return, and being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the cauſe of ſo unexpected a
Murther, they ſent word to the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
that they ſhould take no more care for
him, for he was dead, and he ſhould be
buried; Although this was a great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> that were
there in their Occupation of Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize,
yet ſome were afterwards ſo ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turous,

which the enſuing Narration will

who ſo much ſtrengthened and inabled him to
undergoe thoſe heavy Tortures and Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures

raiſed a Factory in the Iſland of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tore,</hi>
but ſayling from <hi>Iaccatra,</hi> now by

the Natives to ſurrender the Iſland in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their Hands and Cuſtody; Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
they thought to have prevailed
upon them with perſwaſions, and fair
words fayling; they would make uſe of
foul, and threaten them with Sword
and Fire; And although they were
not ignorant that a Treaty had been
held in <hi>London,</hi> and a full Compoſition
for the ending of all Controverſies, yet
they informed the Natives, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they had given the Iſland to the
King of <hi>England,</hi> they need not to fear
to diſclaim what they had done by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
them to become Maſters of it,<note place="margin">Ibid pa. 12, <hi>and</hi> 13.</note> for
they ſaid they could, nay, and they
would interpoſe between all Dangers
and them, and aſſured them that they
had Strength enough to defend them
againſt all the Nations in the World;
They only deſired of them a Seizin of
ſecurity to enjoy the profit of their
Fruits on thoſe Terms which the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi>
had conditioned with them. The
Natives of the Iſland being hereat in a
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:51477:79"/>
great perplexity, and doubting amongſt
themſelves what might be the event, if
they refuſed a proffer, which carried
an Obligation of ſo much ſafety with
it, did Addreſs themſelves unto the
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> and deſired of them to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
how they might ſecure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
from that deceitfull and cruell
Generation of men, whoſe perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
were as plauſible, as their threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
terrible; And underſtanding by
the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that they expected a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
Recruit both of Men and Ships
to come ſuddainly unto them, they
were reſolved to be Couragious, and
not to yield to their treacherous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions:
In this apprehenſion, the
<hi>Dutch</hi> not long afterwards deſired of
them after ſome flattering Aſſeverati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to give them, <hi>A Seizin of Security;</hi>
At which the Natives pretending Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
told them, that they knew not
the ſignification of the World, and
ſeemed to be extraordinarily curious to
underſtand the Interpretation of it; At
which the <hi>Dutch</hi> with as much Mirth as
Confidence, having whiſpered amongſt
themſelves, did after ſome delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:51477:80"/>
tell them, That they muſt bring a
great Braſs Baſon filled with Earth,
and plant in the middle of it the
Branch of a Nutmeg-Tree laden with
Fruit, and cauſe it to be preſented to
them by the Chiefeſt Men of their
Iſlands; And this they told them was
the Sence and Interpretation of the
word.</p>
               <p>The Natives having received this
Anſwer, did ſuddainly acquaint the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> with it, to whom they were
more inclined then to the <hi>Dutch,</hi> as all
the reſt of thoſe Nations are; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
adviſed with one another, they
told the <hi>Dutch</hi> in plain terms, that their
Demands were Impoſſibilities, for
ſhould they recede from what already
they had done, both God and Man
might juſtly brand them with Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
for to their apprehenſions, they
ſeemed to un-intereſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> of
what was their proper Title, which by
no means they could be induced to
conſent unto; At which the <hi>Hollanders</hi>
being much incenſed, told them, that
ſince no perſwaſions would allure them
to a knowledge of their own Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:51477:80"/>
they muſt expect to find the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of their obſtinacy, for rather then
be fruſtrated of their Intentions, they
were reſolved to make a Benefire of
the Iſland, they did adviſe them, not
to truſt to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſtrength which
could ſtand in no Competition with
theirs, for they owned them but as a
Handfull in compariſon with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>This Diſpute being fruſtrated, and
the <hi>Dutch</hi> finding the Natives of the
Iſland to be intractable to their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
they prepared a great Veſſel
which they had with Battery Guns,
with a reſolution forthwith to Aſſault
the Town; This great Ship was called
the <hi>Float<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and beſides her, they had in a
readineſs other leſs Ships that lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
that part of the Town, where the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Factory was; Having for two
dayes planted their Batteries, and play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
againſt that place where by the
Flaggs and Pendants of the Red Croſs,
they found the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Factory to be,
and finding the Event not to anſwer
the expectation, on the firſt of <hi>March,</hi>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:51477:81"/>
(five dayes after their firſt Aſſault)
they found the means to Land their
Men, and Enter the Town; they had
placed in their Front a conſiderable
number of the Nation of <hi>Japan</hi> being
all armed with Guns like unto Culli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
with barrels of Braſs, who making
way for the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> did ſuch Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that the Out-cry in the Streets
was terrible,<note place="margin">Ibidem pa. 18.</note> Men, Women, and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
being cut in pieces, and the Town
a Shamble of dead perſons. The <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
being but few in number were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
Priſoners, and ſaluted with the
Titles of baſe Rogues and Villains,
they were bound unto poſts by Hands
and Neck, they were bruiſed, beaten
and buffered, they were afterwards ty'd
back to back, and ſo the ſtronger was
inforced to carry the weaker to one of
the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ships, called the <hi>Holland,</hi>
where they were laden with Irons, and
tormented with variety of Tortures;
Inſomuch,<note place="margin">Ibidem pa. 20.</note> that the Author of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
who was a Factor at <hi>Lantore,</hi>
and one of thoſe who did partake in
theſe grievous torments, hath theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
words; <hi>For my own part, I ſeriouſly
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:51477:81"/>
protest, that if it pleaſed God, the great
Determiner of all things, to command me to
yield my Body to be Tortured, I had rather by
far chooſe the</hi> Turkiſh <hi>then the</hi> Dutch
<hi>Tormentors, for their Cruelties I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
are far tranſcending the</hi> Turkiſh <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities,
and I know their viperous incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
to the</hi> Engliſh <hi>will not be conſuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
untill their compleated Iury ſhall ſurfeit
it ſelf into an unparalleld Revenge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Many dayes were they thus Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented,
and ſome of them being moſt
ſadly troubled with the Flux, theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifull
people would not let them
out of their Bolts, but compelled them
to uſe the ſame Diſh to receive their
Excrements, in which all of them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
did eat their meat; theſe things
were unſavoury indeed, but theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane
Creatures would not be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of their Calamities; At the laſt it
pleaſed God, that ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships
ſayling that way, and being informed
what the <hi>Dutch</hi> had acted at <hi>Lantore,</hi> one
of the Captains, Captain <hi>Fitz Herbert</hi>
by Name, ſent to the <hi>Dutch</hi> to Demand
the Priſoners, who being conveyed to
his Ship, he wondered at their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſightly
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:51477:82"/>
complexion, and the lameneſs
of their bodies, the one being eaten in
with Irons, and the other quite decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for want of eating; By his means
their Releaſe being obtained, they had
liberty to depart to the Iſland of <hi>Polle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here they continued not long,
but the <hi>Dutch</hi> who would have no Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories
in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> but their own,
did again ſeize upon them, and having
plundred them to their very ſhirts,
they Impriſoned them in a Caſtle
which was in that Iſland, where they
continued enduring many Extremities
until the noiſe of their ſufferings, and
durance being again divulged, they
were again relieved by ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi>
ſhips that paſſed that way; And the
reaſon why they uſed ſo much cruelty
to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> being demanded, no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing being to be laid unto their
Charge, but onely their buying of
Cloves upon the Iſlands; the <hi>Dutch</hi> at
their Diſcharge told the Priſoners, that
in regard they were the firſt <hi>Engliſh</hi>-Men
that ever they took buying of
Cloves upon that Iſland, they were
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:51477:82"/>
willing to ſpare their lives, but if for
the time to come, they ſhould ever
take an <hi>Engliſh</hi>-Man in the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
they would not be ſo favourable
as to hang him, but they would whip
him to Death; And ſpeaking in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> they have been
heard to ſpeak words to this Effect.
Alas! what is <hi>England</hi> if compared to
our High and Mighty States of the <hi>Nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands,</hi>
we know that we have Ships
enough to block up all the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and
if any difference ſhould ariſe, the proof
ſhould manifeſt the truth, for they
would ſhow us what the <hi>Dutch</hi> Men
were, if ever they could find opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to put their Deſigns in Agitation;

of ſo ſad a ſubject; <hi>I protest,</hi>
ſaith he, <hi>and ſhall be ready at any time to
juſtifie it with my life, that I have not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
any thing but what is really correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondent
to the truth, and I am very much aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured,
that there be thoſe now living, who
can teſtifie with me the many Tragioal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns,
that have not onely been acted on us,

               <p>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:51477:83"/>
Neither was this their Arrogancy,
and Cruelty expreſſed to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
but the Inhabitants of <hi>China</hi> have
had the ſad Experience of it, it being
the common practiſe of the <hi>Dutch</hi> to
ſeize upon their Veſſels as they came
down to Traſſique in thoſe Rivers, and
and having plundered their ſhips, to
drown the Men.</p>
               <p>In the year, One thouſand ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and ſeventeen, the Inhabitants of
the <hi>Banda</hi> Iſlands, made a Preſent to
Captain <hi>Ball,</hi> at that time Preſident of
<hi>Bantam,</hi> and beſought him that he
would ſo far be pleaſed to compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate
their ſorrowfull conditions, as
to accept of their Preſent, and receive
their Iſlands into his Juriſdiction, by
defending them from the Tyrannies of
the intruding and unmerciful <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
whoſe practiſe it was, daily to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
upon them, and to murther them at
their pleaſures, and to abuſe their
Wives whiles themſelves were infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to look on, and not dare in the leaſt
to reſiſt them; Moreover their Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs
was ſuch, and ſo habitual to
them, that it was almoſt a wonder to
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:51477:83"/>
ſee them ſober; they told him, if he
were pleaſed to accept of what they
proffered, he ſhould very much oblige
them, and no wayes prejudice himſelf
nor the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation. To which
Captain <hi>Ball</hi> replyed, that he much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
their misfortune, but in regard
that they had made a ſurrender of their
Iſland already to the <hi>Dutch,</hi> it was not
conſonant to Reaſon, that he ſhould
take away that by force from the <hi>Dutch,</hi>
which they had obtained by favour,
he therefore deſired them to ceaſe
their importunity; to which the <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daneſes</hi>
replyed, that if that were all the
obſtacle, it might eaſily be removed,
for they generally proteſted, they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
gave the leaſt conſent to the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi>
to poſſeſs their Iſlands, but that
they wilfully and violently entred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them without their conſent, and
though that oftentimes they had deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
yet the <hi>Dutch</hi> had never received
any aſſurance of ſubmiſſion from
them, the unworthineſs of their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
having deterred the <hi>Bandaneſes</hi>
from condeſcending to their perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Hereupon Captain <hi>Ball</hi> became
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:51477:84"/>
willing to receive them into his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
to the great comfort of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
<hi>Indians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Captain <hi>Ball</hi> continued Preſident
not long after, for Captain <hi>Iourdan</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
with Sir <hi>Thomas Dailes</hi> Fleet, in
the year, 1618. at what time Captain
<hi>Ball</hi> was commanded home; howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the Cruelties againſt the poor <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deneſes</hi>
in many of their Iſlands ſtill
continued, and grew to ſuch a height,
that they hardly could be parallel'd,
and for no other cauſe, but that their
Affections were ſo generally, and ſo
ſervently expreſſed towards the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mention hath already been made of
the taking of the Chief Town in the
Iſland of <hi>Lantore,</hi> and how barbarouſly
the <hi>Dutch</hi> dealt with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Factory
there; It is worthy your obſervation,
that the greateſt part of the Inhabitants
flying for their ſafety into the higheſt
Hills of that Iſland, were courted by
the <hi>Dutch</hi> to ſubmit, and ſurrender
themſelves, and that they ſhould be
received into favour and protection;
Hereupon they came down in great
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:51477:84"/>
numbers, and four hundred of the
Chiefeſt of them being picked out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the reſt, they were tranſported
into an adjacent Iſland, where having
waſhed themſelves, accordingly as
they had been adviſed, they were all
invited to a great dinner, and intreated
with many welcomes; they told them,
they were heartily ſorry that they
ſhould ſo much diſtruſt them as to fly
to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> there being none that
deſired their ſafety and welfare more
then themſelves, and that they would
be friend them againſt all Oppoſers;
they deſired that all differences what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
may be abſolutely compoſed;
and all former injuries forgotten; to
which purpoſe, to give them a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation
of their Reſpects, they had
tranſported them thither, and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
what for the preſent could be had
for their Refreſhment. The Poor In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
being much ſurprized at this
unuſual manner of Reſpect, having fed
heartily, and expreſſed their thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
prepared for their departure, but
the <hi>Dutch</hi> leading them to a window,
told them, that they muſt walk to yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:51477:85"/>
Green, and take their Farewell of
them there, for there their Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners
ſtood in a readineſs to diſpatch
them; whereat the poor <hi>Bandeneſes</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
much amazed, cryed out, <hi>O Apetow!</hi>
which is in <hi>Engliſh, O what is this!</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
they were hurried away to
the place of Execution, and by the <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan</hi>
Slaves, the cruel Inſtruments of the
<hi>Hollanders,</hi> they were cut aſunder in
the middle alive, and their divided
Quarters were ſent ſome of them to
<hi>Lantore,</hi> ſome of them to <hi>Polleroon,</hi> and
other Iſlands belonging unto <hi>Banda.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the ſame year, they put to Death
the Chiefeſt of the Inhabitants of <hi>Polle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roon,</hi>
amongſt whom was the Chief
Prieſt of that Iſland, in whoſe ſide the
<hi>Dutch</hi> having cut a hole, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
that Gun-powder ſhould be
put into it, which at that inſtant being
ſet on fire, by a new way of torment
they deprived him of his life.</p>
               <p>It is very obſervable, that although
theſe Inhabitants of <hi>Polleroon</hi> were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Protection, yet their
numbers being inconſiderable to the
ſtrength of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> durſt
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:51477:85"/>
not contradict them; So that theſe
poor people were not only murdered
before their faces; but the <hi>Engliſh</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
how Tyrahnical withall the
<hi>Dutch</hi> were, and how incroaching upon
them, and what were their cruelties
which they practiſed at <hi>Amboyna,</hi> of
which more in its due place; in the

               <p>And in this place I ſhall not forget to
give you the memorable account of
the innumerable Shoales of <hi>Mackerell</hi>
which was the Chiefeſt thing that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
thoſe Iſlands, they came always
in their ſeaſon in great Multitudes,
and if at any time they appeared not
ſo numerous, they were ſure to have
arrived within the limits of two or
three dayes, and in far greater abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
then uſually before; but after
that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had left thoſe Iſlands,
they did forſake them alſo, as places
polluted with Blood, and Avarice, or

as if they would come to no Coaſts,

<hi>Iourdan</hi> ſayling from <hi>Bantham</hi> with
two Ships, the one called the <hi>Sampſon,</hi>
the other the <hi>Hound,</hi> to the great Iſlands
of <hi>Burnew,</hi> he diſcovered three or four
<hi>Dutch</hi> Ships ſtanding in for the ſame
Port, and being confident that they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
no good to him, he gave order
to prepare for the Encounter, fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving
to fight it out to the laſt Man,
rather then to yield himself to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merciful
hands of his Inſulting and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
Enemies; the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to deliver the Ships
upon fair Quarter, but Captain <hi>Iourdan</hi>
a well complexioned Man, who had a
great heart in a little body, abſolutely
refuſed to yield upon any Condition
whatſoever. The <hi>Dutch</hi> pretending
to be unwilling to ſhed blood, called
out to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and told them, that
they knew very well that little Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Iourdan</hi> was there, and deſired
them to perſwade him to Parley with
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:51477:86"/>
them; Captain <hi>Iourdan</hi> being inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of it, refuſed to have any conference
with them; whereupon they deſired
that he would but ſhow himſelf upon
the Quarter Deck, that by a fair com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance
they might ſtop the effuſion of
blood, which otherwiſe muſt come to
paſs; Whereupon Captain <hi>Iourdan</hi>
(thinking that to ſpeak with them
could not much prejudice him) did
ſhow himſelf on the Quarter Deck, &amp;
after the exchange of ſome few words;
told them, that he knew the Juſtice of
his Cauſe, and the Injuſtice of Theirs,
and was reſolved to fight it out: The
<hi>Hollander</hi> alledging that their ſtrength
was far greater then his, and it was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Deſparateneſs then true Valour
to fight upon ſuch a Diſadvantage; it
prevailed nothing at all with Captain
<hi>Iourdan,</hi> who told them, he queſtioned
not his own ſtrength, but was reſolved
to fight it out, and to leave the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
unto God. The <hi>Dutch</hi> finding him
intractable to their Demands, did hold
him ſtill in Diſcourſe, until a Muſquet
Bullet from one of their ſhips laid him
dead upon the Deck, as he was in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:51477:87"/>
with them: At that very inſtant of
time, whether by Treachery, or by
Accident it is uncertain, a part of our
other <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship called the <hi>Hound,</hi> was
blown up, and many of our men mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
hurt; the Amazement was ſo
great, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were inforced to
yield to the mercy of their Enemies,
who having taken them, did cauſe
them to be laden with bolts, and did
not allow them ſo much favour as to
the Heathen, for they were permitted
to walk up and down with a chain of
Iron, which is far more eaſie then to
lye in bolts of Iron.</p>
               <p>Thus may we obſerve, what injury
and wrong we have all along ſuſtained
by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who have got many of
thoſe Iſlands where now they have
ſeated themſelves by cruelty and
blood-ſhed, and by murthering the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> and their Friends; Theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
are ſad Relations, and though diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall
in themſelves, they are but the
Prologues to the Tragedy at <hi>Amboyna.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Amboyna</hi> is an Iſland lying near unto
<hi>Seran,</hi> fruitful of Cloves, for the buying
and gathering whereof the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:51477:87"/>
Company had for their parts planted
five Factories, the Chiefeſt whereof
was at the Town of <hi>Amboyna;</hi> but the
<hi>Hollanders</hi> who had already diſpoſſeſſed
them of their reſidence at <hi>Polleroon,</hi> and
at <hi>Lantore,</hi> had a labouring deſire to
heave them out alſo at <hi>Amboyna,</hi> and at
<hi>Bonda,</hi> ſeveral complaints and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
did every day ariſe, which were
transferred to <hi>Iaccatra</hi> in the Iſland of
<hi>Iava Major</hi> to the Council of Defence
of both Nations there reſiding, who
alſo not agreeing in points of differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
did ſend them over into <hi>Europe</hi> to
be decided by both Companies here,
or if they could not agree amongſt
themſelves, they ſhould then be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
by the Kings Majeſty, and the
Lords the States General according to
the Article of the Treaty in the year
One thouſand ſix hundred and nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen,
which although it was then Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cled
and Agreed upon by both Nations,
yet the Ambition and Avarice of the
<hi>Dutch,</hi> would not admit of ſo delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rute
a courſe, but with raſh hands
would of themſelves cut their way to
their own ends, and uſe neither delay
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:51477:88"/>
nor conſcience where gain or profit did
appear. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Factories at <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boyna</hi>
began to be rich, and were a great
eye-fore unto them who could not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
that any ſhould Traffick there
but themſelves; On the eleventh
therefore of <hi>February,</hi> in the year, One
thouſand ſix hundred and twenty two,
a <hi>laponen</hi> who ſerved the <hi>Dutch</hi> as a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
was apprehended upon ſuſpition
of Treaſon, and put to the Torture, the
pretenſe was for aſking the Sentinel,
what was the ſtrength of the Caſtle?
The Extremity of the Torture was
ſuch, that it prompted him to confeſs
whatſoever he perceived they would
have him to ſay, which was, that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and ſundry others of his Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
there had contrived the taking of
the Caſtle; Upon this confeſſion
(which made a great noyſe amongſt
the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and adminiſtred them a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
upon which to act, even according
to their own deſires) divers other <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poners</hi>
were examined and tortured;
This Examination continued four
dayes, during which time, diverſe <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi>
Men that belonged to the Factory,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:51477:88"/>
had every day their ingreſs into the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle</hi>
and egreſs from it, they heard of the
torturing of the <hi>Japoners,</hi> and of the
crime laid to their charge, never drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of the bait that was prepared for
themſelves: at the ſame time there was
Priſoner in the Caſtle one <hi>Abel Price,</hi>
an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man, for threatning in a
drunken humour to ſet a <hi>Dutch</hi> Mans
houſe on fire: The <hi>Dutch</hi> being glad
they had ſuch an Inſtrument to work
on in their Cuſtody, they ſhowed him
ſome of the <hi>Japoners</hi> whom moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly
they had Tortured, and told
him, they had confeſſed that the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
had combined with them for the taking
of the Caſtle; whereupon having put
him alſo to the Torture, they enforced
him to confeſs whatſoever they deſired
of him; Immediately upon this, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Towerſon</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
that were in <hi>Amboyna,</hi> were ſent for to
the Governour of the Caſtle: They in
obedience to the command, did all of
them repair unto him, one man ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,
that was left to keep the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory;
The Governour told Captain
<hi>Towerſon,</hi> that he and many other of the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:51477:89"/>
                  <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation were Accuſed of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy
to ſurprize the Caſtle, and
were to remain under Cuſtody untill
a further Tryal; inſtantly they attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the perſon that was left at home in
the Factory, and the Merchandize of
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Company was taken into
the <hi>Dutch</hi> Cuſtody by Inventory; All
their Cheſts, Boxes, Books, Writings,
and whatſoever was of any Value in
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Houſe were ſeized on, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Towerſon</hi> was committed to his
Chamber, having a Guard of <hi>Dutch</hi>
Souldiers; <hi>Emanuel Thomſon,</hi> one of the
Chiefeſt of the Factors, was kept Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner
in the Caſtle, ſeven others, <hi>viz.
John Beaumont, Edward Collins, William
Webber, Ephraim Ramſey, Timothy John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
John Fardo,</hi> and <hi>William Brown</hi> were
ſent aboard the Ships of the <hi>Hollanders</hi>
then in Harbour, ſome to one ſhip,
ſome to another, and all made faſt in
Irons: The reſt of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> that were
in the other Factories in the ſame
Iſland were apprehended; <hi>Samuel Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
John Clark, George Sharrock</hi> were
found in the Factory at <hi>Hitto,</hi> and <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Collins, William Webber,</hi> and <hi>John
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:51477:89"/>
Sadler</hi> in the Factory at <hi>Larica,</hi> who
were all brought Priſoners to <hi>Amboyna.
John Powel, John Weatheral,</hi> and <hi>Thomas
Ladbrook</hi> were apprehended at <hi>Cambello,</hi>
and <hi>John Beaumont, William Griggs,</hi> and
<hi>Ephraim Ramſey</hi> at <hi>Loho,</hi> and brought in
Irons to <hi>Amboyna</hi> on the <hi>20th.</hi> day of
<hi>February.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean time the Governour
and the Fiſcal intend to loſe no oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity,
in the proſecution of the fine
Plot that was contrived; <hi>John Beaumont,</hi>
and <hi>Timothy Johnſon</hi> are ſent for from
aboard the <hi>Unicorn;</hi> Being come into
the Caſtle, <hi>Beaumont</hi> was left with a
Guard in the Hall, and <hi>Johnſon</hi> was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
into the place of Torture, where by
and by to the great grief and aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his heart and underſtanding,
<hi>Beaumont</hi> heard him to make a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable
Out-cry, and then to be ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
for a little while, and not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
to be as loud in his hideous
complaints, if not louder then before;
After this Torture <hi>Abel Price</hi> the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgion,
who was firſt of all wracked,
was brought in to accuſe him; But
<hi>Johnſons</hi> heart being as ſtout as it was
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:51477:90"/>
innocent, and not confeſſing any thing,
he was remanded to the Torture again,
where <hi>Beaumont</hi> heard him to roar, and
ceaſe from roaring, and then to roar
out again, enough to ſoften the hardeſt
ſtones into compaſſion; Having been
a whole hour in this Purgatory of Fire
and Water, they brought him forth
wet all over, and burned in ſeverall
places of his body, and ſo laid aſide in
a by-place in the Hall, with a Souldier
to watch him that he ſhould ſpeak to
no man. After him <hi>Emanuel Tompſon</hi>
was examined in a room adjoyning to
that where <hi>Johnſon</hi> had been Tortured,
where being an hour and a half in his
Examination, and his Torment, he
was carried another way, and paſſed
not through the Hall, where <hi>Beaumont</hi>
attended, and every hour expected the
dreadfull ſummons; At the laſt, <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi>
was called in, and with deep pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations
denying what was propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to him, he was made faſt to the
Rack, and the cloath being tyed about
his Neck, and two men with Jarrs of
Water in their hands being ready to
pour it on his head, the Governour
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:51477:90"/>
commanded that he ſhould be taken
down again ſaying, that he would for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
him a day or two longer, becauſe
he was an Old Man.</p>
               <p>The next day being Sunday, <hi>Robert
Brown</hi> was called in, and being on the
Rack, and the Torment of Water gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him, he confeſſed all as the Fiſcal
aſked. After him was <hi>Edward Collins</hi>
called in, whoſe Hand and Feet being
faſtned to the Rack, he prayed to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpited,
ſaying, he would confeſs all;
But being let down, with great Oaths
and Execrations he proteſted his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
as before, yet told them, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he knew that by Torture, they
would: make him to confeſs any thing,
though never ſo contrary to the Truth,
they ſhould do him a great favour to
tell him what they would have him to
confeſs, and he would acknowledge it
to avoid the torture; At which the Fiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
being angry, he was hoyſted up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
and the Torment of Water being
given him, he was not able to endure
it, but prayed to be let down again to
his Confeſſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> After which having
deliberated a little with himſelf, he
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:51477:91"/>
confeſſed he had a hand in the Plot for
the ſurpriſal of the Caſtle, and being
demanded of the Fiſcal, whether Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Towerſon</hi> were not an Aſſociate in
the Conſpiracy; He Anſwered, No;
Whereupon the Fiſcal told him, that
he lied, for ſaid he, Did not he call all
of you of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Factories unto
him, and tell you, that the daily Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts
and Abuſes of the <hi>Dutch</hi> had put
a Plot into his head, and that he want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
nothing but your Conſent and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy
<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> A <hi>Dutch</hi> Merchant ſtanding by
ſaid; And did not you all ſwear upon
the Bible to be ſecret to him? <hi>Collins</hi>
with great Proteſtations replyed, that
he knew nothing at all of it: Being
then delivered again into the hands of
the Executioner, the ſenſe of the late
Torture ſo prevailed upon him, that he
confeſſed all to be true which they had
ſpoken. Being thus reſpited, he was
demanded, whether the Preſident of
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> at <hi>Iaccatra,</hi> or Maſter <hi>Welden</hi>
Agent for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> at <hi>Banda</hi> were not
privy to the buſineſs; to which he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
anſwered, No; Afterwards the
Fiſcal propounded other Interrogato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:51477:91"/>
unto him, and perceiving that <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins</hi>
knew not what anſwer to make,
he helped him to confeſs thoſe things
which he thought moſt conducing to
his purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Next to him was <hi>Samuel Colſon</hi>
brought in, who for fear of the pain
when he ſaw <hi>Edward Collins</hi> come forth,
choſe rather to deny nothing that was
propounded to him then undergo the
Torments of Fire and Water in the
Atteſtation of his Innocence: But <hi>Iohn
Clark</hi> was of another Reſolution, he
was no ſooner brought in by the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
and Officers, but by and by he
was heard to make a hideous and a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable
complaint, which continued
for the ſpace of two hours, during
which time as they abated or increaſed
his Torments, he diminiſhed or dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
his cryes at the Senſe and horrour
of his Sufferings. The two Elements
of Fire and Water, although merciles
of themſelves, by making their Fury
more deliberate, were here inſtructed
to be more unmercifull, whiles accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
cruelty did torment even inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
it ſelf to torment the Innocent;
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:51477:92"/>
The Rack ordained for the confeſſion
of great and grievous Offences is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
but an unfaithfull diſcoverer
of them; for whiles men are put to
thoſe torments, which Fleſh and Blood
are not able to endure, they confeſs
thoſe crimes which their Fleſh and
Blood were no wayes acceſſary to.
Two hours was this poor Man under
the torment of Fire and Water, yet
confeſſed not any thing, at which his
Tormentors being amazed, they did
cut off his hair, thinking belike, that
the ſtrength of his Reſolution lay in his
hair, when indeed it lay in the Juſtice
of his Cauſe, and the Innocence of his
Conſcience. Afterwards they hoyſed
him up again, and with lighted candles
they did burn him in the bottom of his
feet, untill the moiſture that dropped
from them did put out the candles, yet
even then they applyed freſh lights
unto him; They burnt him alſo in the
elbows, and in the palms of his hands,
and ſo horridly under his arm-pits,
that his Inwards might evidently be
ſeen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> At the laſt, when they percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
that he could make no handſome
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:51477:92"/>
Confeſſion, they led him along with queſtions
of particular circumſtances which they had fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of themſelves; And being wearied and
overcome with Torments, he at laſt, according
to their own wiſhes, made Anſwer to whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they demanded of him. Being then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed
from his Martyrdom, they ſent him out
by four <hi>Negroes,</hi> who carried him between them
to a Dungeon, where he lay five dayes without
any Chyrurgian to dreſs his wounds, untill his
fleſh being putrified great Maggots creeped and
dropped from him in a moſt loathſom, and noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
manner.</p>
               <p>In the like manner, the reſt were all Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
but none of them were ſo heavily Tortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
for ſome of them to avoid the Torment,
made ſuddain Confeſſions, others at the firſt or
ſecond drenching with the water, Anſwered to
all the Interrogatories of the Fiſcal. Captain
<hi>Towerſon</hi> himſelf being reſerved amongſt the
laſt, untill the Torments of thoſe that were Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined
before him might Rack out ſomething
from them that might Evidence againſt Him,
was brought into the Court, where theſe youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
of <hi>Holland,</hi> like another Council of <hi>Reho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam</hi>
ſate in Judgement upon Him, he deeply
did proteſt his Innocence, to Encounter which
they produced the Perſons and Confeſſions of
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:51477:93"/>
                  <hi>Samuel Colſon, William Griggs,</hi> and <hi>John Fardo,
Samuel Colſon</hi> being told, that unleſs he would
make good his former Confeſſion againſt Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Towerſon,</hi> he ſhould be commanded again to
the Torture of Fire and Water, did coldly and
faintly re-affirm what before he ſaid, and ſo was
diſmiſſed; the other two being brought face to
face before Captain <hi>Towerſon,</hi> he charged them,
as they would Anſwer it at the dreadful Day of
Judgement to ſpeak nothing but the truth, at
which both of them trembled down upon their
knees, and beſought him for GOD's ſake to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
them, they openly acknowledged that
that whatſoever they formerly had confeſſed
was moſt falſe, and ſpoken only to avoid the
Torment; Upon theſe words the Fiſcal, and
the reſt of this High Court of Juſtice did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
them again to the Torture, which they
would not endure, but affirmed their former
Confeſſion to be true.</p>
               <p>I do find this Torment was ſo terrible to Fleſh
and Blood, that it even ſtartled the Courage of
Captain <hi>Towerſon</hi> himſelf, who either to avoid
the horrour of the Torment, or the infamy of it,
confeſſed ſome words which the Factor of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bello</hi>
in the Iſle of <hi>Seran,</hi> Maſter <hi>John Weatherall</hi>
ſhould ſpeak, who being ſent for, and Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
on the day following, the Captain was
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:51477:93"/>
brought forth to juſtifie what before he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed,
who deſiring Mr. <hi>Wedtheral</hi> to ſpeak the
truth, and nothing but the truth as God ſhould
put it into his heart; Mr. <hi>Weatheral</hi> was in a
great Amazement, and being ordered to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go
the torture of water, and told, that if water
would not make him to confeſs, fire ſhould; he
prayed them to tell him what he ſhould ſay, or
to write down what they themſelves pleaſed,
and he would ſubſcribe unto it; but being told
that he needed no Tutor, and that they would
make him to confeſs of himſelf, having hoyſted
him up four ſeveral times, and perceived that
he knew not what to ſay, they did read unto
him the Confeſſion of the other Men that had
been Examined, and aſked him from point to
point, and he obſerving very well which way
the world did go, and that his Life muſt become
a Sacrifice to the Rage and Rapine of the <hi>Dutch,</hi>
did ſtill anſwer yea unto all.</p>
               <p>On the 26 of <hi>February old stile,</hi> the Priſoners
were all brought into the great Hall of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
to be prepared for death, by their Miniſters,
being ſolemnly Condemned the day before,
ſome few of them found mercy, and had their
lives ſaved; Captain <hi>Towerſon,</hi> was kept apart
from the reſt, and ſo was Mr. <hi>Emanuel Tomſon,</hi>
but ſome of them by writing found the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:51477:94"/>
to leave a Teſtimony of their Innocence
behind, amongſt whom was Captain <hi>Towerſon,</hi>

theſe words; <hi>Firmed by the Firm of me</hi> Gabriel

                     <p>The <hi>Japoners</hi> were taken and brought to Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,

if the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had any hand in their Plot, which

Mr. <hi>Johnſon,</hi> Maſter <hi>Collins,</hi> and <hi>John

Arm-Pits, the Hands, and Soals of the Feet, with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
most miſerable Torment, of Water, ſome of
them being almoſt Tortured to Death, were forced to
confeſs that which they never knew, by reaſon of the
great Torment, which Fleſh and Blood is not able to
endure. Then were the reſt of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men
called, (amongſt whom I was one,) being wiſhed to

he would confeſs whatſoever they would have him:
And for my part, I alſo muſt confeſs that which I never

I would ſuffer, I confeſſed that, which (as I ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

to it for fear of Torment. At the laſt they did make
us to bear witneſs againſt Captain <hi>Towerſon,</hi> and by

they made Captain <hi>Towerſon</hi> to confeſs the like, for

               <p>Other Atteſtations there are to the ſame ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
which for brevities ſake I omit, I ſhall
only inſert, that all things being prepared for
Execution, the Condemned were brought forth
out of the Hall, and paſſed along by the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
where the Acquitted and Pardoned were,
who ſtood in the door to give and take the fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
of their Country-Men that were then go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Execution; Making a little ſtay for
this purpoſe, they intreated and charged thoſe
that were ſaved to bear witneſs to their Friends
in <hi>England</hi> of their Innocence, and that they
died not like Traytors, but as ſo many Innocents
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:51477:95"/>
meerly murthered by the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> whom they
prayed to God to forgive their blood-thirſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and to have mercy on their own ſouls.</p>
               <p>It is obſervable, that being brought into the
Yard, their Sentence was there read unto them
from a Gallery, and from thence they were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to the place of Execution, together with
Nine <hi>Japons</hi> and one <hi>Portugal,</hi> whom their ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
malice to give a better pretenſe unto
their cruelty, had contrived to be of the ſame
Confederacy: They did not go the ordinary
and ſhort way, but round about through the
Town, and were guarded with five Companies
of Souldiers, <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Amboyners,</hi> and the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
of the Iſland flocked together to behold
this Triumph of the <hi>Dutch</hi> over the Innocent
and Condemned <hi>Engliſh.</hi> And it is not to be
forgotten, that, on the day before, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Miniſters, that they might all
receive the Sacrament, as a Seal of the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of their ſins; which by no means would be
granted them; whereupon Maſter <hi>Colſon</hi> ſaid
unto them, You declare unto us the danger of
diſſimulation in this Caſe; But tell us, if we
ſuffer guiltleſs, being true believers in Chriſt
Jeſus, what ſhall our Reward be? The Miniſter
Anſwered, By how much the more Innocent
you are, by ſo much the Glorious ſhall be your
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:51477:96"/>
Reſurrection; Upon that word Mr. <hi>Colſon</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
him, and gave him his Purſe and ſuch
money as was in it, ſaying, <hi>Sir, God bleſs you, tell
<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

one unto another, begging forgiveneſs
for their falſe Accuſations, being wreſted from
them either by the pain, or by the fear of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
whereupon they all of them freely did
forgive one another, for none of them had been
ſo falſely Accuſed, but he himſelf had as falſely
Accuſed another. In particular <hi>George Sharrock</hi>
knecled down to <hi>John Clark</hi> and craved forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
at his hands, who freely did forgive him,
ſaying, <hi>How ſhall I look to be forgiven of God, if I

Suffering, and now alſo at the place of Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

               <p>They had prepared a Cloath of black Velvet

               <p>Having thus given you an Account of the

it is now high time to look to their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> where we ſhall find
their Cruelty as unparallel'd as their Avarice.</p>
               <p>The Perfidiouſneſs and Ingratitude of the
<hi>Hollanders</hi> to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> may be traced all along
ever ſince the ſhook of their Obedience to the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:51477:97"/>
King of <hi>Spain</hi> even unto this preſent time. But
we will paſs from their Hypocriſic and Cruelty
practiſed abroad, and look on their Actions at
Home; How, almoſt but the very other day, did
they labour to impoſe upon His. Majeſty, and
Sir <hi>George Downing,</hi> his Envoy Extraordinary, by
delivering Papers to many Publick Miniſters of
State at the <hi>Hague,</hi> as if His Majeſty and his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy
had been prepoſſeſſed with them, when
they had not the leaſt notice of any ſuch thing?
How have they ſeemed to be moſt deſirous of
Peace, when at the ſame time they have omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
no dayes, even thoſe appropriated for Holy
Duties to drive on their preparations for War?
How have they ſtood in defence of their vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
and unjuſt Proceedings, and inſtead of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing
their Injuries, they have increaſed
them? About three years ſince, they concluded
a Treaty with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and having ingaged,
that better order ſhould for the future be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
they have ſince heaped new Injuries to the
utter over-throw of all the Trade of His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties
Subjects in the <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West-Indies;</hi> Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
our Ships, the <hi>Hope-well,</hi> the <hi>Leopard,</hi> and
ſome others in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies;</hi> And the <hi>Charles,</hi>
the <hi>James,</hi> the <hi>Mary,</hi> the <hi>Sampſon,</hi> the <hi>Hopefull
Aduenture,</hi> the <hi>Speed-well</hi> on the Coaſt of <hi>Africa;</hi>
And after all theſe Acts of the Higheſt Injuſtice,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:51477:97"/>
and their utmoſt endeavours for driving on a
War, they would make the world believe that
his Majeſty is the firſt undertaker of it, who from
his own Mouth to their Ambaſſadour in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and by his Injunctions to Sir <hi>George Down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
his Miniſter at the <hi>Hague</hi> hath given ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and ſuch Remarkable Demonſtrations to
the contrary: What can they ſay to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial
of the complaints which Sir <hi>George Down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
exhibited to the States General, importing
that in the ſpace of a very few years almoſt
twenty <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships with their whole Lading,
to a very great value, have been ſeized upon in
a horrible manner, and the Men in them moſt
Barbarouſly, and moſt Inhumanely Treated,
being put into ſtinking and naſty Dungeons,
and Holes at <hi>Caſtel. del. Mina,</hi> where they did
lye bedded and bathed in their own Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
having nothing but bread and water gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
them, and not enough of that neither to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain
Nature, [their Bodies being under the
Fury of Exquiſite and Horrid Torments;] and
when any of them died, the living and the dead
were left together, and ſuch as out-lived that
cruelty, were expoſed in the woods to famine,
or to the mercy of wild beaſts in thoſe deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
Countries, or to be carried into Captivity
by the Natives by which means ſeveral Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:51477:98"/>
of His Majeſties Good Subjects have pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed
and been deſtroyed; And unto this hour,
notwithſtanding all ſollicitations and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
of his Majeſties Envoy, not one penny of
Satisfaction can be had, either for the loſs of the
Ships, or the Perſons concerned in any of them,
but to the contrary they have ever ſince hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
and ſhot at the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships that have An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chored
by them, and have took by force all the
Boats of thoſe Natives who have endeavoured
to come aboard them, and have ſeized alſo up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Boats that would go on ſhore, and
deprive them of all manner of Proviſion, nor
ſuffer ſo much as freſh water to be brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them; And to give a further proof of their
Confidence and Ambition, they have publiſhed
a Declaration, wherein they aſſume and chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
to themſelves a Right to that whole
Coaſt, to the Excluſion of all other Nations; Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though,
by Order from His Majeſty, Sir <hi>George
Downing,</hi> both in Publick Conferences with the
Deputies of the Lords General, as alſo with
thoſe of <hi>Holland</hi> in particular, hath at large Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated
His Majeſties Right, and Intereſt in
ſome part therein, having by his Subjects
bought the Ground of the King of that Country
for a valuable Conſideration, and built a Facto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thereon; And yet for all this, ſome of the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:51477:98"/>
                  <hi>Dutch-Weſt-India</hi> Company by Fraud and irea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery
have got into the place, and no hopes of
the Reſtitution of it, but they are reſolved to
keep by violence what they have gained by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit.
Moreover, what can they ſay for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
concerning their ſtirring up the King of
<hi>Fantin</hi> by rewards and ſums of Money, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
him with all manner of Arms and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition
for the ſurprizing of his Majeſties
Caſtle at <hi>Cormantin</hi> in the <hi>West-Indies;</hi> ſo that
an abſolute Neceſſity is impoſed upon his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
and his Subjects, either of loſing all that
have been actually taken from them, and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning
for ever that Trade it ſelf, or of beta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
themſelves to ſome other wayes for their
Relief; And what Hope is there of their Reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
back any place which they have once ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.
The Iſland of <hi>Polleroon</hi> hath been upon
ſurrendring back to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> ever ſince the
year, 1622. at which, by a Solemn and Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Treaty it was promiſed to be done; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
by another Treaty in the year, 1654. and
by an Order of the States General, and the <hi>Eaſt</hi>
Company of that Nation in the year, 1661.
and again by another Treaty in the year follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
And yet to this day, there is not the leaſt
mention of any thing Reſtored; And ſhould
any Man then think it ſtrange, that His Majeſty
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:51477:99"/>
after ſo long an experience of the perverſneſs
and deceitfulneſs of that Nation ſhould ſuffer
his Subjects to repoſſeſs themſelves of thoſe
places, which by the hand of Violence and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
they have forced from them.</p>
               <p>Now as for the buſineſs of the <hi>New-Neather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands,</hi>
as they are pleaſed to call it, It hath been
abundantly elſe-where prov'd, that the ſaid Land
is part of the Poſſeſsion of His Majeſties Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of <hi>New England,</hi> which their Charter plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and preciſely expreſſeth: And thoſe few
<hi>Dutch</hi> that have lived there heretofore, have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
there meerly upon the connivence and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferance
of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> which hath been permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to them ſo to do, ſo long as they demeaned
themſelves peaceably and quietly; but the <hi>Dutch</hi>
not contenting themſelves therewith, have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croached
more and more upon the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
their Laws and Cuſtoms, and endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to raiſe Contributions and Exciſes on
them, and in thoſe places where the <hi>Dutch</hi> had
never been, whereupon they have been neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitated
ſeveral times to ſend Souldiers for the
repulſing of them: Since the Concluſion for the
late Treaty the <hi>Dutch</hi> have made new Incurſions
upon the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and given them many new
Provocations, and have ordained a Tryal of
Cauſes amongſt themſelves, and a proceeding
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:51477:99"/>
by courſe of Arms, without any appealing into
<hi>Europe</hi> at all. And can any Prince then think
it ſtrange, eſpecially the King of <hi>France,</hi> if His
Majeſty of <hi>England</hi> ſuffer his Subjects to reſcue
themſelves from ſuch continual Vexations, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the King of <hi>France</hi> himſelf hath been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
this year, to Order his Subjects to re-poſſeſs
themſelves by force of Arms of a certain place
called <hi>Cayen,</hi> which the <hi>French</hi> alledge hath been
wrongfully kept from them by the <hi>Weſt-India</hi>
-Company of the <hi>Neatherlanders.</hi> As for the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Captain <hi>Holmes</hi> at <hi>Capo Verde</hi> in <hi>Guiney,</hi> a
complaint was no ſooner made to His Majeſty,
this laſt year, in the Moneth of <hi>June;</hi> But His

had given no Order nor Direction there into
Captain <hi>Holmes,</hi> and that upon his Return,
he would examine the buſineſs, and ſee that
Right ſhould be done according to the nature of
the Offence: In order whereunto, when Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Holmes</hi> was returned, His Majeſty ſent him
to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and being afterwards allowed the
liberty of ſome few dayes to follow his particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
