            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A SERMON Shevving How we ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have our selves in Gods house.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>PSALME 93. 6.</bibl>
               <q>Holinesse becometh thy house, O LORD, for ever.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Ut of this Text I must undertake three great tasks.</p>
            <p>The first, to shew what Gods house is; because this is the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of my Text. The second, to shew what God is; because he is the owner of it. The third, to shew what is that holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:17738:8"/>
and behaviour which becometh this house, and the owner. For the first, I must follow holy Scripture in describing of it. Gods house began with an Altar (as all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures arise from small seeds) built in the place where God appeared to Abraham the father of the faithfull Gen. 12. 7. <hi>And the Lord appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to Abraham, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an Altar unto the Lord, who appeared unto him.</hi> In the eighth verse following, it is said that he built an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, <hi>and called upon the name of the Lord.</hi> With this consent were our churches built, where God appeareth to us by his word read and preached. Secondly, by the Sacrament of the Altar, (as it is called by the fathers, and styled so in our own statute laws) in which<note place="margin">1. Edw. 6. c. 1. 1. Elisab. c. 2.</note> the sacrifice of our Lord Christ is remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, and represented unto his Father. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by promise of salvation, and the kingdome of heaven. And lastly, by prayer, in which God is called on, according to that of Isaiah 56. 7. <hi>My house shall be called the house of prayer.</hi> From hence appeareth, that the Altar is the principall part of Gods house, as being the cause and originall of all the rest.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Gods house is described in Gen. 28. by <hi>a stone,</hi> of which in the plurall number an house is made; and by <hi>a ladder,</hi> whose top reached up to heaven, as Jacob upon the stone dreamed; the angels went up and down
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:17738:8"/>
by it: and from thence the Lord spake to Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob: and when Jacob awoke he said, <hi>This is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.</hi> From whence we are taught, that, seeing Gods house is both <hi>Scala coeli,</hi> and <hi>Janua coeli, The ladder of heaven,</hi> and <hi>the gate of heaven,</hi> and that the angels use it, therefore we also should use and respect it as the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie and beaten way to that blessed place.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, as Gods house is here described by a dream, so in Exod. 3. it is described by a vision, the second mean of Gods appearing to the holy nation: according to that of Joel,<note place="margin">Joel 2. 28.</note> 
               <hi>Your old men shall dream dreams, and your young men shall see visions.</hi> In this vision Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses saw a bush burning with fire, and yet was not consumed. The bush burning expresseth the manners of Gods people in his house, who are to him as thorns to his sides: yet so mercifull is he, that he doth not consume us, though we be wood, and he <hi>A consuming</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hebr. 12. 29.</note> 
               <hi>fire.</hi> Can he ever be praised enough? <hi>For his</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 136.</note> 
               <hi>mercy endureth for ever.</hi> After this, God spake to Moses, and bad him to put off his shoes, because the place whereon he stood was holy ground. From hence Gods house is called <hi>A Sanctuary,</hi> that is to say, <hi>a holy place:</hi> and why? in regard of Gods speciall presence, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between him and man; as God here spake to Moses, and Moses to him, about the delivering his people from the hand of the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:17738:9"/>
Egyptians. Thus afterward the Tabernacle and the Temple were called <hi>Gods sanctuary;</hi> because there was the visible signe of Gods presence, called the <hi>Mercy-seat,</hi> from whence<note place="margin">Exod. 25. 17.</note> God spake to the high priest, and the high priest to the people. So again to this day all our churches are called <hi>Sanctuaries,</hi> as in many other regards, so especially in regard of the Lords table or high Altar at the upper end of them, which is Jesus Christs Mercy-seat; because there the memorie of the everlasting sacrifice is made, and presented to the holy Trinity. But why was Moses here command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to put off his shoes? To teach us, that when we come before God in his sanctuary, we should reverence him by putting off our vices, and especially our covetousnesse and earthly affections, which cleave to our souls, as the dust of the earth cleaveth to our shoes. And according to this, every sunday and holiday we shift our common and worldly clothes, to insinuate that we should put off our secular thoughts, and be endued with heavenly and spirituall thoughts, <hi>not doing our own will, nor</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isai. 58. 13.</note> 
               <hi>speaking our own</hi> vain <hi>words,</hi> but Gods words, and his ordinances.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Gods house is set forth in the old law by the Tabernacle, which was a tent or pavilion to be pitched, and taken up, as they travelled to the land of Canaan, the figure of heaven; which signifieth that Gods Church

in this life is a pilgrimage, and a passing to the place above; for which the 15 Psalmes of steps or degrees were made and used in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to teach that we ought continually to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell from the valley of tears, to the heavenly Jerusalem, by all the holy paces of vertues, and especially of charitie. The Psalmist speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">Psal. 84. 7.</note> of this travell, saith, <hi>They go from strength to strength, till every one appeare before God in Sion.</hi> Which if we apply to their Tabernacle, and to our going into Gods house; every time we go, an holy strength and refreshing is supplied unto us toward heavens Sion. In this Tabernacle, first was a laver of pure water set<note place="margin">Exod. 29. 4. and 40. 30.</note> at the doore of the Tabernacle of the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, for the priests to wash before they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted any part of their service: to which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth our holy Font, placed at the doore of our Sanctuaries, to wash all Christs people with the water of regeneration, before they be admitted to be of his number. And this is to teach us, that ever after we should come to this place with pure hearts to worship God: and the holy Font is to put us in minde of it. Next to this was the Altar of burnt-offering, which continually burnt, not with common fire, but with fire sent from heaven, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth Lev. 9. But because the law is now alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from materiall things to spirituall things, therefore our Altar next &amp; under the Altar of Christs sacrifice once offered, is the Altar of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:17738:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
our hearts: and our fire is the heavenly fire of charity, sent down into us from Christs Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: and whosoever offereth with any other fire, his sacrifice shall be no better accepted with God then Nadab's and Abihu's incense was, Levit. 10. Besides this, was the candlestick full of lamps shining with great light; which signified the exceeding light of the Gospell prophesied Isaiah 30. 26. when the light of the moon should be like the light of the sunne, and the light of the sunne should be seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, and like the light of seven dayes: which cannot be understood but of the spirituall light of the Gospell in holy doctrine. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to mend this among our selves, let our light be the light of faith, kindled with chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and not the light of idle and proud know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which can profit nothing. Further, there was the table of shew-bread, and the pot in which Manna was put, signifying the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bread of Christs body, from whence comes unto us the bread of his grace in holy charity, by which all good desires and endeavours are fed and maintained in our souls, as naturall heat is maintained by materiall bread. Lastly, there was the Altar of incense, which figured the most pleasant and sweet sacrifice of Christ for us, whereby we are brought into Gods favour after our many offences toward him. And thus much for the Tabernacle.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Gods house is described by the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:17738:10"/>
Temple at Jerusalem, which was situate upon mount Sion the mountain of holinesse, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in the 48 Psal. 1, 2. <hi>Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised in the city of our God, in the mountain of his holinesse. Beautifull for situation, the joy of the whole earth is mount Sion.</hi> Again, in Psal. 87. 1, 2. <hi>God layed his foundations among the holy mountains. The Lord loveth the gates of Sion above all the habitations of Jacob.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, in the 48 Psal. 3. Gods house is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed by a kings palace; <hi>God is well known in her palaces for a refuge:</hi> from hence the fathers call our greater and mother churches <hi>Basilicae,</hi> the <hi>palaces</hi> where the high King of heaven dwelleth, and where God is a refuge to his people that call upon him there, in any trouble or difficultie. As when the subjects of a king are by their enemies assaulted, if they can get into their kings palace, then they think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves safe enough: so is it with Gods people who flie to his house for refuge.</p>
            <p>But some will say, I can pray, and serve God as well at home in mine own house. Thou mayest serve God there, but not so well; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God hath made choice of this house before all private houses, in regard of his so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne and publick worship. Therefore the Psalmist saith, <hi>The Lord loveth the gates of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 87. 2.</note> 
               <hi>above all the habitations of Jacob.</hi> In this house God hath put his name, and made promises to it above all places: <hi>I have hallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:17738:11"/>
               <hi>this house which thou hast built, to put my name</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. King. 9. 3.</note> 
               <hi>there for ever, and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually.</hi> If Gods heart be here, then my heart shall be here too: and if his eyes be here, then will I humble soul and body before him, lest I offend him. Again, God hath commanded his house to be a house of prayer by way of excellency, Isa. 56. 7. <hi>My house shall be called an house of prayer:</hi> and our Lord in the Gospel confirmeth it. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if God will heare the prayers of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in all places, then he will heare them soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and with greater respect, in his own house, which is specially dedicated to prayer and his service. Neither doth this any way derogate from his ubiquity, but from his being <hi>ubique uniformiter:</hi> for as his mercy (although it is over all his works) yet is it not equally in hell and in heaven; or the measure of his justice equally poured forth upon saints and angels, as upon the children of disobedience: so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, although this be Gods attribute, to be every where; yet he is not every where alike; both in regard of the promise of his especiall presence made in Scripture, in such houses<note place="margin">Exod. 25. 8. and 29. 44, 45. &amp; 1. King. 9. 3.</note> consecrated to his name, by which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more especially holy; as also because in this house God will heare for the presence of his Sonne. For, as S. Chrysostome saith,<note place="margin">Homil. 36. in 1. <hi>Cor.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Where Christ is in the Eucharist, there is no want of angels; where such a King is, and such princes</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:17738:11"/>
               <hi>are, there is a heavenly palace, nay heaven it self.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It followeth now to shew what God is, and that he is the great owner of this house. Great is Gods house, but greater is the owner, because no house can hold him: therefore my Text useth an exclamation, which intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth a great entity; <hi>Holinesse becometh thy house, O Lord!</hi> God is far greater then his house: for he not onely dwelleth in his house, but in the hearts of men, in the intelligences of angels, and in all other creatures. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause nothing can contain him, he dwelleth in himself most perfectly. Of all places the prophet David speaketh, <hi>Whither shall I go</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 139. 7, &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence? If I ascend up to heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed in the grave, thou art there also. If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea: even there shall thy hand leade me, and thy right hand shall hold me.</hi> And in Isa. 66. 1. God challengeth the whole world for his house; <hi>Heaven is my throne, and earth is my footstool: what house will you build for me, saith the Lord? hath not my hand made all these things?</hi> Wherefore when we come to worship God in his house, we must bring this thought with us, to surrender up all our own thoughts of serving him, and desire him to ayd us with his holy Spirit. And when after this we have done our low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liest
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:17738:12"/>
service, and served him with our best devotions, yet we must say, Lord we can never serve thee enough; because thou art infinite, and we uncapable of thy greatnesse and worthinesse.</p>
            <p>Thus farre have I spoken of God and his house: but before we enter it, it is fit to know our selves, and how we are to be qualified for it. From the highest to the lowest, alas we are all poore creatures. At the first, origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally we were born abroad in the fields; our mothers name was <hi>the earth,</hi> and our fathers<note place="margin">Gen. 1. 1. Gal. 6. 3.</note> name was <hi>nothing:</hi> for from nothing God made all his creatures, according to that in<note place="margin">Ex non extan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus, <hi>fides Nicena.</hi>
               </note> Heb. 11. 3. <hi>So that things which are seen, were not made of things which appeare.</hi> Seeing then we are so poorely descended, what shall we do? we must go to service, we must seek some good house for our preferment. The best house in the world is Gods house: for he is owner of heaven and earth, and able to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance all. But what are the orders of this house? what will here give content? <hi>Holinesse becometh thy house, O Lord.</hi> Would we know what this holinesse is? It is no common, but a superlative honour; it is Gods honour which we call godlinesse and holinesse: common honour belongs to all that have Gods image in them; but holinesse reflecteth onely upon the high and mighty God. For this cause our Saviour hath taught us to say, <hi>Hallowed,</hi> which
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:17738:12"/>
is more then <hi>Honoured be thy name:</hi> according to the Psalme, <hi>Holy and reverend is his name.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 111. 9.</note> And this holinesse respective to Gods house consisteth of certain holy offices.</p>
            <p>The first is, To adorn and beautifie it fit for his greatnesse, as himself gave pattern in beautifying his tabernacle: there was gold and silver, precious stones, silks, with all precious colours, the most choice woods, and all things framed with the best cunning that God inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Bezaleel</hi> and <hi>Aholiab,</hi> and all the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted of that time.</p>
            <p>Now, to prosecute S. Pauls argument, if that which was to be done away was glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 3. 11.</note> much more is that to be glorious which is to remain. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <hi>Dei domus</hi> sort well together; comelinesse and holinesse joyn hand with each other. Thus saith my Text, <hi>Holinesse becometh thy house, O Lord.</hi> This of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice equity exacteth of us: for seeing God hath made the worlds great ornament, and our <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, our little world, for our honour and use; should not we proportion a due ornament for his house and service? A mans house is his state, and the greatest men are esteemed by it.<note place="margin">Ezra 7. 27.</note> And according to this Ezra saith, <hi>Blessed be the Lord God of our fathers, which hath put into the kings heart to beautifie the house of our God that is in Jerusalem.</hi> And the Psalmist saith,<note place="margin">Psal. 96. 9.</note> 
               <hi>Worship the Lord in the beauty of holinesse,</hi> that is to say, in the beautified sanctuary, or, as the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:17738:13"/>
               <hi>Geneva</hi> translation expoundeth, in the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Sanctuary.</p>
            <p>But how are our Sanctuaries about us for the most part beautified? If basenesse were not more then want of beauty, I would hold my peace. One beauty hath beat out another; the beauty of preaching (which is a beauty too) hath preacht away the beauty of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: for if men may have a sermon; prayer and church-service, with the ornaments of Gods house, may fit abroad in the cold. Alas that the daughters should drive away the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers! Is it not a shame for us to see the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of knights and gentlemen sweeter kept, and better adorned then the houses of the King of heaven? To the one, one mans means is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient; to the other, the means of a whole town is liable; and yet this latter nothing so beautified as the other is: is not this a second shame? Our Saviour telleth us, that in his <hi>Fathers house there are many mansions.</hi> Shall we<note place="margin">John 14. 2.</note> look for glorious mansions in the kingdome of heaven, and will we not prepare comely mansions in the kingdomes of the earth? Doth not God challenge us where he challengeth his chosen people? <hi>Is it time for you to dwell</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hagg. 1. 4. and 1. 9, 10.</note> 
               <hi>in your cieled houses, and this house to lie waste?</hi> Gods judgement follows, <hi>Ye looked for much, and lo it came to little; and when ye brought it home, I did blow upon it: and why, saith the Lord of hosts? because of my house that is waste, and</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:17738:13"/>
               <hi>ye come every man to his own house. Therefore the heaven over you stayed it self from dew, and the earth stayed her fruit.</hi> Then, neighbours, if you desire the cry of our poore to cease, and the judgements of God to forbear us, let us give God his due, and respect his house. There was a time when our holy fathers spared no cost nor labour to build Gods houses: now let us take our time to adorn them, as many of our devout brethren have begun. So forward were good people in the old world to this ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, that Moses made proclamation to stay their devotions, as we reade in Exod. 36. O that but half this willing heart were among us Christians, to shew our love to God in this kinde!</p>
            <p>The second office of holinesse, is a holy preparation before we enter Gods house: This is taught by Solomon, Eccles. 5. 1. <hi>Take heed to thy foot when thou entrest into the house of God:</hi> as if it had been said, Thou canst not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as thou oughtest, without a preventing and preparing thought. Why sayest thou not to thy self, Whither goest thou? what art thou about to do? If thou sayest, To serve God; then consider what God is. Is he not the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of all things, and the mover of all things made? canst thou see any thing that is not his? canst thou heare any thing which his hand hath not made? canst thou wear any thing which his fingers have not spunne? canst thou
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:17738:14"/>
set thy foot on that which his power hath not founded? All this week before, thou hast sitten at his table and tasted of his cates; and canst thou come at any time to his house to thank him for all this, and not deeply consider what thou art to do?</p>
            <p>The third office of holinesse is, To reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence Gods Sanctuarie, and as by other acts of reverence, so by keeping off our hats while we stay in it, whether there be Service or no Service: and this reverence is commanded in generall, Levit. 19. after such an emphaticall manner, as if the breach of it were equall to the sinne of not keeping the fourth command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for they are joyned together both in the same precept, vers. 30. <hi>Ye shall keep my Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, and reverence my Sanctuarie: I am the Lord.</hi> Where ye see why God commands his house to be reverenced; because it is his house, and the honour that is done in it, and to it, is done to himself: <hi>I am the Lord.</hi> As the good usage which we give to the family of a noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, reflecteth from the family to the noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; so is it between God and his house. When we go into our kings chamber where stands his chair of state, though the king him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self be not there, yet we put off and are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered in remembrance of his majestie: but our heavenly King, as he is in all places be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is infinite, so he is in this his palace by a more speciall resemblance of his holinesse,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:17738:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but then chiefly when Gods people are met together there: for Gods house is a little heaven on earth; here dwels the Father, Sonne, and holy Ghost: the Father in receiving our devotions, the Sonne in directing them, and the holy Ghost in sanctifying them. Thus saith the Sonne of God, <hi>Where two or three are</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 18. 20.</note> 
               <hi>gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.</hi> Thou wilt say, I cannot see either Father, Sonne, or holy Ghost in this place. I answer, God is a Spirit, therefore not to be seen with bodily eyes; yet hath he given thee bodily eyes to inform thy spirituall eyes. Seest thou not Gods Minister here speaking to God, and bowing his knees to him when he speaks? Seest thou not the Sonne of Gods seat here, the holy Altar at the upper end of this house? and seest thou not the holy Font at the nether end, where the holy Ghost is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies ready to receive all into his kingdome? If the Sonne and holy Ghosts seats be at both ends of this house, must not the Father needs be all the house over? because both Sonne and holy Ghost proceed from him, and are but one Spirit, and one God. Moses saith, <hi>The</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 6. 4.</note> 
               <hi>Lord our God is one Lord.</hi> He is in the light that shines in at the window, he is in thy breath by which thou prayest and speakest. Thou mayst say further, I cannot see the holy angels here attending on him. Wilt thou beleeve no more then thou canst see? then art thou no better
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:17738:15"/>
then S. Thomas in this case, to whom our<note place="margin">John 20. 29.</note> Lord preferreth all them that beleeve &amp; have not seen. See with S. Pauls eies in the 1. Cor. 11. 10. where men are directed to be uncovered on their heads in Gods house, &amp; women to be covered, because of the angels; that is to say, lest the holy angels in the congregation should be offended at the womens irreverent carriage with bare heads and long hair, and at the mens hats on their heads. Wherefore, good fellow-brethren, if you respect God and his holy place, have a speciall care to maintain good orders and manners in it, lest God and his holy angels be offended at us. To conclude, as all the holy saints in heaven behold Gods face there, so all the saints of the earth are here in this lower heaven be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the beauty of his holinesse. Now if God be here, his seat here, his angels here, his saints here, his word and worship here; then what reverence and holinesse becometh this house above all places in the world! Wert thou in the kings chamber, the king there speaking to thee, and thou to the king; how wouldest thou tremble! what passions would<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est thou have within thee! what thoughts of humilitie! what cares of oversights! But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause thou canst see none but thy neighbours here, here thou art bold, and servest God<note place="margin">De morum ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilitate in templo.</note> with lesse fear then men serve the work of his fingers. <hi>Si quis regem hominem</hi> (saith

            <p>The 4 sort of reverence and office of this holinesse beseeming Gods house, is, at the entring in, before we take our seats, to bend the knee, and to bowe our body to him, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the more usuall and speciall place of his residence or resemblance, which is the high Altar or the Lords table usually standing at the east end of Gods house, <hi>Id<expan>

And this duty was practised in the new Testament by S.

especially among women; and at this day, before they enter their pews, some make their courtesy in the alley, but it is with their faces either toward their masters and mistres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, or toward some of their betters in the parish. Now, good men and women, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand your duty; You come not hither to serve men, but God: therefore the first reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence that you make, (because the house is Gods, and not mans) direct your aspect to Gods table, which S.

Wherefore, to follow their good and holy pattern, we also are to do the like both at our first coming into Gods house, and at our going out. And this will I confirm to you out of Gods word. The first is taught in Psalm. 132. 7. <hi>We will enter into his tabernacle, we will worship at his footstool.</hi> The second is expressed in the second of Chron. where is shewed, that, when the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice<note place="margin">2. Chro. 29. 30</note> was ended, <hi>the king and all that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent with him bowed themselves and worshipped.</hi> And <hi>thus Elkanah came yearely both to worship,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Sam. 1. 3.</note> 
               <hi>and to sacrifice to the Lord in Shiloh;</hi> upon which place saith Mendoza, <hi>Mysterio non vacat, quòd priùs adorârit &amp; postea sacrificârit, ut quanta cum reverentia sacrificandum sit significetur. It wanted not mysterie, that he first worshipped, and then sacrificed, to signifie with how great reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence he did it.</hi> S. Gregorie likewise hath it,<note place="margin">Expos. mor. in locum.</note> 
               <hi>Adorans immolat, quia quò humiliùs divinâ ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neratione prosternitur, eò summo claritatis illius blandimento suaviùs refovetur: He worshipping sacrificed: for by how much the more humble he was in divine veneration prostrate, so much the sweetlier he was comforted with the pleasantnesse of his highest excellencie.</hi> But what is the fashion of the vulgar? as they come in with rudenesse,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:17738:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
so they run out like sheep at a gap; except a few of our women and maids, which to this day retain some remnant of this laudable duty. Did we know what God is, what we have had from him, and what we are to have, we would kisse the ground for his sake where he is, and think nothing enough for his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
            <p>After our bowing to God, followeth our falling on our knees in prayer. For seeing Gods house is principally for prayer, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore next after our holy salutation it is fit to fall down unto him in our places, and humble our selves more low, in regard of the benefit we begge of him. And thus did the man to Jesus in S. Matthew, <hi>There came to him a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 17. 14, 15.</note> 
               <hi>man, and fell down at his feet, and said, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, have pitie on my sonne, for he is lunatick, and sore vexed.</hi> In S. Mark another came, <hi>and kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mark 10. 17.</note> 
               <hi>to him, and asked him, Good master, what shall I do that I may inherit eternall life?</hi> This que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion deserved a double fee. Thus Peter<note place="margin">Acts 9. 40.</note> kneeled down and prayed, when he raised Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitha to life: and thus the disciples with their<note place="margin">Acts 21. 5.</note> wives and children kneeled down and prayed on the shore, before they took their leave of Paul when he departed from them. And so frequent was this manner of praying in the primitive Church, that Eusebius reporteth of<note place="margin">Euseb. lib. 2. Hist. Eccl. cap. 22.

               <hi>kneeling to God in supplication: from which his singular sanctity he was called IUST.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fifth office is, To rise up from our seats when the Articles of our faith are read: and this we are to do, First, by way of reverence, because the Creed is the summe of Christs Gospel. Secondly, as when we ask God par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for our sinnes past, or beseech his heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Majestie for blessings needfull to sustain us, in all reason our behaviour should be with all humilitie on our knees; so in the profession of our faith our gesture of standing, which argues constancie in our hearts, best becomes us at that time, to testifie before God and the world, that we will stand up in the defence of it, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of S. Paul, <hi>Stand fast in the</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 16. 13.</note> 
               <hi>faith, play the men, and be strong.</hi> The man that standeth, is alwayes readie to resist his enemie: but he that sitteth or lieth, is a vantage to him, according to the verse made of the devil,
<q>
                  <l>Est leo, si sedeat; si stet, quasi muscarecedit.</l>
                  <l>If man doth sit, the devil will Lion be:</l>
                  <l>But if he stand, the devil a Lion's he.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Standing therefore is the fittest and comeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est of all gestures for the professing of our faith, and putting us in minde of being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant in it. For as we stand in the faith, so without the faith we cannot stand: therefore the Apostle saith, <hi>By faith ye stand.</hi> Take away<note place="margin">2. Cor. 1. 24.</note> from man his faith, and presently he falls. Faith is a mans rock; and as long as he stands
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:17738:18"/>
upon it, fall he cannot. For this cause our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour called Simon <hi>Peter, quasi Petra,</hi> because his faith was his rock; and against this, he told him the gates of hell should not prevail. Wherefore seeing our faith is so pleasing to God, and so profitable to us, we ought often to offer it to him in profession. Next, we shall do more reverently to stand up at the reading of the Psalmes, before, after, and between the holy lessons, and at <hi>Gloria Patri;</hi> because in these we speak unto God, and it is not good manners in a publick assembly to speak unto God sitting, as if we were his fellows. Lastly, we are to stand up at the reading of the Gospel, in regard of the authour of the speech, which is our Lord Christ: <hi>As also because they do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hooker Eccl. Polit. lib. 5. Parag. 30.</note> 
               <hi>historically declare something that our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our either spake, did, or suffered in his own person,</hi> for us most miserable and wretched sinners. Whereupon, in token of greater reverence to our ever-blessed Redeemer, <hi>it hath been the custome of Christian men and women to stand up, and at the rehearsall of the Gospel to utter certain words of acclamation, as, Glorie be to thee, O Lord;</hi> and at the end thereof to say, <hi>Thanks be to God for his glorious Gospel,</hi> or the like. But you will say, You teach us to bowe, to kneel, and to stand up; yet these are but out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ceremonies, and humane civilities, fitter for men then for Gods high holinesse of which you treat. I answer, that ceremonies and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilities
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:17738:19"/>
to men, when they are applied to God, change their nature, and become holinesse. The reason whereof is, because all actions are specified <hi>ab objecto &amp; fine,</hi> as the School teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: but in these acts of religion, the object is God, and his glorie their highest end, next to which consequently follows mans reward. Therefore it cannot be, that these actions of the bodie accompanying those of the minde, should from their end be otherwise then spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall duties. As S. Thomas of Aquine hath<note place="margin">Aquin. 2. 2. qu. 84. art. 2.</note> it, <hi>Adoratio corporalis in spiritu fit, in quantum à spirituali devotione procedit, &amp; ad eam ordinatur:—&amp; quia per sensum Deum attingere non possu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, per sensibilia tamen signa mens nostra provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catur, in Deum ut tendat. Bodily worship is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in spirit, inasmuch as it proceeds from spirituall devotion, and is ordered to it. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause by our sense we cannot attain unto God, yet by sensible signes our minde is incited to tend to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him.</hi> Thus you see these expressions be not onely outward, but inward too. For what makes thee to bowe to God in his Sanctuarie? doth not thy soul set thy knee on work? and what sets thy soul on work? is it not faith and charitie, the two principall graces of Gods Spirit? How then should not this be holinesse which proceedeth from such holy roots?</p>
            <p>The sixth office of holinesse is, To come to the Sacrament with due preparation. First, in reconciling our selves to our neighbours
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:17738:19"/>
where is cause of offence. Secondly, by co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in right faith with true understanding of the thing, in discerning the Lords bodie. Thirdly, by coming in charitie; because cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie is the life of our souls, and the thing to be fed. Fourthly, to come fasting where men are able; because S. Augustine saith, <hi>Placet Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tui</hi>
               <note place="margin">Aug. Epist. 118.</note> 
               <hi>sancto, ut, in honorem tanti Sacramenti, priùs intret in os Christiani corpus Dominicum: It plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the holy Ghost, that, in honour of so great a Sacrament, the Lords body should first enter into the mouth of a Christian.</hi> And S. Paul faulteth this among the Corinthians: <hi>For every man,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 11. 21.</note> 
               <hi>when they should eat, taketh his supper before; and one is hungry, and another is drunken.</hi> He that was hungry, was in good case: but he that was drunken, was not fit for the place. Fifthly, to receive it kneeling; because to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it sitting, is to receive it as we receive our bodies supper: yet is there a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the one and the other: the one being the food of our souls, and received in the sanctuary; and the other being the food of our bodies, and eaten in private houses.</p>
            <p>The 7 office of holinesse is, To keep all the holy feasts of the Church: and they which neglect this, cut off a great part of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and lose all the holy lives and examples of the saints, and divers mysteries of our sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation besides. The lives of the saints are our looking glasses; and the reason why we come
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:17738:20"/>
so short of them in good life, is, because we do not see our sinnes in their lives, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take not of their holinesse. For he which ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noureth God with the saint, is partaker of the saints holinesse. So likewise they which come to Gods house upon the day of Christs na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, (coming in faith and love, as they ought) are partakers of Christs birth: they which come upon the day of his circumcision, are with him circumcised from the dominion of the flesh: they which come upon the day of purification, are presented with him to his Father: they which come upon Goodfriday, are partakers of his precious death: they which come upon Easter day, are partakers of his glorious resurrection: they which come upon Ascension day, ascend with him in holy desires in present, and hereafter shall ascend in person: they which come upon Whitsun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, shall partake of those white gifts that God bestowed upon his Church upon that day: and they which come upon Trinity sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, shall enjoy the blessed Trinity of Father, Sonne, and holy Ghost. So again they which come upon S. Stephens day, are in affection partakers of his martyrdome, and prepared for holy suffering: they which come upon S. Johns day, partake of S. Johns love and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: they which come upon Innocents day, partake with them in their deaths for Christs cause: they which come upon S. Michaels
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:17738:20"/>
day, shall enjoy the blessed Angels in their administration: and they which come upon the day of All Saints, shall be of that blessed number to stand with them on Christs right hand in the day of judgement: and so of all the rest. Thus in observing saints daies, and in dedicating Temples to God in their names, we have the blessed saints still living and dwelling among us. Oh blessed we! And this doctrine is confirmed by the Article of the <hi>Communion of saints:</hi> therefore they which neglect this holy fellowship in joyning with them to serve and worship God in this lower house, as they serve and honour him in his higher house, do, as much as in them lies, cut themselves from this holy Communion, and have a great losse which none can see but they that have spirituall eyes.</p>
            <p>But what will worldlings say? If we come<note place="margin">Object.</note> to Gods house every saints day, we shall come short of our houshold business<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and our poore should be hindered from providing their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries. I answer, Because you come short<note place="margin">Resp.</note> with God in his service, therefore he comes short with you in his blessing: where Gods service is wanting, there means want foison. Saith not Hagge so? <hi>Ye have sown much, and</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hag. 1. 6.</note> 
               <hi>bring in little: ye eat, but ye have not enough: ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink: ye clothe you, but there is none warm: and he that earneth wages, earneth wag<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s to put it into a bag with</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:17738:21"/>
               <hi>holes.</hi> What is now either gotten or saved this way, by sparing from God? We pull from him, and he pulls from us: who is the stronger?</p>
            <p>The eighth office is, To use all the respon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals or answers prescribed in the holy Liturgie. The people must not onely joyn with the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister in heart, but in voice too; because of all outward means this is most significant and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall, as being the hearts eruption and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter. And for such as are unlearned, it is fit for them to learn them, and to have them printed in their hearts, to make them their own, and to use them at other times; because no pattern of prayer can equall this. And this dutie of praying and praising God together with Gods ministers, is by S. Peter prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to all the faithfull, where he tells them that they <hi>are an holy priesthood, to offer up spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Pet. 2. 5.</note> 
               <hi>sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.</hi> These spirituall sacrifices are three; Prayer, Fasting, and Almes: by Prayer we sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice our souls to God, by Fasting we sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice our bodies, and by Almes our goods. These three we have to give to God, and no more; and these three are bettered to us by our giving to him. Our souls are bettered by his accepting, and sanctifying of them; our bodies are bettered by being freed from surfetting and diseases; and our goods are bettered by Gods blessing of them. The charitable mans
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:17738:21"/>
cow casteth not her calf, his corn is not blast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, his fruit not eaten with caterpillers, and the borrower runnes not away with his money. Therefore Ecclesiasticus saith, <hi>A mans almes</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ecclus 29. 10. Vet. Transl.</hi> Eleemosyna viri quasi sac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus cum ipso</note> 
               <hi>is his purse:</hi> as if it were said, It keeps his <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>te. Further he saith, <hi>Bestow thy treasure a<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="4 letters">
                     <desc>••••</desc>
                  </gap> the commandment of the most high, and it shall bring thee more profit then gold.</hi> And again, <hi>Lay up thy almes in the secret chambers, and it shall keep thee from all afflictions.</hi> What are the secret chambers? they be the hungry bellies of the poore: little see we what they want. But to proceed: Shall we think our souls to be sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed by all manner of prayers? No: for Isaiah prophesieth, <hi>This people draw neare unto me with</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isaiah 29. 13.</note> 
               <hi>their mouth, and honour me with their lips, but their heart is farre from me.</hi> The sacrifice of prayer is no lip-labour, but a breaking of the heart before God for sinne; 'tis sobs, and sighs, and an ardent desire of obtaining Gods favour in Christ, before all the goods of the world. This is the fire of Gods Sanctuarie, to kindle and enflame our sacrifice of prayer. For Fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, this is not, as many use it, to abstain onely from flesh, and care not to swallow up sinne: but it is to beat down the body by abstinence, and to bring it into subjection to the spirit: it is to abstain from flesh, and other delightfull food, that thereby we might be taught and brought to abstain from fleshly pleasures, from hunting after strange women, from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:17738:22"/>
of eating and drinking, carding, dicing, and other vanities, which feed the greedy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite of flesh and bloud, and the soul unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; to abstain on fasting daies from meats for<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>dden and, before thou comest to Gods house to be of an empty stomack, that God may fill thy soul with his graces; and after the sinnes of thy flesh, to punish and keep down thy body with the coursest nourishments.</p>
            <p>Lastly, for the sacrifice of our goods, this is not to give them when we cannot well keep them any longer. When thy coat is moth-ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, then the moth gives it: when thy bread is mouldie, and thy meat smells, then the mould and ill savour bestows it. This is no true sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of our goods, because it smells not sweet in Gods nostrills. But, neighbours, I cannot fault you in this kinde; for that I know you to be more charitable, and readier to give, then others are worthy to receive. Therefore I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort you, that when you give bodily food to some, you would give some spirituall food with it: admonish them of their idlenesse, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke their sinne, chide them for filching and stealing, and other misdemeanours which you heare of or know. This is as necessarie for them as their meat and drink, and more too.</p>
            <p>But here I cannot but suspect, that our car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall<note place="margin">Object.</note> Gospellers will object that our bodies and goods are no spirituall sacrifices, but things materiall, and so not fit for the Gospel. Let<note place="margin">Resp.</note>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:17738:22"/>
such learn, that though body and goods be by nature materiall, yet by the principall whereby they are offered, which is the soul and spirit, they become spirituall. Therefore David saith, Not my heart alone, but <hi>

            <p>The ninth office is, To sing holy psalmes and hymnes to Gods honour in his house: and this is taught Ephes. 5. 18, 19. <hi>Be not drunk with wine, wherein is excesse: but be filled with the Spirit: Speaking to your selves in psalmes, and hymnes, and spirituall songs, singing, and making melody in your heart to the Lord.</hi> And again, Coloss. 3. 16. <hi>Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdome, teaching and admonishing one another in psalmes, and hymnes, and spirituall songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.</hi> In which words is signified, not onely the spirituall edifying of the soul in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and understanding, but further the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall grace of holy singing, in stirring up all our powers to praise God, and to petition unto him with greater fervencie and alacritie.

            <p>The tenth office respecteth Gods Ministers; First, in putting on the holy vestments: for it is not fit that the maker of heavens ornaments should be served with common garments. Gods house is a house of holinesse; therefore holy vestments, set apart for so high service, best beseem it. These intimate to all sorts, in what a reverent manner God is to be served.

            <p>After this, a wise and discreet Sermon, not
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:17738:25"/>
made by every Minister, but by a man of read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and discretion, right well beseemeth this holy place. Preaching is Gods mouth to his people: therefore great care must be had, that it be not abused, either with false doctrines, or unsavourie speeches. In this case S. Paul makes his exclamation, <hi>Who is sufficient for</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Cor. 2. 16.</note> 
               <hi>these things?</hi> How this is regarded, none but the learned see. Not how well, but a Sermon, of the vulgar is expected. But would you know what Sermons are fit for our holy as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies? they are such as are suitable to our book of Common Service, and the two heads of religion, <hi>faith,</hi> and <hi>good life.</hi> If you would know what faith we are to follow, it must be that which S. Paul calleth the <hi>one faith.</hi> As<note place="margin">Ephes. 4. 5.</note> there was but one Tabernacle and one Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the old Law, to preserve the unitie of their religion; so here must be but one faith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us Christians (to keep us from diversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of opinions) all the world over. This one faith, Titus 1. 4. is called the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon faith,</hi> and of Divines it is called the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick faith,</hi> to shew that they which hold not it, cannot be of the <hi>Communion of saints.</hi> And this faith is contained in the three Creeds, of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> of <hi>Nice,</hi> and <hi>Athanasius.</hi> And the false faith is that which is contrary to this, the private faith, or fancie rather, by which men beleeve to be saved by themselves absolutely, without condition or regard of the faith of the Church.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:17738:25"/>And this is that which is mother and nurse to vice, and enemy to all good life. And that this is not the catholick faith, it shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, because that faith hath not a speciall object as a mans private self, or Gods speciall favour to this or that particular man (which is hopes object) but a catholick object, which is the whole first truth, and every member of Gods word, as the School teacheth: This faith goeth but to the truth and <hi>esse</hi> of divine things; according to that of the Apostle, Heb. 11. 1. <hi>Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.</hi> Faith gives them a subsisting and being in our minde; and after this, Hope layes hold of them in the will and affections, and applies them to our selves; and Charity goes into them. Again, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle saith, <hi>He that cometh to God, must beleeve</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 6.</note> 
               <hi>that God is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him:</hi> not a rewarder of thee and me (as if the Article of the faith were personall) but <hi>of them that diligently seek him.</hi> Here is the condition: If thou and I seek him diligently, then is he a rewarder of thee and me, and not otherwise: if the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be kept, the Article is just, and the faith is stedfast. Secondly, if faith be to beleeve all the parts of Gods word, then none can be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely sure of their salvation by faith: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the threatnings against sinne (which none are without) do as much discourage us,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:17738:26"/>
as the promises pull us on; and the one must be beleeved as well as the other. Thirdly, whereas all hope of salvation depends upon the promises; there is no promise but in one part of Gods word or other hath conditions tied to it; as repentance after sinnes, keeping of Gods law, and perseverance to the end: from whence it follows, that none can be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure of the promises (though he have all the faith in the world) except he be sure of the conditions keeping; of which none can be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, because no man is his own judge. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if men might be saved by such a faith, or by faith onely; then prayer to God might sleep, care of standing might stand by, and good life, which is the nearest bond of our conjunction with God, might be forborn: which God forbid. Wherefore, that we might preach the right way, and you walk the right way, we must joyn S. James justifying of <hi>works,</hi> with S. Pauls justification by <hi>faith;</hi> and then have we the two principalls of <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>good life</hi> observed, by which the hope of our salvation is confirmed and strengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and if you would have a breviary of good life, it is to keep all the commandments of Gods law, and the Canons of the Church, as farre as we can; it is to flie sinne, to follow vertue, to live justly, to give to every one his own, mercy to some, and love and charity to all; because <hi>Charity is the fulfilling of the</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 13. 10.</note> 
               <hi>law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:17738:26"/>Thus much for Sermons fit for Gods house. Where such cannot be had, (because such are not common) there the distinct and sensible reading of the two lessons and the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homilies, with Sermons heard abroad some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times upon occasions, will supply this want: and were these read as the Canon directeth,<note place="margin">Can. 49.</note> 
               <hi>aptly,</hi> that is, by just distinctions and by a sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible reader, observing all the rules of reading, with pronuntiation fit for the matter, and with due attention of the hearer; the profit and edifying would be much.</p>
            <p>Thirdly and lastly, to this office on the peoples part belongs attention and devotion, without which the former office freezeth. At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention is to separate our thoughts from all other things whatsoever, and to give them onely to divine doctrine and service; accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to holy Ephrems counsel, <hi>Cave nè aurum</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tom. 1. Cap. de perfecta re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuntiat.</note>

               </note> 
               <hi>with brasse or lead; that is, Defile not thy soul with wicked or unclean thoughts: For as a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin espoused to an husband, if she be deflowred by others, becomes execrable unto him: even so the soul distracted with filthy and immodest thoughts, becomes abominable to Christ her heavenly bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom.</hi> For these impure thoughts conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate our attention, which gives life to that we receive into us; and devotion is the soul
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:17738:27"/>
of that which goes out of us; the one gives form to our hearing, the other perfection to our praying. Attention is commanded in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs 5. 1. <hi>My sonne, hearken unto my wisdome, and encline thine eare unto my knowledge.</hi> The enclining of the eare is attention, without which Gods word goes in at the one eare, and out at the other: Attention is the souls concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with the eares and mouths organs. What is the reason why Gods word read, and the Church-service, is to many so fruitlesse? They attend it not, they neither mark it nor respect it. <hi>Wouldest thou have God to heare thee,</hi> (saith S. Chrysostome) <hi>and thou hearest not thy self?</hi> Had we a sermon preached by angels, yet if we did not mark it, what would it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit? Gods service is common, therefore it is not regarded. The sunne shines daily; is it therefore the worse? every day we say the Lords prayer; is it therefore the weaker? No, but <hi>Vis unita fortior,</hi> Force united is stronger. The sunne by its often beating upon the earth makes the greater heat: so the oftener we beat upon Gods word, and repeat the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prayers, the more the Sonne of Gods light re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecteth upon us, and the more heat of devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is stirred up in us. If God or the Church make a prayer for our use; that is slighted: but if men make an extemporarie prayer, or frame a prayer of their own; that is extolled. For shame let us gather our wits together, let us
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:17738:27"/>
put a difference betwixt God and man, and let us attend his stablished ordinance in his Church, before the rolling wits of men. So running is mans head, that it will stay no where. Should the best wits in the world make a new liturgie applauded of all, yet would it not long be liked, except it might roll as mens wits roll; that is, as continually to alter, as the winde bloweth and the weather changeth. People now are grown so cunning, and proud in their learning, that if the preacher speaks any thing which they distast, they will fleere at it in the very house of God: such come not to heare with attention, but to sit judges on him; they come to catch something from him, as the Scribes and Pharisees came to take Christ in his doctrine. This is contrary to sanctified attention, and a vice to be shunned, when thou comest to Gods house: thou must not bring a chair with thee to sit down and judge; but if thou canst not presently assent to all that thou hearest, carrie it home with thee, and, with the <hi>noble Bereans,</hi> search in Gods word whether<note place="margin">Act. 17. 11.</note> it may not stand with it: and further, because thou art a private man, and S. Peter teacheth<note place="margin">2. Pet. 1. 20.</note> that <hi>no scripture is of any private interpretation;</hi> therefore thou art not to rest in thine own sense, but thou must go further to the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers fellows, and to them whose authority is prevalent in the Church, and require their judgement; because S. Paul saith, <hi>The spirits</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 14. 32.</note>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:17738:28"/>
               <hi>of the prophets are subject to the prophets:</hi> and if the matter be too hard for them, then thou must go to the Bishops, who are Gods high priests, and ask of them, as we are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected in Deut. 17. Devotion, as hath been said, is the soul to prayer and the rest of Gods service, because it is the daughter of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-vertue Charitie: and this is a cheerfull and free giving of our selves to Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, as his houshold servants. Therefore this is the speciall act of religion. And this devotion is derived <hi>à voto, from a vow,</hi> and is a frank gift and free binding of our selves unto it: and a <hi>simile</hi> of this we have in Mephibo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth, who, when king David had awarded his lands to be divided between him and his servant Ziba, gave all from himself for Davids sake, saying, <hi>Let him take all, seeing my lord</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Sam. 19. 30.</note> 
               <hi>the king is come home in peace.</hi> According to this when we consider what God hath done for us, as Mephibosheth remembred what king David had done for him; when we remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that he hath not onely made us, but after this redeemed and saved us when we were but dead men before him, as Mephibosheth and his fathers house were before king David; and when we remember further that in his Sonne Christ he hath taken us as his own sonnes to be at his own table: therefore now we are willing to forsake all for his sake, to let the world and Ziba take all, and to give
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:17738:28"/>
our selves wholly to his service. A second motive to this devotion, is the consideration of our own defects. For when we finde our selves too weak to persist in this purchased grace without his speciall aid, we relinquish our own strength and providence, to betake us to his protection, and so we turn to be his house<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold servants. And because prayer is the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall mean to lay hold on Gods help, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore herein specially our devotion in Gods house is occupied.</p>
            <p>And for that many, after they have made good vowes, by the worlds avocations are called off; therefore my Text tells me that this holy service must not be for a time, but for ever: <hi>Holinesse becometh thy house, O Lord, for ever.</hi> God is alwaies the same, as saith the Psalmist, <hi>Thou art the same, and thy yeares fail</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 102. 27.</note> 
               <hi>not.</hi> The proverb is, <hi>Semper idem.</hi> Wherefore if we be not the same alwaies to him as he is to us, if we fail to serve him, he will fail to save us; because he is alwaies the same, as well just, as mercifull. S. Jude teacheth that <hi>the angels which kept not their first habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
               <note place="margin">vers. 6.</note> 
               <hi>God hath reserved in everlasting chains to the judgement of the great day.</hi> Of how much more punishment shall they be worthy, which fall upon fall, and finally fall away? The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels fell but once, and were immediately cast down: but loose and carelesse men fall from God twice: first in Adam, whereby we have
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:17738:29"/>
all warning; and secondly in themselves: in which if without repentance they persist, then is grace contemned, and their falling from God confirmed. The devout Anna lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us a better example: for she being <hi>a widow</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 2. 37.</note> 
               <hi>of about fourescore and foure yeares, departed not from the Temple, but served God with fastings and prayers night and day.</hi> She would not go out of it: but many of us will seldome come at it, especially upon Saints dayes, and fasting dayes, when God should be served with great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est humiliation and strongest devotion; because then the Saints in heaven joyn with us. <hi>Joyn with us,</hi> will you say? how know you that? Thus, because in Wis. 3. 1. it is said, <hi>The souls of the righteous are in the hand of God:</hi> but Gods hand is ever in action: therefore the souls de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted must be so too. What are they doing? because they are of our body, which is Christs Church, they are in continuall care for us: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause S. Paul saith, <hi>that the members should have</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 12. 25.</note> 
               <hi>the same care one for another.</hi> What? is their care in action? it can be nothing but prayer for us; because they themselves are past dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: therefore all their desires are for us. And this is represented after some manner, by Gods ordinance towards the holy nation in getting the earthly Canaan: for God would not give to the two tribes and half, the land of Gilead, but upon condition that they should<note place="margin">Numb. 32. &amp; Josh. 1.</note> aid the rest of their brethren, and go armed
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:17738:29"/>
with them into Canaan, untill they were in as quiet possession as themselves. Now if the Saints in heaven, after their manner, aid us with their prayers; shall we be so base-minded, as not to pray with them? O ingratitude, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fit for heaven nor earth! The Church our mother hath ordained holy-dayes to God for them, to acknowledge their pains and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours which they took for Gods glory, and our good, before they went from us: then let us upon these dayes blesse and praise God for them. These dayes are the Saints obsequies, their feast dayes, their dayes of triumph: O let us rejoyce with them; let us reverence their memories; let us imitate their vertues; let there be a holy necessitude between them and us; let us not be strangers. We are all of the holy bloud and the bloud-royall, we are all of<note place="margin">Eph. 2. 19.</note> Christs body: therefore let us joyn together, that God may be served of us the stronger. In Cathedrall and Collegiate churches, they serve God every day in the week: this is the continuall burnt-offering commanded Exod.<note place="margin">Preface to the Service.</note> 29. In our countrey-churches we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to serve God so too, specially adding every Wednesday and every Friday the holy Letanie: on Wednesday, in memoriall of our Lords arraignment; and on Friday, in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of his precious death. And although in our particular churches we have not the people to attend the continuall burnt-offering,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:17738:30"/>
in regard of secular businesse; yet the priest is to do it, and for the people. This serveth to teach us, that though we be not alwayes in the Temple, as Anna was; yet the Altar of our hearts should never be cold towards God, nor the fire of his love at any time go out, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies burn in prayer and meditation and holy desires, as God gave in charge by the figure, Levit. 6. 12. <hi>The fire shall ever burn upon the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, and never go out.</hi> And according to this, in the new law S. Paul saith, <hi>Pray continually,</hi> or<note place="margin">1. Thess. 5. 17.</note> 
               <hi>without ceasing,</hi> that is to say, upon all occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons offered: and again, <hi>Praying alwayes with all</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ephes. 6. 18.</note> 
               <hi>prayer and supplication in the spirit.</hi> In the old law were two principall sacrifices; <hi>Juge sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium, &amp; holocaustum;</hi> the continuall burnt-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the whole burnt-offering. The whole burnt-offering teacheth, that, seeing God sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth us not in parts or halves, but in whole, therefore we should serve him also in whole, with all that we have, with soul, body, and goods. The continuall burnt-offering preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to us, that, whereas God is good unto us not at spirts and whiles, but perpetually, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we should at all times be for him; conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually in <hi>habit,</hi> and as often as we can in <hi>action;</hi> in the morning, in the evening, at midnight, and at noon-day: and this the Prophet David comprehendeth in the compleat number of seven, Psal. 119. 164. <hi>Seven times a day do I praise thee, because of thy righteous judgements.</hi>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:17738:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
To conclude, thus our Church by the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall service daily hath brought religion into a practise among us; but our <hi>Solisermonists</hi> and <hi>Solifidians</hi> do what they can to dissipate it: for, so they may have a sermon or two on the Lords day, or other, they take no thought for the weekly service, nor other good works; because faith, falsly so called, onely supplieth all to these fruitlesse men.</p>

                  </gap>, as Clemens Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andrinus<note place="margin">Faed. lib. 3. cap. 11.</note> hath it, <hi>and seem to march as if they would exactly measure out the earth by their min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, or else leade some pompous train upon the stage.</hi> Our Prophet saith, <hi>Holinesse becometh this</hi>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:17738:31"/>
                  <hi>house:</hi> but these take more care for braverie, the newest fashions, and the finest attires that can be bought for money; for here we are lookt upon. We should come hither to serve God: but these come to shew themselves. Knowest thou whose house this is? knowest thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whom thou comest hither? is he not thy Maker? Shall we then come before our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker onely in our own making? Shall we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent our selves to his Majestie in our own ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie? No, let us come hither with humilitie, in the most modest manner that may be. It is holinesse, lowlinesse, the souls beautie, that Gods eies are delighted in. The Prophet Isai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah saith, <hi>The high looks of man shall be humbled,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isai. 2. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>and the loftinesse of men shall be abased, and the Lord onely shall be exalted in that day.</hi> This house is Gods house, and this day is Gods day; here therefore let us exalt him, and humble our selves. Keep thy braverie rather for fairs and markets; save thy new fashions and sumptuous dressings for great mens houses. Thus saith our Saviour, <hi>They which wear soft clothing are</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 11. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>in kings houses.</hi> Then suit the world with the world, and Gods house with holinesse. I am not so cynicall as to take from men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men their distinctions; that we should not know the mistresse from the maid, nor the maid from the mistresse. This the angels dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like; for they keep their order one above ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Under them we see again how God hath
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:17738:31"/>
not clothed the flowers alike, but hath given more beautie to some, and sweeter smell to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. So let us keep our sorts and orders, let us not make our selves better then we are; and when we are in our best and richest, let us be in our own eyes lowliest, especially when we come before God. This is comely.</p>
               <p>The second kinde of uncomelinesse, is that of men in this house, who, when Gods Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster is not in place, and sometime when he is in place, in stead of prayer and meditation, in stead of turning the leaves of their book, turn face to face, and confabulate one with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, as if they were in a faire or market. This is like to the tables of the money-changers,<note place="margin">Matth. 21. 12.</note> and the seats of the dove-sellers, which Christ in his time threw out of the Temple. Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, I am not here to flatter you, nor so mean as to fear you; I am Gods Minister, to tell you of your faults, and to speak for God and his house. Let these things be amended, they are neither holy nor comely. S. Chrysostome in his 36 homily upon the 1. Corinth. saith, <hi>It is not lawfull in the Church to speak to our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour;</hi> he means about secular businesse. His words are emphaticall, and therefore I will cite them at large. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:17738:32"/>
                  <hi>It is not lawfull to speak unto a neighbour, or take acquaintance of an old friend in the Church, as elsewhere; but these things are to be done out of it, and that for very good reason: for the Church is not a barbours or apothecaries shop, neither a place to plead in; but a place of angels and arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angels, the palace of God, yea, heaven it self.</hi> Therefore it is most fit that the best manners and respects possible should be maintained in it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, as men profane Gods house at their coming in, so they serve it before their going out. Two, or three, or more will sit talking still upon their own matters, as though Gods house were now changed, and things set apart for his service may as well serve our private busines. This common talk is fitter for other places, then for the King of heavens pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace. As we fanne the darnell from the wheat, so we must winnow all profane speeches out of the house of prayer. You will say, Our speeches are not profane. Then know you what profanenesse is? Is it any thing but what is common in respect of things sacred? as S. Peter expresseth it, Acts 10. 14. <hi>Lord, I have never eaten any thing which is common or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean.</hi> And thus Esau is called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Heb. 12. 16. <hi>a profane person,</hi> one that was for any thing. I speak not against an orderly conference without brawling, in parleying about the good of Gods house, about the good of the Parish, or
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:17738:32"/>
for the poore, and such like actions of piety and devotion: for these are warranted 1. Cor. 16. 2. I speak onely against unnecessarie confa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations: and for common matters, they are fittest for common places.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, as some profane Gods house with their common talk; so some profane it by their going forth with their hats on their heads, as though when Gods service is done, then Gods house is no more Gods house. Such think that Gods house is like to our common houses: Therefore if they come either before or after service, they think no more reverence is to be shewed. Yet still it is Gods house, and he never is out of it; and therefore still to be respected.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Gods house is profaned by such as sit in time of divine prayer. For both prayer, and praising God, is a speaking to him. Now it is unmannerly to speak to God upon our seats in a publick assembly. If we speak to a king or noble man, either we kneel, or stand up. But many have I seen either sitting in time of prayer, or lying along very unseemly. This is not holinesse, but unmanner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rudenesse.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, when servants are upon their knees in prayer, if their masters or dames come in after, they will leave their service to God, to stand up to them; as if they should say, Stay God, till my master and mistris be in their
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:17738:33"/>
seats, and then I will attend on thee again, &amp; go forward with thy Minister. Is not this to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the creature before the Creatour? fie on these manners! This is not thy masters house, but Gods house. Reverence thy master at home &amp; abroad, and reverence thy Maker here, &amp; out of his service thou mayst reverence thy master here too. But the principall end of this house is, not for humane civility, but for divine ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. Thy master himself comes hither to serve God, as well as thou; and this must ever be thy rule, That when Gods duty and mans come together in competition, thou must leave all, father and mother, master and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stris, to wait upon God; though thou have a commandment for the one, as well as for the other. Thus did Levi, as we reade in Deut. 33. 9. <hi>Who said to his father and mother, I have not seen him; neither did he acknowledge his brethren, nor knew his own children.</hi> So must we do too: in Gods service we must neither see father nor mother, brother nor sister, master nor mistris, nor our own selves neither, how great so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we be, to divert or hinder us from it.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, Gods house is profaned by wandring eyes, in gazing about to see what others do, and who hath the newest fashion: and when they see any thing which they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, they make sport at it: while they look after such things, they lose God. <hi>Eo tempore nugas obgannire in aurem vicini, eorum est, qui</hi>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:17738:33"/>
                  <hi>non credunt illîc adesse Christum: huc illùs cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumferre vagos oculos, amentium est: existimes enim te frustra Templum adiisse, nisi indè melior discesseris puriórque;</hi> As Erasmus hath it. <hi>It is</hi>
                  <note place="margin">De civilitate morum in templo.</note> 
                  <hi>their fashion that think Christ is not in his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in presence, to tattle toyes in the eares of their neighbours: but then to roll wandering eyes to and again, is the part of mad men: for know cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, that thou comest to Gods house in vain, if thou departest not from it better and more pure in soul then thou camest.</hi> Therefore the Turks, though they be heathen men, yet herein they be our betters, as report goeth of them. For so do they attend their service, that if by chance they do but scratch their heads, they think all their former devotion to be lost. But what do our lighter women, and maidens in this place? Among many other misde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanours this is one, when the weather is hotter then ordinary, they never leave fanning of winde with their napkins on their faces. Our men do not so, though they be as hot of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. This is womens delicacy, unfit for Gods service. Greater rudenes is committed by the unmarried at the holy ordinance of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonie. In the beginning when the banes are published, what a smiling is there? For this the parties contracting forbear to come to Gods house till the asking be out. But in the end of the solemnity, after the conjunction, as though they were not in Gods house but
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:17738:34"/>
in the Brides chamber, they fall a rifling the Bride, in pulling off garters and shoe-tyings: Is not this a shame to be suffered in this most holy and modest place? O whither would rudenesse run, if it might be permitted!</p>
               <p>Further, Gods house is abused by them which bring hither hawks and dogs, which is faulted in our Church-homilie, and whereby peoples mindes are diverted from their devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. If our Saviour Christ, as a good sonne, was so zealous of his Fathers honour in his house, that he made a whip of cords, to drive those that sold doves, sheep, and oxen, things which were all offerable in sacrifice; will he not now with whips of scorpions drive out those who bring hither, either unclean creatures, as dogs; or things meerly devoted to pleasure, as hawks, and the like, into his Temple? Gods service is so great, that it ought not by any thing to be interrupted: did we see but a glimmering of Gods glorie and greatnesse, we would throw all away to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend him. To him we cannot come too sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, nor too separate from things worldly. As Gods house is consecrate, so nothing ought to come into it, but things consecrated. If thou cavill with me, and say, that thy appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell and thy book are not consecrated, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which none come hither; I answer, that thy apparell is sacred by thy person in Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptisme consecrated, and thy book (if it be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine)
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:17738:34"/>
by the Church-bible: for which cause when the followers of the worthy young king Edward laid a bible for him in a house in London, to tread on, to look out at a window to see a sight; he took it up and kist it, and laid it in its former room.</p>
               <p>Lastly, all these abuses shall be shut up with such as sleep in Gods house. Besides the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of God, sleep is to all holy duties an extinction. They which use it, make an idol of this place, and banish Gods service; they can neither do themselves good, nor good to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward God. In the Acts we reade, that S. Paul<note place="margin">Acts 20. 7.</note> preached till midnight: here was great dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence: when people sleep at midday, is not this great negligence? Eutychus in Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice sleeping at midnight, was taken up dead: in what state of sinne then stand they, that sleep thus at midday? is not their service at that time dead? is not sleep the image of death? To amend this fault, such as cannot at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend God sitting, let them rise up and serve him standing. Baals priests lanced themselves<note place="margin">1. King. 18. 28.</note> to serve an idol; and shall not we stirre up our selves to serve the living God?</p>
               <p>Now, brethren, having shewed you the beautie of Gods house, what is fit for it, and what unfit, one thing I request in lieu of my labour, and for Christs sake I beg it, That you would follow the directions of it.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here were a sort of Christians in the Apostles time, which would not consort with their fellows, because they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood more then they did. They would eat meat in the idols temples with the idolaters, because they had learned that an idol
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:17738:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was nothing, and that all the creatures of God were good: the other which knew lesse, durst not, because they had neither warrant for it, nor president. The like difference is at this day among our professours. One sort will not sociate with the rest of their neighbours in the house of God, because they have not every day a sermon to teach them more knowledge. Both these the Apostle here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth, in saying, <hi>Knowledge puffeth up;</hi> that is to say, makes men proud: <hi>but Charitie edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What the Apostle hath here put down in the generall, I will proceed to prove in the particulars. And to begin with the pride of knowledge; In the creation God made his angels exceeding bright and glorious in under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, and then propounded to them his Sonne to be their governour, to direct them in his service, according to that Heb. 1. 6. <hi>Let all the angels of God worship him:</hi> as if it were said, Let them follow his direction. But they, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves made in such perfection of knowledge, were so lifted up in pride, that they refused a directour, and would serve him after their own understanding; for which their pride, they were thrown down from heaven to hell. After this, the angels percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that the pride of their knowledge had thrown them down, they set upon Adam and Eve, perswading them also to break their
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:17738:36"/>
order in eating of the tree of knowledge. The serpent-angel told them, that if they would eat of this tree, they should be as Gods, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good and evil. This conceit of knowledge did so puffe them up too, that they broke Gods commandment, and were <hi>ipso facto</hi> thrown out of Paradise. After this, when man was ejected out of Paradise, so politick and proud grew they, that they would make a tower to clamber up to heaven, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themselves against Gods providence: God seeing their pride, confounded their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, by changing their language, and then they were dispersed all the earth over, like straying herds. The like pride hath now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes puft up our Puritanes, that being but very ignorant people, yet they will not be content to be accounted men of any mean knowledge, or be satisfied with any setled e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state; but they will run from church to church, from preacher to preacher, and from one opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to another, untill they have lost and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded themselves in the tower and Babel of their own fancies. <hi>Knowledge puffeth up,</hi> saith the Apostle; and when a man is at the highest, then he falls lowest. Knowledge threw the angels out of heaven to hell; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge threw Adam and Eve out of an earthly Paradise into a wildernesse of miseries; and wittie policie cast mighty Nimrod, with all mankinde, out of the citie, to seek straw and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:17738:37"/>
stubble with the children of Israel all the world over.</p>
            <p>But, saith the Puritane, We have no ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, we are without a preacher, we shall perish for want of knowledge. I answer, It is not knowledge that shall save: because then all they that know the will of God, and the mysteries of life, must needs be saved. But so they shall not, because our Saviour saith, <hi>He</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 12. 47.</note> 
               <hi>that knows his masters will, and doth it not, shall be beaten with many stripes:</hi> and S. Paul saith, <hi>The hearers of the law are not righteous before</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 2. 13.</note> 
               <hi>God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.</hi> Then knowledge without charitie saveth not,<note place="margin">Adde scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae charitate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; utilis erit scientia, non per se, sed per charitatem. <hi>S. Aug. in Evang. Joh. Tract. 27.</hi>
               </note> but increaseth punishment, and puffeth up. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, if knowledge were able to save, then the devils might be saved, because they know more then the best minister in the land. And whereas thou standest upon much knowledge, (for we will yeeld thee that which is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent) I say more unto thee, that one may be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved without any knowledge at all. Know you what you say? yes: the childe of three moneths old, when by Gods providence it departeth, what knowledge hath that of salvation? yet the Church in all ages hath taught, that such shall go to the kingdome of heaven: and what should let? it is without originall sinne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that is washt away in Baptisme; and actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all sinne it never committed any, by reason it wanted the use of free-will. Besides, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:17738:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>
after Baptisme is within the covenant, and united to God by his grace; and God cannot denie either his grace or his covenant. Now if the poore infant shall be saved without any knowledge at all, why then shouldest thou think that thou canst not be saved with mean knowledge fit for thy estate? But thou wilt say, The infant is not suffered to live to the means of knowledge, and therefore he is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused for the want of it. Then what sayest thou to the men and women which want the gifts of understanding, whom some call fools, some innocents, who know not the right hand from the left, or whether there be a heaven or a hell? what, shall these be damned which want the knowledge that thou hast? where dwells thy charitie? I will not beleeve thy knowledge, because that makes thee proud; and the proud will condemne all save them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. The School Tenet is, <hi>Amentes, furiosi, &amp; infantes non peccant;</hi> that is, <hi>Fools, mad-men, and children sinne not.</hi> Therefore mad-men, though they kill a man, are not put to death for it. Again, the Church hath ever taught, that all they that are within the covenant, are in the state of grace, untill they fall away: but these Christian innocents cannot fall away, because they cannot sinne; and they cannot sinne, because they want knowledge and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will. And my charitie teacheth me to hope, that as the Saviour of the world at his first
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:17738:38"/>
coming had mercie on the Gentiles, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore lived without faith, and without God in the world; so at his second coming he likewise will shew favour to these want-wits and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wits, and then open the windows of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding to see God face to face; because they are within the covenant, and are bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed Christians.</p>
            <p>But to return to thy former challenge, We have no sermons, we want a preacher, we shall die in our sinnes, we know not what to do. The Lord open thy eyes as he opened the eyes of Elisha his servant in the 6 chapter of the 2 book of Kings, and then thou shalt see a multitude of preachers. First, all Gods creatures are thy preachers, and daily teach thee. And to prove this, turn to the 19 Psalm. 1, 2, 3. <hi>The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament sheweth his handie work. One day telleth another, and one night certifieth another. There is neither speech nor language, but their voices are heard among them.</hi> Again, turn to the 12 of Job, 7, 8. and there he will bid thee <hi>ask the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the fowls of heaven, and they shall tell thee: Or speak to the earth, and it shall shew thee; or the fishes of the sea, and they shall declare unto thee.</hi> When thou travellest abroad, and seest a good piece of ground, a good cow, or a good horse, thou wilt say, I would my neighbour would sell me these for reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

money. Canst thou see the goodnesse of the creature in these, and not see the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the Creatour? Canst thou learn in these books what is good for thy bodie, and not learn what is good for thy soul? Open thy eyes wider, and then thou shalt see that there could be no goodnesse in the creature, except God had made it; and that if the effect be good, then the cause of this good must needs be infinitely more good; and therefore he above all things is to be sought of us. And this is so cleare a lesson, that except a man will shut his eyes, he must see it and understand it; because the Apostle saith, Rom. 1. 19, 20. <hi>That which may be known of God, is manifest in them. For the invisible things of him, that is, his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall power and Godhead, are seen by the creation of the world, being considered in his works, that they should be without excuse.</hi> And these preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are of S. Paul acknowledged for preachers, in the 10 chapter following, and the 18 vers. having relation to the 14 verse. <hi>Have they not heard? no doubt their sound went into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Gods Word is thy preacher: And this is proved by the book of Solomon called Ecclesiastes; for that book, as the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed know, signifieth <hi>a preacher.</hi> Again, turn to Acts 15. 21. and there the holy Ghost will tell thee, that Moses was preached every day in
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:17738:39"/>
the Synagogues, while his words were read unto them. If thou saist, that Gods scriptures are too high for thy capacitie; then what say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est thou to the 19 Psalm. vers. 7. which teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that <hi>the testimony of the Lord giveth wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to the simple?</hi> And art thou so simple to think, that when God gave his scriptures to the Church, he gave them so darkly, that men might not understand them? then he might as well not have given them. Thou wilt object that of the Eunuch in Acts 8. 30, 31. where when Philip asked the Eunuch, whether he understood what he read, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, <hi>How can I, except I had a guide?</hi> And I answer thee again, that there is a great difference between the Eunuch and thee, and this place of scripture which he read, and the places of scripture which to thee are propounded: for he was out of the Church, which is the house of light, and thou art in it. Again, that scripture was to him a myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, but to thee it is no mysterie. For in Isaiah no name is exprest, but it is read, <hi>He was led as a sheep to the slaughter:</hi> but what <hi>he</hi> this was, the articles of our faith expresse to the simplest, that it was <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> the Messi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as of the world, who was delivered by the Jews to Pontius Pilate, to be slain for our redemption: and therefore this excuse of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is utterly taken from thee, because the Gospel is the blazing of the Law, and there
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:17738:39"/>
is nothing so dark in one place, but in some other it is so bright that the very blear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eied may see it. Therefore Fulgentius saith,<note place="margin">Serm. de Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens. Dom.</note> 
               <hi>In verbo Dei abundat quod perfectus comedat, abundat etiam quod parvulus sugat: Ibi est enim simul &amp; lacteus potus, quo tenera fidelium nutriatur infantia; &amp; solidus cibus, quo robusta perfectorum juventus spiritalia sanctae virtutis ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipiat incrementa. In the word of God aboundeth that which the perfect man may eat, and that which the little one may suck: For there is both drink of milk, whereby the tender infancy of the faithfull may be nourished; and solid meat, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the strong youth of the perfect may receive the spirituall increase of holy vertue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, Gods holy Sacraments are our preachers, while by visible and sensible signes they teach us what we are to beleeve; for which they are of the learned called <hi>visibilia verba, words visible.</hi> Therefore when we see the water in Baptisme, this bringeth to our remembrance the water and bloud which came out of our Saviours side: and when we see the bread and wine, this preacheth to us, that his bodie was broken, and his bloud shed for our sinnes, as the water si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifieth the washing away of our transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions. And these Sacraments do that for us that all the preachers of the land cannot do. For they by their words can but onely teach us, and enlighten our understanding; but
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:17738:40"/>
these preachers the Sacraments, besides the light which they give to our understanding, infuse, through Christs power and effectuall ordinance, grace into our souls, and make us acceptable before God. Yea, so effectually do they this, that they can never want grace after, who rightly receive them, and preserve the vertue of them. Therefore our Lord said to the woman in John 4. 14. <hi>Whosoever shall drink of the water that I shall give him, shall never be more athirst: but the water that I shall give him, shall be in him a well of water springing up into eternall life.</hi> This water is that grace which is bestowed upon us in Baptisme, which after the Eunuch had received, as we reade in Acts 8. 39. <hi>he went away rejoycing:</hi> and we reade not that he heard any more sermons, or received any other Sacraments; for his well of water, which he carried away with him into a farre heathen countrey, was sufficient for him. But oh the lamentation of our times! Who shall make our people to beleeve, that Christs Sacraments bestow grace? they say they signifie onely, and that faith cometh by hearing onely: yet when they have heard what they can, and beleeve what they will, they shall never be saved without the grace of the Sacraments, at least in desire. I can shew you of some that are saved without the hearing of the word preached; our baptized infants: but I can shew you of none saved ordinarily with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:17738:40"/>
the Sacraments, in regard of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours exception in John 3. 5. <hi>Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdome of God.</hi> Therefore the men which shut up all in the preaching of the word, evacuate Christs Sacraments, and do they know not what: for preaching is but a preparation for the Sacraments, and there the principall grace lies hid. For this cause our Saviour said to his Apostles, Matth. 28. 19. <hi>Go teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Sonne, and of the holy Ghost.</hi> For people must first be taught that God bestoweth grace in the Sacraments, or els they will not receive them. And the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Sacrament is Baptisme, because that onely bestoweth new life, and the rest strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en and preserve it.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, printed sermons are thy preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. For assoon as there is any rare sermon preached, by and by it is put to print, and from the presse it is disperst all the land over. There is scarce a house in any town, but one or other in it by reading can repeat it to thee. Then how shouldest thou starve for want of preaching, when the best preachers in the land, such as thou never sawest, nor they thee, yet by this means continually preach unto thee?</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Gods Spirit is thy preacher. And to prove this, see 1 John 2. 27. where it is
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:17738:41"/>
written, <hi>But that anointing which ye have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of him, dwelleth in you: and ye need not that any teach you: but, as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, &amp;c.</hi> This anointing is nothing els but Gods Spirit and grace bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon Christians in their Baptisme. And of this Spirit and grace speaketh S. Paul, 1. Cor. 2. 10. <hi>God hath revealed them to us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea the deep things of God.</hi> Then if Gods word be true, the Spirit of grace which he hath given to his children, is another of thy preachers.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, thy conscience is thy preacher. For assoon as thou hast done any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse, or left any thing undone that ought to be done, that will by and by tell thee of it. Thus Adam and Eves conscience, when they had eaten of the forbidden fruit, preached unto them, that they had offended God; and therefore they hid themselves, and made them breeches of fig-leaves. <hi>Who told thee,</hi> said God, <hi>that thou wast naked?</hi> oh his conscience, the first preacher, had made a sermon unto him. So again, when David had cut off but a<note place="margin">1. Sam. 24. 4, 5.</note> lap of Sauls garment privily, <hi>his heart smote him</hi> for it, and told him that he had wronged the Lords anointed. And again, when he had numbred the people, his heart touched<note place="margin">2. Sam. 24. 10.</note> him for it. Thus every mans conscience is his tutour, to teach and govern him, not
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:17738:41"/>
onely after, but before he hath done amisse. Wouldest thou be thus dealt withall, will it say? Thou mayst bribe thy preacher with a gift, and thou mayst stop the mouth of the parish-priest with a good tithe: but nothing will stop the mouth of thy conscience, that is a continuall preacher within thee. And of this preacher the prophet Isaiah saith further in his 30 chapter, vers. 21. <hi>And thine eares shall heare a word behinde thee, saying, This is the way, walk ye in it, when thou turnest to the right hand, and when thou turnest to the left.</hi> This <hi>word behinde thee,</hi> is the word of thy conscience; thou canst turn thy self no way but that will speak unto thee. If thou goest on thy left hand when thou shouldest go on thy right, it will call to thee and tell thee, Thou art out of thy way: and when thou art in the way, if thou goest too much to the right hand or too much to the left, it will say to thee with the Preacher in the book of the Preacher, <hi>Be not thou just overmuch, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccles. 7. 16.</note> 
               <hi>make thy self over-wise,</hi> play not the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite nor the proud fellow: for vertue is ever in the midst. But how comes thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science to preach thus to thee? from the law that is written in thine heart by the finger of Gods own hand, as S. Paul teacheth, Rom. 2. 15. <hi>Which shew the effect of the law writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in their hearts, their conscience bearing wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and their thoughts accusing one another, or</hi>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:17738:42"/>
               <hi>excusing.</hi> If thou dost ill, thy conscience will preach nothing to thee but the Law &amp; judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but if thou dost well, then nothing but the Gospel and mercie; then thy conscience will be to thee <hi>a continuall feast,</hi> as Solomon saith. Besides, thy conscience hath another law to inform thee, and this is the new cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the Gospel, spoken of Jer. 31. 33, 34. <hi>This shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel, After those dayes, saith the Lord, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts, and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for they shall all know me, from the least to the greatest, saith the Lord.</hi> Is this word of God true? then how canst thou complain for want of teaching, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thou wilt make Gods word a liar? And here you shall further understand, that there be two kindes of teaching; the one outward, the other inward: The outward is that which comes from the mouth of man; the inward is that which comes from the mouth of the conscience. And this inward teaching, because it is next to the heart, worketh farre more strongly upon it then the outward doth. When men had more of this inward teaching, and lesse of the outward, then was there farre bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter living; for then they lived alwayes in fear of offending: and assoon as they had done any
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:17738:42"/>
thing amisse, their conscience by and by gave them a nip and a <hi>memento</hi> for it. Then they confessed their sinnes to God and their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, for spirituall comfort and counsell; then they endeavoured to make the best temporall satisfaction they could, by almes, prayer, and fasting, and other good works of humiliation: but now outward teaching, being not rightly understood, hath beaten away this. Faith one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly justifieth, saith the vulgar preacher. Then, saith the Solifidian and loose liver, what need I care how I live? no sinne can hurt me so long as I beleeve. Thy preacher and thou are both in an errour; because Gods word no where teacheth this, but the contrary. <hi>Ye see,</hi> saith S. James, <hi>how a man is justified by works,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jam. 2. 24.</note> 
               <hi>and not by faith onely.</hi> Thou wilt say, The Fathers taught this doctrine, and our own Church too. But how, and in what sense? to shut out works before faith be come, and to acknowledge faith to be the onely begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the preparations of our justification: but our young preachers and hearers shut up all in faith onely, and stay at the beginning; and thus, <hi>verbo tenus,</hi> they prove but half-Christians. Thine own conscience will preach better to thee; for that will exclude no vertue, and admit no vice. And as for thee which art an hearer, though thy principles be good, yet thy apprehension cannot well digest them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they be somewhat above thy reach.
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:17738:43"/>
Therefore the Church in all ages hath provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that the common people should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with the <hi>common faith,</hi> as S. Paul cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it, Titus 1. 4. and that deep mysteries should be reserved for the learned, who have their wits <hi>exercised to discern both good and</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hebr.</hi> 5. 14. Canon Apost. 48.</note> 
               <hi>evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seventhly, good life and conversation of Christians is thy preacher, by which very heathens may be wonne and converted to God. But you will say, How prove you that? Turn to 1. Pet. 3. 1. where you shall finde it thus written, <hi>Let wives be subject to their hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, that even they which obey not the word, may without the word be wonne by the conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the wives, while they behold your pure conversation coupled with fear.</hi> Here see the force of this preaching; when the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the word cannot prevail, then men may be wonne by good conversation without the word preached: <hi>while they behold your pure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation coupled with fear.</hi> Good life, my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, is better then a good sermon: for that with many goes in at one eare, and out at the other; but a good life is a sermon in print, it is alwaies before thee to behold, and it makes deep penetration, when it speaks in almes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeds or benefits. This I confirm to you by examples of instance. In the second book of Eusebius his Ecclesiasticall Historie and the 9 chapter, we reade, that when he which drew
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:17738:43"/>
S. James before the tribunall, saw that he would suffer martyrdome willingly, he was therewith so moved, that he confessed himself to be a Christian, &amp; so was beheaded together with him, after S. James had forgiven him at his request, and kissed him. His words are these; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Likewise this sermon of good life and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation had so wonne Ruth to the true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, that when her mother in law Naomi was to return from the heathen countrey of Moab, her two daughters in law, Ruth and Orpah, bearing her companie in the way, at last Naomi spake thus unto them, <hi>Turn again</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ruth 1. 11.</note> 
               <hi>my daughters, for there is no more hope of husbands for you by me.</hi> Then Ruth thus replied, <hi>Intreat</hi>
               <note place="margin">vers. 16, 17.</note> 
               <hi>me not to leave thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou dwellest, I will dwell: thy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple shall be my people, and thy God shall be my God: Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: the Lord do so to me, and more also, if ought but death part thee and me.</hi> Now if the life and conversation of simple women and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literate, be of such vertue to winne and turn people to God; then shall the good life of thy Minister be nothing worth, against whom thou canst prove nothing? Some parishes (as
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:17738:44"/>
men say) have good preachers, but bad livers; and some have mean preachers, or readers, but good livers: which of these are best? I say, The good liver is the best preacher. For the bad liver, as fast as he buildeth with one hand, pulls down again with the other: but the good-living Minister, what he buildeth by his reading of Gods word, prayer, and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string of the Sacraments, pulls not down a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, but upholds all with his good life; and therefore he is farre the best preacher. The one builds in shew, the other in substance. This S. Hierome upon the 22 Psalme confirmeth; <hi>Ille plus didicit, qui plus facit, &amp;c. He hath learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed most, that doth most. If</hi> (saith he) <hi>that which thou hast learned I do, my works do more hold the scriptures, then thy sermon which makes a vain sound.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Eighthly, parents are preachers to their children and servants. The first world for more then two thousand yeares together, untill the giving of the Law, had no other preachers. Then every private mans house was a church; as it is in the epistle to Philemon, vers. 2. <hi>And to the church in thy house.</hi> And according to this God said of Abraham, <hi>Shall I hide from</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 18. 17, 19.</note> 
               <hi>Abraham that thing which I do?—For I know that he will command his sonnes and his houshold after him, that they keep the way of the Lord, to do righteousnesse and judgement.</hi> And this kinde of preaching was commanded by God in the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:17738:44"/>
Law, Deut. 6. 7. <hi>And thou shalt rehearse them continually to thy children.</hi> And Solomon, Prov. 1. 8. thus beginneth his sermon to his sonne Roboam, <hi>My sonne, heare thy fathers instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and forsake not thy mothers teaching.</hi> For as the mothers milk is more nourishing to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant, then the milk of strangers: so the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of parents is more acceptable to youth, then the teaching of the learned. My father and mother were the first that converted me to God, by their example and teaching. And this kinde of preaching was not onely before the Law, and after the Law; but it is continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed also in the Gospel, as we reade Ephes. 6. 4. <hi>Ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.</hi> And this kinde of preaching is so need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, that the Church hath derived it from the naturall parents to the spirituall parents, (who are Gods Ministers) in catechizing of youth. And this kinde of preaching, as the most anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and effectuall, is so highly commended of King James before all other, that in his second direction to the Archbishop of Canterburie, he giveth this charge, <hi>That those preachers be most encouraged and approved of, who spend the afternoon exercises in examining children in their Catechisme, and in expounding the severall heads thereof; which</hi> (saith he) <hi>is the most ancient and laudable custome of teaching in the Church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</hi> But how is this regarded? Preaching
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:17738:45"/>
hath preacht away catechizing, and the new preaching hath beat out the old. Now adayes every mans own wit is best, though it be the greenest and youngest.</p>
            <p>A ninth kinde of preachers are thy Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an neighbours: for they have not gone so long to church &amp; to sermons, but they have learned something to speak of the knowledge of God and his laws, &amp; in the way of good living. And this duty S. Paul requireth of all in Coloss. 3. 16. <hi>Let the word of Christ dwell in you plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in all wisdome, teaching and admonishing one another.</hi> And thus sometime one neighbour ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monisheth another of his faults, sometime an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient kindred instruct their younger in the fear of the Lord, and sometime servants give good advice to their masters and dames, as the servants of Naaman the Syrian did: The maid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servant perswaded her mistris, that her lord should go to the prophet in Samaria; and when that her lord was at a stand, his men-servants gave him this good counsell, as we reade in 2. Kings 5. 13. <hi>Father, if the prophet had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded thee a great thing, wouldest thou not have done it? how much rather then, when he saith to thee, Wash and be clean?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tenthly, Gods Minister is thy preacher, and the divine Service in the Church-book is his sermon. In this service and in this sermon is contained whatsoever is necessary to salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But you will say, How prove you that?
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:17738:45"/>
I say, thus: Whatsoever is necessary to salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is contained in these foure points; in true faith, in good life, in prayer, and grace. True faith is contained in the three Creeds, of the Apostles, of Nice, and of Athanasius; the two latter being the exposition of the former. Good life is expressed in the ten command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; Prayer in the Lords prayer, the Leta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, and the rest; and grace in the Sacraments. You will say, We plain people cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand these without some to explain them. I answer, Canst thou tell me of one man that can make them more plain to thee by his words, then God himself and his blessed Apostles have done by their words? But thou wilt say further, that thou hast need of some bodie to stirre them up unto thee. Hast thou not thy Minister to do this for thee every Sunday and holiday in catechizing? But thou likest not of this, because it is not a sermon. How provest thou that? Because it is not spoken out of the pulpit, nor delivered out of a text. I reply, Are not the articles of the faith, the Lords prayer, and the Sacraments exprest in scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture? are not these texts? But they are not delivered out of the pulpit. If the pulpit make a sermon, then where dost thou reade that Christ and his Apostles at any time made ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons? Didst thou ever reade of a pulpit in the scripture? But tell me, thou man all for sermons, what is a sermon? is it not a speech
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:17738:46"/>
of God and heavenly things? and then is not the divine service this? But thou wilt shift out further and say, This is not after the manner of our preachers, who make divisions, answer objections, lay open the scope of the text, and amplifie it by divers <hi>theses</hi> and uses to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. Then what sayest thou to the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sermons, which, for the more honour, from the Greek tongue are called <hi>Homilies?</hi> are not<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> these framed just after the manner of your preachers? I but thou wilt say, These are dead sermons, because they are onely read; in which reading there is little or no life. Then why hath the Church made them? why hath the Church commanded them to be read? would the Church have mens souls to be fed with dead things? But tell me, what difference is there between a sermon read, &amp; the same ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon spoken by memorie and by heart? there is the same pronunciation, the same sense, the same invention. But I will prove to thee out of Gods word, (if thou wilt beleeve Gods word) that the very reading of it is preaching, and not onely preaching, but lively and working preaching, working upon mens souls to grace and goodnesse. And that Gods word read un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us is preaching, you shall finde it expressed in Acts 15. 21. where it is thus written, <hi>For Moses of old time hath in every citie them that preach him, seeing he is read in the synagogues every sabbath-day.</hi> Where the reason why
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:17738:46"/>
Moses, that is to say, the Law of Moses, was preached every sabbath to the Jews, is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to be this, Because it was every sabbath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day read unto them. Next, that this reading is no dead preaching, but lively and working, see 2. Kings 22. 10, 11, and 19 verses. There you shall finde, that the bare reading of the Law by Shaphan the Chancellour did so work upon good king Josiah, that he rent his clothes, and wept, and his heart melted before the Lord. Secondly, the bare reading of the roll from Jeremies mouth, caused the people to fast and pray, and fear, and to return from their evil way, as you may reade in Jeremie 36. Thirdly, the bare reading of Baruchs book made the governour, the kings sonne, and all the people to weep, fast and pray, and fear, and to return from their evil way, as you may reade in the first chapter of that book. Whose preaching can work better effects? Fourthly, by Gods word written and read, faith is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, as you may reade in John 20. 31. <hi>These things are written, that ye may beleeve that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus is that Christ the Sonne of God, and that in beleeving ye might have life through his name.</hi> If men may have life eternall by reading holy writing<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, then what wretches are they which seek to discredit this! Again, this is proved from Christs command in John 5. 39. <hi>Search the scriptures,</hi> (that is to say, Study them by your reading) <hi>for they are they which testifie of</hi>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:17738:47"/>
               <hi>me.</hi> From all which I conclude, that they which deny reading of the scriptures to be a lively and effectuall kinde of preaching, and disable it from begetting faith and other spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall vertues, make Jeremiah a false prophet, Baruch a false historian, the second book of Kings false scripture, John a false apostle, and our Saviour a false Christ: for all these affirm it. Further, if there be no life in reading, then what is in the Psalmes which are sung in the church to Gods praise? for they are not preached: is there no edifying in them neither? then why doth the Apostle say, Coloss. 3. 16. <hi>Teaching and admonishing your own selves in psalmes, and hymnes, and spirituall songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord?</hi> But to come nearer to thee; when our commissioners of justice under the King send their warrants to our cities and villages, and they are read to thee by our under-officers, dost thou not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand them? dost thou not prepare thy self to perform them? Now canst thou understand &amp; beleeve the warrants of men when they are read to thee, and canst thou not understand and beleeve the warrants of Almighty God when they are read by his Ministers? Cannot God as significantly expresse himself unto thee as a Lieutenant, a Justice, or a chief Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable? If thou takest exception at Gods greatnesse and his high style, know thou that he spake to men. And though he once wrote
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:17738:47"/>
his law with his own finger, and spake it with his own mouth; yet ever since he hath spoken all his divine precepts, and written all his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine warrants by such men as we our selves are, and used too our own words and dialects. If thou objectest the deep revelations of S. John, or the hard things of S. Paul; then I<note place="margin">2.

            <p>Such dainty and queasie stomacks were in S. Chrysostomes time, who was the most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous preacher of the Greek Church. His words are these, in his third homilie upon the 2. Thess. where he brings in the Puritane thus speaking, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>This hath marred and corrupted all.</hi> And afterward answereth the Puritane in this manner, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>. <hi>What need is there of a preacher? by our negligence this necessitie is made.</hi> Then he sheweth the reason; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>For what need is there of preaching? all things are cleare and plain in the scriptures; all things necessary are manifest: but because you are delicate hearers,</hi> (hunting after pleasure in your hearing) <hi>therefore ye seek these things.</hi> Where you understand from this famous and judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous preacher, that the besotted negligence of our delicate Puritanes is that which makes them to runne so after sermons. God speaks unto thee every holy day by his own word; wilt not thou understand him? or canst thou not understand him? If thou saist thou canst not; then thou makest God but a mean tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher. But if God be a good teacher and a plain teacher, as may appeare in the articles of the faith, in the ten commandments, and the Lords prayer; and if all things necessarie to salvation are manifest in the scripture, as that learned S. Chrysostome sheweth: then for shame gather thy wits together, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand. Wilt thou ever be a childe? <hi>Brethren,</hi> (saith S.

               <hi>in malitiousnesse be ye children, but in under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing be of a ripe age.</hi> Understandest thou these words? they are plain enough; and why canst thou not understand them, when they are read to thee out of Gods book? wilt thou ever be like a young bird, fed out of the dammes bill? canst thou not eat thy meat when it is before thee, except another put it into thy mouth, or chew it for thee, as nurses do for young infants? fie on this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligence!</p>
            <p>But to conclude with thee; After thou hast had so many preachers, and heard so many sermons, the creatures teaching thee, Gods word teaching thee, the Sacraments teaching thee, printed sermons teaching thee, Gods Spirit teaching thee, thy conscience teaching thee, good life and conversation teaching thee, thy neighbours teaching thee, parents teaching thee, and lastly Gods Ministers teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thee, ten in all, a compleat number, and will not all this suffice thee? No. Why? because thou art out of thy self, thou singest a note above Ela, thou art puft up, thou wilt be confined to no order, and to no measure. For, whereas the Canons have tied thee to thine own Pastour, and to thine own church, thou runnest in the forenoon to one parish, and in the afternoon to another; no one place will content thee, if there be not a sermon fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon &amp; afternoon. Would you not be loth, say
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:17738:49"/>
they, to have but one meal a day? What preacher taught thee that the food of thy soul is of no stronger nourishment then the food of thy body? Eliah travelled in the strength of one meal 40 daies and 40 nights to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. If he went so long unfamisht with one meal of the food which perisheth; then how long thinkest thou maist thou travel with the <hi>food which never perisheth, but endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to everlasting life?</hi> John 6. 27.</p>
            <p>But what doth this singularitie work in thee, but a contempt of government, and a condemning of all other save thy self? Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is contemned, because they will not yeeld to it; their own Minister is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned, els ask the woman of the next pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, who called her Ministers preaching <hi>Bulls-bief:</hi> yet she paid for good ox-bief, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Commissarie left her. And what think they of their neighbours that follow them not? oh they are but civil men and women, they sit at home and starve their souls. Are not these puft up, when they take upon them Gods place and office? do they starve their souls, which make to God a most humble confession of their sinnes, intreating him in Christs name to forgive them? are they but civil men and women, which make a publick profession of the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghost? and do they starve their souls, who pray to God for grace and for all bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:17738:49"/>
spirituall and temporall? and are they but civil men, who every Lords day lay up the law of God in their hearts, and follow it in their lives all the week after? If thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours be in the state of salvation, then why bearest thou not them companie? but if thou condemnest thy neighbours, and wilt be sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular by thy self; then I will say unto thee, as the good Emperour Constantine said once to the Arch-puritane Novatus, <hi>Scalam in coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum erigito, &amp;c. Make thee a ladder, and climbe up from us into heaven alone.</hi> But thou wilt say, Oh but knowledge is a good thing: I would be glad to have more knowledge. So is hony a good thing too, and yet a man may eat too much of it, as Solomon teacheth in Pro. 25. 16. <hi>If thou have found hony, eat that which is sufficient for thee, lest thou be over-full and vomit it.</hi> Doth Solomon speak this of honies excesse onely, and not of immoderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in generall? For as the weak stomack cannot well digest much meat; so the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and plain people cannot govern much knowledge: and when they cannot govern and well digest it, then they vomit it, as the weak stomack casteth up the sweet hony. Then they wax proud, and will contest with their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, as Miriam and Aaron did with Moses;<note place="margin">Numb. 12.</note> then they will talk of Antichrist; then they will soar into points of predestination, and will be moderatours between Papists and

Protestants; and what will they not do? when they finde their wings but spoon-feathered, they will offer to flie. Were the learned at this time my auditorie, I would ask of them at what time most heresies were broached, and they would tell me, that it was in the primitive Church, when there was most preaching; therefore afterward they slacked it. And is it not so now too? Then ask the cobler of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterdam. There every tradesman will be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest preacher.

            <p>But now besides the ten kindes of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, of which I have alreadie entreated, and which are able to stop the mouthes of all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented and itching-ear'd professours, there is yet another kinde of preaching, which is not fit for every Minister, but for extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie and excellent men, called by God and the Church to reform errours and abuses, or to promulge to the world new laws and canons. And as this kinde is to be performed by extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary men, so it is not alwaies so needfull, but onely when necessitie requireth: for when things are setled, there needs no more set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, but onely preserving. We ought not to have many Moseses, nor many Evangelists, nor many Apostles. According to this, when idolatrie was spread over the land of Judah,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:17738:53"/>
the good King Jehoshaphat sent his princes, Ben-hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethaneel, and Michaiah, with the choise of the priests and Levites, and with the book of the Law, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call the people from the worship of false Gods, to the worship of the true God, as you may reade in 2. Chron. 17. Thus again when the Scribes and Pharisees had corrupted the Law by their traditions, then came the great Doctour of the Church, Jesus Christ, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged it by his preaching upon the mount, as you may reade in Matth. 5, 6, and 7 chapters. Again, after our Saviour had finisht the great work of our redemption by his rising from the dead, then he sent his twelve Apostles to preach the new law all the world over. <hi>Go</hi> (saith he) <hi>and teach all nations, baptizing them</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 28. 19.</note> 
               <hi>in the name of the Father, and of the Sonne, and of the holy Ghost.</hi> Were people now to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and converted to the Gospel, then not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this kinde of preaching, but miracles also were needfull: but, as S. Augustine saith, <hi>When all the world beleeveth, what need mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles?</hi> and what need is now of Apostles, and Evangelists, and 70 Disciples?</p>
            <p>Lastly, when much needlesse, and some unsound teaching, by tract of time had sued into the ark of Christs Church, by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates and priests thereof; then in the 19 yeare of King Henrie the 8, began licenses to be granted by the court of Starre-chamber, to
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:17738:53"/>
preach against the corruptions of the time, like to that of King Jehoshaphat. But now, thanks be to God, the corruptions are remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and the ancient and true doctrine of the primitive Church by settled articles is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored: therefore this extraordinarie kinde is not now so necessarie, except it be upon some notorious crimes breaking in upon our people, or some exorbitancies of green heads broaching the froth of their own brains, which will hardly be reformed, untill many of these be unfurnisht of their licenses, and those that are permitted be restrained to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain times and seasons. For better were it for our Church and people, to have but one ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon well premeditated in a moneth, (which is insinuated by the Canon) then two upon a day, proceeding from a rolling brain, and mouth without due preparation. Such sermons are abortive, like cast calves, coming out of the wombe before the time: and they runne into the curse of the Prophet Jeremiah, <hi>Maledictus</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 48. 10.</note> 
               <hi>qui facit opus Domini negligenter, Cursed be he that doth the work of the Lord negligently.</hi> Many of these men, partly to serve the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of others, and partly to seek their own applause, after they have been in the high place, and saluted after the descent, take it upon them, as though they were young pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and new apostles, to preach a new Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel to the world, as our Puritanes, Brownists,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:17738:54"/>
and other Novelists have done. I reade in Socrates Scholasticus, <hi>l.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 20. that <hi>at Alexandria the inferiour priest did not use to preach: but that order first began, when Arius turned up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side down the quiet estate of the Church.</hi> But we have so many inferiour and young priests preaching among us, that all the Bishops in the land can hardly keep down their wrong and unseasoned doctrine, if <hi>Vox populi</hi> may be judge. Such are work-makers, and not finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of work. See Calvine upon 1. Cor. 1. 17. <hi>Sed cùm paucorum esset docere, pluribus autem baptizare datum fuerit.</hi> And S. Paul saith, <hi>Are all teachers?</hi> 1. Cor. 12. 29.</p>
            <p>Having shewed this kinde of preaching to be extraordinarie, for speciall men, speciall times and occasions; it followeth that the preaching by reading, proved out of Acts 15. and other places of scripture, is the ordinarie preaching, ordained by God himself in his Church, as you may see in the 4. chapter of the epistle to the Colossians and 16 verse; where S. Paul writeth thus, <hi>And when this epistle is read of you, cause that it be read in the church of the Laodiceans also, and that ye like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise reade the epistle from Laodicea.</hi> This was the ordinarie preaching in our Church before king Henrie the eighth, and this was the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary preaching in the synagogues of the Jews, as you may see in Acts 13. 15. and by the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the three Hebrew <gap reason="foreign">

Bible. And by this demonstration of the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarinesse of the kinde, person, and time, we may answer all objections made of confused and undistinguishing wits, out of 2. Tim. 4. and all other places of scripture, because par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular precepts do not binde all persons and confine all times. For who can expect those gifts in the ordinarie Ministers of our dayes, which God bestowed upon the extraordinarie Ministers, and times of the first preaching of the Gospel? And as for our large-carving pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessours in their way of preaching and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, this I finde, that they which professe least, live more justly then they which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse and know most; because, as my text di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteth me, <hi>knowledge puffes</hi> them <hi>up,</hi> and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their knowledge they presume: for the more they know, the lesse they fear; and the lesse they fear, the more they offend. Who are more bold then they which know most and fear least? The skilfullest captain, he most hazardeth; the cunningest physician, he kills most; and the ripest wits runne into greatest oversights. Why? because they presume so much of their knowledge; and presuming draws carelesnesse. Wherefore they which know lesse, are the more industrious. <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge puffeth up, but Charitie edifieth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now to conclude with thee which runnest after this extraordinarie kinde, where thou thinkest best; I will shew the inconvenience.

First, thou breakest the Church-canon: and when thou fallest on breaking of Canons, then follows nothing but confusion &amp; disorder. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, thou discreditest thine own Minister, though he hath better parts and gifts then the men that thou runnest after. Thirdly, thou troublest thy neighbours seats in a strange church. Fourthly, thy servants and children will no<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Fifthly, when thou shouldest help thy neighbours in singing psalmes to Gods praise, then thy trumpet is abroad in another parish. Lastly, if all the rest should follow thee, some would fall short under hedges, and there pray lewd parts. The Lord open thine eyes to give thee more discretion, that thou mayst give a better example.</p>

               <p>HAving spoken of the first part of my text, now I must proceed to the second, in which I must as much extoll Charitie, as before I disabled unformed knowledge: for it was never the Apostles minde nor mine to speak any thing against well qualified know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,<note place="margin">2. Esdras 14. 42.</note> which belongs to perfect men, as the learned have noted; nor yet against moderate and sober knowledge, fit for all sorts of men,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:17738:55"/>
taught by the forenamed preachers; but onely to withstand the immoderatenesse and misgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernance of it in the vulgar, who know no better how to use it, then a mad man doth a sword. If thy knowledge be greater then thy charitie, then it will do more hurt then good: but if thy charitie exceed thy knowledge, then that by its government makes all good; because charitie is the master and governour of knowledge. You may surfet with know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; so you cannot with charitie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Knowledge puffeth up, but Charitie edifieth.</hi> The word <hi>but</hi> signifieth a difference between charitie and knowledge, because the conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is discretive. And indeed the difference is great, as the Apostle expresseth; because charitie is (to use the School phrase) an act giving life and perfection, it edifieth among the vertues theologicall and morall: but knowledge without charitie is a matter of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, because it puffeth up: it is like a bladder or bubble, which have nothing but winde in them; the one lifteth up in nature, the other lifteth up in God. But here it may be objected, What meaneth the Apostle thus to disable knowledge; seeing by it we depart from evil, and are informed to good? and the prophet Isaiah saith in his 53 chapter, vers. 11. <hi>By his knowledge shall my righteous servant justifie ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny:</hi> where knowledge is made the cause of our justification. I answer, that wheresoever
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:17738:56"/>
                  <hi>knowledge</hi> in holy scripture is taken in a good sense, there it is <hi>vox complexa,</hi> as <hi>sapientia</hi> is by S. Bernard called <hi>sapida scientia, savourie know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:</hi>

                  </note> for in this knowledge, charitie, which is the extern form of knowledge, is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended. But here in this text of scripture, <hi>Knowledge</hi> is <hi>vox incomplexa,</hi> standing alone by it self, and in opposition to <hi>Charitie;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore here it produceth no good effect, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pride, which is enemie to goodnesse. But charitie is the substance of Christianitie, and therefore is called of the School Divines <hi>grace it self.</hi> And this, in the building of a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an toward heaven, is the master-builder: for the more it worketh in us, the better and big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Christians we grow, according to that of S. Augustine, <hi>Charitas inchoata, inchoata justitia</hi>

Charitie begunne, is righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse begunne; charitie increased, is righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse increased; great charitie, is great righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; and perfect charitie, is perfect righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi> And when this is come, then there is no difference between God and man; it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie between God and man; it is, as S.

               <p>Yea, that which is the most comfortable<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 2. Rom. 5. 5. Gal. 5. 23.</note> and remarkable point in all Christianitie, is the <hi>law of the Spirit of life, which freeth from the</hi>

                  <hi>law of sinne and of death:</hi> and this is the main refuge to the distressed conscience. There are in the best two laws ruling in them; because the best are compounded of two, the flesh and the spirit. The law of the flesh is concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scence,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Magist. Sent. l. 2. dist. 31. b</hi> Nullum pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catum morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le secum pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titur. The law of charity ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filleth the law of facts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Decalogue.</note> which gives precepts onely for the flesh, whose end is sinne and death; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is called <hi>the law of sinne &amp; of death:</hi> and the law of the spirit is charitie, which gives precepts onely for holinesse and righteousnes; and this is called <hi>the law of life,</hi> because the end of it is life. These two laws are <hi>ex diametro</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite one to the other in the regenerate: &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they be both of force in this life, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the regenerate are carried both wayes, sometimes to sinne, and sometimes to holines and vertue. But because charitie, which is the root of all good desires, is the more noble law,<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 5.</note> as being the law of the spirit, and is in all evil actions, first or last, or both, opposite to them,<note place="margin">

Therefore when the blessed Apostle besought God, that the prick in the flesh, that is to say, concupiscence, the law of sinne and death, might be removed from him, he would not grant it, but told him, <hi>My grace</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Cor. 12. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>shall be sufficient for thee:</hi> and this is nothing
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:17738:57"/>
else but charitie, which freeth the compound from sinne and death; because, as S. Peter saith, it <hi>covereth the multitude of sinnes,</hi> it will<note place="margin">1. Pet. 4. 8.</note> not suffer them to appeare. And the reason why God would not have the law of the flesh and of sinne to be outed from this holy man, and from the regenerate, was, because he would have his grace to conflict with the flesh, that after the conflict his grace might be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour: <hi>For my power</hi> (saith God) <hi>is made perfect through weaknesse.</hi> But there is no greater weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in man then concupiscence, the lust of the flesh; which being overcome by charities de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, Gods grace and power is advanced and perfected. And this law of the spirit, S. Paul<note place="margin">2. Cor. 3. 6.</note> opposeth to the law of the letter, which is knowledge when it is separate from the spirit: and this killeth as well in the ministerie of the Gospel, as in the ministerie of the Law of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, as S. Augustine teacheth, <hi>lib. de spiritu &amp; litera;</hi> because the more knowledge we have, the greater shall be our condemnation, if we want the spirit of charitie to put it in practise. Will you know then what charitie is, which is thus advanced above knowledge? It is the most noble above all vertues, as our Apostle teacheth, 1. Cor. 13. 13. <hi>Now abideth faith, hope, and charitie, but the greatest of these is charitie.</hi> He saith not, <hi>shall be,</hi> as Calvin and Beza offer to evacuate the Apostles comparison &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation; but <hi>is</hi> now: <hi>Now abideth faith, hope,</hi>

As concupiscence is the root of all vices; so this is the root of all vertues: it is the souls sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied appetite. Every man that hath wit and discretion, will make choice of the best and the fairest; but charitie is the best of all Gods gifts, above faith, and hope, and knowledge; and therefore above all things I wish you to seek and follow that. In the twelfth chapter before, the Apostle sets down all the better sort of Gods gifts, among which he placeth wisdome, knowledge, faith, working of mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and the rest; and then willeth them to make choice of the best; <hi>But</hi> (saith he) <hi>desire</hi>

And though I had the gift of prophesie, and knew all secrets, and all knowledge; yea, if I had all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and had not charitie, I were nothing. And though I feed the poore with all my</hi>

               <p>But what is the reason why all other gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces without this are worth nothing? Because without charitie they are as a bodie without a soul. Hadst thou a bodie as well framed as Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anders and Hero's was, yet if thou hadst not a spirit to move in it, thou shouldest have but a dead bodie worth nothing, as S. James teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of faith without charitie by the effect of works; <hi>As the bodie without the spirit is dead, so</hi>
                  <note place="margin">James 2. 26.</note> 
                  <hi>faith without works is dead also:</hi> for where no works are, there is no charitie; and where no charitie is, there faith and works and all is dead. Therefore the Apostle saith, <hi>Though I feed the poore with all my goods, and have not cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, it profiteth me nothing.</hi> Why? because without charitie works are dead, as well as faith, and knowledge, and other graces. And where there is charitie, that is to say, a divine love to God and all goodnesse, there all things are alive, and every grace working to salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Faith beleeveth to salvation, hope hopeth to salvation, knowledge knoweth to salvation; all work by charities spirit. Hence the School calleth charitie <hi>the form of vertues.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But you may say, How prove you that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine love and charitie is the spirit that giveth life and motion to all other graces? Thus, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:17738:58"/>
faith, which is the first grace, worketh by it: Gal. 5. 6. <hi>For in Jesus Christ neither circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but faith which worketh by charitie.</hi> Then as all the members of the bodie work by the power of the soul; so faith and other graces in the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall body work by the power of charitie: First, because charitie is the impulse of the Christian soul. Neither can you with reason say, that, because faith is the first grace in spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritualitie, therefore all animation and motion proceedeth from it; because in generation the matter goeth before the form, and in the body of man there is vegetation and animalitie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to other creatures, before the reasonable soul come, which is the sole beginning of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons reasonable. Secondly, I prove this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause where is no charitie, there all is dead, as S. John sheweth, <hi>He that loveth not his brother,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Joh. 3. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>abideth in death.</hi> Again, <hi>We know that we are translated from death to life, because we love the brethren.</hi> Where love is, there is life; and where no love is, there is no life. Thirdly, I prove this, because God is our life: but God is charitie, as Saint John sheweth, <hi>God</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Joh. 4. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>is charitie, and he that remaineth in charitie, remaineth in God, and God in him.</hi> If God be charitie, then charitie in the Christian must needs be his life; because our charitie floweth from his charitie. Fourthly, I shew that charitie is the life of all vertues and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:17738:59"/>
because it is the root of the spirituall tree within us, as S. Paul teacheth, Ephes. 3. 17, 18, 19. <hi>That ye being rooted and grounded in charity, may be able to comprehend with all saints, what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height: and to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye may be filled with all the fulnesse of God.</hi> Here ye see charitie to be the root: therefore so long as the root lasteth, no vertue or grace can wither in us; but if the root die, all die. All comes from the root; the leaves, the blossoms, the fruit. If there be either ornament of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, or fruit of grace in us, all comes from the root of charitie. Yea, the life of vertue not onely comes from this root, but there it is kept and preserved too: for when winter and cold storms come, then the sappe for shelter runnes down to the root, and there it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served till the next spring: so again, when the winter of Gods wrath, and storms of perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution assault the profession of the Gospel, then by and by we retire to the root of chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and there is our profession preserved till the storm be over. Thus Peter denied his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster thrice when he was going to his death: yet because he still loved his Master, therefore his life remained in him; in the time of perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution it lay hid in the root of charitie.</p>
               <p>The Apostle goeth forward, <hi>That ye may be able to comprehend with all saints, what is the length, and breadth, and height, and depth.</hi> Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:17738:59"/>
breaks forth into all the dimensions of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall growth. The prophet Isaiah, rather then he would forsake his God, was sawn asunder in the midst: <hi>others were racked and would not be</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 35.</note> 
                  <hi>delivered;</hi> they would not be delivered, but held out to the death. The blessed Marie Magdalene washt our Saviours feet with her tears, and wiped them drie again with the hairs of her head. Oh blessed charitie! If thou hast this root in thee, thou also shalt compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend this breadth, and length, height, and depth; and thou shalt with these holy Saints say, If I had been in their coats, or had their occasions, I would have done as they did. This is that love of Christ which passeth knowledge, and this is the fulnesse of God.</p>
               <p>To proceed, Charitie is the most excellent grace, because it is the divine seed of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,<note place="margin">1. Joh. 4. 7.</note> by which we are born of God and freed from mortall sinne. 1. John 3. 9. <hi>Whosoever is born of God, sinneth not: for his seed remaineth in him.</hi> This seed S. Hierome in his 2 book a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Jovinian, and S. Austine in his 5 tract<note place="margin">Peccatum mortale nunquam cum gratia esse possit.</note> upon 1. John, calleth charitie: for in it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the beginning of our conversion to God, which is a holy desire. For no man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireth any thing untill he loves it: but when he loves it, then he desires it; when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires it, then he seeks it; after he hath sought it, then he findes it, according to that in the Gospel, <hi>Seek and ye shall finde, knock and it</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 7. 7</note>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:17738:60"/>
                  <hi>shall be opened:</hi> and when a man hath found, because he loves it entirely, he will so cleave to it, that he will not be removed from it. So is it between the regenerate heart and God. When God hath given a man a heart to love him, then he beginnes to desire him; when he desires him, then he seeks him, then he knocks at heaven gates by prayer, and will not away till God open to him, because his seed remaineth in him. And after he hath found him, then he so cleaves to him by hope, and hangs so fast upon him, that he will die before he leave him; because faith hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded him that God is his maker and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, and that he is moreover <hi>a rewarder of them that diligently seek him,</hi> Heb. 11. 6. And how will he reward him? not with gold and silver, which are corruptible; but with life everlasting, and the joyes of heaven. Oh here is enough, we will seek no further.</p>
               <p>Thus you see how love and charitie sets the soul to desire and seek God above all things, and so charitie is the beginning of our conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: and after it hath begun, it will never cease seeking untill it hath found and obtained. Were a man by faith perswaded, that God is the authour of all happinesse, and that all the goods in heaven and earth lay in him treasured up; yet if he should love the goods of the world more then God, then he would never set his heart to seek and desire him. But when
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:17738:60"/>
faith hath enlightned the minde to know God, then if the love of the heart will forsake the world and things worldly, and seek him who is supernaturall happinesse, then is conversion wrought, and not before. Faith converts the minde to God: but it is love and charitie that converts the heart and will to God, which is the greatest and last conversion, because we never seek any thing untill we desire it. Our conversion therefore is begun in the minde by faith: but this conversion is but half a conversion, yea, it is no conversion of the whole man, except the love of the heart, where lieth the greatest apprehension, do second and follow it. We see salvation by faith: but we never obtain it, untill we desire and seek it by charities desire. Wherefore I conclude, that, for so much as charitie is the nearest and immediate cause of our conversion, of our seeking and finding God, therefore this is the most precious grace of God for our good, and is the greatest mean and instrument of our ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification; because justification and conversion to God is all one: for God is our righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: but the greatest mean of our apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him is by charitie, which layes hold of him in the will and reasonable affection: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this must be the greatest mean of our ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification, signified by the Apostle, where he speaks of the severall means, <hi>Now abideth</hi>

Then</hi> (saith he) <hi>the king should plough better then the husbandman, should make shoes better then the shoemaker, because he is more noble then them both: Then a man should run swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then a horse, should carry a greater burden then an elephant, because he excells them in dignitie: Then angels should illuminate the earth better then the sunne and moon, because they are more excellent.</hi> But this is nothing but a running from the state of the question; because every thing that is greatest and best to his proper object, and in proper comparison, is not great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est and best to every object, and in every com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison. But the Apostle here compareth charitie with justifying faith and hope abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, and in the most excellent way, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in the 31 verse of the 12 chapter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foregoing; and it is manifest, that the most excellent way is the way of our justification and conversion to God: and here he affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this to be the greatest and chiefest, and therefore absolutely so it is. Again, he preferreth faith before charitie, because faith
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:17738:61" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is the cause of charitie. If he could shew faith to be the efficient cause of it, he should say something: but when he can prove it to be no more but the disposing and instrumentall cause; then, by the same argument, the ax should be greater and better then the house, because it is an instrument used in the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of it: which argument is absurd.</p>
               <p>But to prove the truth for this noble ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, which none shall be able to overturn, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is founded upon the rock of Gods word, I have these arguments. 1. <hi>God justifieth,</hi> Rom. 8. 33. <hi>God is charitie,</hi> John 4. 8. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore charitie justifieth. 2. The fulnesse of God in man is that which justifieth him. Charitie is the fulnesse of God in man, Ephes. 3. 19. Therefore charitie justifieth him. 3. The ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of the law justifieth, Rom. 10. 4. <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie is the fulfilling of the law,</hi> Rom. 13. 10. Therefore charitie justifieth. In the assumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, let not the reader understand the power of nature or naturall love; but charitie the principall grace of Christ, united to faith and hope.</p>
               <p>In the preferring of this vertue, S. Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, in his 38 homilie upon the Gospel, calleth charitie the wedding garment, which he that wanted at the great marriage, was thrown in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to utter darknesse. His words are these: <hi>Quid debemus intelligere nuptialem vestem, nisi chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem? Intrat enim ad nuptias, sed cum nuptiali</hi>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:17738:62"/>
                  <hi>veste non intrat, qui in sancta Ecclesia assistens, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem habet, sed charitatem non habet. What are we to understand by the wedding garment, but chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie? For he goeth in to the wedding, but not with the wedding garment, who, being in the holy Church, hath faith, but hath not charitie.</hi> He addeth further to this purpose, <hi>Omnis ergò ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strûm qui in Ecclesia positus Deo credidit, jam ad nuptias intravit: sed cum nuptiali veste non venit, si charitatis gratiam non custodit. Therefore eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of you which being placed in the Church hath beleeved in God, hath alreadie entred into the marriage: but he cometh not with the wedding garment, if he doth not preserve the grace of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.</hi> There are many which come into Gods house, which is his Church, because they have faith to beleeve; for this is that which first brings a man to God, according to that, Heb. 11. 6. <hi>He that cometh to God, must beleeve that God is:</hi> yet though they be in Gods house, and at his Sonnes wedding for a time; when he comes <hi>to lift up their heads</hi> in his house, as it is said, Gen. 40. that is, to reckon with them, they must be thrown out again, because, as S. Augustine saith, Expos. in Epist. Joh. Tract. 5. <hi>Dilectio sola discernit inter filios Dei, &amp; filios dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boli. Signent se omnes signo crucis Christi, respon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deant omnes Amen, cantent omnes Alleluia, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptizentur omnes, intrent omnes ecclesias, faciant pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietes basilicarum; non discernuntur filii Dei à filiis diaboli, nisi in charitate. Onely charitie maketh a</hi>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:17738:62"/>
                  <hi>difference between the sonnes of God, and the sonnes of the devil. Let all signe themselves with the signe of Christs crosse, let all answer Amen, let all sing Alleluia, let all be baptized, let all go to church, let all build churches; the sonnes of God are not distinguished from the sonnes of the devil, but by charitie.</hi> They are none of Gods sonnes because they want charitie, the robe of Christs righteousnesse, and therefore they have no right to the place.</p>
               <p>Further, that must be the most excellent grace, which joyneth the soul to God: but this doth charitie; because the Apostle saith, 1. Cor. 6. 17. <hi>He that cleaveth to the Lord,</hi> (as S. Hierome translateth) or <hi>he that is joyned to the Lord,</hi> (as our translation hath it, which in meaning is all one) <hi>is one spirit.</hi> But charitie above all vertues causeth a man to cleave to God; because, as S. Bernard saith, by charitie the soul is as it were married to God; and in marriage a man forsakes all other to cleave to his wife, and the wife forsakes all other to cleave to her husband, according to that rule for marriage in Gen. 2. 24. <hi>Therefore shall a man leave father and mother, and cleave to his wife, and they twain shall be one flesh.</hi> So they that have charitie, will leave all things to cleave to God, to be one spirit with him. Yea so fast doth charitie glue the good soul to God, as the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> expresseth, that it will die before it leave him, as is to
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:17738:63"/>
be seen in all the holy Martyrs. Nothing may quench this fire, as Solomon singeth, <hi>Set me</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cant. 8. 6, 7.</note> 
                  <hi>as a seal upon thy heart, and as a signet upon thy arm: for love is strong as death, jealousie is cruell as the grave: the coals thereof are fiery coals, yea, a vehement flame. Much water cannot quench love, neither can the flouds drown it: if a man would give all the substance of his house for love, they would greatly contemne it.</hi> For what is that which makes all the marriages in the world? is it not love? if they did not love one another, they would never come together. Now this charitie is nothing else but divine love; and this makes God and man one spirit, as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall love and marriage makes man and wife one flesh: and it is called <hi>Charity,</hi> to distinguish it from naturall love, for that it is the most deare and precious love, in regard it is between God and mans spirit.</p>
               <p>Again, that must be the most excellent ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, which makes man most like to God: but there is nothing that makes man more like to God then charitie; because S. John saith, <hi>God</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. John 4. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>is charitie:</hi> therefore they that have charitie, must needs be most like him. It is the holy Ghosts child as I may say, sanctifying the soul. It is no where said, that God is faith, or God is knowledge; for then the devils should be more like to God then man, because they know more and beleeve more then any man: but he is called in scripture onely charitie, in
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:17738:63"/>
regard of goodnesse and sanctitie, for that all goodnesse of sanctification proceeds from cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. <hi>So God loved the world</hi> (saith our Lord, in John 3. 16.) <hi>that he gave his onely begotten Sonne, that whosoever beleeveth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.</hi> Now as all good of sanctitie comes from Gods love to man; so from mans charitie comes all the like goodnesse toward God and our neighbour. Light comes from faith, and understanding from knowledge: but goodnesse and sanctitie come onely from charitie. And if God be charitie, then what interest have they to God and his kingdome, who live continually in malice and quarrels?</p>
               <p>Moreover, Charitie is called of Divines <hi>the universall grace,</hi> because S. Paul, Colos. 3. 14. calleth it <hi>the bond of perfection. Above all these things put on charitie, which is the bond of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectnesse.</hi> He saith <hi>above all,</hi> because this is the best of all: and he calleth it <hi>the bond of perfectnesse,</hi> first, because it tieth man to God in the heart, who is perfectnesse it self; and next, because it tieth all vertues together, as we are taught in the Collect of Quinqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesima. Hast thou charitie? then canst thou want no vertue, because all are bound up in it. There is justice, there is mercy, there is libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie, there is fidelitie, there is the highest, there is the lowest, there is magnanimitie, there is humilitie: charitie bindes all together
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:17738:64"/>
in one man. Then get charitie, and thou need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est not run from parish to parish to get under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, because it dwells in charitie. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding<note place="margin">Lib 3. de doctr. Christ. cap. 10.</note> to this S. Austine saith, <hi>Scriptura nihil prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipit nisi charitatem, nihil culpat nisi cupiditatem: The scripture commandeth nothing but charitie, and blameth nothing but concupiscence.</hi> Now what charitie is, the Father in that place thus defineth; <hi>Charitatem voco motum animi ad fruendum Deo propter ipsum, &amp; se atque proximo propter Deum. I call charitie</hi> (saith he) <hi>a motion of the minde to the fruition of God for himself, and of himself and his neighbour for God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly, there is yet another title of e<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie belonging to charitie, and this is <hi>Queen of vertues,</hi> because it commandeth and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them all to right ends. For say I had all knowledge and could confute all men, and say I had all eloquence that I could with Orphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us move the stonie heart, say I had all patience, and could give my body to be burned, and say I had all faith, that I could remove mountains; yet if I did not know to Godward, speak to Godward, suffer to Godward, and beleeve to Godward, and so of all other vertues, all this would do me no good. Why? because the Queen of vertues, Charitie, which should bend and order all these to Godward, is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. For every action, as the learned know, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from election; election is in the will; and the principall power of the will is love and
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:17738:64"/>
charitie: therefore look which way that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that way go all thy actions of heart and minde. If thy love be naturall, then it orders and carries all thy actions to a naturall end, and that leadeth to hell: but if thy love be divine and spirituall, which my Text calleth Charitie, then that like a Queen regulates all thy actions to a supernaturall end, which is to serve God and to gain his kingdome. And the more good actions thou dost in this kinde, the more thou edifiest, as my Text saith, <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge puffeth up, but Charitie edifieth,</hi> that is to say, Charitie buildeth. As the carpenter and mason build with wood and stone; so cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie buildeth with good and godly actions. Faith is often idle, knowledge sleepie, and hope is drousie: but charitie is alwayes work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, because it is the hearts pulse to God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. As the pulse never leaves beating; so charitie never leaves working: and the more it worketh, the greater is the edifying. Little charitie makes a little Christian, and great charitie makes a great Christian, and perfect charitie makes a perfect Christian.</p>
               <p>The main Tenet of the scripture is, that God will reward every man according to his works. Therefore the more good works a Christian doth in the kingdome of grace, the greater shall be his crown in the kingdome of glorie. For, as S. Paul saith, 1. Cor. 15. 41, 42. <hi>As one starre differeth from another in glory; so is</hi>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:17738:65"/>
                  <hi>the resurrection of the dead:</hi> the body, with the more good works it riseth, the more it shall shine in heavens glory. <hi>In my Fathers house are many mansions,</hi> saith our Saviour, John 14. 2. Every man here strives to have the fairest house, if he be a man of worth. Then if thou desirest one of the better mansions in the kingdome of glorie, thou must build for it here in the kingdome of grace. The more good works thou preparest here, the larger shall be thy house there; the holier works, the higher habitation in heavens majestie. Wherefore, brethren, be never weary of well doing, but, as S. Paul exhorteth, 1. Cor. 15. 58. <hi>be abundant alwayes in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.</hi> There is nothing lost but all gotten by good life and good works.</p>
               <p>But you may say, It seemeth otherwise; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the mansions there are already built, and therefore they depend not upon our building and edifying. Yes, they depend upon our edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, in regard of the placing and bestowing; because the better a man is edified in good life here, the better building God will bestow upon him there: he made the best for the best. <hi>For thou rewardest every man according to his work,</hi> Psal. 62. 12. Luke 6. 38. 1. Cor. 3. 8. 2. Cor. 9. 6. You may say again, that heaven is but one house, which is the Fathers house. I reply, As our Saviour in John calleth heaven
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:17738:65"/>
                  <hi>a house;</hi> so S. Paul, Heb. 12. 22. calleth it <hi>a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</hi> It is called <hi>a house,</hi> because he is Father of the familie there; and it is called <hi>a citie,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is King of the place. Palaces have many rooms and chambers in excellency one above another: so cities have many houses, some more spacious, some more costly, and some more stately then others. Why should it not be so too in the celestiall Jerusalem, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept we should think that God had some wants there? There be degrees of edifying in us here; therefore there are degrees of edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices for us there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Charitie edifieth.</hi> As charitie edifieth, so it pulleth down too. As the understanding build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, when he sees something in his edifice amisse, will not rest till it be demolisht, and set up in a better manner; so is it with the good Christian: when he perceiveth some faults in his life, he will not cease till they be<note place="margin">Nihil eis pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cati damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilis remanere poterit, nec deerit aliquid boni, quibus charitas omnis inquina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menti mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datio &amp; bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norum omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um mater affuerit. <hi>Prosp. de vita contemplat. lib. 3. cap. 14.</hi>
                  </note> removed. And this part S. Paul also refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to charitie, 1. Cor. 13. 5. <hi>It doth no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comely thing, it seeketh not her own, it is not provoked to anger, it thinketh no evil.</hi> Therefore if there be in thee any undecent le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherie, or gaping covetousnesse, or passions troublesome, or any evil whatsoever; if cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie be in thee, it will seek and endeavour to remove all, because they be uncomely for spirituall and Christian buildings. And from this text S. Prosper inferreth, that charitie is
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:17738:66"/>
the death of vices, and the life of vertues.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Charitie edifieth.</hi> Lastly, as charitie edifieth in a mans own self, so it edifieth in others also. If there be any infirmitie in neighbours, it will beare with it, and help to amend it. <hi>Charitie suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth long, it boasteth not it self, it is not puffed up.</hi> There is no pride in charitie, but it sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth it self to all good ordinances, both in Church and Commonwealth. This will not flie out like the disobedient professour, this will not runne from his neighbours, this will not contemne his Ministers; but this wil labour to uphold all. This will say, Come neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, let us hold together, we must be subject to our governours for conscience sake, we may not do what we list, we may not be our own judges, we may not make our selves equal with Apostles, and say in our own causes, It is better to please God then men, and then please neither: for now it is not as it was in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles dayes: then were wicked governours; now we have godly governours. Thus charitie edifieth in our own selves, and others; but proud knowledge pulleth down and destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. And in this Predicament are they which make havock of Church-discipline: they will not keep holy dayes, though they be in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Saviour of the world; they will not observe Saints dayes, though their exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in the Liturgie be the glasses of our lives; to stand up in reverence when <hi>Gloria Patri, Te</hi>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:17738:66"/>
                  <hi>Deum, Benedictus,</hi> and the rest are said, (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we speak to God) with them is a needlesse ceremonie; Confession and Absolution is flat Poperie; and with such all is superstition, save onely a sermon from the spirit without preme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, and a prayer <hi>ex tempore,</hi> or of their own framing without authoritie. Might these have their wills, there should be no face of religion among us. They professe themselves to be hearers: but if you talk with them, then they will be preachers. Not need, but pride, not edifying, but ambition, makes them to am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble about the countrey for choise hearing and precise fashions: but the true speakers and true hearers are alwayes in charitie, Ephes. 4. 15. <gap reason="foreign">

            <head>A TREATISE Shewing That Gods Law, now qualified by the Gospel of Christ, is possible, and ought to be fulfilled of us in this life.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O shunne homonymie, and to state the question, that we might not fall to andabatisme, we are to understand, that as there be two kindes of perfection, <hi>viae &amp; patriae;</hi> one of our way, the other of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey to which we are travelling; so there are two kindes also of fulfilling Gods law, one of this life, the other of the next. That of this life may stand with divers interruptions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause here we are not confirmed in grace: but that of the next, which is in heaven, will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit no interruption; because there all are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in grace, and cannot sinne.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:17738:68"/>That there is a fulfilling of Gods law in this life, the scripture admits, where it saith in S. James, <hi>If ye fulfill the royall law according to</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jam. 2. 8.</note> 
               <hi>the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy self, ye do well.</hi> Here the text makes a manifest supposition of fulfilling G<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap> law in this life: &amp; first it affirmeth this doctrine to be according to scripture; next, it sheweth how it is to be tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that is, by the law, in loving our neighbour as our selves: and he that can do this, there is no doubt but he loveth God above all; because without God he could not do this. Were Gods law not possible to be fulfilled, the suppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on should be idle, unfit for Gods word, and unbeseeming one writing by divine inspiration; and then the twelve tribes might justly have returned this caption upon S. James, You put upon us that which cannot be done. But in this absurditie the Apostle could not be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, because he wrote by divine inspiration, and sootheth the thing, first by adding to his supposition this commendation, <hi>Ye do well;</hi> and secondly, by fetching to this head all other parts of Gods law, saying afterward, <hi>For who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vers. 10.</note> 
               <hi>shall keep the whole law, and yet fail in one point, he is guiltie of all.</hi> Here therefore is a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall and absolute fulfilling spoken of: and here is implied, that every one is bound to bring his obedience, not to one or most, but to every part of Gods law; and so no starting hole is left for any one beloved sinne.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:17738:68"/>Secondly, this supposition of S. James is confirmed by our Lords prayer, <hi>Thy will be done in earth, <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s it is in heaven.</hi> If the law, which is Gods will, could not be fulfilled in earth, then Christ obtained not what he would, we daily pray in vain, and Christ hath in vain commanded us to pray.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, this is confirmed by the liturgie of our Church in the collect upon the first Sunday after the Epiphanie in these words, <hi>And grant that they may both perceive and know what things they ought to do, and also have grace and power faithfully to fulfill the same, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</hi> Where we are taught, by whose vertue men may fulfill Gods law, that is, by Jesus Christs grace and power.</p>
            <p>Lastly, this is taught by the prayer upon the ten commandments, <hi>Lord have mercy upon us, and encline our hearts to keep this law.</hi> Where first we are taught to know our own miserie, in that we are bound to keep Gods law with the penaltie of everlasting death, and yet of our selves we have no power to perform it, and therefore we pray God to be <hi>mercifull to us.</hi> Next we pray that he would <hi>encline our hearts to keep his law:</hi> where is shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that God himself is the first mover and principall actour in this work; that we do but run along with him, and that of our selves we are so crooked and averse, that if he do not
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:17738:69"/>
encline and bend our hearts, as the shipwright boweth his timber by his instruments, the strength of his arms, and the heat of his fire to make a ship, we should never be able to sail to the kingdome of heaven. Wherefore if we shall fail to joyn our hands to Gods hand, when the principall acting is his, the second and inferiour ours; when he hath used all his means towards us, his threatnings to terrifie us, his exhortations to draw us, his promises to entice us, and propounded the end and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the work to be onely ours, whereas the greatest merit is Christs: if we now be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective and behinde on our part, we shall be worthy of many hells. To conclude, in that we intreat God to enable us to keep his law, hence appeareth the laws excellencie, and mans benefit in observing it. It is Gods image and similitude in which he made man; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it hath relation to us, and we to it: it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storeth us to our first perfection and heavens felicitie, it is the conformity between God and man, it is that which maketh God and us one: Therefore to the keeping of this we must strain soul and body, we must put all that we can, we must not fly to naked imputation, where is required our conformation. <hi>For whom</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 29.</note> 
               <hi>he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Sonne.</hi> His Sonne hath fulfilled the law, and so must we too.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:17738:69"/>But here may be objected, that they which<note place="margin">Ob.</note> are in Christ are delivered from the law. Rom. 8. 2. <hi>For the law of the Spirit of life hath made me free from the law of sinne and of death.</hi> Therefore we have nothing to do with the law.</p>
            <p>I answer, that in this place and in the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter<note place="margin">Sol.</note> before, by the law is understood concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scence, the law of the members, which giveth precepts and motions onely for sinne; and not the law of God, which giveth precepts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst sinne, and for holinesse and righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
            <p>Again, it may be objected, that we are not<note place="margin">Ob.</note> under the law, therefore we have not to do with it. Rom. 6. 14. <hi>Ye are not under the law, but under grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is answered, Though we be not under<note place="margin">Sol.</note> the law to be condemned, terrified, and forced by it; yet we are under the law to Christ, that is, to be guided by it; as the Apostle testifieth of himself, 1. Cor. 9. 21. <hi>Being not without the law to God, but under the law to Christ:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if the very just shall transgresse, while they are within the law, they are bound to make sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction by holy penance, which is <hi>secunda ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bula post naufragium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, it may be objected, that we are dead<note place="margin">Ob.</note> to the law, and therefore we have no more to do with it. Rom. 7. 4. <hi>Wherefore my brethren, ye are also become dead to the law by the body of Christ,</hi>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:17738:70"/>
               <hi>that ye should be married to another, even unto him that is raised up from the dead, that ye should bring forth fruit unto God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the law here is not meant the law simply,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> but the law and the flesh compounded toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (as appeareth in the sixth verse) wherein we stood in bondage to both. For the laws let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter onely shewed us what we were to do, but gave us no power to perform; and with this the flesh and the old man went hand in hand: for though the law gave us no power to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, yet the flesh gave us power to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse and sinne. To this the Apostle sheweth, that we are dead by the merit of the death of Christs body, <hi>that we might be married to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> that is, to Christ in Baptisme, by whose Spirit and grace we might be enabled to fulfill that which the law taught and commanded, to bring forth fruit unto God and our own salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And from hence it appeareth still, that the law of it self is good, and we have need of it, though it be not sufficient for us; because it is our school-master, to shew us our sinnes, and to bring us to Christ, Gal. 3. 24. Rom. 7. 7. <hi>I had not known sinne, but by the law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having made an end of confirming my first argument from the scriptures supposition and grant, now I proceed to my second argument, which is founded upon the efficacie and end of Christs suffering for us, which I hope no good Christian will extenuate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:17738:70"/>If Christ hath merited, that the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the law should be fulfilled in us who are his members, then the law is not impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be fulfilled of us: but Christ hath me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited, that the righteousnesse of the law should be fulfilled in us: therefore the law is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to be fulfilled of us. The <hi>major</hi> is true, because it is blasphemie to discredit the effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and end of Christs merits. The <hi>minor</hi> is as true by this scripture, Rom. 8. 3. <hi>For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Sonne in the likenesse of sinfull flesh, and for sinne condemned sinne in the flesh:</hi> that is to say, In sinnes room he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned sinne. If sinne be condemned, then it cannot hurt us, the fuit is at an end. But to what end did God send his Sonne, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne sinne in the flesh? It followeth in the text, <hi>that the righteousnesse of the law might be</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vers. 4.</note> 
               <hi>fulfilled in us.</hi> It is not said, That the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse of the law might be fulfilled in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, or for himself onely, (because he died not for himself, nor had need of such a righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, for that he was the lawgiver, and had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes the laws fulnesse in himself before he wrought any thing) but, <hi>That the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the law might be fulfilled in us.</hi> And how is that to be done? not by faith onely, or by bare imputation alone, as the ignorant under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it; but by our actuall walking in divine precepts: and therefore it is said, vers. 4. <hi>Who</hi>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:17738:71"/>
               <hi>walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in our walking, though it be after the<note place="margin">Ob.</note> Spirit, the law is oft broken of us by sinnes of commission and sinnes of omission, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the laws righteousnesse is not fulfilled of us.</p>
            <p>I answer, As it is oft broken of us, so it is<note place="margin">Sol.</note> as often repaired and satisfied, and so all is made whole again, and so he is <hi>in statu quo priús.</hi> Tremelius upon the text hath, <hi>Restitui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur &amp; redintegratur à malo, He is restored and made whole from the evil.</hi> Which in Saint Augustines words is a spotlesse and blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse walking in Gods laws. For in his book <hi>de perfectione justitiae,</hi> speaking of many places of scripture urged for the perfection of the Saints, he saith thus, <hi>Horum testimoniorum ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua currentes exhortantur, ut perfectè currant; aliqua ipsum finem commemorant, quò currendo pertendant. Ingredi autem sine macula non absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dè etiam ille dicitur, non qui jam perfectus est, sed qui ad ipsam perfectionem irreprehensibiliter cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, carens omnibus criminibus damnabilibus, at<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>
                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> ipsa peccata venialia non negligens mundare eleemosynis. Some places exhort the runners, that they may runne perfectly; some mention the end to which they should tend. Therefore he may be said without absurditie to enter spotlesse, not who is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready perfect, but he which runnes inculpably to that perfection, wanting all deadly sinnes, and not forgetting to expiate his veniall sinnes by alms.</hi>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:17738:71"/>
If he riseth not again so oft as he falleth either in number or vertue, then he seemeth to be no more a just man. Wherefore let every one, as soon as he is down, presently rise again.</p>
            <p>Our sinnes of commission are repaired and reversed by repentance. Ezech. 18. 21, 22. <hi>But if the wicked will return from all his sinnes that he hath committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that which is lawfull and right, he shall surely live, he shall not die: all his transgressions that he hath committed, they shall not be mentioned unto him.</hi> If it be thus to the wicked, shall it not be as much to the godly, when they sinne lesse, and not with a full consent? Our sinnes of omission are salved and supplied by prayer, as S. Augustine insinuateth upon this point of giving the law unto us, <hi>Admonet nos Deus facere</hi>
               <note place="margin">De natur. &amp; grat. <hi>cap. 43.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>quod possumus, &amp; petere quod non possumus: God, by giving his law to us, admonisheth us to do what we can, and to ask that which we cannot do.</hi> Whereupon it follows, that obedience as farre as we can, and prayer where we cannot, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the frailtie of the flesh, maketh Gods law to us possible; because in his Gospel he<note place="margin">Matth. 7. 7. John 15. 7.</note> hath promised to give us that which we pray for, as we ought to pray: in which are included all our sinnes, as well of commission as of omission. These are the helps which the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel affordeth. How are we to respect and frequent these two, upon which our salvation so much dependeth! were it not fit that these
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:17738:72"/>
two should alwayes lie by us, to be ready at every need? The old law onely commandeth,<note place="margin">Lex praedicat iram, evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelium grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am; lex mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strat culpam &amp; poenam, evangelium remissionem culpae &amp; ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutionem à poena exhibet; lex demum morbum &amp; aegrotum, evangelium medicum &amp; remedium porrigit. <hi>Psal. 119. 32.</hi>
               </note> but giveth no power to perform: but the new law not onely giveth precepts, but also power and helps by the sacraments to perform, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is written in Christs bloud, and so hath Christs spirit and life going together with it. Therefore it is called of S. Paul, <hi>The law of the Spirit of life;</hi> and of S. James, <hi>The law of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie:</hi> not because it gives men libertie to sinne; but because it freeth from the lets, and enlargeth mans heart through the spirit to perform it with alacritie and cheerfulnesse, according to that of David, <hi>I will runne the way of thy commandments, when thou shalt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large my heart.</hi> And to this belong the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels of the gospel, which go beyond the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of the law: of which S. Chrysostome speaketh, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <note place="margin">Hom. 19. in Heb. &amp; Hom. 18. de poen.</note> 
               <hi>Christ commanded no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing impossible, insomuch that many go beyond the very commandments.</hi> And if it be demanded who ever did this, he forthwith answers, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>S. Paul, S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, even all the quire of saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, as Christs spirit and grace gives such power to go beyond the precepts; so it is not incongruent that it should so modifie sinnes in his members to make them veniall and not killing, in regard they are not done with a full consent, but with a desire of doing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary:
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:17738:72"/>
of which the Apostle saith thus, Rom. 7. 20. <hi>But if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sinne that dwelleth in me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A third argument I have from the kindes of fulfilling Gods law, which are two, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and the outward. The inward is the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of the law in desire: The outward is the fulfilling of it in the bodies members, prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and put on by the mindes direction and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. The inward is more noble, because it is more neare to the minde its originall and fountain, and without whose act the bodies members could act nothing: yet the outward is the more ample, because it breaketh out fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The inward fulfilling of necessity must be acknowledged, or else we destroy the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, and frustrate that great work of mans redemption. Of this inward fulfilling thus speaketh the Apostle, Rom. 7. 22. <hi>For I delight in the law of God after the inward man.</hi> This delight is the wills fulnesse, often spoken of in the 119 Psalme, <hi>O how I love thy law! it is my meditation all the day long.</hi> Again, <hi>Therein is my delight. I will observe it with my whole heart.</hi> Now the whole is the fulnesse of a thing; therefore there is an inward fulfilling of Gods will. Notwithstanding we must not here rest, but proceed to the outward also, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the bodie is a part of the whole, and so bound by the law to follow its inward princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. By this outward fulfilling God is more
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:17738:73"/>
glorified to the eye of the world; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the outward the inward is not seen: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore upon every good opportunitie they ought to go both together. But here we must take knowledge, that the bodie in its own principle is so farre from fulfilling Gods law, that it is a contrary law to it, and is called of the Apostle <hi>the law of the members, and the</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 23.</note> 
               <hi>law of sinne and of death. I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my minde, and leading me into captivitie to the law of sinne, which is in my members.</hi> That is to say, as S. Augustine expoundeth it, <hi>captivare co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantem,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lib. 1. de nupt. &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cup. <hi>cap. 30.</hi>
               </note> endeavouring to leade me into capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitie to the law of sinne in my members. How may we be freed from this? by another law, that is, the law of the minde, called <hi>the law of the Spirit of life,</hi> Rom. 8. 2. <hi>For the law of the Spirit of life, which is in Christ Jesus, hath made me free from the law of sinne and of death.</hi> Then the law of the members cannot hold us in ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptivitie. Here therefore come to be consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of us three laws in Gods word expressed. The first is that which is called <hi>the law of God;</hi> and this is the glasse of our lives, shewing what we should do, and what we should not do. The second is called <hi>the law of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi> and <hi>the law of sinne and of death,</hi> because it labours and endeavours to draw us to sinne and to death. And this is concupiscence, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving precepts and motions for sinne, which in
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:17738:73"/>
the unregenerate draweth death after it. The third is the law of the minde, called of S. Paul, Rom. 8. 2. <hi>the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus.</hi> And this law is bestowed upon us ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitually in baptisme, and is nothing else but holy charitie, which sanctifieth by the power of the holy Ghost, and purifieth the minde before God, and is opposite to concupiscence. And because this is the strongest law, and seated in the minde which is mans form and principle, therefore this both freeth from the law of the members and of sinne, &amp; also fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the law of God, which is mans conformity with him. And this is confirmed by that main conclusion, <hi>Charitas est legis plenitudo, Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 13. 10.</note> 
               <hi>is the fulnesse</hi> or <hi>fulfilling of the law.</hi> Which is thus to be understood, saith S. Augustine; <hi>Diffunditur in corde charitas Dei, unde fiat legis</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ad Hilar. Epist. 89.</note> 
               <hi>plenitudo, non per vires arbitrii, quod est in nobis, sed per Spiritum sanctum, qui datus est nobis. The love of God is diffused in our hearts, from whence proceeds the laws fulfilling, not by the power of free-will, which is in us, but by the holy Ghost, which is given to us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may be objected, that the law of the<note place="margin">Ob.</note> members, or concupiscence, is imputed by God to the whole man, being it is opposite and rebells against the law of the Spirit.</p>
            <p>I answer, that the sinne of the flesh is not<note place="margin">Sol.</note> imputed to the whole man, because the flesh is not yet redeemed in execution; according
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:17738:74"/>
to that of the Apostle, Rom. 8. 23. <hi>But we also which have the first-fruits of the Spirit</hi> (that is, the law of the Spirit of life in our mindes, by which we are sanctified and consecrated to God) <hi>even we do mourn in our selves, waiting for the adoption, the redemption of our bodies;</hi> that is to say, the deliverance of our bodies from concupiscence: which is thus done, saith S. Augustine; <hi>Liberari à corpore mortis, est, omni</hi>
               <note place="margin">Contra duas epist. Pelag. <hi>lib. 1. cap. 11.</hi>

               <hi>sanato languore concupiscentiae carnis, non ad poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam recipere corpus, sed ad gloriam: non enim à corpore mortis impii liberabuntur unquam, quibus in resurrectione eadem corpora ad aeterna tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta reddentur. To be freed from this bodie of death, is to heal all the languour or infirmitie of lust in the flesh, and not to receive the bodie to pain but glory in the citie of God: for the wicked shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be freed from this bodie of death, to whom the same bodies at the resurrection shall be restored, to suffer everlasting torments.</hi> And the reason why God hath not redeemed or delivered our bodies, is, because God hath ordained, that man should not attain his end and perfection without difficultie, or at one instant, as the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels did; but to go to heavens happinesse by much opposition, and by many sighs and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, as our head hath done before us by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny sufferings; and that according to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of every ones conflict and striving, they might be rewarded with the different orders of the glorious angels. For which cause all
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:17738:74"/>
they who have generous mindes according to the dispensation of grace, must put on in the way of godlinesse the best that they can, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Apostle, <hi>that their labour shall not</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 15. 58.</note> 
               <hi>be in vain in the Lord.</hi> And from hence it will follow, that, whereas Christians have longer time and more difficulties to go to their end then the angels had, therefore their rewards shall be greater, and more then theirs, though their grace be more and greater then that of Christians. Wherefore when they both shall meet, there shall be a blessed harmonie and sweet rejoycing in God together.</p>
            <p>And to shew a little further the difference between the angels and mens travell toward the end, this shall appeare from mans combate under the three laws warring one against ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The law of the members challengeth the law of the minde and spirit; and the law of the minde and spirit challengeth the law of the members; and the law of God challengeth both, saying, Thou law of spirit and grace comest too short for mans salvation; and thou law of members art out of measure sinfull, and therefore killing. What shall the distressed conscience now do, when so many fists are one upon another in one man, beside the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known stratagems of the devil, the multitude of the worlds incursions, and the manifold falls into sinne? O the fears, the cares, and the labours! Is not here S. Pauls exclamation, <hi>O</hi>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:17738:75"/>
               <hi>wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 24.</note> 
               <hi>from the body of this death?</hi> At last comes in our captain to our comfort; and then the Apostle saith, <hi>I thank God through Jesus Christ</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vers. 25.</note> 
               <hi>our Lord.</hi> Then take we heart, and say further with the same, <hi>Then I my self with the minde serve the law of God, but with the flesh the law of sinne.</hi> The Saviour of the world strikes in with his law, and in the end with much ado we overcome. Thus stands the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween men and angels travell toward the end: the one had a short cut without difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; the other hath a long race in many infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities and miseries. Therefore of these it is said, Apoc. 7. 14. <hi>These are they which came out of many tribulations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To return again to the laws possibilitie, a fourth argument ariseth from the nature of a law. For if God should give such a law which could not be kept of us, then it could not binde us; because by the rule of justice no man ought to be bound to that which is impossible, for that were a wrong both to nature and grace: Therefore the School verse saith,</p>
            <q>Ultra posse viri non vult Deus ulla requiri.</q>
            <p>A fifth argument is from the end of a law, which is, to be kept: for if God should com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand things impossible, then he should make a law not to be kept, but to be broken; which is contrarie to the right end of a law and of a lawgiver. But God for his infinite wisdome
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:17738:75"/>
will never give a law to a wrong end: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he will never command things impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.</p>
            <p>But the adversaries to this truth will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance<note place="margin">Ob.</note> object, that when God first gave his law to man, it was possible to be kept: the impossibilitie now proceeds onely from our selves, because through our own default it is that we are disinabled: and therefore God may justly still oblige us to it, though im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible.</p>
            <p>But to this it is answered, that Christ hath<note place="margin">Sol.</note> made a full satisfaction for that default of ours, and by this means discharged us of that obligation; insomuch that God can no more in equitie now require impossibilities at our hands, then he could at first at Adams. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther does he, if we may beleeve S. Paul, who saith, <hi>I can do all things by Christ that</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 4. 13.</note> 
               <hi>strengtheneth me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it may be further urged, that the law<note place="margin">Ob.</note> is still the same it was, and therefore of it self doth oblige us now to as exact a performance as ever it did Adam, though God for Christ his sake is pleased to remit from the rigour of it, requiring <hi>sub poena</hi> no more of us, then we being assisted by his grace are able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.</p>
            <p>To this I answer, that the law obliges us<note place="margin">Sol.</note> no further then the intent of the lawgiver was to extend it: and therefore if God intends
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:17738:76"/>
not now (as questionlesse he doth not) to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act of us the performance of the law, as it stood in its rigour <hi>quoad omnes gradus,</hi> neither does it in reason oblige us now to any such perfection. And so by consequence the law, as given to Adam, is not the rule whereby we are to be judged, but as it was given to us in Christ; which every Christian ought and therefore may perform. And here we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, that it is most convenient to reason and justice, that the law should be exacted so farre as the possibilitie of the obliged could reach, and no further. Adam in his integritie might have perfectly kept it, if he would; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the fulfilling of it in rigour was expected <hi>sub poena</hi> of him, and that justly: we now fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len would perfectly fulfill it, but cannot, by reason of the punishment inflicted on us by our just judge: and therefore, <hi>durante poenâ,</hi> he cannot in equitie now expect that perfection in keeping it, which Adam had. For to mutilate a runner, or oppresse him with weights, and then to command him to runne with that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilitie and speed he formerly could, unlesse he were endued with his first integritie, strength, and libertie of limbes, is absurd: so to think our good God now in this our languour and reluctancy of nature will under pain of death tie us to absolute obedience, and not restore us to the state of innocencie, wherein 'twas possible, is altogether as senslesse and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:17738:76"/>A sixth argument is from the goodnesse of the lawgiver, which is God. If God should command things impossible, then he should be more cruel then a tyrant, who will not offer to ask of his subjects such a tribute, which he knows cannot be paid, nor make such a law which cannot be kept; because this is against the common good of every state: but God is good to all, and no tyrant, because his mercie is over all his works: therefore he will not command any thing impossible. And to this accordeth S. Augustine, <hi>Deus nec impossibile aliquid potuit imperare, quia justus est; nec homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem damnaturus est pro eo quod non potuit vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tare, quia pius est: God could not command any thing impossible, because he is just; neither will he damne a man for that he could not avoid, because he is mercifull.</hi> Now it is manifest, that God gave his law in Moses time many hundred yeares after Adams fall, and therefore he gave it to be kept according to the condition of mans present estate. And in this estate it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Almightie to make a league of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship betwixt himself and mankinde: whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Abraham (who lived before the law) was called <hi>the friend of God,</hi> and holy David <hi>a man</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jam. 2. 23. 1. Sam. 13. 14</note> 
               <hi>after his own heart.</hi> Now let any man tell me, how a father that hath received his prodigall sonne into his grace and favour, and forgiven all, can yet exact of his sonne, without tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie or ridiculousnesse, to perform as many acts
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:17738:77"/>
of hospitalitie, or otherwise, now in the estate of his decocted patrimonie, as in his full riches; unlesse the father had restored him again unto as great an inheritance? To confirm this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, take this argument; A man can either do as much as Gods grace inables him, or not. If not, how doth grace inable him? If he can do all which Gods grace inableth him to do; how is it possible for a most just and good God either to desire, or at least require more then his own with all usury possible? Secondly, to impose on man his friend precepts impossible to be observed, neither suiteth with the true rules of friendship, neither is compatible with the majestie of so most just a Creator; especially seeing he hath now supplied mans fall with his Sonnes grace, which is farre greater and better then that in paradise: for Adam demerited but one sinne to his posteritie, <hi>viz.</hi> original, which cannot be augmented; but Christ hath poured out the abundance of his graces for our salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: as S. Paul speaketh, <hi>Not as the offence, so</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 5. 15.</note> 
               <hi>also is the free gift: for if through the offence of one, many be dead; much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many. Valor meritorum &amp; satisfactionis Christi longè excedit demerita Adae; idque non ex acceptatione divina, sed ex rigida justitia &amp; valore ipsorum operum, quem habebant ex dignitate personae operantis &amp; patientis:</hi> so the<note place="margin">Serm. 12. de Passione.</note> School. And S. Leo thus, <hi>Ubi abundavit pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:17738:77"/>
               <hi>superabundavit gratia; &amp; qui cum peccati praejudicio nati, potestatem acceperunt adjustitiam renascendi: validius donum factum est libertatis, quàm debitum servitutis. Where sinne abounded, there grace hath superabounded; and those who were born with the guilt of sinne, have received power to be reborn to righteousnesse: for the gift of freedome is made of more force, then was the debt of bondage and slaverie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it will be objected, that God might just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">Ob.</note> command things impossible to man fallen: for the law was given to Adam in paradise, though not written <hi>in tabulis lapideis,</hi> yet <hi>in cordibus hominum,</hi> as we reade, Rom. 2. 14. <hi>For when the Gentiles which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these having not the law, are a law unto themselves: which shew the work of the law written in their hearts.</hi> If the Gentiles, much more had our first parents this law of nature, which is nothing else but the nature of God written in their hearts likewise. And therefore because man by his free-will made himself unable to keep this law thus written, God may now justly exact impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities of us, in this our present miserie and wretchednesse.</p>
            <p>I answer, that although the law may be<note place="margin">Sol.</note> truely said to have been given to Adam in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise (though there not promulgated, as by Moses afterward) as likewise that man was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in paradise to perform the whole law of
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:17738:78"/>
nature, or morall law; but afterwards God subtracting his grace (as justly he might) for his sinne, this inabilitie fell upon him as a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment: now it is tyrannicall and cruell, (therefore impossible for Almighty God) to require that abilitie which he himself thus took away, &amp; of those too that are his friends and in league with him, unlesse he had resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it again. And so surely he hath, by giving us <hi>gratiam potentiorem,</hi> though Adam had <hi>laeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orem:</hi> for grace now by Christ is more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, because Adam in his puritie had lesse re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancie, and therefore lesse grace might suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice: as S. Augustine plainly, <hi>Per Adam amis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa</hi>
               <note place="margin">De bono per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sever.</note> 
               <hi>est gratia, quâ homo perseverare possit: per Christum datur gratia crebrior &amp; uberior, ut in tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta infirmitate inter tot hostes fortior stet, &amp; actu perseveret.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may be objected, that the two precepts,<note place="margin">Ob.</note> one of loving God with all our heart and all our strength, and that other, <hi>Non concupisces, Thou shalt not covet,</hi> are impossible to be kept, seeing as long as we carrie about with us this bodie of flesh, concupiscence or the law of the members must be in it; as S. Augustine <hi>de per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectione justitiae,</hi> and elsewhere seems to affirm.</p>
            <p>For the first, we make no doubt, but every<note place="margin">Sol.</note> childe of God doth keep that, though not with the same intention we shall do in heaven, where nothing is to distract us. And is not that to love God with all our hearts and souls,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:17738:78"/>
when we preferre him above all the world; as the Martyrs did, which endured for the love of God most exquisite and horrid torments? What an excesse of charitie was in S. Paul a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all imagination, who desired not onely to die, but to be accursed (if it were possible) for the glorie of God in the salvation of his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren! And here I may crie out <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>! as well as the Apostle in another case. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, this is no expresse particular command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the decalogue: therefore it followeth that he necessarily fulfils that eminent and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall commandment, which keeps the ten par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular commandments; and therefore Christ sayes, <hi>If you love me, keep my commandments.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 14. 15.</note> And lastly, God commands us to love him, as much as ever we are able; and if we do that, (as doubtlesse we may) what can God desire of his children more, then to love him as much as they can possibly in this life?</p>
            <p>As for the last commandment of all, <hi>Non concupisces,</hi> I take it that the consent of the will is onely forbidden, and the cherishing of the first motion to sinne, according to the scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture every where; <hi>Let not sinne reigne in your</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 12.</note> 
               <hi>mortall bodies;</hi> and, <hi>Go not after thy concupiscence,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 13. 14.</note> 
               <hi>to fulfill the lusts thereof.</hi> Touching which opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion S. Augustine most clearly, <hi>Quantum ad</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ad Julian. lib. 2. prope finem.</note> 
               <hi>nos attinet, sine peccato semper essemus, donec sana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retur hoc malum, si ei nunquam consentiremus ad malum:</hi> and so it is rather <hi>praeceptum medii, quàm</hi>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:17738:79"/>
               <hi>finis, a precept of the means to labour to resist,</hi> and to keep those motions from overcoming us, and leading our will captive. The end it onely shews, and points out that which by these actions we should tend to, even that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which we cannot fully attain in this life, but shall be most consummate in our countrey and celestiall citie of God; and that is, not to feel the motions of concupiscence. To which purpose S. Augustine writeth to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellicus thus, <hi>Hoc lex posuit dicendo, Non concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pisces,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Epist. 200.</note> 
               <hi>non quòd hoc valeamus, sed ad quod profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciendo tendamus.</hi> Now the end is not enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in commands, but demonstrated onely: as if a captain bid his souldiers overcome their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; if they fight valiantly, though they do not utterly overcome, we may in reason sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the commandment of the generall truly fulfilled, though the end be not fully accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plisht. The Apostle surely was of this minde, when he said, <hi>If I do that which I would not,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 16, 22.</note> 
               <hi>I consent unto the law that it is good: for I delight in the law of God, according to the inward man:</hi> as if he had said, I work not that which the foam and sourse of concupiscence within me entices unto; and therefore though he had these motions of concupiscence, yet for all that he kept the law, as he concludes in the last verse, <hi>Igitur mente servio legi Dei; Id est,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Contra 2. e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist. Pelag. l. 1. c. 18.</note> saith S. Augustine, <hi>Concupiscentiae non consenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endo: non enim damnatur, nisi qui concupiscentiae</hi>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:17738:79"/>
               <hi>carnis consentit ad malum.</hi> And that which was beside his minde, was none of his, neither was he guiltie of it; as is plainly set down in that chapter. Secondly, that concupiscence without the wills consent, is not sinne, is more then intimated by S. Augustine from the<note place="margin">Lib. 2. contra Julianum.</note> words of S. Cyprian, in his epistle <hi>de morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litate: We must encounter</hi> (saith he) <hi>with cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse, immodestie, anger, and ambition, with carnall vices also, and secular enticements: a daily and dangerous strife we must endure. The minde of man is every way assaulted and environed with the devils wiles; it scarce withstands them, scarce re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists.

Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian: to which S. Augustine, <hi>Absit autem ut sanctum Cyprianum aut avarum existimemus fuis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se, quia cum avaritia; aut impudicum, quia cum impudicitia; aut irae subditum, quia cum ira, &amp;c. confligebat: God forbid we should think S.

               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:17738:80"/>
               <hi>lust, pride, and the like, because he was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with hourely molested. Imò verò ideo nihil corum erat, quia his malis motibus, partim de origine, partim de consuetudine venientibus fortiter resiste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, non acquiescens esse, quod eum esse cogebant. Yea verily</hi> (saith he) <hi>he was none of these, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he valiantly resisted these evil motions, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly arising from nature, partly from custome, not yeelding to that they would have compelled him.</hi> Furthermore, if it had been possible for Adam in his puritie to have had these sudden <hi>ictus,</hi> or blows of concupiscence in his soul; yet had he not consented, without question he should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have been turned out of paradise: for not to consent to evil suggestions is so farre from the least demerit, that by this means ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther merit is highly increased: for, <hi>Ubi maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma pugna, ibi maxima est victoria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, it may be objected, that the very<note place="margin">Ob.</note> best works of the saints are unclean, impure, menstruous, and mortall sinnes; therefore it is impossible for any man to keep the law.</p>
            <p>I answer, They that say so, cannot (in my<note place="margin">Sol.</note> judgement) be excused from extream blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie: yet seeing it is out of ignorance, they may happily obtain pardon, as the Jews did that crucified our Saviour, as S. Peter told them.<note place="margin">Acts 3. 17.</note> Can the works and fruits of the holy Ghost be impure? Hath Christ purchased to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self nought but a filthy and impure generation, which can do nothing but sinne, and that mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally?
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:17738:80"/>
How can this but derogate from the grace and wisdome of God? from grace, in that it cannot purifie the heart from filthines; from his wisdome and justice, to reward men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struous rags (for so they term them) with heaven. Can he reward sinnes? how then shall he judge the world <hi>secundum judicium &amp; veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem?</hi> Now the least addition of evil (we know) in a good act makes it sinfull, because <hi>bonum est ex integra causa, malum ex quolibet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectu.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seventhly, King James upon the Lords prayer affirmeth it to be blasphemie, to say that any of Christs precepts are impossible; because this is to give him the lie, who out of his own<note place="margin">Matth. 11. 30.</note> mouth told us, that his <hi>yoke is easie, and</hi> his <hi>bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den light.</hi> And his inward disciple S.

God would never command us to do this thing, if he judged it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to be done of man.

               <hi>example, is at hand, that he may also afford his aid.</hi> Moreover, this holy father abhorreth this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine<note place="margin">Serm. 191. &amp; Hieron. in symb. Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can. epist. 17.</note> as accursed in the hereticks of his time. <hi>Execramur eorum blasphemiam, qui dicunt impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibile aliquid homini à Deo esse praeceptum; &amp; Dei mandata, non à singulis, sed ab omnibus in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muni posse servari. We detest their blasphemie, that affirm God commanded any thing impossible to man; and that Gods commandments cannot be kept of any man in particular, but of all men taken together:</hi> which erroneous doctrine is there much faulted. Farre be it therefore from us to attribute that impietie to our heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which we cannot justifie to be in a tyrant or cruell governour. Secondly, in this doctrine of impossibilitie, all exhortations to vertue, and comminations against vice must needs be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown, <hi>Cùm nemo ad impossibilia teneatur,</hi> as the lawgivers have exprest it. Thirdly, if Gods law must be broken of us necessarily, how shall God come <hi>to judge the world in righteousnesse, and the people with his truth?</hi> as holy David saith, Psalme 96. 13. But this blessed Patriarch was doubtlesse of another minde, when he said, <hi>I will runne the way of thy commandments,</hi>

               <hi>auxilio; He may command what he will, that makes man able to obey,</hi> and, not by enforcing the will, but by infusing grace, aids and elevates its actions to a higher end. So where nature cometh short, there grace supplies the defect. Gods enemies and the unregenerate cannot possibly fulfill the law, because S. Paul saith, <hi>The naturall man receiveth not the things of the</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 2. 14.</note> 
               <hi>Spirit of God, for they are foolishnesse unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually discerned.</hi> But Gods sonnes and servants are able not onely to discern and know them, but also to observe and fulfill them; because S. John saith, <hi>Whosoever is born of God, sinneth</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. John 3. 9.</note> 
               <hi>not: for his seed remaineth in him, neither can he sinne, because he is born of God.</hi> Again, <hi>Love co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. John 4. 7. and 5. 3.</note> 
               <hi>of God; and every one that loveth, is born of God, and knoweth God. This is the love of God, that we keep his commandments, and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments are not grievous</hi> or <hi>heavie.</hi> To the unregenerate they are very heavy and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, unsupportable: but to sonnes and friends they are easie and light, because Gods Spirit comes in to their aid. Wherefore get to be friends with God, and then you cannot stand out for any aid: obtain to be his, not in name
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:17738:82"/>
but in deed, and then you shall want nothing that is good. O that the world knew how good and rich God is! then every one would strive to be toward him; for <hi>all things work together</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 28.</note> 
               <hi>for the best to them that love him.</hi> Again, in the regenerate there are two men, the old and the new, the flesh and the spirit. According to this we affirm that the old man cannot fulfill Gods law, because S. Paul saith, <hi>I know that in</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 18.</note> 
               <hi>me, that is, in my flesh, dwelleth no good thing.</hi> Again, <hi>I see another law in my members, warring</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verse 23.</note> 
               <hi>against the law of my minde, and leading me ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptive to the law of sinne, which is in my members.</hi> But the law of the Spirit freeth from the law of the flesh, Rom. 8. 2. Therefore the Apostle saith further, Gal. 5. 23. <hi>Against such there is no law.</hi> And this freeing law of the Spirit is nothing but charitie; as S. Augustine saith, <hi>Id</hi>
               <note place="margin">In Psalm. 98.</note> 
               <hi>agit gratia, ut dilectione impleantur mandata Dei, quae timore non poterant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To draw to an end, Were the law impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to be kept, then all the exhortations and threatnings in Gods word should be idle, then all mens labours would wax lazie, and then good life which is after the rule would be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iled, for that no man would strive against the stream. Wherefore great enemies are they to Christians growth and reward in the way of godlinesse, which are against this doctrine: they are like to the man in the parable, who laid up his money in a napkin, and at last had it taken from him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:17738:82"/>A surplus argument I have from the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthinesse of them that are against the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. Origen in his ninth homilie upon<note place="margin">Annon tibi videtur in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter mulieres existimandus ille vir, qui dicit, Non possum obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vare quae scripta sunt? <hi>Et ibid.</hi> Qui dicit, Implere non possum, quid tibi vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>detur aliud quàm inter mulieres, quae nihil virile Possunt, esse numerandus?</note> Joshua giveth this censure, <hi>that they are to be compared to women, which say that Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments cannot be kept.</hi> Indeed I grant, that it is easier for flesh and bloud to break Gods law, then to keep it: But when God hath for man ordained it as his highest form, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed his blessing and helping hand unto it, and set a kingdome and a crown at the end of it; they are all base-minded that will not bring their best endeavours to it.</p>
            <p>Hearken to Jehoshaphats good counsel in 2. Chron. 19. 11. <hi>Be of good courage and do it, and God shall be with the good.</hi> Hearken we further to Gods encouragement to good<note place="margin">Josh. 1. 5.</note> Joshua, <hi>There shall not a man be able to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand thee all the dayes of thy life: as I was with Moses, so will I be with thee: I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.</hi> Lastly, let us listen to Christs counsell and encouragement for us all, Matth. 28. 20. <hi>Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and lo, I am with you alway unto the end of the world.</hi> Many examples also have we of those that fulfilled Gods law by scriptures warrant. But to shunne tediousnesse, I will use onely two couples; the first of Enoch and Elias, who so walked with God on earth, that they are now translated to walk with God in heaven. The
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:17738:83"/>
second is that of Zacharie and his wife Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth, of whom it is thus written, Luke 1. 6. <hi>And they were both just before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord, blamelesse.</hi> If they lived so well then in the time of the law; what may we do now in the time of grace, when the law of the Spirit reigneth, and when <hi>the light of the moon is as</hi>

               <hi>the light of the sunne, and the light of the sunne is seven-fold, and like the light of seven dayes?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now though I hold this <hi>in thesi,</hi> that Gods law might not be impeached, his grace not shortned, nor good endeavours hindered; yet will I be no patron to any that shall presume and boast of it. For my self, I will ever put it off to others, and give all the praise of my wayes to God onely: for pride is the laws break, and humilitie is a member of its fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. Wherefore when I have done all that I can, I will pray with the Publicane, <hi>God be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull to me a sinner.</hi> Thus in condemning my self I shall be justified by the law it self. James 4. 10. <hi>Cast down your selves before the Lord, and he will lift you up.</hi> Toward the godly, mercie and justice go both together.

               <hi>begotten Sonne which is in the bosome of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he hath declared him.</hi> Then so farre as he speaketh we may speak with him, or speak consectaries to his sayings; because he being in his Fathers bosome, inwardly knoweth him. As Jacob, when he wrestled with God, would<note place="margin">Gen. 32. 26.</note> not let him go till he had blessed him; and as the Philistines could not finde out Samsons<note place="margin">Judg. 14. 18.</note> riddle, till they had plowed with his heifer: no more can we finde out the mysteries of God, unlesse we plow with his Spirit, and wrestle with him by prayer. This being done, then God will blesse us, as he blessed Jacob; and then he will shew us his hinder parts, as<note place="margin">Exod. 33. 23.</note> he did unto Moses, by created means.</p>
            <p>These he expresseth to us by his divine at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, whereof the foundation is his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance or essence. And this <hi>Essence</hi> God chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lengeth as his name to be known by: for when
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:17738:85"/>
Moses demanded of God his name, he told him it was <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which signifieth essence, <hi>I am,</hi> or<note place="margin">Exod. 3. 14.</note> 
               <hi>will be.</hi> So that <hi>to be,</hi> properly belongs to God, from whom all things have their being. And this is seconded by these sayings of Gods word Isai. 42. 8. <hi>Ego sum Jehova, hoc est nomen meum; I am Jehovah, this is my name.</hi> This name ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth his eternitie, Apoc. 1. 4. <hi>Which is, which was, and is to come.</hi> This name <hi>Jehovah</hi> is derived from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>esse, to be.</hi> In this name <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah</hi> are contained the 5 vowels, which are the sinews of all languages. As without them no tongue can be expressed; so without the true knowledge of Jehovah no flesh can be saved. This name Pagnine calleth <hi>ineffabile nomen.</hi> This name of Gods essence was so reverenced of the Jews, that they thought not themselves worthy to speak it; therefore whensoever it came to be read in the old Testament, they pronounced some other name of God for it, as <hi>Adonai the Lord, or Elohim God.</hi> This ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of the name <hi>Jehovah</hi> is further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in Isai. 43. 10. where it is said, <hi>Ye shall understand that I am;</hi> where is shewed, that his essence is <hi>to be.</hi> Again, vers. 13. <hi>Before the day was, I am.</hi> He was before the creation, before there was day or night; therefore he is the onely proper and true being. All creatures, yea the most perfect, as angels, are not perfect essences, because there was a time when they were not; and it is a thing possible for them not
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:17738:86"/>
to be again. It is as possible for them to have an end as to have a beginning: but they had a beginning; therefore for any thing that is in their being, they may have an end, and so their essence is not absolute, but from God bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed. It sorteth with all creatures to be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and shadows of true being, not to be true being it self. The image is understood of men and angels, because they come nearest to true and perfect life; the shadow, of sensitive and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensitive things. Thus Plato denied things sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible truely to be. And Seneca saith, that they make a shew, and for a time put on a counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of being. And for the immortalitie of angels and men mentioned in holy writing, this is not to be derived from the immateriali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or excellencie of their essence, but from the speciall grant and charter of their Maker. The Almighty hath ordained it to be so from their creation, and therefore their immortalitie shall hold.</p>
            <p>But here between the Fathers and Scholists there is difference about the essence of angels and spirits of men, as we may reade in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Nicene Councel and the fifth act; where they are held to be materiate and corporate. <note n="*" place="margin">Damonum ea est natura, ut aërei cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poris sensu terrenorum corporum sensum faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lè praecedant; celeritate eti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am, propter ejusdem aërei corporis su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periorem mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitatem, non solùm cursus quorumlibet hominum vel ferarum, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rumetiam volatus avi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabiliter vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant. <hi>S. Aug. lib. de Divin. Daemon. c. 2.</hi>
               </note> Their reason is, to put a difference between Gods simple essence and their compounded, which of necessity must be grosse in respect of Gods, and to withstand their infinitenesse; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that which may not be circumscribed
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:17738:86"/>
or limited, must be infinite: but angels and spirits of men are not infinite, therefore they must be bounded and defined with matter. And this may be upheld by these reasons. First, because they are not absolutely eternal, but frail in regard of their matter, and eternal <hi>gratis.</hi> Seneca epist. 58. <hi>Manent cuncta, non quia aterna sunt, sed quia defenduntur curâ regentis: immortalia tutore non egent. Haec conservat arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fex, fragilitatem materiae vi suâ vincens.</hi> By this, all things that are, are frail or mortall in regard of the frailtie of their matter, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall by God who keeps them so: for things by nature immortall need no preserver. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, there seemeth to be as much reason for spirits to be made of matter rarefied and sublimate, as the Alchymists speak, as for natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall bodies to be made spirituall bodies in the resurrection, by rarefaction and sublimation. 1. Cor. 15. 44. <hi>It is sown a naturall body: it is raised a spirituall bodie. There is a naturall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and there is a spirituall bodie.</hi> Thirdly, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rardus Bonioannes the expositour of S. Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas, insinuateth this, Sum. par. 1. q. 14. art. 1. <hi>Formae secundum quod sunt magìs immateriales,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Forma dici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur actus.</note> 
               <hi>secundum hoc magìs accedunt ad infinitatem quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam.</hi> From whence ariseth this argument; <hi>In absoluta &amp; mera immaterialitate non est magìs &amp; minus. In formis angelorum &amp; hominum est magìs &amp; minus immaterialitatis. Ergò in illis non est absoluta &amp; mera immaterialitas.</hi> Fourthly,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:17738:87"/>
the materiality of mans spirit seemeth proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in regard of the union between the body and the spirit, because contraries expell one the other: hence there seemeth to be some materialitie in the spirit, that the connexion and alliance might be the more easie and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar. Fifthly, the materialitie of spirits is shewed, because they suffer from the matter of fire in hell, Matth. 25. 41. <hi>prepared for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and his angels:</hi> but in immaterialitie there is no proportion for sense, because sense is in matter &amp; qualitie, without which there can be no passion. Sixtly, this may not seem strange to us, if we compare the angels with the windes, which in the holy tongue have the same name that angels and spirits have, which is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>ventus, spiritus, anima, angelus.</hi> So simple is the windes substance, that it is no more subject to our sight then angels are; and for strength it is little inferiour, while it turmoyls the great ocean, overturneth trees and houses, and makes the stedfast earth to quake and tremble: yet is this materiate, and then why not the other, though they be more simple, and in a degree higher?</p>
            <p>The Scholists, following S. Thomas, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude materialitie; and their reasons are these. First, because it is consonant to the universitie of things, that some should be Gods images in <hi>intellect</hi> and <hi>will:</hi> but intellect and will are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>materiate, for that they are distinct from sense
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:17738:87"/>
which riseth from bodies. As some things are purely materiate, as the elements; some things mixt of matter &amp; form, as men; some of matter &amp; spirit materiall, as beasts; some of matter and spirit intellectuall, as men: so it is requisite, that some things should be purely spirituall, as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; because it is requisite, that in every kinde there should be some perfect: but in mans soul his intellect is imperfect because it gets know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge by corporall senses from things sensible: therefore it is fit that some substances should be meerly intellectuall without bodies, not to gain knowledge by so base means, but to have the roots of intelligence innate in themselves, which are their powers replete with princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples or <hi>species.</hi> This then is the difference between the spirits of men and angels: the one have a bodie united to them, to receive <hi>species,</hi> and to understand from bodily objects; but the other have <hi>species</hi> of intellect connate with them, and separate from bodily reason which is by discourse. Secondly, they shew this, because spirits and souls have not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensuration with places, for that they want quantitie which bodies of matter have, and have no situation <hi>in continuo.</hi> The incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reall substance rather containeth then is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, as the soul is in the bodie, containing it by its vertue and power, and not contained; applied, and not circumscribed. Because it wanteth quantitie, it cannot be divided; and
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:17738:88"/>
because it wanteth matter, it cannot be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, except it be understood of losse of qualitie, as of grace and good being, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to Gods will.</p>
            <p>Yet they hold that angels are compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of <hi>act</hi> and <hi>potentialitie,</hi> of subject and acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, of essence common to all, and existence, in which is contained their difference in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, offices, and perfections. By reason of this composition they are all frail; because whatsoever is compounded is subject to disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution: but in God is no composition: therefore his essence onely is simple. Herein Scholists joyn with antiquitie, in affirming their act and potentialitie to be <hi>quasi materia &amp; forma.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To return to Gods essence, it is wonderfull in two respects: First, in that it is communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to three persons: upon which the Arians sung in their scoffing anthems against the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Christians, <hi>Where are these fellows that</hi>

               <hi>affirm three to be but one power?</hi> Secondly, in that his essence is so simple, without any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position: for he doth not consist of matter and form or potentialitie, as the creatures do; but he is all form or act, without matter or mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: for meer matter hath no life in it, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly potentialitie to receive life from its form. The creatures have composition in their very forms, as appeareth in the soul of man consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Intellect</hi> and <hi>Will.</hi> In which composition there is this infirmitie, that though the Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:17738:88"/>
offereth to the Will never so right things; yet the Will, being of a diverse and domineer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power, like a queen will do what she list; for that election, which is the immediate cause of every action, is in her jurisdiction. This is seen in the saying of Medea,
<q>
                  <l>—Video meliora probóque,</l>
                  <l>Deteriora sequor:—</l>
               </q>
and again in this,
<q>Sic volo, sic jubeo, stat pro ratione voluntas.</q>
And by this composition angels and men fell. For whereas they both were made for an end, as all other creatures are; and to this they were to go by their wills election, and by due and proportionable means, in which consisted their assurance for consummation and confirmation in it: herein they failed. Their end was to serve their Maker, which they could not but under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, in regard they were made in perfect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect, and whereupon they could not desire to be Gods equall and compeer, as some have imagined; but onely his copartner, and like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him in freedome of will. And that this end was by God propounded to them upon their creation, in regard they were made in free ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, it appeareth from this interrogation, Hebr. 1. 14. <hi>Are they not all ministring spirits?</hi> And this is also confirmed by reason, for that there can be no higher end to any creature, then to serve the Creatour. But to go to this end, it was requisite they should have a dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:17738:89"/>
and a mandate from the Creatour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he knew best how he would be served: wherefore God set before them his own Sonne, who is his Word, to follow as their Lord and Captain. And to this end it is said in the Psalmes, <hi>Worship him all ye gods:</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,<note place="margin">Psal. 97. 7.</note> Heb. 1. 6. <hi>And let all the angels of God wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship him.</hi> Thus the onely true way to the end of Gods service is his Word, that is, his onely<note place="margin">Joh. 1. 1.</note> begotten Sonne, the second person in the Trinitie, <hi>by whom also he made the worlds,</hi> as the<note place="margin">Heb. 1. 2.</note> Apostle testifieth; and therefore he knew best how they were to be governed. And this is averred by the testimonie of the Sonne, John 14. 6. <hi>I am the way, and the truth.</hi> This being propounded as grace from God for their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding; part of the angels, (whose ring-lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er was the prince of devils, whom we call <note n="*" place="margin">Called, Matth. 12. 24. <hi>Beclzebub.</hi>
               </note> Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifer) considering their own excellencie, their own intellect and strength of nature in which they were made, by their arrogancie neglected their Makers direction and aid, and thought themselves sufficient to do this of themselves: and thus of their free-will they made election to serve God, not as he would have them, but as they themselves listed: whereby they fell from God. So now they serve him after their own will, in tempting and trying his servants among men, and in being the instruments of his anger in punishing the rebellious. This they do willingly, and God suffereth willingly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:17738:89"/>
he knoweth how to turn it to his own glory, though it be not to their ease, because they forsook him: and so their service, which, if they had been ruled by him, should have been a pleasure unto them, is now become their punishment by their own choice; and upon this they are confirmed in malice, and thrown out of heaven, according to that in Isaiah, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the Babylonians also, <hi>How art thou</hi>

            <p>Lastly, when Adam was created, in whom by propagation were all men, the same mean again to their end was propounded by God under his word and command, and the type of the tree of life, which signified the Sonne of God who is the true life, according to the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie<note place="margin">Joh. 14. 6.</note> of the Sonne, <hi>I am the way, the truth, and the life:</hi> upon this tree if they would have fed, they had been confirmed in grace for ever. But they, leaving Gods grace and his order, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the preventing temptation of the fallen spirit, and partly by their own pride, chose to go to their end by forsaking his word, and breaking of his command, in eating of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden tree. Thus by forsaking of God they also fell, which was their sinne: for sinne is the undoing of the compounded substance, which before the undoing was held together by Gods grace, till the bond was broken by the volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie act of the creature; according to the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of S. Austine, <hi>Quid est gustato cibo prohibito</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lib 4. in Jul. cap. ult.</note> 
               <hi>nuditas indicata, nisi peccato nudatum quod gratia contegebat? gratia quippe Dei magna ibi erat, ubi terrenum &amp; animale corpus bestialem libidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem</hi>

                  </gap>sse appeared when the forbidden meat was tasted, but because that was by sinne made bare, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore grace covered? for the grace of God was there great, where the earthly and animal bodie had not beastly lust.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that the sinne of angels and men arose from the frailtie of their composition and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, (yet without necessitie, or else all should have sinned) it appeareth, for that absolute simplicitie and unitie cannot admit alteration. Secondly, because sinne originally springs<note place="margin">Ecclus 10. 13.</note> from pride; and the subject of pride is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectuall appetite inordinately desiring its own excellencie. And the reason why this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite is inordinate, is, because it is founded in an unconstant and mutable nature, which is free-will, to which the creature was left after his creation, according to the saying of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticus, <hi>He made man from the beginning, and</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ecclus 15. 14.</note>

            </p>
            <p>But you will say that this composition is as well in God as in the creature, because in him
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:17738:91"/>
there is also will and intellect. I answer, that though both these be in God, yet in him they are without composition, for that in him they are not really distinct; but in him the whole is intellect, and the whole is will, because he is <hi>simplex &amp; totus simul.</hi> Whatsoever is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded may fall asunder; therefore that which is uncompounded must be immutable and eternal. Mans intellect is compounded of <hi>simplex</hi> and <hi>compositus,</hi> as the Physicks teach. The simple intellect, is that which apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the truth and <hi>species</hi> of things by sense and experience. The compounded is that which is occupied in the discourse of things, by ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering one thing from another; from whence is the discussing of doubts, and the constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of axioms. But in God there is no such method, because he doth all things without discourse, for that he seeth all things, and electeth all things at once without any circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance: but man first seeth by his intellect, next by reason deliberateth, and lastly electeth.</p>
            <p>From the simplenesse of Gods essence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth his reall existence in all creatures. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord filleth the world,</hi> Wisd. 1. 7. <hi>Thine incorruptible Spirit is in all things,</hi> Wisd. 12. 1. <hi>Do not I fill heaven and earth?</hi> Jer. 23. 24. <hi>Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations,</hi> Psalm. 90. 1. <hi>In him we live, and move, and have our being,</hi> Acts 17. 28. For so simple is he, that no creature can out him or withstand
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:17738:91"/>
him. And were not his essence in the creatures essence, they could not exist. Therefore when God leaveth the creature, that leaveth to be; because there can be no second essence without the first supporting it. If God were not in the hard stone and in the spisse iron, they could not hold, but they would first fall to powder; and if after that he should not be in the powder, it would vanish into nothing. The creatures es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence cannot be without Gods essence, which sustaineth all things. As no accident can be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a subject; no more can the creatures sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance exist without Gods substance, to which it belongs as an inseparable accident. But though Gods essence be in all things, yet is it not there by way of matter or form, or as a part of things; for so he should be in composition, and then he could not be the first cause of things: besides, all parts are imperfect, because they are not the whole. And if God should not be in all his creatures, in all places, and beyond all places and creatures, then he should not be infinite, but finite, where the creature is and he is not. He is in all places, not as occupying or filling them like the creatures, but as causing places, and containing them in himself. And he is in his creatures three waies; by his essence, by his presence, and by his power: by his essence, in causing them to exist; by his presence, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding them; and by his power, in upholding them. <hi>Applicat suum esse ad illorum esse, alioqui</hi>
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:17738:92"/>
               <hi>non essent ampliús.</hi> And this is approved by the School verse,</p>
            <q>Enter, praesenter, Deus hîc &amp; ubique potenter.</q>
            <p>But it may be objected, that if God should be in all things, then he should contract defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the baser things, according to the proverb, <hi>Qui tang it picem, coinquinabitar ab ipsa.</hi> It is answered, that Gods simplenesse and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie is such, that it cannot contract impuritie; because he is not in any thing by way of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position or participation, but <hi>seorsum, &amp; per se.</hi> As the pure light, though it shineth in the most impure things, yet is still pure, because it mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not with them: so though God be in the devils and wicked men, beholding their hearts &amp; thoughts, yet he cannot contract any defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, being purer then the light; because he is onely in their essence which is alwayes good, and not in their defection wherein lieth the defilement: for by sinne onely the creature fell from God. Wherefore the errour of Illyricus, in affirming sinne to be the substance of the creature fallen, is exceeding foolish; seeing the Apostle saith, 1. Tim. 4. 4. <hi>Omnis creatura Dei bona est.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Further, God is in his creatures generally, by upholding their essence and governing their wayes; but in the regenerate onely, by reducing them to their order, inflecting their hearts and thoughts to their right end. And this demonstration I confirm from these
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:17738:92"/>
grounds of Gods word. Acts 17. 27, 28. <hi>Though doubtlesse he be not farre from every one of us. For in him we live, and move, and have our being.</hi> Psal. 139. 7. <hi>Whither shall I go from thy Spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence?</hi> And vers. 13. <hi>For thou hast possessed my reins.</hi> We therefore are all in God <hi>prime modo, id est, per essentiam:</hi> but if he be not in us and we in him <hi>secundo modo, per gratiam &amp; ordinem,</hi> it will profit us nothing to our chiefest good.</p>
            <p>Lastly, to this attribute of the simplicitie of Gods essence, accreweth the attribute of his immutabilitie. All corruption is in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position: therefore the things which are more simple, are farthest from alteration, and nearest to eternitie. So pure is Gods essence, without any mixture of matter and potentialitie, that it cannot alter: but all things created, in that they are made and compounded, have a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of infirm matter or potentialitie, and therefore are mutable.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Consectaries.</head>
               <p>From hence arise these consectaries, that if God be in every one of us upholding our essence, this shall be our greater condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if we do not seek and finde him who is so neare unto us, and turn to him who is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us. Secondly, this argueth Gods infinite greatnesse, in that no creature can escape his presence, which is as well in hell and in the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:17738:93" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hardest adamant, as in the glorious heavens. Thirdly, to see this wonderfull God with the eyes of our minde (whom we cannot see with bodily eyes) to see him who is in all things supporting all as a root or foundation, with him to converse, to walk, to talk, and to do nothing without him, is the onely securitie that is in the world. And this appeareth by this saying of S. Paul upon Moses, <hi>For he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>as he which saw him who is invisible;</hi> and is seconded by David, Psalm. 16. 8. <hi>I have set the Lord alwaies before me, therefore I shall not slide.</hi> Fourthly, to be content with God onely, and not to mix our selves with world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, is mans simplicitie.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Gods attributes.</head>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>1 Unitie.</head>
                  <p>Having spoken of Gods essence, it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to speak of his attributes. Of which the first is <hi>Unitie,</hi> the first of the 3 great passions Metaphysicall, <hi>Unum, Verum, Bonum.</hi> And this is testified by these affirmations of Gods word. <hi>Heare O Israel, The Lord our God is one Lord,</hi> Deut. 6. 4. <hi>See now that I, even I am he, and there is no god with me,</hi> Deut. 32. 39. That which is the beginning and cause of all things, must be one and no more. As one is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of all numbers; so one God is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of all creatures: therefore Parmeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des said, <hi>Omnia unum sunt.</hi> Multiplicitie of
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:17738:93" rendition="simple:additions"/>
things visible is but the multiplied shadow of invisible unitie. According to this Seneca said of God, <hi>Est totum quod vides, &amp; totum quod non vides.</hi> But this must cautelously be understood: not that God in the stone is truely and properly a stone, as Servetus wickedly affirmed; but that he is the onely cause of the stones being, and of all things else.</p>
                  <p>1. If there were more Gods then one, then there would be some difference between them; because multiplicitie admits difference and varietie: and therefore something should be in the one which is not in the other; and so that God which wanteth, should not be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect God.</p>
                  <p>2. That there is but one God, shall appeare from all things that are, because he hath set his mark and stamp upon them: for all things speak but one. Though there be millions of men in the world, yet every man is but one man. Though there be many <hi>species</hi> of things made, yet they all consist of individuals. There is nothing but is one thing. Multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie and collectives end in one. Many mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers make but one bodie, many sheep but one flock, many beasts but one herd, many men but one kingdome, and all creatures make but one world. Wherefore one is the mark and image of God, who as he is but one, so he comprehends all in himself.</p>
                  <p>3. If there were more then one, then warre
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:17738:94" rendition="simple:additions"/>
would not cease between them, till one had gotten the upper hand to be above the rest. For, as Tertullian disputeth against Marcion,<note place="margin">Advers. Marc. lib. 1.</note> he which is God must be <hi>summum magnum, the chiefest great above all other;</hi> and this can be but one. Again, S. Cyprian thus, <hi>Unus omnium</hi>

And Ennius saith, <hi>Nulla sancta societas nec fides</hi>

                     <hi>regniest.</hi> Alexander likewise told king Darius, <hi>Mundum non posse duobus solibus regi, That the world could not be governed by two sunnes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. If there were more Gods then one, then as fast as the one did blesse us, the other would curse us; according to that of the Poet,</p>
                  <q>Mulciber in Trojam, pro Troja stabat Apollo.</q>
                  <p>Then again the creatures would not so well agree as they do: for if one creature were made by one God, and another by another, then there would be nothing but relucting. The earth would swallow up the water, the fire would burn up the aire, the host of heaven would set upon the hosts of the earth to depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulate it; yea, heaven it self would be divided: Saturns planet would spoil the planet of Mars, the light of the sunne would waste the other
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:17738:94" rendition="simple:additions"/>
lights; and every creature, as his God should be best able to aid, would overcome his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low or inferiour. But now because there is but one God that hath made all, therefore he hath care of all alike; therefore they agree as they do, and mutually serve each others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit.</p>
                  <p>5. The government of commonwealths, where divers and strange dispositions combine themselves into one bodie, for one common good, shews that nature imitateth the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, which is one.</p>
                  <p>6. Contrarietie and discord, though it be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so great, yet it cannot overcome unitie, but unitie overcomes it, as an armie concatenate prevaileth against an armie scattered. This sheweth that there is but one God ruling over all, which is the God of unitie and concord.</p>

                     <hi>appetunt, All things desire good.</hi> Wherefore as all things joyn in one concerning the general end, (though all use not the right mean) this argueth also that there is but one beginning, which hath given but one common appetite to all creatures.</p>
                  <p>Now having shewed God to be but one, from hence it followeth that in him there can be no pluralitie: therefore his essence is not one thing, and his attributes another; neither
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:17738:95"/>
may we say of his attributes, This is not that; but his truth is the same that his goodnesse is, his goodnesse the same with his power, his power the same with his essence, and so there is no difference nor distinction numericall or spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cificall, but in God all is one, and one is all: and to think otherwise, is to make God in himself finite and limited; because look how much one attribute hath of infinitenesse proper to it self, so much the other must want, and so be limited. Thus therefore are we to affirm of God and his attributes as convertibles: God is truth it self or the first truth, and the first truth is God. God is goodnesse or the first goodnesse, and the first goodnesse is God. God is power, and power it self is God; and so of the rest. Next, as God is one, so he is all; because all things are contained in this one. Therefore if all the goods of men and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and all things els were lost, in him they might be found again.</p>

                     <p>The consectarie doctrine is, that, whereas all things are but one in the individuall, and have but one root or beginning, which is God, therefore we should not part his honour among others, but give it wholly to himself: and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong our selves we should not break the bond of unitie by discord; because there is but one heaven to which we tend, there to meet with the one beginning: and to come to this there is
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:17738:95"/>
but one mean, which is the will of this holy One, written and sealed in his holy word. By departing from Gods unitie, truth, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, men and angels were destroyed.

                  <head>Gods Truth and Intellect.</head>
                  <p>The second attribute is his <hi>Truth,</hi> which is the second in the three principall passions, <hi>U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, Verum, Bonum, Unum</hi> noteth the first per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, from whom is the unitie of essence; <hi>Verum</hi> the second, which is the Fathers intellect and wisdome; and <hi>Bonum</hi> the third person, who is the Father and Sonnes goodnesse. Now Gods truth is his perfect intellect in all things; for truth according to our capacitie cometh from right, and right from the light of intellect: but because there is no composition in God as in the creature, therefore in him there is no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent from thing to thing; but his truth, light, and intellect is all one, which we call his knowledge. From hence proceedeth the recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude which is to be found in his creatures: for what in them is right, is true; and what is true, is right. Agreeing to this the Psalme hath, <hi>O Lord, how manifold are thy works! in wisdome</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 104. 24.</note> 
                     <hi>thou hast made them all: the earth is full of thy riches.</hi> They are true made, because they are made by the light of Gods wisdome. From which God is called, Jam. 1. 17. <hi>the Father of lights:</hi> and he is so called, because as all the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:17738:96"/>
childrens goods descend from the father, so the rectitudes and excellencies of all creatures are from God derived, and are to him to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred as to their fountain. <hi>Every good and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect gift</hi> (saith he) <hi>cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variablenesse, nor sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of turning.</hi> Here God is compared to the sunne and moon, the two great lights in the firmament, to confound their light. For the moons light (as we know) is variable, because it is borrowed from the sunne by divers posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and therefore is not alwayes light-alike; and the sunnes light leaveth a shadow behinde it, by his turning from one horizon to another: but Almightie God hath no variablenesse, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his light is his own; and he leaveth no shadow by turning, because he is alwayes in the midst of his horizon, which is every where. And from hence is this comfortable saying of God to his people, Malach. 3. 6. <hi>Because I the Lord am not changed, therefore ye sonnes of Jacob are not consumed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And in God is the truest knowledge, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause by how much any thing is remote from matter, by so much the more it is intelligent, for that it is not straitned by its matter to which it is united: for the book of Wisdome hath, <hi>The corruptible bodie presseth down the soul,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Wisd. 9. 15.</note> 
                     <hi>and the earthly tabernacle weigheth down the minde that museth upon many things.</hi> And from hence it is that the angelical nature is more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:17738:96"/>
then the humane soul, for that it is more immateriall, and therein cometh nearest to God: for God hath no matter, but is <hi>purus actus</hi> without potentialitie, and therefore his knowledge must needs be perfect. And, as I said before, his intellect is not by discourse or successe, because this implieth difficultie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to omnipotencie: but God seeth all his effects in himself, as in the cause at once, for that all things are to him alwayes present in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his eternitie: and for this cause reason is none of his attributes, but vision in place of it; because reason hath discourse, but vision hath none, but is onely a direct aspect. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner mans reason in the next life shal be advanced, when it shall behold God, not any more by reason, but by vision. <hi>Now we see</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly, the height of Gods knowledge is observed in beholding himself, by which from eternitie he begat his Sonne, who in holy Writ is called his <hi>truth, wisdome,</hi> &amp; <hi>image.</hi> And<note place="margin">John 14. 6.</note> this is illustrated by the looking-glasse, as one demonstrateth. For as when a man looketh in a glasse, he produceth an image of himself so like as no difference can be found, not onely in shape, but also in motion; for when the man moveth, the image moveth too; and this image is not long in making, nor by instruments, nor
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:17738:97"/>
by labour, but in a moment by one look: in like manner Almighty God beholding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in the glasse of his divinitie with the eie of his understanding, doth beget and produce an image most like unto himself. And because God hath given to this image all his own sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance and being, (which we cannot do in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding our selves in a glasse) that image is the true Sonne of God, though our images which we see in glasses are not our sonnes. And for that God the Father hath alwaies and doth alwaies behold himself, therefore his Sonne is not younger, but full as ancient as his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; he alwaies begotten, and his Father al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies begetting, according to that of S.

                  <head>Gods Goodnesse.</head>
                  <p>Gods third attribute is his <hi>Goodnesse:</hi> and this is splendent in two respects: First, in that he is the cause efficient of things; and next, the cause appetible; for good and appetible are convertibles: what is good, is to be desired; and what is to be desired, is good. Therefore Aristotle saith, <hi>Omnia bonum appetunt.</hi> Thus we distinguish between the substance of things and their goods: for substances are but emptie vessels without their goods adjected: and these goods are certain similitudes or conveniences in which things rejoyce; for like desireth like. From whence it follows, that if the created similitudes be goods appetible, then much more God the creatour of them must be good, yea the chief good, as the fountain of them. Now there can be no better similitude for man the image to delight in, then God his <hi>exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plar,</hi> and his Sonne by flesh and bloud to him allied. Therefore he above all things is of him to be desired.</p>
                  <p>Thus from these three great attributes we have the great and infinite God described; who in English is called <hi>God,</hi> of <hi>good.</hi> From these three he expresseth himself in the creation of the world his image. From his unitie in es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:17738:98"/>
we have our essences to be individuals; from his truth we have the perfection of our composition; and from his goodnesse we have our end in desires, which is the height of our growth: so from the beginning we have our beginning and active principle; from the truth we have our <hi>medium</hi> and way to our end; and from goodnesse we have the complement of our desires in the end, which the School cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth <hi>quies in bono.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now to shew the good things of God for mans good created, he in this life offers to the intellect the contemplation of things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectuall, mathematicall, and materiall, as the causes and reasons of things, by which Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon spake, from the cedar that is in Lebanon, to the hysope that springeth out of the wall. Again, he offers to the will the good divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>utile, honestum, delectabile. Utile</hi> sheweth the means by which we tend toward things good; <hi>honestum</hi> is that which is good of it self; and <hi>delectabile</hi> is the rest and joy in the good obtained. Lastly, he offers to the senses their proper and desired objects; as fair sights to the eyes, harmonies to the eares, sweet smells to the nostrills, pleasant meats to the taste, and smooth things to the touch. But as the goodnesse of God thus sheweth it self in this life, so it exceedeth all our expectation in the next life, where is our last rest and chief good. <hi>Eye hath not seen, nor eare heard, neither have</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Cor. 2. 9.</note>
                     <pb n="183" facs="tcp:17738:98"/>
                     <hi>entred into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him:</hi> for some of Gods goods are so great and so good, that this life, though it be good, is not capable of them.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto of the goodnesse of God in the state of nature: now followeth the goodnesse of God in the state of grace. And this is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally to be seen in his justice and mercie in redeeming mankinde. The goodnesse of Gods justice appeareth in that no mercie could ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare without it: for mercie presupposeth miserie, and miserie is the pay of justice. Where therefore there is no justice, there can be no mercie. Had not God permitted men and angels to fall, neither angels nor men could have been sensible of Gods love the root of goodnesse, in keeping some from fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and in saving others after the fall. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fit it was for God to make justice his way to shew his mercie, by which above all his goodnesse is applauded. And these two in the redemption of man the greatest of Gods works are to be observed, wherein they met and saluted each other, according to the Psalm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ist, <hi>Mercie and truth are met together: righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 85. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>and peace have kissed each other.</hi> He shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his justice upon his own Sonne; he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his mercie in ransoming all mankinde: and here is verified Samsons riddle, <hi>Out of the eater</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Judg. 14. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>came meat, out of the strong came sweetnesse.</hi>
                     <pb n="184" facs="tcp:17738:99"/>
What is more strong and devouring then justice? and what is more sweet then mercie? God gave his Sonne to death, and by this he redeemed the world. Mercie kissed justice, and justice yeelded her right to mercie. <hi>Mercie</hi> (saith S. James) <hi>rejoyceth</hi> or <hi>glorieth against</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jam. 2. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>judgement.</hi> In the death of Gods Sonne mercie and justice contended; mercie overcame, and therefore she triumpheth. Now therefore mercie hath the preeminence all the world over; yet not without justice, as they met at first, lest man should runne out of mercies bounds, and fall into relapse: both therefore, because we are saved by both, and preserved by both, are to be respected of us as our spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall good from God.</p>
                  <p>In the next place we are beholding to Gods goodnesse in the 3 graces, Faith, Hope, and Charitie, and the Sacraments, by which Gods ransome is applied to us. By faith God resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth our understanding; by hope he sanctifieth our affections, and gives us state of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven; and by charitie he draws us out of our selves, and taketh us into himself by making us partakers of the divine nature. And the Sacraments are outward means by which God bestoweth on us his inward graces, to teach us that grace is not bred in our selves, but given to us <hi>forinsecus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this goodnesse of God natively pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from his will, as thought and truth
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:17738:99"/>
proceedeth from his minde. The one is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent, the other alwaies erumpent. Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is known by its going forth. Therefore we call him the good man, not which is good to himself within, but good to others with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. Wisdome and truth never come forth but in the companie of goodnesse. Therefore the Psalmist saith, <hi>Mercie and truth are met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 85. 10.</note> When they meet, mercie cometh out first, and bringeth truth and wisdome with it.</p>
                  <p>Now the will of God, because it is the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme dispenser of all things, as it is one, so it is universall: and because it is universall, it containeth in it all wills, and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent all things under it. And thus it cometh, that with one and the same will he permitteth things most contrarie to be willed, and yet his will is still one and the same. And it must be so, because otherwise the wills of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which are contrarie to his, should not move under it, but without it and above it, and so God should not be omnipotent. For though God did not positively or with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure will that men and angels should sinne and fall, because the Psalmist saith, <hi>Thou art not a</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 5. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>God that hath pleasure in wickednesse, neither shall my evil dwell with thee;</hi> yet <hi>per accidens &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missivè,</hi> according to his order or decree of contingencie, he would leave men and angels to themselves, to see what they would bring forth. And rather then he would violate the
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:17738:100"/>
order of nature in depriving men of the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of their wills (which is essentiall to them) it pleased his all-swaying providence to suffer evil to be done (being he knew how to bring good out of it) then to permit none at all.

We most savingly confesse, which most right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we beleeve, that the God and Lord of all things, who created all things exceeding good, and foresaw evil would arise from the good, knowing also that it more appertained to his most omnipotent goodnes, even out of evil to bring good, then to suffer no evil to be done at all: first, that he might shew what free-will could do; secondly, the benefit of his grace, and power of justice.</hi> For if men and angels could have sinned whether God would or no, therein they had been superiour to Gods will: but this they could not: therefore God would suffer it, to shew his omnipotencie, in being not onely able to make all things good, as he did in the beginning; but in a degree further, to make good of evil, in turning their evils to a greater good, by his justice toward angels,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:17738:100"/>
and by advancement of mercie towards men. So that now since mans fall, God, by his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting and superabounding mercie, hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided such a remedie, which should not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store him to his former paradise <hi>in puris natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralibus,</hi> but to a supernaturall happinesse in the kingdome of glory; not to wade in reason, but to walk in vision, to enjoy glorie above the sunnes light, and to reap content above all conceit. But for such as shall fall double, from lesse and from greater grace, and never rise; for such whom no warning will amend, for such justice hath a double due, a naturall and a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall death, seated not onely <hi>in poena damni,</hi> but <hi>in poena sensûs,</hi> which the torments of hell-fire afford. S. Thomas well teacheth, that God by no means will have evil or blame<note place="margin">Quid melius, quid omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentius eo, qui, cùm mali nihil faciat, bene etiam de malis facit? <hi>Et rursus,</hi> Omnipotens Deus, qui o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratur bona etiam de no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stris malis, qualia dabit bona, cum li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beraverit ab omnibus ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis? <hi>Aug. lib. de Continen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, cap. 6.</hi>
                     </note> simply, as it is evil, (because he is all good) but onely as evil is joyned to some good: as he that would have justice, must also be willing to have punishment; and as he that would have the order of nature to be preserved, must also be willing to have nature corrupted: but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire evil as it is onely evil, or to approve evil of blame, God by no appetite, either naturall, animall, or intellectuall, desireth. And this is confirmed by S. Augustine; <hi>Miro &amp; ineffabili modo non fit praeter ejus voluntatem, quod fit etiam contra ejus voluntatem; quia non fieret si non sine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret; nec utique nolens sinit, sed volens: nec sineret bonus fieri malè, nisi omnipotens etiam de malo</hi>
                     <pb n="188" facs="tcp:17738:101"/>
                     <hi>posset facere bonum bene. By a wonderfull and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable manner, that is not done without his will, which is done against his will; because if he did not suffer it, it should not be done; neither doth he suffer it against his will, but willingly: neither would he that is good suffer evil things to be done, but that he being omnipotent is able of evil to make good things well.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By this you see, that if God should not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer evil, and admit contraries, there could be no world. And this libertie God hath bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed also upon man. For we many times suffer the evil of blame and displeasure willingly, to see how farre our adversaries will proceed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us, because we know how to reverse all again at our pleasure, and to right it by taking satisfaction of punishment, or to merit by suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferance.

Mark 8. 34.</note> liberties, to follow Christ through the worlds difficulties, to receive a hundred-fold more enlargements in the kingdome of glorie. These are Gods counsels, which of the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church were put in practise, but in our times they are put off with a <hi>Non placet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fourth part of Gods will of signe is his operation; and this is the sermon of his works which he makes all the yeare long to instruct
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:17738:102"/>
us. By his works of justice and punishment he calls us to repentance; by his works of favour and mercie he procureth us to praise him. This the Apostle expresseth in Acts 14. 17. <hi>Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse, he left not himself without witnesse, in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitfull seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladnesse.</hi> Thus by his operation he really preacheth unto us.</p>
                  <p>The fifth and last part of this will, is his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission; and by this he suffers man to do what<note place="margin">Nec pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum nec rectè factum impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tari cuiquam justè potest, qui nihil se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerit propriâ voluntate: est enim pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum &amp; rectè factum in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bero volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trio. <hi>Aug. lib. 83. q. 24.</hi> Quid illud, quòd tam multis in lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis omnia mandata sua custodiri &amp; fieri jubet Deus? quomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do jubet, si non est l<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> he will under his divine rule and measure. And this will he affordeth to man in three re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects; in regard of his creation, in regard of his judgement, and in regard of excuse. In his creation he gave to man free-will; therefore it was fit to grant him together with it suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and free libertie to exercise it: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise it were all one as if God should make hands, and then binde them as soon as he had made them. Again, the will of Gods suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is due in regard of mans last end, and Gods judgement: for if God should not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit man to do his actions freely, then he could not in justice punish him if he did not as he should, because he wanted free libertie; nor give him reward, by reason of necessitie. For as God will not call the beasts of the field to doom at the last day, because he gave them not free-will; no more would he call man to judgement, if he wanted permission to execute
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:17738:102"/>
his free-will. Lastly, God suffers man to live long, to expect his repentance: wherefore if he do not repent, his excuse is prevented. In this respect the Apostle saith, Rom. 2. 4. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spisest thou the riches of his bountifulnesse, and patience, and long sufferance, not knowing that the goodnesse of God leadeth thee to repentance?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having spoken of Gods will as it is <hi>antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> and <hi>of signe;</hi> now it followeth to speak of it as it is <hi>of good pleasure,</hi> and <hi>of consequent.</hi> The will of Gods good pleasure is expressed in the 135 Psalme, vers. 6. <hi>Whatsoever the Lord plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, that did he in heaven and in earth, in the seas, and in all deep places.</hi> This is Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and essentiall will; first, because it is of the nature of the will to do of pleasure; and next, because it is most generall, and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to any place or person. His will of signe is not alwaies done, because it is his will for men and not for himself respectively. Therefore his precepts are broken, his prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions slighted, his counsels not regarded: but his will of good pleasure is above the law of the Medes and Persians; this cannot be put by, because it is <hi>divina</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, after that God hath shewed man all his favours by his will of signe and word re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, to which he addeth the effects of his grace expressed by S. Prosper in these seven particulars, <hi>perswading by exhortations, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monishing by examples, terrifying by dangers,</hi>
                     <pb n="192" facs="tcp:17738:103"/>
                     <hi>inciting by miracles, giving understanding, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiring counsel, and lightning the heart with faiths affections.</hi> When all these are despised and rejected, then God proceedeth with his will consequent, which is the will of his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice. First he would have all men to be saved by his will antecedent: but because all men will not consent to this, therefore, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain mans free-will, God will not save all in effect; but the same will turneth from mercie to justice, which before turned from justice<note place="margin">Matth. 25. 41.</note> to mercie, and saith, <hi>Depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire, which is prepared for the devil and his angels.</hi> Neither is Gods will altered nor broken, because it turneth from mercie to judgement, for that it still retaineth its former mercie, and man his former resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance<note place="margin">Matth. 23. 37.</note> to receive it. <hi>How often</hi> (saith our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our) <hi>would I have gathered thy children together even as a hen gathereth her chickens, but ye would not?</hi> If God hath not bound man to one ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, but given him free-will to turn from ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to object, according to reasons rule; then should God be bound and man free? The will of God is wider then all wills: all his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine attributes may rest in it; his truth, his wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, his justice, his mercie, his power, his pleasure and displeasure: yea all the contraries that are in the world, are within it, and lie under it; as life and death, sicknesse and health, good and evil, salvation and da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mnation:
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:17738:103"/>
and without this there could be no world.</p>
                  <p>Notwithstanding, though Gods will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so wide and comprehensive, yet it impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth no necessitie upon mans will, because all will by Gods creation is free; and if it were not free, it were no will. Necessitie and will are <hi>incompatibilia,</hi> they cannot stand together. Nature and things without will are of a strait disposition; therefore for them God hath ordained necessitie, and determined them to one thing: but mans will, because it is the image of Gods will, is wide and capacious; and therefore he hath provided for it the ocean of contingencie. <hi>He hath set fire and water before thee,</hi> (saith Ecclesiasticus) <hi>stretch out thy hand</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ecclus 15. 16, 17.</note> 
                     <hi>unto which thou wilt. Before man is life and death, good and evil; and whether him liketh, shall be given him.</hi> Now no man can justly complain while all things are set before him, and he hath free choice to all. Election expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth necessitie, and necessitie thrusteth out e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection. If mans will were not free from neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie, then there could neither be merit nor demerit, that is, neither reward nor punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and then the two great streams of Gods bountie and justice should be dried up: but now he hath given to man free-will; and to maintain this, he hath ordained contingencie, and added his grace to aid his will, that there might be no defect on his part: for freedome
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:17738:104"/>
naturall to good Theologicall is not free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, but stubbornnesse without grace.</p>
                  <p>And this grace and goodnesse of God, as it ordereth and aideth things naturall to their naturall ends, so it ordereth and aideth man to his supernaturall end, which is to live with his God in heaven. And this goodnesse of grace is like to the vertuous magnet the most remarkable of all stones, the guide of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and the direction for sea-travell: for as the pin and needle of the diall being toucht with it, the needle will stand no way but north and south; so the heart of man being toucht with Gods grace in his regeneration, will stand no way but to heaven-ward. And this touch is that which Divines call the habit of charitie, alwaies enclining and bending to heaven and heavenly things through all the rubs of the world. Though the toucht needle for a while is shaken and justled from its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer due station; yet as soon as the shaking is over, it returneth instantly to the same point: right so, though the heart be for a time justled either by the lust of the flesh, or the lust of the eyes, or the pride of life from its right stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; yet as soon as the force is over, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently it returneth to its former station to heaven-ward. And the onely reason is the touch of Gods goodnesse in the regenerate soul, to which above all things mans heart is beholding.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="195" facs="tcp:17738:104"/>And this goodnesse proceedeth from the holy Ghost, as truth proceedeth from the Sonne of God: for as the Sonne is the Fathers essentiall truth, so the holy Ghost is the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and the Sonnes essentiall goodnesse. And as the holy Ghost is the increate goodnesse of God in himself, so love and charitie is the create goodnesse of the holy Ghost in man. And untill this be wrought in us by the holy Spirit, we may be men and true men, but we cannot be good men, nor for the kingdome of heaven. Therefore S. Augustine saith, <hi>Sola</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tract. 5. in epist. Joh.</note> 
                     <hi>charitas dividit inter filios regni &amp; filios aeternae damnationis.</hi> So excellent is charitie, that God is called by it, 1 John 4. 8. <hi>God is charitie.</hi> And so good is it, that Divines call it <hi>grace, per Antonomasiam,</hi> because it is the principall grace. And S. Paul calleth it <hi>the greatest; The</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Cor. 13. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>greatest of these is charitie.</hi> Yea so great is it, that no good can be done without it, because it is the cause impulsive of every good action. You may beleeve without it, but then your belief is not good, because it wanteth his right end, which must proceed from chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties election and direction. Therefore in this sense, S. Paul gives faiths action to charitie; <hi>It beleeveth all things, it hopeth all things, &amp;c.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Vers. 7.</note> Why? because it enliveneth faith and all other vertues by giving spirit unto them. Faith is the candle to charitie, and sheweth her light how to work, according to Gods word: but
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:17738:105"/>
charitie, being the impulse of the regenerate soul, acteth all.</p>
                  <p>And whereas <hi>bonum</hi> is by Divines distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished into <hi>verum</hi> &amp; <hi>apparens,</hi> the <hi>true</hi> good, and the <hi>appearing</hi> good; the true good is that which hath order to the best end, which is Gods glorie and our eternall good: of this kinde are all holy habits, qualities, and good works commanded by God. The appearing good is that which hath no order to the best end, but is onely for this world, and appeareth glorious to the naturall man. And this is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed by S. John in these three particulars, <hi>the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Joh. 2. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>pride of life.</hi> The lust of the flesh is fleshly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence, the lust of the eyes is covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and the pride of life is a mans animositie, appearing in anger, arrogancie, and the like. All these, as S. John saith, are not of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but of this world, and are the devils baits to hook the unwise generation.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, here may the question be moved, Whether the goodnesse of substance in man be better then the goodnesse of qualitie. To this I answer, that the goodnesse of substance is <hi>de esse;</hi> but the goodnesse of qualitie is <hi>de be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne esse,</hi> which is Gods grace qualifying sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and therefore the better. For the souls of the damned have their <hi>esse</hi> in hell, and are miserable: but the souls of the Saints, by Gods grace and the good qualitie, are in heaven,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:17738:105"/>
which is their chief good. Grace and the good qualitie is the perfection and complement of substance. A holy and a good man is better then a man; because holinesse and goodnesse is the perfection of a man. As the soul is the form of man; so grace and goodnesse is the form of the soul: it healeth nature, it giveth to man <hi>quoddam supernaturale,</hi> it is the root of vertues, it is the greatest of gifts, it is corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondent to eternall glorie, by it the holy Ghost inhabiteth in us; and therefore in this life this good is <hi>maximè appetibile.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus farre of the goodnesse of God in the state of grace: but the greatest of his goodnes is to be seen in the state of glorie, because the state of glorie is the end and perfection of the state of grace. In this state his goodnesse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth of joy and glorie. Joy is the crown of the heart, and glorie is the crown of the head: the one is the complement of the will and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, the other of the minde and intellect. The intellect shall there be filled with the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God, the will and affections with the fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition of his love, and the lower part of the soul with its proper objects. And that this may the better be effected in that blessed estate, God hath ordained certain means for the possessing of it, which S. Thomas calleth <hi>dotes, dowries:</hi> and these are certain glorious habits or dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions, fitting the souls and bodies of the saints for the enjoying of eternall blisse, because
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:17738:106"/>
without means nothing may be applied. And these dowries are three; <hi>vision,</hi> which answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to faith in this life; <hi>apprehension,</hi> answering to hope; and <hi>fruition,</hi> answering to charitie. Besides, in that blessed estate there are degrees of joy and glorie, insinuated by our Lord, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>In my Fathers house are many mansions;</hi> and<note place="margin">Joh. 14. 2.</note> by S.

And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there are certain excellencies of works, in overcoming the greatest difficulties; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the School, after the former demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, argueth certain priviledged crowns, which they call <hi>aureolae,</hi> to be due to them which
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:17738:106"/>
have conquered best; to Martyrs for overco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming<note place="margin">Apoc. 2. 17. and 14. 3.</note> persecutions, to Virgins for conquering the flesh, and to Doctours for putting the devil<note place="margin">Dan. 12. 3.</note> to flight from their flocks.</p>
                  <p>And this goodnesse of God is so great, that in the kingdome of glorie he giveth not even rewards to any, but exceeding to all, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his riches in the parable expressed, <hi>Give, and it shall be given to you; good measure,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly, so great is Gods goodnesse every way, that it sustaineth even the worst things, that is to say, all evil: for such an infirmitie is evil, that it cannot exist except it lean upon some good, as on a subject: for there can be no sicknesse but in the bodie, no blindnesse but in the eye, no lamenesse but in the member; no more can there be the evil of pain but in the organ of sense; nor sinne, which is the evil of blame, but in the soul receding from grace: for sinne in the action is nothing else but the leaving of the divine order to the good end. The subject is good, and the action as it is an action is good; but the running of it without order to a wrong end, that onely is evil, and is no way to be righted and resisted, but by the other evil, which is the evil of pain: but of the two, the evil of blame is the worst and greatest, because it is opposite to Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, as the evil of pain is opposite to the creatures good.</p>

                  <head>Gods Providence.</head>
                  <p>To Gods life allie two other attributes, his providence and his power. His providence is his foreknowledge, by which he provideth for his creatures their ends, and the means leading toward them. Gods providence is his law by which he governeth his creatures: for when he had made all things, it was not fit then to leave them to themselves. If he should not have made them to some end, then he should have lost by his work; &amp; if he should have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided them an end, and no means to go toward it, then both he and his creatures should fail: wherefore after the creation, it is fit that God should execute the law of his providence, for the ordering of all things to their ends. The end of the inferiour creature is to serve man, who is Gods image; and the end of man is to serve his Maker, for making of him in his own image.</p>
                  <p>The order to these ends is to be seen in these three; in the order of necessitie, in the order of inclination, &amp; in the order of free-will. The or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of necessity serves for creatures inanimate, which are farthest remote from free-will. Of these the Psalmist saith, <hi>He hath made them an</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 104. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>ordinance which none shall passe.</hi> Thus the fire burneth, and the water of necessitie quencheth, except for his pleasure he dispenseth with his ordinance. The order of inclination &amp; instinct
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:17738:108"/>
is for sensitive creatures, because they come nearest to free-will: by this the bee gathereth hony, and fish serve severall coasts at severall seasons, as if they were sent upon a message. The order of free-will is for man; to which, because it is the highest, God addeth his spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall grace. And by this man travelleth either to his home of happinesse, or his home of heavinesse. In this order, though it be never so free, and suggested by a sea of possibilities, yet none can outflee Gods providence (which the School calleth Fate) for that the second cause cannot move out of the first, no more then the lower orb can turn above the higher. The reason is, for that mans will is ordered by contingent objects, and God is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander and orderer of objects, and applieth them as he please. And thus God by causing a sound to be heard in the eares of Sennacherib,<note place="margin">2. Kings 19.</note> of king Tirhakahs coming against him, of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will he brake up his siege against king Hezeki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah. Thus again by the light of lamps and the<note place="margin">Judges 7.</note> sound of trumpets, God discomfited the great host of the Midianites. Thus also God by lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the wicked &amp; reprobates to their free-wil, to grace sufficient, and the objects of pleasure, covetousnesse, and pride, for all their free-will &amp; power of nature, they cannot free themselves from eternall sorrow. Lastly, thus God by mans free-will, by his word and Sacraments, and by grace habituall and influent to mans
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:17738:109"/>
free-will added, saveth his faithfull and elect, and bringeth them to eternall life.</p>
                  <p>And this providence of God concerning mans will thus distinguished, (first by grace generall to all mankinde added; next by meer free-will, to which man is left in himself; and lastly by grace habituall and effectuall, by which onely the godly and elect are moved and governed) this, I say, is answerable to the threefold motion of the heavens; the first moving from east to west, the next turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contrarie from west to east, and the third moving sometimes to the south, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to the north. So the first degree of Gods providence moveth all men generally to grace and goodnesse; and this is Gods motion one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, answering to that of the <hi>primum mobile.</hi> The second, contrarie to this, is the motion of nature; and this is mans onely, oppositely crossing God and his grace. The third, going both waies, is the motion of Gods sonnes, who are compounded of nature and grace; and they move sometime to vertue and goodnesse, and sometime to vice and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednesse.</p>
                  <p>Again, for the better knowledge of the state of free-will, to which many doubts and questions are liable, we are to understand, that it runneth under two orbs subordinate to Gods providence. The first and nearest is the orb of Contingencie; the second and more
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:17738:109"/>
supream is the orb of Fate. The orb of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingencie is decreed of God for the proper element of mans free-will to expatiate in, as fishes swim in the water, and fowls flie in the aire. And were it not for this, mans will could not be free, but shut up as it were in a prison, and so could neither be rewarded nor punished, neither move to heaven nor go down to hell, no more then the brute beasts which want understanding and the objects of contingencie.</p>
                  <p>To shew how man comes to have free-will, it shal appeare by these foure particulars. First, because God hath given to man reason and understanding, by which his will is not bound to one object, but hath libertie to make a free choice among many. Secondly, because it hath an orb of contingencies or possibilities to elect in. Thirdly, whereas God hath made mans will in his own image, by which it is capable of a spirituall good or a spirituall evil, in this respect God hath given freedome to it, by giving it a conscience wherein the rules of nature are written, either to excuse it if it do well, or to accuse it if it do ill, Rom. 2. 15. Fourthly and lastly, whereas God hath ordained to man a supernaturall end, to go to a heavenly paradise, he hath added the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est enfranchisement to his will, in affording it his grace, by giving to it his law positive, his sacraments, and ministers to apply this grace<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 11, &amp;c.</note>
                     <pb n="206" facs="tcp:17738:110"/>
daily. And in this respect our Lord saith in the Gospel, <hi>If the Sonne shall make you free, ye</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 8. 36.</note> 
                     <hi>shall be free indeed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Next, we are to know what contingencie is; and this is the possible mean between necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of being, and necessitie of not being, of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such or not such, of doing or not doing, &amp;c. Further, we are to know, that the events of contingencie in this orb are neither good nor bad, but meerly indifferent to free-will, and are onely matter or occasion of good and evil, yet ordered and guided by the providence of God, as may appeare by these particulars. On a time it fell out, that king Pharaohs butler<note place="margin">Gen. 40.</note> and baker had each of them a dream in one night; and that two yeares after king Pharaoh<note place="margin">Gen. 41.</note> had two dreams in one night, the interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whereof was the matter and occasion of Josephs great good and advancement. Again, it fortuned on a night, that king Ahasuerus<note place="margin">Esther 6.</note> could not sleep; whereupon he called for his chronicles to be read, and by chance the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of Mordecai his discoverie of the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Bigthana and Teresh against the king was lighted on, which was the matter of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decais advancement, and Gods Churches de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance. By chance Achan saw a wedge of<note place="margin">Josh. 7. 21.</note> gold and a Babylonish garment in the spoil of Jericho, and stole them; which turned to the utter extinction of him and his seed. Lastly, by chance David walked upon the roof of his
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:17738:110"/>
palace, from whence he espied Bathsh<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>a washing her self; by which sight he was so caught, that he not onely committed filthy adultery, but also cruell murder, which was a scarre upon him all his life after, and retaliated<note place="margin">2. Sam. 12. 10, 11.</note> with punishments of like nature. Yet did not these objects of contingencie more necessitate David and Achan to sinne, then the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Potiphars wife could prevail upon Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph, or the supposed stollen kid could cause Tobit to entertain it, though he was both<note place="margin">Tobit 2.</note> blinde, and so poore that his wife laboured for his living.</p>
                  <p>Now to prove contingencie to stand with holy Scripture, against the men which attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute all to fate and necessitie, my first argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment shall be from the Hebrew adverb of chance <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which is often used in the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, and by Pagnine and Hierome transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>nè forté;</hi> and specially in the 91 Psalme, vers. 11, 12. where the speech is attributed to God himself, the authour both of Fate and Contingencie. <hi>For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy wayes: they shall bear thee up in their hands, lest haply thou dash thy foot against a stone.</hi> My second induction shall be from the Hebrew conjunction <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>si,</hi> which formally argues chance, as may appeare by this and such like speeches in the old Law, Deut. 11. 13. <hi>If ye shall therefore hearken unto my commandments.</hi> It is said <hi>If,</hi> because it was
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:17738:111"/>
a great chance, if many of them did. My third is from the Greek adverb <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, in the new Testament, Acts 5. 39. <hi>Lest haply ye be found to fight against God.</hi> Then so it might fall out, and so again it might not fall out. Lastly, from the conjunction <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>sin</hi> or <hi>si:</hi> as in Matth. 11. 21. <hi>If the great works which have been done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they had repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.</hi> From hence our Saviour insinuates, that the great works which were wrought in Corazin and Bethsaida, might have been wrought in Tyre and Sidon; therefore this was contingent: and if it had been so, the one would have repented, whereas the other did not; and this is another contingent, and the more notable, in that the mean should have been all one between both without any difference. Again, contingencie in event is expressed in Acts 3. 10. where the people are said to be <hi>amazed at that which happened.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Further, contingencie is proved from the rule of justice: for if there were no contingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, then there could be no free-will; and if no free-will, then neither praise nor dispraise, neither hope of heaven nor desert of hell: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause then mens hands should be so bound with the cords of necessitie, that they might not do otherwise then they do, and so deserve nothing. Therefore the souls that are in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and in hell, neither merit nor demerit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:17738:111"/>
in those states there are no contingencies, but all necessitie: but they onely are worthy of praise or dispraise, of reward of glorie, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution of ignominie, which live here in this middle place of contingencie, unconfirmed ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in goodnesse or malice. And this is veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the saying of Ecclesiasticus upon the tried man, <hi>Let him be an example of glorie, who</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ecclus 31. 10, 11.</note> 
                     <hi>might offend, and hath not offended; or do evil, and hath not done it: therefore shall his goodnesse be established.</hi> Lastly, this is proved from absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie: for if necessitie should reigne alone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us, without contingencie; then all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations, promises, and threatnings in Gods word should be idle: for that it is in vain to call upon them, where there is no possibilitie to do otherwise then they do.</p>
                  <p>But though mans will be thus free in the orb of contingencies, as hath been proved; yet is it not absolutely free, but hath onely a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate freedome under the orb of fate, and divine necessitie in Gods providence, that is to say, such a freedome as is subject to Gods will, the supream moderatour and governour of all things. And this the very heathen acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, as the Oratour sheweth in the excuse of Pompey, <hi>At mihi quidem, si proprium &amp; verum nomen nostri mali quaeratur, fatalis quaedam cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitas incidisse videtur, &amp; improvidas hominum mentes occupavisse; ut nemo mirari debeat, huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na consilia divinâ necessitate esse superata. If the</hi>
                     <pb n="210" facs="tcp:17738:112"/>
                     <hi>true and proper name of our evil be sought, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain fatall calamitie to me seemeth to chop in, and so to occupie the improvident mindes of men, that no man ought to marvell, when humane counsels are by divine necessitie overcome.</hi> But to passe from humane frailtie, we affirm, that neither the will of angels, nor of Christ himself as he was man, hath an absolute libertie, (for which cause he said, <hi>Not as I will, but as thou wilt</hi>) but<note place="margin">Matth. 26. 39.</note> onely God, whose libertie of will is also a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie of necessitie, because it can will nothing but what is good. And this kinde of will is most noble, for that it is of divine essence, which cannot alter, nor is subject to defect or corruption. And in the order of causalitie this will again is most excellent, because it is most absolutely free, not depending upon any other but it self. Were the will of man in the orb of contingencie absolutely free, then it should not depend upon Gods will, then it would not say, <hi>Thy will be done,</hi> and then Gods will could not be omnipotent, because mans will might outgo it; then man would strike at heaven, and break ope hell if he could; then Phaetons horses would rend their halters, and the course of nature would be overturned. But, as it is in the proverb, God giveth a curst cow short horns: God gives to man such a libertie of will as is answerable to his power, that is, that he shall not in all things will what he would, nor be able to do what
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:17738:112"/>
he will. But herein stands his libertie and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to do what he can, and will what he will in the way of grace and goodnesse, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God will aid him to go beyond himself: but in the doing of evil, God will not give him leave to do what he list; but he so over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruleth his will by his divine fate or decree, that he can do nothing but what he will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him to do, either for the just punishment of sinne, or for the expression of his power in making good of evil.</p>
                  <p>Thus then standeth the libertie of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond will under the orb of the first will, that it is alwaies subject to it. And to demonstrate this to the safeguard of both, mans will is compared to a multitude of birds, and Gods providence to a wide cage, as we may ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, of a mile or two over; in which, some may flie south, some north, some east, some west, and all which way they list; yet when they become to the cages bounds, they can flie no further. And so is it with mans free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will: when it is come to the bounds of Fate, which God himself hath spoken, it can flie no further. And this is confirmed by these eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Gods word, <hi>Who hath resisted his will?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom. 9. 19. Prov. 19. 21. Prov. 16. 1, 9.</hi> Intelliguntur haec loca de voluntate ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soluta, non conditionata.</note> 
                     <hi>Many devices are in mans heart: but the counsel of the Lord shall stand. The preparations of the heart are in man: but the answer of the tongue is of the Lord. The heart of man purposeth his way: but the Lord doth direct his steps.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="212" facs="tcp:17738:113"/>And if we would know what Fate is, it is the decree or counsel of Gods will about the doing or leaving undone of all things that are to be done or left undone to the worlds end. S. Thomas defineth it thus, <hi>Fatum pro divina</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Part. 1. quaest. 116. <hi>art. 1.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>ponitur providentia omnia praeloquente.</hi> And his expositour Bonioannes thus, <hi>Fatum est dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positio seu series causarum secundarum.</hi> And this is confirmed by these testimonies: <hi>He spake, and it was done; he commanded, and it</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 33. 9, 11.</note> 
                     <hi>stood. The counsel of the Lord shall stand for ever, and the thoughts of his heart throughout all ages. Who worketh all things after the counsel of his</hi>

                     <hi>own will.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But here it may be objected, How can mans<note place="margin">Ob.</note> will be free, while it is subject to Fate or Gods will? It is answered, Because it is neither forced<note place="margin">Sol.</note> nor necessitated, but onely ordered, disposed, and perswaded, as Solomon expresseth in the former allegations, and again in this, <hi>The kings</hi>

                     <hi>heart is in the hand of the Lord, as the rivers of water: he turneth it whithersoever it pleaseth him.</hi> Thus he turneth it without any touch of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie or force, by offering to it such objects as are congruent and acceptable to the kings will. As he that makes an oration to perswade men, doth not thereby take from them their free choice: so doth Gods providence, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of objects, and altering contingents after his own pleasure, dispose all mens wills and waies to the right end of their own good, if
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:17738:113"/>
they will yeed to him; or to his own glory, if they will not turn.</p>

                  <head>Gods Power.</head>
                  <p>Next, for Gods <hi>Power,</hi> this must needs be omnipotent, because he made the world and all things in it of nothing. Angels have for a time made themselves bodies in which they appeared to the saints of the old world, &amp; men have made all the gorgeous buildings on earth: but how? the one of the aire by them conden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and the other of wood and stone and other materials: but herein is the power, to make of nothing, which is proper onely to the omnipotent. Next, he not onely made all things of nothing; but he daily supporteth and moveth all things made, without any other aid then his own. The lives of all things move in his life, and the vertue of all things is operative by his vertue. Alexander conquered the world, but the power was Gods; Cyrus won Babylon, but the policie was the Lords; &amp; men wrought the seven wonders, and yet they were but Gods instruments; in him they all moved. Therefore the Psalme saith in generall, <hi>If thou hide thy face, they are tro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ubled; if thou take</hi>

And whereas he made the world in six dayes, as fast as he made the succeeding dayes
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:17738:114"/>
works, the works of the former dayes would have expired: for which cause it is no lesse vertue to the Almightie, to sustain the world made, then to make it of nothing: and at this the Apostle aimed, when he said, <hi>Bearing up</hi>

                  <p>The fifth attribute is Gods <hi>Perfection;</hi> which to illustrate, is rightly to distinguish of perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: for perfection is twofold; one growing and having degrees, the other without growth, and without degrees. The first is of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the second is of the Creatour. The perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the creature is the top of its growth: for when the creature is grown as much as it can grow, then it is said to be perfect. This perfection is competent to men, and the Sonne of man as he was man. Of men it is said, Matth. 5. 48. <hi>Be ye therefore perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.</hi> This is an exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to grow to our perfection, which is fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, as Gods is infinite. Of the Sonne of Gods perfection as he was man, it is said, Luk. 2. 52.

                     <hi>And Jesus increased in wisdome and stature, and in favour with God and man.</hi> The second perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is of God onely, is the absolute perfection: for that which cannot be better nor worse, must needs be absolutely perfect: but God is so good, that he cannot be better; and again he is so good, that he cannot be worse: therefore he must be absolutely perfect with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out degrees or growth. And this perfection is from his essence, which, because it is infinite, can admit no increase; and because it is eternall, it will suffer no decay.</p>

                  <p>The sixth divine attribute is Gods <hi>Infinitenesse.</hi> And this the ancient Philosophers thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, <hi>Infinitum est, extra quod nihil est.</hi> Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle and his followers define it otherwise, <hi>Infinitum est, extra quod semper aliquid est.</hi> The first put infinitie in him that comprehendeth all things, <hi>extra quod nihil est;</hi> and this is God, because nothing is without him, as the Poet

For when we have cast our eyes all the world over, yet there is still somewhat with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and this is God. Lastly, Divines shew in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitie from the capacitie of the receiver. Thus that is infinite, which cannot be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended or received of any. Therefore of Athanasius in his Creed God is called <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> 
                     <hi>incomprehensibilis.</hi> Further, God is infinite, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is not compounded of matter and form: for that which is in any matter, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted and determined by its matter: but God, because he made all matter and forms, is beyond all matter and forms; he compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends them, but they cannot comprehend him: he onely therefore is infinite. All greater orbs receive within and under them the lesse: but God, being the first and largest essence, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending all things under him, cannot be received totally of any inferiour: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he must be infinite and incomprehensible.</p>
                  <p>That which hath no bounds nor borders, must be infinite: but Almightie God hath no bounds, because nothing bordereth upon him, and there is nothing above him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine him. He hath no adjacent, no equall, no corrivall: for this cause the Logicians will not entertain him into any Predicament, but put
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:17738:117"/>
him alone by himself in the <hi>Transcendent,</hi> mounting above all things: for though he may be apprehended of his inferiour, yet he cannot be comprehended of his compeer. And this his incomprehensivenesse and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendencie, we shew first in regard of his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing and will; secondly, in regard of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; thirdly, in regard of place; fourthly, in regard of time. In regard of understanding &amp; will, because at one act and instant he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth all things, &amp; at the same act and instant he willeth all things. His understanding never preventeth his will, and his will is never sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent to his understanding; because they have both but one present <hi>esse</hi> incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.

He is <hi>primus motor;</hi> and if he move not, all things lie asleep. In regard of place, he is incomprehensible, for that he is every where and no where. He is every where, where there is a place; and he is no where, where there is no place: and he must be in no place, because no place can contain him. Every where speaks finite, because all places are created: but no where speaks infinite, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:17738:118"/>
it is not created. And though he be no where, yet he is not out of himself; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he himself is infinite. Lastly, in respect of time he is infinite, for that he had no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning; and because he had no beginning, therefore he can have no ending, <hi>à relatis.</hi> He hath neither <hi>terminum à quo,</hi> nor <hi>terminum ad quem:</hi> therefore in time also he is infinite.</p>
                  <p>And this infinitenesse in God, is that which will suffer no man to see him as in himself he is. <hi>No man shall see me, and live,</hi> saith God.<note place="margin">Exod. 33. 20.</note> Therefore when the Saints stood before God, they fell down upon their faces, or else God held his hand before their faces, as he did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to<note place="margin">Vers. 22.</note> Moses. The rest of Gods attributes, his truth, his goodnesse, his mercie, justice, power and providence, we may in some measure en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure: but his infinitie no creature can sustain, because it hath no measure. If we look to the antecedent of Gods eternitie, after the first or second prospect, the raies of our mindes eyes are broken; if we look to the sequent, after our sight is reflected from the heavens, we can see no further: further then the walls we cannot go. If we look but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the image of his infinitie, which is his works and his waies, our eyes begin to da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zle.

                  <p>Lastly, here the plausible description of Trismegistus (affirming God to be <hi>a sphere, whose centre is every where, and whose circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is no where</hi>) holdeth better with a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor of the creatures residence in God, then with any formall veritie or reason of infinitie; because <hi>every where</hi> hath relation to place, which is finite, for that it is created: but in God there is nothing finite. If therefore we will assigne a centre to the infinite, we must ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it beyond every where, because the centre must be proportionate to the circumference: but in God there is no proportion, because he is all infinite: therefore as his circumference is no where, so his centre in proper speech must be no where too.

                  <p>The seventh and last attribute is Gods <hi>Eternitie,</hi> and hath reference to time, which is alwayes flowing and running; and the further it goeth, the more it getteth; and the more it getteth, the more it argueth its want and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencie, in that it needeth: but eternitie, as it can get nothing, so it needeth nothing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it alwayes is, and hath neither antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent nor subsequent, but is one individuall, having no parts, no more then Gods essence: for <hi>to be</hi> is Gods eternitie. Time hath parts, the first, the middle, the last: as it had a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, so it shall have an ending. Therefore time standeth within eternitie as an inferiour orb, and eternitie is the supporter of it, so long as it shall stand. Time is the shadow of eternitie, and eternitie the substance; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore time shall vanish with the shadow, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is following eternitie, as the shadow follows the sunne: but eternitie cannot vanish, because it is a durable substance, yea being it self. Eternitie is one permanent instant, not admitting division: it alwayes was, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not cease to be. But here the question may be made, that if God was ever, before either time or place, where then should God be? The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:17738:119"/>
of Divines is, that before the creation he was in himself. Tertullian saith, <hi>Ante omnia</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Advers. Praxeam.</note> 
                     <hi>Deus erat solus, ipse sibi &amp; mundus, &amp; locus, &amp; omnia: solus autem, quia nihil extrinse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus praeter illum.

                  <p>But to return to Gods eternitie, this must be a life, because it is life that maketh things to last. Therefore Boëtius thus defineth it, <hi>Aeternitas est vitae interminabilis tota simul &amp; perfecta possessio; Eternitie is the possession of an unterminable life whole together.</hi> This life must have no term: for if it should, then God could not be God, because then either the previver or the surviver would carrie it away. If any thing had been before God, then that previver had been God; or if any thing should be after him, then the surviver would inherit. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it follows, that that which is alwayes, must be God, and so his life subject to no term.</p>
                  <p>And this eternitie of God is expressed unto us in holy Scripture two wayes; privatively, and positively. Privatively in Melchizedech Christs figure, who in Heb. 7. 3. is said to
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:17738:120"/>
have <hi>neither beginning of dayes, nor end of life; but is likened to the Sonne of God, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a priest for ever.</hi> This is thus said of him, not <hi>simpliciter &amp; absoluté,</hi> but <hi>respectivé;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was but a figure, and not the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of eternitie. And it is said of him so, for that neither the beginning of his dayes nor the end of his life is in holy Scripture disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered: but this is absolutely and simply true in the Sonne of God, because he was before the day was; he was before the creation, when<note place="margin">Isa. 43. 10</note> there was no distinction of time; and he shall be after the worlds dissolution, when there shall be no more time, according to that of the angel in Apocalyps 10. 6. who <hi>sware by him that liveth for ever, that time should be no more:</hi> for then time shall be turned into eternitie. Therefore he which was before the day and before time, and shall be after the day and after time, he which hath neither begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning nor ending, must needs be eternall. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitively he is in Apocalyps called <hi>Alpha and</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Apoc. 22. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>Omega, the beginning and the ending, the first and the last.</hi> If he be the first, then nothing was before him; and if he be the last, then no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing shall be after him. And from hence it followeth (because it is absolutely spoken) that he is <hi>Principium sine principio, &amp; Finis sine fine,</hi> as the School speaketh.</p>
                  <p>But in 1. Thess. 5. 10. it is said, that <hi>we also shall live together with him:</hi> therefore we also
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:17738:120"/>
shall be eternall. It is answered, that our life is not eternall <hi>absoluté,</hi> but <hi>participativé;</hi> because if we should not live with Christ, we should not live eternally. Again, mans eternitie is but half an eternitie, because it is not <hi>vita intermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabilis.</hi> For though mans life shall have no end by enjoying Christ, yet it had a beginning at its first being.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, where Boëtius saith, that eternall life is <hi>simul tota, the whole together;</hi> this shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that it hath no partition, nor passion, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of youth nor age. And the image of this eternitie is the sphere of the heavens, which hath no fracture in beginning or ending, but is all whole within it self, so that you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not say, Here it begins, or here it ends: from whence ariseth the axiom in Schools, <hi>Spherica figura est perfectissima.</hi> Gods eternitie is not like our lower world: for it hath neither orient nor occident, spring nor autumne, youth nor age; but his life is all of one vigour, his life and durance is <hi>simul tota,</hi> he hath neither <hi>praeteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> nor <hi>futurum,</hi> but his ever-present <hi>esse.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From hence is this comfortable consectarie, that though it be an impossibilitie for any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to adequate God in his eternitie, yet he hath ordained all his sonnes in Christ to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of it by living with him eternally. This is the Christians <hi>summum bonum,</hi> their last rest, their <hi>verum delectabile.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen S. Paul that blessed Apostle had in his former epistle taught the Thessalonians the doctrine of the resurrection, the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our faith and hope in Christ; it may seem, some busie spirits stirred

up by the enemie of mankinde, had gone about to weaken this strong foundation, to the future and finall subversion thereof, by adding false doctrine unto it. Whereas he had taught them the certaintie of our resurrection, they would confine it to a short time. The devil their schoolmaster made this project, that if the Thessalonians might be perswaded of the soon coming of Christ, then when they should be frustrate of their expectation, they might make doubt of their faith, from doubt fall to despair; and so their foundation should by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees be shaken, and in the end turn to nothing. And from hence are to spring the mockers in S. Peters second epistle and third chapter, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Where is the promise of his coming? for since</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Pet. 3. 4.</note> 
               <hi>the fathers died, all things continue alike from the beginning of the creation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now whereas this project of Satan was so fatall to the subversion of our faith; the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Apostle, as in cases of weightiest impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, compoundeth a prayer, mixt with an adjuration, to binde the Thessalonians from this wrong conceit. First, he prayeth them, <hi>We beseech you brethren:</hi> next he adjureth them, <hi>by the coming of our Lord, and by our gathering together unto him.</hi> The first is the period of our expectation, the second the consummation of our happinesse: by both these he beseecheth and adjureth them, that they would not hasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly look for the day of Christ, nor designe to
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:17738:122"/>
themselves the time of his coming, because this was not expedient for them, as he insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in the fifth chapter of his first epistle.<note place="margin">1. Thess. 5. 1.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And to the end they might flee this main inconvenience, first he exhorteth them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancie, <hi>that they would not be shaken in minde, nor troubled,</hi> that is, that they would make no doubt of this doctrine; because he that doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, shaketh in faith; and after shaking comes ruine and falling; and after perturbation of minde follows confusion of minde, which is the subversion of all the senses. Next, he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warns them of three kindes of imposture or cozenage; that is, by <hi>spirit,</hi> by <hi>word,</hi> by <hi>wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</hi> By spirit men cozen, when they father false doctrine upon the spirit; by word, when they feoffe it upon true doctrine; and by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, when they forge a letter, and put another mans name unto it. Now denying the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of impostours by these three, he utterly barres the Thessalonians from admitting this false doctrine, that Christs coming was then at hand. And therefore he adjoyneth this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall to these particulars, <hi>Let no man deceive you</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vers. 3.</note> 
               <hi>by any means.</hi> Though they prophesie in the spirit, though they preach out of the pulpit, though they shew a letter signed as it were with mine own hand; yet beleeve it not, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the like monition, Gal. 1. 8. <hi>Though we, or an angel from heaven, preach unto you o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise then that which we have preached un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, let him be accursed.</hi>

                  <p>The Apostle having bound the Thessalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians from the hasty expectation of Christs coming, now he gives them two infallible antecedents which must go before; so that till these be come, Christ may not come: and when both these are come, then the time which we look for must be at hand; so say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Saviour, <hi>When ye see all these things,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 24. 33.</note> 
                     <hi>know that the kingdome of God is neare, even at the doores.</hi> The first antecedent is the falling away; the second and last is the uncovering of the man of sinne. These two, by reason of congruitie, must go before: for before these two parts be acted, how should Christ come to judgement? <hi>Cuique sua est tempestas,</hi> saith Ecclesiastes; <hi>Every thing must have his time.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eccles. 3. 1.</note> Before Christ can judge the deficient, they must have a time to fall away in; before Christ can crown the constant, they must have a time to be tried in; before Christ can fight with his adversarie, his adversarie must first shew himself, and come into the field: so there must be a world before there can be an end of the world: besides, in generation there is privation ever before form; therefore in the

                  <head>The falling away.</head>
                  <p>Whereas the first antecedent is a falling away, we must enquire what is meant by this. 'Tis not a falling away from the Romane em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, as some have imagined; (for what hath Christ empire to do with the Romane em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire?) but it is a falling away from the faith of the Gospell: it is the greatest defection that can be; because it is a falling from Christ to the breeding of Antichrist. Thus S. Paul ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth himself in 1. Tim. 4. 1. <hi>Now the Spirit speaketh evidently, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith.</hi> He saith <hi>some,</hi> because all shall not. But that this <hi>some</hi> shall be the greatest some, our Saviour sheweth in the Gospel, by an interrogation: <hi>But when the</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luk. 18. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>Sonne of man cometh, shall he finde faith on the earth?</hi> Defection spirituall is like a river; the further it runneth, the greater it groweth: therefore the fittest time for the great Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ is the last time.</p>

               <div type="section">
                  <head>Where the falling away is.</head>
                  <p>Next, the question is, where this aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie is to be found; in what part of the world: whether in the east church, or in the west church. Let us search the new Testament, and see if we can finde any thing for it there. First the Gospel was preached to the Jews, many embraced it at the first, as we reade in the
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:17738:124"/>
Gospel: but now they be all gone from it, looking for a new Messias. Where is the Church of the Corinthians, the Church of the Galatians, the Church of the Ephesians, the Church of the Philippians, the Church of the Colossians, the Church of the Thessalonians, to all which S. Paul wrote? what is become of the twelve tribes, to which Saint James wrote? and whither are gone the seven great Churches of Asia, to whom S. John wrote? All these East Churches founded by the scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, are fallen from Christ, and become Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans and Nestorians. Their falling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way was prophesied by S. John in the 2 of the Revelation. The Church of the Ephesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans was challenged for leaving their first love; and were threatned with the removing of their candlestick, if they did not repent. The Church of Pergamos was challenged for maintaining the doctrine of Balaam, &amp; the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Nicolaitans; and was threatned to be fought against with the sword of Christs mouth. The Church of Thyatira was char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for suffering of Jezebel to deceive the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and was threatned to be cast into a bed of affliction. The Church of Sardis was chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged for being then dead, or at least a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and was threatned to be come upon, as a thief comes, unexpectedly. The Church of the Laodiceans was challenged for that they were neither hot nor cold, but luke-warm;
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:17738:124"/>
and were threatned to be spewed out of Christs mouth. All these with all the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of Africa, as lamentable experience pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, a long time ago are gone, in denying Christ totally, and in receiving of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision the mark of the beast. Therefore here, that is, in these Churches of the east (which at this day are all under the great Turk) this apostasie, of which S. Paul speaketh, of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie must be understood. Thus the Church which rose in the east like the moon in the firmament, is going down in the west, expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Christs coming. Then from this great defection let us acquit Christendome, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be Papists, Protestants, or Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans; because though there be some differences amongst us in ceremonies and expositions (which destroy not) yet still our head Christ by Baptisme standeth upon our bodie, and the substance of the Gospel is entire and whole amongst us, by retaining the articles of the faith, the volume of the new Testament, and the practise thereof by faith and good life. But where Baptisme is removed, there is perfect apostasie, because there the head is cut off from the body: And this is contrarie to the commission of our Saviour, Matth. 28. 19.</p>

                  <p>To proceed in this point, next it is expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to know the authours of this defection, how long it hath continued, and who is the
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:17738:125"/>
upholder of it. For the first, we finde that the first authour was the arch-heretick Arius,<note place="margin">Ariani Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium esse creaturam, Spiritum ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rò sanctum creaturam creatura, hoc est, ab ipso Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio creatum volunt. <hi>Aug. lib. de Haeres.</hi>

                     </gap>, <hi>a fighter with Christ.</hi> The second authour was the heretick Nestorius, who affirmed Christ to be onely man. And he was termed <hi>Ecclesiae incendium, the firebrand of the Church,</hi> as we reade in So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates; and, <hi>officina blasphemiarum, the shop-house of blasphemies,</hi> as we reade in Euagrius. The third and last authour was the false prophet Mahomet, who by the help of Sergius the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian Monk forged his Alcoran, in which as in the sink of heresies is contained the perfection of all apostasie. This falling away began in the reigne of Heradius the Romane Emperour, who lived in the yeare of our Lord 637. And from that time to this the issue of defection hath continued, spreading it self over Asia and Africa, being aided by the great Turk the successour of Mahomet, who daily increaseth the monarchie of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, by captiving of Christians, making them his Basshaws and Janizaries, and by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in of Christian kingdomes, to more then the third part of Europe. And if Christian Kings do not by divine providence combine
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:17738:125"/>
themselves against this beast, 'tis greatly to be feared, that he will lick up all Christian kingdomes, as an ox licketh up the grasse of the field. Polychronicon sheweth, that by<note place="margin">Polychron. lib. 5. cap. 14.</note> the Christians discord this beast was bred of the Hagarenes. And M. Fox in his historie<note place="margin">Act. &amp; Mon. p. 738.</note> of Turks affirmeth, that the first letting in of Turks into Europe, was by dissension of the Princes of Greece. <hi>Discordiâ cuncta ruunt.

                     <hi>of the earth.</hi> And you Christians leave off your divisions, which are the bridge for the Beast and Antichrist to passe over to us. The<note place="margin">Polychron. lib. 3. cap. 3.</note> river Euphrates was a famous defence unto Babylon: but after that king Cyrus had divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it into foure hundred and threescore chanels, the enemie at ease went in at the emptie and drie hollow, and wonne the citie before invincible. And right so, if we Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans shall cut our main current into many small creeks, by dividing our selves into divers sects of religion; there is great likelihood that the Turk will overrunne us all. That speech of some Christians hath alwaies been held of me for profane and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenish, that they had rather live under the Turk, then under the Pope, or the king of Spain. But what is their reason? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause under the Turk they may have the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie of their conscience. And what will their conscience-libertie unbounded bring them to?
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:17738:126"/>
to break open hell gates, to live without faith, without law, to do what they list, to dispute of the Trinitie, and to denie Christs divinitie, as the Transilvanians and Hungarians<note place="margin">Danaeus de haeres. cap. 49.</note> Turkishly and Jewishly have begun. For the passion of Christ, good Christian brethren, let us give over our hostile dissensions. When two of the Hebrews in Egypt fought and quarrelled, what said Moses unto them? <hi>Sirs,</hi>

of the covenant with them, and by a light and oblique dissent provoke them to better life and more refined learning. Have not dissent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fathers and sliding Scholists been alwaies born with in points of religion?</p>
                  <p>To come again to the defection, it is a matter not unneedfull to know, by what means the falling away was first broacht, and then dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perst. And this was by preaching of heresies and false doctrines. Never were so many here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies set on foot, as in the first five hundred yeares after Christ, when preaching was at the most. Then preaching, of its own nature, is indifferent, and may assoon be abused as well used. Therefore the managing of it is not for all men, but onely for such as are of a stayed head, long understanding, and good life. It is for men of age, who are able to digest strong meat, and <hi>through long custome have their wits</hi>

                  </head>
                  <p>Having spoken of the first antecedent, which is the falling away; it followeth to treat of the second, which is the unmasking of the man of sinne, and is imminent to the worlds end. This man of sinne, by generall consent, is the great Antichrist, expressed by his description, in <hi>opposing himself against all that is called God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Vers. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>or that is worshipped:</hi> but Christ is not onely called God, but is the true God, and worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped; and therefore the man that opposeth himself to him totally, must be the Antichrist. But here we must take heed, what manner of Antichrist we mean; because there are many Antichrists, as S. John teacheth in his 1. epist. 2. chap. vers. 18. <hi>Little children, it is the last time, and as ye have heard that Antichrist shall come, even now are there many Antichrists.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These Antichrists were the hereticks of S. Johns time, to whose number we are to refer all the rest which have followed, as also all the persecuting Emperours, from Nero to the Turkish Emperour Achmeth, sending defiance to the renowned Christian king Sigismund of Poland, in the yeare 1612. Christ is two wayes opposed; by heresie, and tyrannie; the one fighting against the body, the other against the soul of Christ in his members. These Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christs
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:17738:128"/>
are the lesser Antichrists, which in certain parts, <hi>&amp; modo quodam,</hi> oppose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to Christ: but the man of sinne, of whom S. Paul speaketh, is the great Antichrist, who is an universall opponent both in heresie and tyrannie to Christ and his whole kingdome.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>Antichrist one man.</head>
                  <p>Next we must enquire, whether this Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ is to be taken for one man, or for a state or kingdome; as some would have the reigne of Popes, some the reigne of Turks to be the Antichrist; and some would make Antichrist a twin, like the image of Janus, which hath two faces, and looks contrarie waies; affirming the Turk to be the elder brother of Antichrist, and the Pope the younger. But to such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits I cannot yeeld.</p>
                  <p>First, by reason of the denomination, which is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and not <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that is, <hi>a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Antichristus est nomen per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonale à per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sona Christi.</note> 
                     <hi>Christ,</hi> and not <hi>a contrary kingdome.</hi> Christ was but one person: therefore his great and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect opposite must be but one person too.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, because my text calleth him <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>that man of sinne, that sonne of perdition,</hi> which Beza translateth, <hi>homo ille sceleratus, filius ille perditionis,</hi> which signifieth <hi>that wicked man, that sonne of perdition;</hi> and not <hi>those wicked men, those sonnes of perdition.</hi> And therefore Antichrist, as he is here described <hi>quoad literam,</hi> must be but one person in the singular number.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="244" facs="tcp:17738:129"/>Thirdly, this is further confirmed by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of Scripture, Joh. 5. 43. where our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour prophesying of Antichrists coming, speaks in the singular number, and in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular: <hi>I am come in my Fathers name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him will ye receive.</hi> Our Redeemer here makes no feigned supposition, but a true one; which shall come to passe, because he is no tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fler, but the God of prophesie and truth. And that here he intendeth Antichrist, it appeareth, because the Jews to this day look for their Messias; and therefore their Messias must be the Antichrist-Messias, for that there can be but one true Messias.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, this appeareth, because Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ shall come in his own name, and not in the name of any God; for that it is said, <hi>Who</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. Thess. 2. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>opposeth himself against all that is called God, or that is worshipped.</hi> And thus it is prophesied of him, Dan. 11. 36. <hi>He shall not regard the God of his fathers, nor regard any God; for he shall magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie himself above all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, from hence also it appeareth, that Antichrist shall be but one person, because our Saviour here opposeth to himself another man in the singular number; and so he opposeth person to person, and not kingdome to king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, or sect to sect. As Christ therefore was one man; so that man of sinne, which is the great Antichrist, must be but one man too: and
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:17738:129"/>
it is evident that the Jews expect but one Christ, and not many Christs.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, S. John, in his first epistle and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond chapter, distinguisheth the great Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ<note place="margin">Vers. 18.</note> from the multitude of Antichrists, by the singular number. <hi>Little children, it is the last time, and as ye have heard that Antichrist shall come, even now there are many Antichrists, whereby we know that it is the last time;</hi> that is to say, the last time is now entring. Where ye see a manifest distinction between <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, between them that were present, and him that was to come.</p>
                  <p>If we should make the Antichrist a state of men, or a reigne of men; then we should confound S. Johns distinction between the Antichrist and the multitude of Antichrists, which are the forerunners of the main Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ. And then we should feigne a huge and Chimerick Antichrist, who with his hands should apprehend the Apostles time, &amp; fasten his feet in the end of the world. Then again we should make S. Paul and S. John to jarre, if the one should affirm him already to be come, and the day of Christ to be instant; and the other at the same time to adjure the Thes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salonians, that by no means they should admit this, but expect the falling away first, and the removing of the Romane empire. And to reconcile S. John with S. Paul about the last<note place="margin">1. Joh. 2. 18. 2. Thess. 2. 2.</note> time and Christs coming, we say that S. John
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:17738:130"/>
intended by the last time the last age of the world, which then was in inchoation, to stirre them up to preparation; and not the last time precisely, because we know there have been a thousand and six hundred yeares since.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, this is proved from Antichrists figure in the 11 and 12 of Daniel, upon which Calvine affirmeth Daniel to speak of Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus Epiphanes according to the letter, and allegorically of Antichrist whose person An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus did present; and so commonly the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers understand. But this Antiochus in the seventh chapter of that book is not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a kingdome or reigne, but one little horn besides the ten horns of the fourth beast, as appeareth in the 8 verse; and one king besides those ten kings which stood up out of the fourth kingdome, as Daniel expoundeth in the 24 verse. This fourth kingdome or fourth beast was the reigne of the Seleucians in Asia, from which the holy nation received many mischiefs; and the little horn was Antiochus, who plagued the Jews above all the rest. From whence ariseth this argument, that if Antiochus the figure of Antichrist was but one man; then Antichrist, which must answer to his figure, must be but one man too. And to this agreeth S. Johns prophesie in Apoc. 13. 17. where a particular name and a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular number is given unto him.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, this is shewed from the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:17738:130"/>
of time. For Antichrist is to reigne but three yeares and a half; as appeareth in Dan. 7. 25. where Antiochus is foretold to reigne over the holy nation, untill <hi>a time, and times, and the dividing of a time,</hi> which is three yeares and a half. And with this consenteth the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie of Antichrists reigne under the Dragon in the 12 of the Revelation; where the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that is, the Church, is said <hi>to be nourished in</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Vers. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>the wildernes, for a time, and times, and half a time.</hi> To this is added the treading down of the holy citie by the same Antichrist for the space of fourty two moneths, and the prophesying of the two witnesses in the same time by the space of <hi>a thousand two hundred and threescore</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Vers. 2, 3.</note> 
                     <hi>dayes,</hi> as it is manifest in the 11 chapter of the same book. All which severall accounts by yeares, moneths, and dayes, make but three yeares and a half, as that most judicious Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther S. Austine most boldly delivereth. And with this further agreeth the prophesie of Christ concerning Antichrists end of dayes (as appeareth by alluding to Daniel, about the abomination of desolation set in the holy place, that is to say, of the sitting of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ in the temple of God, as S. Paul ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth it) <hi>And except those dayes should be</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 24. 22.</note> 
                     <hi>shortened, no flesh should be saved.</hi> But here we see these dayes to be shortened, by the last yeare cut asunder in the midst. And this is more illustrated by reason of congruitie: for
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:17738:131"/>
as Christ preached but three yeares and an half; so it is not meet that Antichrist should preach more, lest he should seem to prevail upon Christ.</p>
                  <p>The testimonies of Fathers confirm this. Irenaeus in the end of his 5. book hath these words, <hi>Antichrist shall reigne three yeares and</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cùm vastave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus hic omnia in hoc mundo, regnans annis tribus &amp; mensibus sex, &amp; sederit in templo Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosolymis, tunc veniet Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus de coelis in nubibus in gloria Patris.</note> 
                     <hi>six moneths; and then shall the Lord come from heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hierome upon the 7 of Daniel hath these, <hi>Tempus annum significat: Tempora, juxta Hebrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci sermonis proprietatem, qui &amp; ipsi dualem nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum habent, duos annos praefigurant: Dimidium autem temporis sex menses, quibus sancti potestati Antichristi permittendi sunt: ut condemnentur Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daei, qui non credentes veritati susceperunt menda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium. A time signifieth a yeare: times, according to the propertie of the Hebrew speech, which hath the duall number, prefigureth two yeares: but half a time six moneths, during which time the saints shall be permitted to the power of Antichrist: that the Jews might be condemned, who beleeving not the truth, have received a lie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>S. Augustine in his 20 book of the citie of God, and 23 chap. saith, <hi>The most cruel reigne</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Antichristi adversus ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiam saevis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simum regnum &amp;c.</note> 
                     <hi>of Antichrist against the Church, that it is to be sustained for a very short time, he that readeth these things, though he be half asleep and half awake, is not suffered to doubt: because A TIME, AND TIMES, AND HALF A TIME, is one yeare, and two yeares, and half a yeare; and</hi>
                     <pb n="249" facs="tcp:17738:131"/>
                     <hi>so three yeares and an half. This also appeareth by the number of dayes afterward put down; and</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dan. 12. 7, 11 Revel. 11. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>sometime in Scripture this is declared by the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of moneths.</hi> From these testimonies it is cleare, that if Antichrist in his reigne shall not exceed this prescribed time, then it is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that he should be more then one man.</p>
                  <p>But against this computation it is objected,<note place="margin">Ob.</note> that the foresaid prophesies of yeares, moneths, and dayes, are to be multiplied and understood according to the prophesie, Ezek. 4. 6. where is said, <hi>I have given thee a day for a yeare.</hi> Then these yeares, moneths, and dayes, will fetch in a long succession of Popes into Antichrists chair.</p>
                  <p>I answer, Then the foresaid Fathers and all<note place="margin">Sol.</note> the rest (for all in this point agree in one) were much overseen in not seeing this prophesie to be so much against them. Next, I answer, This is a particular prophesie, and no generall rule to rule other prophesies, <hi>I have given thee a day for a yeare,</hi> and so I have not done to the rest of my prophets: for if times should be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of yeares, and then every day in the yeare should be multiplied again into so many yeares more as there be dayes in every yeare; then where it is prophesied of Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar,<note place="margin">Dan. 4. 32.</note> that seven times should passe over him in his expulsion from his kingdome, it should fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that he was banished two thousand five hundred and fiftie five yeares; which are more
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:17738:132"/>
yeares then he ever lived by a thousand at the least: and thus the prophesie of his restaurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on should be utterly false.</p>
                  <p>But these times in Daniel must be understood onely of yeares, as Tremellius and Junius note upon Dan. 4. 13. after our division of chapters; but upon the 16, as they begin their chapter. Again in the 11 of Daniel, verse 13, in the text,<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </note> he readeth <hi>exactis illis temporibus, id est, annis,</hi> following the Hebrew original. And thus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain it is noted in our Church-bible in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine of the same chapter and verse, <hi>at the end of times of yeares.</hi> Therefore Revel. 12. 14. du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the great persecution of Antichrist, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the devil the old serpent, the woman,<note place="margin">Irenaeus, Hieron. August. Tremel. Junius, in lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum.</note> that is, the Church, is provided for, but <hi>for a time, and times, and half a time,</hi> that is, but for three yeares and an half, as both ancient and modern interpreters consent.</p>
                  <p>The second prophesie of the durance of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrists reigne is by moneths, Revel. 11. 2. <hi>And the holy citie shall they tread under foot two and fourtie moneths.</hi> This the opponent will not<note place="margin">Ob.</note> understand of bare moneths as the Fathers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, which make but three yeares and an half; but they will alter the propertie, and turn moneths into so many daies as be in four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty two moneths; and then they will turn dayes again into yeares, that is, 1260 dayes, which are in fourty two moneths, into 1260 yeares.</p>
                  <p>Here I would demand of these men, what<note place="margin">Sol.</note>
                     <pb n="251" facs="tcp:17738:132"/>
rule or warrant they have in any part of Gods word, to turn moneths into dayes, and then dayes into yeares. I reade in Levit. 25. 8. where God gave this rule to the Israelites, to number yeares by weeks or sabbaths: <hi>Thou shalt number seven sabbaths of yeares unto thee, and the space of seven sabbaths of yeares will be unto thee nine and fourty yeares.</hi> Now let them in like manner shew where God hath given a rule to number yeares by moneths resolved into dayes, as here we reade of a sabbath of yeares; that so there might be a moneth of yeares too; and then am I confined. Otherwise they make rules out of their own brain, and adde unto Gods word.</p>
                  <p>The third prophesie of the durance of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrists reigne is by dayes, Revel. 11. which dayes are there expressed to be 1260. and these dayes they turn into so many yeares, to serve their own turn.</p>
                  <p>Here again I require their rule. They offer Gods direction to Ezekiel, <hi>I have appointed thee</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ezek. 4. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>each day for a yeare.</hi> I reply, God did not appoint Ezekiel this rule to be a generall rule to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber by; but to lie and sleep upon his left side, and upon his right. For because it had been too long for him to lie and sleep openly for a signe to the Israelites, three hundred and ninety yeares on his left side, and again to lie fourtie yeares on his right, to signifie so many yeares of punishment, according to the yeares of their

sleeping in sinne; because, I say, this had been too long a time (if not impossible) for the Prophet to make this signe; therefore God for his ease appointed him a day for a yeare. And because these dayes were not given to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiel to number by, but to signifie by; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore both Tremellius, and Junius, and our Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva translatours upon the 8 of Daniel and 14 vers. do not take dayes for yeares, as Moulin &amp; others would have us; but for naturall dayes: where when the question was asked how long the vision of taking away of the daily sacrifice, and the desolation and treading down should continue; it was answered, <hi>Unto the evening and morning two thousand and three hundred,</hi> that is, <hi>unto two thousand and three hundred dayes,</hi> as it is in the Church-bible, agreeing to that, Gen. 1. 5 <hi>And the morning and the evening were the first day.</hi> Now if these two thousand and three hundred evenings and mornings, which make two thousand and three hundred dayes, should be taken for two thousand and three hundred yeares, as these men would have it, the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versitie of Divines would cry shame upon it; because it is palpably known that Antiochus, by whom this abomination of desolation was set up, and the holy citie troden under foot, did not live the tenth part of these yeares.<note place="margin">See Psal. 90. 10.</note> Therefore our Geneva note upon this text saith honestly and truly, <hi>that is, untill so many naturall dayes be past, which make six yeares, three</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Again, in the last chapter of Daniel (where is prophesied not of the whole time of tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down of the holy people as before, but onely of the taking away of the daily sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and setting up of the abomination of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation, which was the statue of Jupiter Olympius, as we reade in 2. Mac. 6. 2.) there is put down in the text <hi>a thousand two hundred</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dan. 12. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>and ninety dayes:</hi> this Tremellius and Junius in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret <hi>anni tres, menses septem, &amp; dies quasi tredecim;</hi> that is, <hi>three yeares, seven moneths, and, as it were, thirteen dayes.</hi> But if you shall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the thousand two hundred and ninetie dayes for a thousand two hundred and ninetie yeares; then nothing will fit: and then you must extend the abomination and desolation many hundred yeares after the death of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus; the text in the next verse being against it, saying, <hi>Blessed is he which waiteth and cometh to the thousand three hundred and thirty five dayes,</hi> that is to say, to fourty five dayes after, as Tremellius and Junius interpret; because An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus Epiphanes should then be dead, and then Antiochus Eupator his sonne granted to the Jews full peace and free libertie of their religion, as you may reade in 2. Mac. 11. 22. Which thing was done the same yeare that his father died in.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="254" facs="tcp:17738:134"/>From these two examples out of Daniel, the numbring of dayes for yeares, to crosse the Fathers, and to serve their private desires, is found to be very false; and, that Ezekiels rule was peculiar to himself. And from the last prophesie, to the comfort of Christs people, I observe, that when Antichrist shall come, his time shall not be long, as is before declared by S. Augustine: because under Antiochus the<note place="margin">De Civitate Dei lib. 20. cap. 23. Dan. 12. Apoc. 11. 2.</note> temple was profaned but 1290 dayes; and in the Apocalyps it is prophesied, that under Antichrist the court of the temple and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly citie should be troden under foot but 42 moneths, which are 30 dayes fewer. And here it is worth the observing, how neare An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus time over the Synagogue, Christs time over the Church, and Antichrists time in the end of the world, do conspire in one; all being about three yeares and a half, as Scriptures have expressed, and the learned computed.</p>
                  <p>But against this computation it is objected,<note place="margin">Ob.</note> that if it be admitted to stand so neare to Christs coming to destroy Antichrist, as in 2. Thess. 2. 8. is expressed; then the day of Christs coming to judgement may be known: which in Matth. 24. 36. is denied.</p>
                  <p>I answer, This consequent is not good. First,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> because we have no warrant in Gods word, when this account of yeares, moneths, and dayes is to begin: wherefore the beginning being but conjecturall, the end can be but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecturall
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:17738:134"/>
too; and so nothing certain. Secondly, no Scripture hath revealed that the day of Christs coming shall be tangent to these three yeares and half, as if it were to follow the next day after; because the Gospel hath interjected certain signes and prodigies between Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christs persecution and the end of the world, saying, <hi>And immediately after the tribulation of</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 24. 29, 30.</note> 
                     <hi>those dayes, the sunne shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the starres shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens shall be shaken. And then shall appeare the signe of the Sonne of man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To return to the demonstration of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ one man, this is further proved from the name <hi>Antichrist,</hi> which signifieth an opposite<note place="margin">Adversarius.</note> to Christ. Now a sect or kingdome is not so proper an opposite to Christ, as one person is opposite to another. Should the opposition be in a kingdome or sect, then the Mahometi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call kingdome and the sect of Arius should be the Antichrist; because these principally oppose Christ, in denying him to be God. But the Fathers understand Antichrist of one man opposite to Christ in person and qualities, in whom shall inhabit the devils malice and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture corporally, as in Christ doth inhabit the Godhead corporally. Thus properly shall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son<note place="margin">Col. 2. 9.</note> be opposite to person; one Christ, one Antichrist.</p>

                  <p>These words are the description of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ; in which, as in a table, ye may see his stature, complexion, and portraiture limmed to the life.

He is <hi>that man of sinne, quia totus ex peccato:</hi> He is made of sinne; sinnes are his materials. Other sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners have some good parts in them, though but few: but as there is no goodnesse in the father of sinne, so there is no more in the sonne of sinne; for he is a great masse or mountain of sinne. Him doth Irenaeus thus anatomize in his 5. book and 23 chapter; <hi>Diaboli virtutem suscipiet Antichristus, qui veniet ut impius &amp; injustus, sine lege quasi apostata, iniquus &amp; homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cida quasi latro, diabolicam apostasiam in se re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capitulans, idola seponens, ad suadendum quòd ipse sit Deus; se autem extollens unum idolum.</hi> Again, in his 24 chapter he hath, <hi>Omnis nequitia, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus, &amp; vis apostatica confluit in Antichristum.

                  <p>But here a great question ariseth, Who shall be these two witnesses. Our late Divines say, The ordinarie Ministers of the Church for that time. But the Fathers under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand them to be Enoch and Elias. Though there be no expresse warrant for either of these, yet untill I understand better, I follow the Fathers; because their sense fitteth best with the circumstances of the text, and the description of the persons. And first, because the persons are but two, but the ordinarie
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:17738:139"/>
Ministers are many. And if it be said, that the number of two is put for all the rest; I reply, that this is not agreeing with the scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, which in such cases useth numbers of perfection, or numbers of allusion, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. The number of seven, being a number of perfection, is thus commonly used through this book of the Apocalyps: as, the <hi>seven starres</hi> are put for all the Ministers of Asia, and the <hi>seven lamps</hi> for all the vertues of Gods Spirit, and the number of <hi>twelve thousand</hi> for all them that were sealed of every of the twelve tribes. But the number of two is no such number, and therefore not fit to comprehend a whole. Secondly, for the word <hi>witnesses,</hi> this is fit for<note place="margin">Jude vers. 14, &amp;c.</note> Enoch, in that he rebuked the first world, and testified of Gods coming to judgement against them. And this squareth as just with Elias, in rebuking of sinne and testifying for God; inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as John the Baptist the great reformer, is prophesied to come <hi>in the spirit and power of</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luk. 1. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>Elias.</hi> Thirdly, it is said, that <hi>if any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Apoc. 11. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>and devoureth their enemies.</hi> And so again, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soon as Elias opened his mouth to command<note place="margin">2. King. 1. 10, 12.</note> fire to come down from heaven, the fire fell and devoured two captains with their two fifties. Fourthly, it is said, that <hi>these have</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Apoc. 11. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the dayes of their prophesying:</hi> and this power had Elias, and executed it, as we reade in 1. Kin. 17. 1.
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:17738:139"/>
Fifthly, it is said, that <hi>these two vexed them</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Apoc. 11. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>that dwelt on the earth:</hi> and thus did Elias vex king Ahab, when he said unto him, <hi>Art thou</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. King. 18. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>he that troublest Israel?</hi> and again, when he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked Baals prophets to cut themselves with<note place="margin">Vers. 28.</note> knives and lancers. Sixthly, it is said that their enemie <hi>shall kill them:</hi> and this is fit for E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noch and Elias, because hitherto they have<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 5.</note> not tasted of death, but one day they must die, because the scripture saith, <hi>It is appointed to men</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb. 9. 27.</hi> Vide Tertul. lib. de anima. Translatus est Enoch &amp; Elias, nec mors eorum reperta est, sed dilata. Caeterùm mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituri reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantur, ut Antichristum sanguine suo extinguant.</note> 
                     <hi>that they shall once die.</hi> Their death therefore seemeth to be deferred, to a more famous end, to a congresse with the great Antichrist. Seventhly and lastly, it is said, <hi>They shall ascend up to heaven, and their enemies shall see them:</hi> and so have Enoch and Elias alreadie done; and therefore they know the way to do so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. These two therefore, be they who they may be, may well be called Enoch and Elias; because in their deeds they so resemble them, as if they were themselves. And these reasons I have for the reverend Fathers, whose under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing and judgement I much regard. And I see no reason, why these two may not as well in the end of the world come to this service, as Elias and Moses in Christs time came to him<note place="margin">Matth. 17. 3. Mar. 9. 4. Luk. 9. 30.</note> upon the mount upon the like service; that is, to testifie to his disciples that he was the true Messias, and that he was to suffer death ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Moses law, to make satisfaction for the sinnes of the people: and therefore it
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:17738:140"/>
is said in Luke 9. 31. that <hi>they spake of his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi> Elias before his translation testifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<note place="margin">1. King. 18. 36, 37.</note> for the true God against the false God; after his translation he came again upon earth to testifie for Christ the true Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias: then being thus his approved witnesse, why may he not come once again in the end of the world, to contest with Antichrist and his false prophets? for the true Christ against that false Christ? And if it be objected, that Elias did not in substance come to Christ upon the mount, but as a <hi>spectrum;</hi> to such Calvin upon the place will give this honest and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable answer; <hi>Quanquam res est in utramque partem disputabilis, mihi tamen magis probatur, ipsos verè in eum locum adductos esse. Neque enim absurdum est, quum Deus corpora &amp; animas habeat in sua manu, mortuos ad tempus in vitam ejus arbitrio restitui, dum ità expedit. Tunc au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem Moses &amp; Elias non sibi resurrexerunt, sed ut praestò adessent Christo.</hi> Calvin. Harm. Evang. in loc. <hi>Though the thing be disputable on both parts, yet to me</hi> (saith he) <hi>it seemeth more probable, that they were truely brought into that place. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it absurd, seeing God hath in his hands bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and souls, that at his will the dead should for a time be restored to life, when it is so expedient, &amp;c.</hi> But for this businesse, the coming of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noch and Elias is most expedient, for that it is said of Antichrist, that he shall come <hi>after</hi>

                     <hi>and lying wonders;</hi> and therefore they who are to buckle with him, had need to be more then ordinarie men, such to whom none were like, (as Ecclesiasticus reporteth of Enoch and Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as)<note place="margin">Ecclus 48. 4. &amp; 49. 14.</note> and endued with true miracles. And this is further confirmed by the prophesie of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachi, <hi>Behold, I will send you Elias the prophet,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Malac. 4. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>before the coming of the great and terrible day of the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But this our late Divines turn aside, by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying<note place="margin">Ob.</note> it to John the Baptist, and to Christs first coming, according to that in Matt. 17. 12. <hi>I say unto you, that Elias is already come.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this I reply, that as there are two co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings<note place="margin">Sol.</note> of Christ, a first and a second: so there are also two Eliahs; the true and proper Elias,<note place="margin">John denieth himself to be the proper Elias, John 1. 21.</note> who was the Prophet; and the spirituall Elias, which was John the Baptist, so called because he came in Eliahs spirit. This spirituall Elias, as our Saviour most truely reporteth, came before Christs first coming; and the proper Elias is to come before his second coming. And this, as Jansenius on this point in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel saith, <hi>communiter intelligitur.</hi> Thus are both true, Elias is come, and not come. The spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Elias is come, and hath done his part: but the proper Elias is yet to come, because Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachi saith, <hi>He shall be sent before the great and</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Malac. 4. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>terrible day of the Lord.</hi> Now it is manifest, that Christs first coming was not that great

                     <note place="margin">Isai. 49. 8. 2.

                  <p>Why doth the Apostle applie this let one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Romane empire, seeing there were other and farre higher causes of this dilation, as Gods will of sufferance, and the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of angels? Of the first it is said, Psalme 115. 3. <hi>Our God is in heaven, and he doth what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever</hi>

                     <hi>he will.</hi> And S. Paul, Rom. 9. 19. saith, <hi>Who hath resisted his will?</hi> Of the second we reade in Daniel 10. 13. that the angel who was prince of the kingdome of Persia, withstood that other angel who was prince of the holy nation, untill Michael one of the chief princes came in to his help. To this we say, that where divers causes be concurring to one end, there the naming of one doth not exclude the other: but because our eyes are more conversant in beholding inferiour and nearest causes, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apostle directeth us to this here; and thus onely the Romane empire was the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting cause. One tyrant will not suffer another tyrant to rise, because he would be tyrant still. But one must not alwayes continue; the worlds race requireth this. One generation passeth, and another cometh. When one Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian hath acted his part, he goes off the stage, and another cometh on. Let Christs little flock therefore be of good comfort: for when the whole generation of Antichrist have played their parts, they shall all be taken away in the end: As Moses said to the children of Israel, Exod. 14. 13. <hi>The Egyptians whom ye have seen this day, ye shall never see them again.</hi> And this demonstration is confirmed by S.

but he doth not expresse how long it shall work. Yet certain it is, that after the falling away Antichrist shall come, though it be not known how soon, or how long after.

               <head>The two Beasts.</head>
               <p>These two kingdomes, the Romish and Turkish, are the two beasts that S. John wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth of, Revel. 13. and are to precede the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrists coming. The first beast is the Romane Empire, which rose out of <hi>the sea,</hi> that is to say, from the citie of Rome; because that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous arm of the sea Tybur flows through it.<note place="margin">Vide Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranzam in Concil. Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan. 13.</note> And this beast is described in this monstrous shape, in the form of his bodie to be like a leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:17738:144"/>
for his various government, by Kings, Consuls, Decemvirats, Dictatours, Cesars, &amp;c. in his feet to be like a bear, to lay hold; and in his mouth like to a lion, to devoure and tear. And by this beast was the Church most la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentably rent and torn, during the time of the ten persecutions, as we reade in Ecclesiastical histories.</p>
               <p>The second beast is the Turkish Empire, which is there said to rise out of <hi>the earth,</hi> that is, out of the drie, rockie, and desert land of Arabia, <hi>Regio aquarum inops, &amp; inculta,</hi> as Sturmius saith. Out of this countrey, as histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie<note place="margin">Sturm. Cos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogr. eathol.</note> affordeth, Mahomet sprung up.

                  </gap>, that is to say, a giant, in regard of his mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous and huge dominion spread so farre over the earth. And this beast is compared to a lambe in the frame of the Alcoran, (which praiseth religion, and offers content to every sect, as being patched up of all the pleasures of hereticks) in assoiling the nations that dwelt nigh him, as Ranulphus testifieth, and in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">Polychron. lib. 5.</note> by craft and guile, what he might not do by deeds of arms. But after he had raised his kingdome <hi>by flatteries,</hi> as Antiochus did his;<note place="margin">Dan. 11. 21.</note> then he spake like a dragon, saying, that he was sent of God to compell men to his religion

by the sword; and that they which will not obey his law, must pay tribute, or be put to death: for so be the words of the Alcoran.<note place="margin">Fox in Acts &amp; Monum. <hi>Apoc. 13. 12.</hi>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>And this <hi>beast exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him,</hi> that is, in <hi>speaking great things and blasphemies,</hi> in <hi>making warre with the saints,</hi> and <hi>overcoming them,</hi> and in <hi>having power over all kindreds, tongues, and nations,</hi> as we reade in the fifth and seventh verses of that chapter.

                  </gap>, <hi>before the first beast,</hi> that is, <hi>in his sight,</hi> or <hi>right over against him.</hi> Before the first beast be extinct, he playes the tyrant; for it is a thorn that pricks betimes. But after that his short horns were grown, of a lambe he became a ramme; &amp; then he pushed more strongly, in exercising the power of the first beast, that is, in <hi>speaking of great things and blasphemies,</hi> in <hi>making warre with the saints,</hi> and in <hi>having power over all kindreds, tongues, and nations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The first, of <hi>speaking great things and blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies,</hi> is verified in the letters defiatorie of Achmeth to Sigismund the third, king of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, in the yeare 1612.</p>

                  <hi>the name of Antichrist needfull to be known, out of doubt the holy Ghost would have manifested it: time and experience shall make it manifest to the prudent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now from this demonstration of the two beasts ariseth this argument, That the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ could not rise up under the first beast, he was his onely let: And because there are but two of these beasts, therefore it is left that he must rise up under this last, as Antiochus An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrists figure rose out of one of the foure horns of the goat in the end of that kingdome, Dan. 8. 23. Therefore in the sixteenth of the Apocalyps he is yoked with this beast and the dragon under the title of the false prophet, where is said, <hi>And I saw three unclean spirits</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Apoc. 16. 13, 14.</note> 
                  <hi>come out of the mouth of that dragon, and out of the mouth of that beast, and out of the mouth of that false prophet,—to go unto the kings of the earth, and of the whole world, to gather them to the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell of that great day of God Almighty.</hi> By the <hi>Dragon</hi> is meant the Devil, as S. John inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preteth;<note place="margin">Apoc. 20. 2.</note> by the <hi>Beast</hi> is understood the Turk, which is the second and surviving beast; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause where the first beast ended, there the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond began; therefore it remaineth, that the <hi>false prophet</hi> in the last place should be the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist, that is, that singular man, whose name consisteth of these Greek letters, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and <hi>whose coming,</hi> as S. Paul saith, <hi>shall be after the</hi>

                  <pb n="282" facs="tcp:17738:148"/>
                  <hi>lying wonders:</hi> To these ends: First, to make the people to beleeve in him as the onely God, the Turks as if their Mahomet were returned, and the Jews as though their Messias were come: And secondly, as S. John testifieth, <hi>to gather the world together to the battell of the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Apoc. 16. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>great day of God Almightie,</hi> which shall be at the worlds end.</p>
               <p>Hence it is apparent, that the second beast cannot be the Papacie, as some have inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted. First, because the Papacie rose up, and to this day resideth where the first beast rose up, that is, <hi>out of the sea</hi> at Rome: but the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond<note place="margin">Apoc. 13. 1.</note> beast, as S. John sheweth, rose <hi>out of the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 11.</note> 
                  <hi>earth.</hi> And secondly, because the second beast and the false prophet conspire together: but the Turk and the Pope are enemies one to another. Thirdly, because the blowing of the sixth trumpet, and the pouring out of the sixth vial in Apoc. 9, and 16, (as M. Fox and most interpreters do consent) belong to the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Antichrist, and is properly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of the Turks dominions, as appeareth from the circumstance of the river Euphrates, where the foure angels were loosed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the third part of men, and the river dried up to prepare the way for Antichrists armie. And if the Pope should be the second beast, then we must make the Turk to be the third; because he teareth more then the other: and thus we should have one beast more then S.
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:17738:148"/>
John saw. So that now it lies between the Turk and the Pope who shall have the horns: and let the wiser sort judge. Lastly, if the Pope should be the second beast, or the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ from him, (because all interpreters un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand Antichrist to belong to the second beast, as Doctor Whitakers writeth in his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to Sanders) then he must not arise at Rome, which is the first beasts originall; for that this is found contrary in Revel. 13. and 11 verse being compared with the first verse.</p>
               <p>But there remaineth a stumbling block to<note place="margin">Ob.</note> be removed; which is the misapplying of the prophesie of the whore of Babylon in the 17 of the Revelation. For all there understand the Whore to be Antichrist, in regard of her cup full of abominations and fornications; and the beast upon which she sitteth, to be the citie of Rome, or the governour thereof, by a meto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymie. Verse 3. <hi>I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coloured beast, full of names of blasphemie, which had seven heads, and ten horns.</hi> These seven heads are by S. John expounded to be seven mountains, in verse 9. Now it is confessed on both sides, that this citie consisting of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven mountains is Rome; and therefore the men which would have the Pope to be Antichrist, affirm it, because at this day the Pope sitteth on that seat.</p>
               <p>I answer, Though the Pope at this day sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth<note place="margin">Sol.</note> on that citie which is called <hi>the beast,</hi>
                  <pb n="284" facs="tcp:17738:149"/>
(because the first beast, which was the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring empire of ethnick Rome, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sided) yet the Pope shall not alwayes there sit (except he sit beside his cushen;) because when the great Antichrist shall come, toward the end of the world, aided by the second beast, which is the Mahometicall empire; then shall the Pope be outed, and the second beast and the Whore Antichrist shall come in: where sitting by the space of three yeares and an half, the Beast, the Whore, and the Citie, (for so I finde them conjoyned in this chapter, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king but one bodie) shall be drunken with the bloud of the saints and martyrs, which they shall then shed in abundance: and thus at last the second beast shall sit on the first beasts seat, and so become as it were one beast, as it is in the 8 verse of this 17 chapter, where it is said, <hi>When they shall behold the beast which was, and is not, and yet is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The beast which was, must of necessitie be understood of persecuting Rome, in the time of the primitive Church. That Rome at this day is not the beast, is manifest, because the Pope there now sheddeth no bloud. Yet this first beast at this day is in his successour the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond beast, which is the Mahometicall em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, doing all things that the first beast could, as you may reade in the 13 chapter and 12 verse. Thus the first beast shall be in his <hi>esse,</hi> by the second beast and Antichrist the last of
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:17738:149"/>
that wicked line in the end of the world, and shall sit upon the seven-hilled Rome, abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with blasphemies, spirituall fornications, and bloud, untill the <hi>moon be turned into bloud,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joel 2. 31. Act. 2. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>and the great and terrible day of the Lord be come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that Antichrist when he cometh shall sit at Rome, I prove it first from S. Pauls testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie,<note place="margin">2. Thess. 2. 4.</note> saying that he shall <hi>sit as God in the temple of God.</hi> Where by <hi>the temple of God,</hi> we are not to understand the temple at Jerusalem (as Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine would have us:) for that was to cease with the old law, and was long since demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished by Vespasian and Titus; and when Julian<note place="margin">Heilin Cosm.</note> the apostate would have built it again, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease the Jews, and to lessen the Christians, no sooner were the foundations laid, but an earthquake cast them up again, and fire from heaven consumed the tools of the workmen, with the stones, timber, and other materials; which is a signe that God will not have that temple to be built again. But by <hi>the Temple</hi> we must understand the Temples of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, which are our Churches; because the Apostle wrote this to the Christians at Thes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salonica, and not to the Jews. And thus Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumenius interpreteth S. Paul, saying, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>He doth not say the Temple at Jerusalem; but, the Churches of Christ.</hi> And according to this sense, our Saviour (Matth. 24. 15.) speaking of Antichrists seat, doth not say, <hi>When ye see the</hi>
                  <pb n="286" facs="tcp:17738:150"/>
                  <hi>abomination of desolation stand in the temple at Jerusalem:</hi> but he saith, <hi>stand in the holy place,</hi> that is to say, <hi>in the Church,</hi> which is more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then ever was the temple at Jerusalem, by reason of the time of grace. And this reason also evinceth. For if Antichrist should not have his residence in the Church among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians; what opportunitie could he have to tread under foot the holy citie by the space of fourty two moneths, and to compasse the tents of the saints about, and the beloved citie, which is the Church of Christ prophesied of in the 11 and 20 chapters of the Revelation? Lastly, to this cometh the prophesie of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylla speaking of Antichrist in the 8 book of Oracles, and quoted by Jewel upon the 2 Thess. 2. where she hath these words, <hi>The greatest terrour and furie of his empire, and the greatest wo that he shall work, shall be by the banks of Tybur.</hi> And to this agree the Remenses, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Credibile omnino est, Romae sessurum Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christum:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. in Apoc. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>It is altogether credible, that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ is to sit at Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, this is shewed from the Fathers. S. Hierome, <hi>quaest.</hi> 11. <hi>ad Algas.</hi> saith, <hi>He shall sit in the temple of God, either at Jerusalem, as some think, or in the Church, as we more truely sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</hi> S. Chrysostome upon 2. Thess. 2. <hi>He shall command himself to be worshipped for God, and to be placed in the temple, not onely at Jerusalem, but also in the Churches.</hi> S. Augustine, <hi>de Civit.</hi>
                  <pb n="287" facs="tcp:17738:150"/>
                  <hi>Dei, lib.</hi> 20. <hi>cap.</hi> 11. speaking of Antichrists per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution, saith, <hi>Haec erit novissima persecutio no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vissimo imminente judicio, quam sancta Ecclesia toto terrarum orbe patietur, universa scilicet civitas Christi ab universa diaboli civitate, quantacunque erit utraque super terram. This shall be the last per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution (the last judgement hanging over our heads) which the whole Church shall suffer in all the world, that is to say, the whole citie of Christ from the whole citie of the devil, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to stop the mouth of these testimonies,<note place="margin">Ob.</note> some perhaps may say, that there is no Church at Rome.</p>
               <p>To such will Calvin give answer in his<note place="margin">Sol.</note> fourth book of Inst. chap. 2. sect. 12. <hi>Hinc igitur patet, nos minimè negare, quin sub ejus quo<expan>

As in time past among the Jews, certain peculiar prerogatives remained; so neither do we at this day take from the Papists the steps of the Church, which the Lord would have to remain among them out of that dissipation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here again may some other ask why Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ<note place="margin">Quaest.</note> may not as well make choice of some other Seas in Christendome, as of Rome, and
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:17738:151"/>
namely among the reformed Churches.</p>
               <p>I answer, Of necessitie he must sit at Rome,<note place="margin">Respons.</note> to fulfill the prophesie, Revel. 17. and because this was the seat of the first beast. Reason also will runne with the prophesie; for that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querers will aim at the fairest, as the Turk the second beast hath made choice of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople, as being the principall citie of the East Church.</p>
               <p>The Papist and the Protestant strive about<note place="margin">Bellarm. de Rom. Pont. lib. 3. cap. 13.</note> the seat of Antichrist; the one would have it to be at Rome, the other not. In my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Protestant sets the saddle on the right horse. Wherefore if the Papist will be advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by me; let him yeeld the horse and saddle too, and save the rider. Let him free the Pope, amend his teaching, especially whereby he shed so much Christian bloud, and maintain peace and charitie with his brethren, who dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent not from him in the main; and let the devil and Antichrist take Rome when the time comes. They had it at the first, and they will have it again at the last, sit the holy Father as sure as he can. When the great deluge and overspreading shall come, spoken of by Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel<note place="margin">Dan. 9. 26.

               <head>Whether Antichrist be yet come.</head>
               <p>I answer, No: because the scripture testifieth that he shall come in the end of the world: for when he is come, and hath reigned his three yeares and an half, as is before declared; then our text saith, that Christ shall come to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume him with the spirit of his mouth, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy him with the brightnesse of his coming.</hi> Some understand this of Christs spirit in his preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers by created graces: but this cannot be good; because the Greek hath <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which signifieth <hi>by the appearing of his substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall</hi> or <hi>personall presence.</hi> Secondly, because the preachers of that time shall not kill Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, but be killed, as appeareth in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie of the two witnesses, Revel. 11. 3, 7. And lastly, it is more congruent, and most for Christs honour, that whereas Antichrist is Christs personall opposite, therefore he should be suppressed by Christs personall presence. Again, it was a received thing in the primitive Church, that Antichrists time and the end of the world shall <hi>coincidere, fall in one,</hi> as we
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:17738:152"/>
reade, 1. John 2. 18. <hi>Little children, it is the last time, and as ye have heard that Antichrist shall come, even now there are many Antichrists, whereby we know that it is the last time.</hi> Thus by Antichrists time ye may know the last time, and by the last time ye may know Antichrists time. But here seems a difficultie, in that S. John maketh the last time to be in his dayes. I answer, He speaketh this <hi>inchoativé,</hi> to stirre up his children to watchfulnesse; because then the last day was coming on, and even then there were many Antichrists, the forerunners of the main Antichrist, that man of sinne.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Antichrist cannot be yet come, by reason of the circumstances which holy Writ hath fastned to his time. For in Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christs time <hi>the daily sacrifice shall be taken away, and the abomination of desolation shall be set up</hi> in place of it, as appeareth Dan. 12. 11. and is confirmed by our Saviour, Matth. 24. 15. For the abomination cannot be set up, till the daily sacrifice be removed. So in the figure, after Antiochus had taken away the daily sacrifice from the Temple, he set up in place of it the statue of Jupiter Olympius. And this is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note place="margin">
                     <hi>2. Mac. 6.</hi> Polychron. lib. 3. cap. 35.</note> illustrated by the opposition between Christ and Antichrist. For he that is Christs opposite, cannot endure Christs service before his eyes: but at this day, neither is the daily sacrifice taken away, nor the abomination of desolation set up; for that no land of the
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:17738:153"/>
Christians is yet divasted, nor the temples of Papists or Protestants left desolate: but the Christian world every where offer up their daily liturgies, and the holy Eucharist; Papists by themselves, and Protestants by themselves, without disturbance: and therefore as yet that great Antichrist is not come, who will take this away, and set himself in place of it, as S. Paul teacheth; <hi>so that he doth sit as God in the temple of God;</hi> which is <hi>the abomination:</hi> and this abomination cannot be erected, till Antichrist by his souldiers have made the temples of Christians <hi>desolate.</hi> Therefore Beza translateth, <hi>illam abominationem vastatricem, the abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In Matth. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>making desolate:</hi> and so our Church-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble also translateth in Dan. 12. 11.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I shew this from the description of Antichrist, which is this, <hi>Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped.</hi> But as yet no man hath done thus. Therefore as yet that Antichrist is not come. The assumption is proved from parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of importance. The first beast the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Cesars have acknowledged and adored the multitude of Gods, as Jupiter, Mercurie, Diana, Venus, &amp;c. The second beast the Turk to this day worshippeth a supreme God, as he saith (which is neither the Father, nor the Sonne, nor the holy Ghost) and that with great devotion, as our own countrey travellers report. Lastly, the Pope acknowledgeth the
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:17738:153"/>
Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghost, as is manifest from the Apostles Creed, the Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene, and Athanasian, to this day used of him; and from calling himself Christs vicar, which is to say, his substitute or vicegerent upon earth; and from concluding all his prayers to God the Father, <hi>per Dominum nostrum Jesum Christum, by our Lord Jesus Christ;</hi> and from singing to the holy Trinitie, <hi>Gloria Patri, Fili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>óque, &amp; Spiritui sancto,</hi> that is, <hi>Glorie be to the Father, to the Sonne, and to the holy Ghost.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that the Pope is not to be held for An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist, I prove from S. Johns descriptions, 1. Joh. 2. 22. <hi>Who is a liar, but he that denieth that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus is that Christ? the same is that Antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Sonne.</hi> But the Pope denieth neither of both, as is before declared; and therefore he is not to be held for Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ.</p>
               <p>A second description of Antichrist is in his fourth chapter of the same epistle, in these words, <hi>Every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Vers. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Christ is come in the flesh, is not of God; and this is that spirit of Antichrist.</hi> From whence I thus reason; Whosoever is not of Antichrists spirit, cannot be Antichrist: but the Pope is not of Antichrists spirit: therefore he cannot be An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist. The assumption is proved thus; An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrists spirit will not confesse that Christ is come in the flesh: But the Pope confesseth that Christ is come in the flesh, that he was
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:17738:154"/>
born of the virgin Marie, &amp; suffered death un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Pontius Pilate for the sinnes of the world: Therefore so long as the Pope holdeth this minde, he cannot possibly be the Antichrist.</p>
               <p>But Doctor Whitakers, to crosse these two<note place="margin">Ob.</note> manifest demonstrations of Gods word, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth, that though the Pope denieth not Christ to be come in the flesh, <hi>verbo tenus,</hi> and in the first; yet, that he denieth him in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, that is, by consequent. First, saith he, he denieth him to be the onely King, Priest, and Prophet of his Church; and next, in subjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Christs merits and passion other subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate means, as the use of Sacraments, peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiall sorrow, forgiving of injuries, giving of almes, the abundance of charitie, and all the kindes of good works. From whence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows (as Doctor Whitakers thinketh) that where so many concurrent means are joyned to Christs death and merits, there Christs co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming and suffering in the flesh is in a manner or by consequence denied and diminished.</p>
               <p>I reply, that if we should understand Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christs<note place="margin">Sol.</note> denying of Christ by such consequents and comments of our own brain, then Luther should be the Antichrist; who, in his comment upon the epistle to the Galatians, calleth Christ <hi>a sinner,</hi> yea, <hi>the greatest of all sinners:</hi> by which blasphemie though Christs coming in the flesh is not absolutely denied, yet his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riting in the flesh is absolutely denied, by the
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:17738:154"/>
former way of consequence; because a sinner can make no satisfaction, nor merit any thing. Again, by such sequence, Calvine should be the Antichrist, who absolutely denieth the sufficiencie of Christs bodily death and suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for us, thus writing, <hi>Nihil actum erat, si</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Instit. lib. 2. cap. 16. sect. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>corporeâ tantùm morte defunctus fuisset: Nothing had been done, if Christ had died onely a bodily death.</hi> Again, <hi>Eam mortem pertulit, quae scele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratis ab irato Deo infligitur: He bore that death which is inflicted by the angrie God upon wicked men.</hi> But if Christ were dead in soul, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered hell-torments, such as a damned man should do (which are deprivation of grace, and eternall torments) then he could not have redeemed us, as the worthy Doctor Bilson ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serveth upon this; because he which is dead in soul, can deserve nothing. Yet God forbid I should put the term of <hi>Antichrist</hi> upon these my brethren; because they opposed not Christ <hi>directé,</hi> but <hi>indirectè &amp; obliqué; ex igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantia, &amp; non ex rata malitia:</hi> not <hi>directly,</hi> but <hi>indirectly;</hi> of <hi>ignorance,</hi> and not of <hi>confirmed malice.</hi> In which case they travelled along with the blessed Apostle before his conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he saying of himself, <hi>I was a blasphemer, and</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Tim. 1. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>a persecuter, and an oppressour: but I obtained mercie, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Doctors reasons against the Pope, in that he acknowledgeth other Kings, Priests, and Prophets, beside Christ, and other means
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:17738:155"/>
in the mysterie of mans salvation besides Christs merits, are not worth the answering: because these officers and means are instituted and commanded by Christ himself; the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers for agencie under him, and the means for application of his merits and conformitie to his life, without which Christs merits can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit nothing.</p>
               <p>But laying aside this wringing of scripture in denying Christ, we must understand it of the direct and absolute denying of him in words; because he cannot be a full opposite and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, such an one as S. Paul describeth, <hi>shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself that he is God, and exalting himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped,</hi> but he must denie, extinguish, and disable Christ, as openly and as publickly as he can, that he may be taken for Christ in Christs room. And to effect this, insinuations, half speeches, and oblique inferences will not serve the turn. We blinde judges, children in our non-age, take upon us to judge before our time: and who do not say as we say, though they do better then we do, yet we condemne them as Antichristian, which is as much as <hi>Anathema, Maran-atha,</hi> the greatest of all censures. And wherefore judge we so eagerly? For holding of errours. And are any without them? The Prophet David saith, <hi>Who can understand his</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 19. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>errours? cleanse thou me from secret faults.</hi> Some errours we may bear with, because they dister<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:17738:155"/>
not from the head, no more then a wound or maladie extinguisheth the life of the bodie. Again, errours of ignorance, and not of affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed malice, commonly finde mercie, as S. Paul sheweth, <hi>I was a blasphemer, a persecuter, and an</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Tim. 1. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>oppressour: but I was received to mercie, for I did it ignorantly, in unbelief.</hi> Thus charitie teacheth me to judge: errours of Christians are errours of ignorance, and not of intention or affected malice. For I beleeve, that wittingly and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly neither Papist, Protestant, nor Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran would wrong their Head Christ, whom they daily professe: and therefore let us, bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, pray for one another, and help one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and not envie and hurt one another.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, to return again to argument, None is to be held for the great Antichrist, before the Church (which onely hath power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine of hereticks, and to judge malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours) hath declared him so to be: But the Church hitherto hath neither declared the Pope, nor any other to be the great Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ: Therefore as yet he is to come.</p>
               <p>The major is proved, first, from Christs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, Matth. 18. 17. <hi>Dic Ecclesiae, Tell it to the Church.</hi> From whence it followeth, that if the Pope, or any other have carried themselves so badly, that they have deserved to be denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced <hi>that man of sinne,</hi> we should appeal to the Church, and require her definition, and not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude our selves into publick magistracie,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:17738:156"/>
which is the ruine of States.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this is proved from the instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Synods, and the Apostles practise, Act. 15. 6. <hi>Then the Apostles and Elders came together to look to this matter.</hi> Though Paul and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas being Apostles, had of themselves pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to determine the question then raised; yet they yeelded to go to the Synod, the Church assembled, for example sake, to teach us what we ought to do in like cases.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Moses, Deut. 1. 17. saith, <hi>Judicium Dei est, The judgement is Gods.</hi> With this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent the words of our Saviour concerning Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods, Matth. 18. 20. <hi>Where two or three are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.</hi> Again, Acts 15. 28. it is said, <hi>It seemed good to the holy Ghost, and to us:</hi> But no private men, though they be never so many, have this authoritie of judgement; therefore this is well forbidden in the ancient verses,</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Est verum vitae, doctrinae, justitie<expan>
                        <am>
                           <g ref="char:abque"/>
                        </am>
                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan>:</l>
                  <l>Primum semper habe, duo propter scandala linque:</l>
               </q>
               <q>There is a truth of life, doctrine, and justice: have thou the first, two leave as scandalous.</q>
               <p>Fourthly, in all difficult points the law com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth us to go to the Senate of Priests, and to the Judge for resolution. Deut. 17. 8, 9. <hi>If there arise a matter too hard for thee in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp;c. thou shalt come unto the Priests of the Levites, and unto the Judge that shall be in those</hi>
                  <pb n="299" facs="tcp:17738:156"/>
                  <hi>dayes, and ask; and they shall shew thee the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of judgement.</hi> But to define of Antichrist, is a difficult point: and therefore King James, in his book of Antichrist, would not urge it, pag. 51. <hi>As for the definition of Antichrist, I will not urge so obscure a point as a matter of faith to be necessarily beleeved of all Christians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The minor is manifestly true, because no universall Synod can be found to bring forth such a definition (and it is fit that such an universall enemie should have an universal sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence) neither is there any such declaration to be found in the harmonie of the reformed Churches, printed at Geneva in the yeare 1581. From whence I conclude, that forso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the Church hath not yet detected and determined the Antichrist, therefore as yet he is to come.</p>
               <p>And were there no other argument to free the Pope from being the Antichrist, among the Fathers this is sufficient, for that he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth images. For so jealous is Antichrist of his usurped deitie, that he cannot secure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self of it, so long as he sees them set up. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Irenaeus saith of him, <hi>Idola quidem sepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lib. 5. cap. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>&amp;c. He shall put away idols, to perswade that he is God: but he shall extoll himself the onely Idol.</hi> And Hippolytus saith, <hi>Antichristus ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lolatriam non admittet, Antichrist will not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit idolatrie.</hi> And Cyrillus hath, <hi>Idola odio ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bebit Antichristus, Antichrist shall hate idols.</hi> I
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:17738:157"/>
am not of minde that all images are idols, but onely when they are worshipped for Gods. This is manifest, first from the word <hi>Idolola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tria,</hi> which signifieth the worshipping of idols with <hi>divine worship,</hi> which in Greek, as it is used of Divines, is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Again, this is shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the distich,</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Qui sacros facit ex auro vel marmore vultus,</l>
                  <l>Non facit ille Deos; qui colit, ille facit.</l>
               </q>
               <p>Otherwise our Geneva bible should maintain idolatrie, in picturing Ezekiels vision of God,<note place="margin">Ezek. 1. 5.</note> in the form of an old man. Yet such is An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrists jealousie, that he will be afraid of every shadow. Images, statues, idols, all must down before him; because he will admit no other God, neither in substance, nor in repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Antichrists warres.</head>
               <p>Fourthly and lastly, the great Antichrist is not yet come, because the scriptures which speak of his troubles and foretell of his warres, are not yet fulfilled. In the 12 of Daniel, where the end of the world is prophesied, it is said, that <hi>then there shall be such a time of</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dan. 12. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>trouble, as was not since there began to be a nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on untill that time.</hi> And in the sixth and seventh verses, where question is moved of the time and durance of this trouble, the angell <hi>sware by him that liveth for ever, that it should be for a time, times, and an half,</hi> that is to say, for
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:17738:157"/>
three yeares and an half; and after this it is said in the text, <hi>And when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people,</hi> (that is to say, when Antiochus hath made an end of oppressing the Jews, and Antichrist of tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down the holy citie among the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans) <hi>then all these things shall be finished:</hi> that is to say, then shall be an end of the Jews per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions, and then shall be an end of the Christians oppressions, when the world shall end, and the day of resurrection come.</p>
               <p>With this consenteth the threefold cable of prophesies in S. Johns Revelation. The first of the blowing of the sixth trumpet in the ninth chapter, where the foure angels bound at Euphrates, were loosed <hi>to slay the third part</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Vers. 15, 16.</note> 
                  <hi>of men: And the horsemen of warre were twenty thousand times ten thousand;</hi> which multitude, as M. Fox saith, agreeth best with the Turks<note place="margin">Fox in <hi>Apoc. 9.</hi>
                  </note> armies. The second of pouring out of the sixth viall in the sixteenth chapter, where Euphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes<note place="margin">Vers. 12.</note> is seen to be <hi>dried up, that the way for the kings of the east might be prepared,</hi> that is, that the Scythians or Tartars might joyn with the Beast and the false Prophet in the battell of that great day of God Almightie. And the third of the loosing of Satan in the twentieth chapter, <hi>to gather Gog and Magog together,</hi> (that<note place="margin">Vers. 8.</note> is, the Turks and Tartars, with the people of the foure quarters of the earth) <hi>whose number</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Vers. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>shall be like the sand of the sea,—to compasse the</hi>
                  <pb n="302" facs="tcp:17738:158"/>
                  <hi>camp of the saints about, and the beloved citie,</hi> which is the Church and the Christians. And that this great warre is to be understood of Antichrists warre in the end of the world, it is apparent, both from the testimonie of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters, and specially from the evidence of scriptures, and the effects following. For the interpreters, I will use one for all, which is S. Augustine in the 20 book of the citie of God and 11 chapter: <hi>This shall be the last per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution, when the last judgement shall hang over our heads, which the holy Church through the world shall suffer, that is, the whole citie of Christ from the whole citie of the devil.</hi> For the scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, in the 24 of Matthew we reade, that <hi>immediately after the tribulation of those dayes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Vers. 29.</note> 
                  <hi>the sunne shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the starres shall fall,—and after this the Sonne of man shall come in the clouds with power and great glorie.</hi> In the 10 of the Apocalyps, after the blowing of the sixth trumpet and the warre ended, <hi>the mightie</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Vers. 5, 6, 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Angel</hi> (that is, Christ) <hi>lift up his hand to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and swore, that time should be no more, and that in the dayes of the voice of the seventh</hi> trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet (which S. Paul calleth <hi>the last trumpet,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 15. 5. 1. Thess. 4. 16.</note> and <hi>the trumpet of God) the mysterie of God should be finished.</hi> In the 16. chapter, after the pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring out of the sixth vial and the warre ended, <hi>the seventh angel poured out his into the aire, and</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 16. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>there came a loud voice out of the temple of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>
                  <pb n="303" facs="tcp:17738:158"/>
                  <hi>and from the thrane, saying, It is done. - And</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Vers. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>the isles fled away, and the mountains were not found.</hi> Lastly, in the 20 chapter, after the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering together of Gog and Magog, after they had compassed the camp of the saints, and the beloved citie, after they had had their full pleasure over them; then fire fell down from heaven upon them; the devil, the beast, and the false prophet, were cast into a lake of fire and brimstone, the white throne was set up, the books were opened, and the dead were judged. All these testimonies being testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the last warres, shew them to be An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrists warres; because they jump together with <hi>the abomination of desolation</hi> in Matth. 24. 15. and with S. Johns saying, <hi>Little children,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. John 2. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>it is the last time, and as ye have heard that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist shall come, even now are there many An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrists, whereby we know that it is the last time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hitherto we have seen the intestine and civill warres of Christians: as yet we have not seen the troups of the Ottomans, we have not seen Gog and Magog the Scythian nations; we have<note place="margin">Rev. 20.</note> not seen the kings of the whole world ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together by the three spirits of the dragon, the beast, and the false prophet; we<note place="margin">Rev. 16.</note> have not seen the armie whose number imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tateth<note place="margin">Rev. 20.</note> the sand of the sea; as yet they have not spread the breadth of the earth, as yet they have not compassed the camp of the saints, as
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:17738:159"/>
yet the Beast hath not imprinted his character upon us: but we use our libertie, we buy and sell, great thanks be to our God. Therefore as yet that great Antichrist is not come: but we look for him, to resist him in the faith, and to overcome him with suffering. What if he handle us, as Antiochus handled the mother and the seven brethren? if he kill us in the morning, shall not our souls be crowned with joy in the evening? shall not he for whom we suffer take away the edge of our pains? is not the death of the sword shorter and easier then the death of the bed? and is not the weight of the recompense above all rewards? would not a man runne through a river of bloud to go to a kingdome? oh, this shall be the joyfullest suffering that ever was seen; because our Lord Jesus shall come from heaven in person, to make an end of it, and to crown it. <hi>When ye see</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 21. 28.</note> 
                  <hi>these things begin to come to passe,</hi> (saith our Redeemer) <hi>lift up your heads; for your redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on draweth neare.</hi> And again, <hi>Know that the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi>

For though at first he get the field of us, yet in the end the victorie and triumph shall be ours, when that man of sinne shall be consumed with the spirit of Christs mouth, and destroyed with the brightnesse of his coming; when all his

                  </p>
                  <p>Because Antichrist hath two ends, the one to be honoured as a king, the other to be worshipped as a God: therefore he shall come instructed and furnished with full means, with all power of mans arm, to throw down and to enthrone; and with all signes and lying won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, to prepare faith for him. With the first agrees the type, with the second the antithesis accords. Of the type it is said in Daniel, <hi>The</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dan. 9. 26.</note> 
                     <hi>prince that shall come shall destroy the citie, and the sanctuarie, and the end thereof shall be with a floud, and unto the end of the battel it</hi>

                     <hi>shall be destroyed by desolations.</hi> So when Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ comes, he shall spread the breadth of<note place="margin">Apoc. 20. 9.</note> the earth with his armies, as a floud covers the drie land. For the antithesis, look how Christ wonne the world to his faith by true signes and miracles, so shall Antichrist prevail with the reprobate by his false signes and lying wonders. And as when Christ came, not he onely wrought miracles, but his disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples also did the like; so when Antichrist shall come, his ministers shall work as false mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles as their master. Therefore it is said in Matth. 24. 24. that the false prophets shall shew signes and wonders, as well as the false Christs. Hitherto there have been many false Christs, and many false prophets, as we reade in storie: but the last false Christ, and the last false prophets, which are Antichrists false prophets, shall outgo the rest: for they shall mork miracles, which the former could not do; for they shall <hi>cause fire to come down from heaven in the sight of men,</hi> as it is, Revel. 13. 13. because at that time <hi>Satan shall be loosed,</hi> and<note place="margin">Apoc. 20. 7.</note> they shall have all his power.</p>
                  <p>And these miracles of theirs are said to be <hi>lying wonders,</hi> in respect of all the causes; mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, form, efficient, and end. In respect of the matter, because many of them shall be phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick, deceiving the eye like the tricks of jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers. Such were the rods and serpents of Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raohs<note place="margin">Exod. 7. 11, 12, &amp;c.</note> inchanters, which were devoured of Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:17738:161"/>
rod; because they were but shadows, and his was a substance. In respect of the form, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause though they have a matter, yet they shall not exceed the force of nature. And such are the prodigies of Necromancers, while by the help of the devil they conjoyn naturall causes, to the producing of some strange effect, beyond the ordinary course of nature. And thus they may cause fire to fall down from<note place="margin">Apoc. 13. 13.</note> heaven; for that in the aire there is the element of fire, and the fuell of exhalations for the fire to feed upon. But true miracles have no naturall causes; and therefore they are miracles not onely in the sight of men, but also in the sight of devils and angels. These are compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to God onely, as it is Psal. 72. 18. <hi>Benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus Dominus Deus Israel, qui facit mirabilia so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus: Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, who alone doth wondrous things.</hi> And our Lord Christ saith, Joh. 15. 24. <hi>If I had not done among them the works which no other did, they had not had sinne.</hi> Again, in regard of the efficient they are lying miracles; because the devil the father of lies shall be the principall agent: <hi>whose coming</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. Thess. 2. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>is after the working of Satan.</hi> Therefore the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers affirm, that Antichrist shall be a notable witch, and that the devil shall inhabit him from his conception, or at least from his cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle. Lastly, they shall be <hi>lying signes</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of their end; because they shall tend to shew that Antichrist is God, and the Messias,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:17738:161"/>
which is a Jewish and devilish lie. For as Christ by his true miracles proved his divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; so shall Antichrist by his false miracles la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to do the like: but all in vain, because ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing miracles are but idols, and prove nothing. And for this cause miracles are called <hi>signes,</hi> for that they signifie to the world some strange and wonderfull thing.</p>

                  <p>In the former part of this verse S.

                     <hi>truth, and the life.</hi> Hence is insinuated, that the Jews are here especially meant, because they above all other refused Christ, when they cried, <hi>Not this man, but Barabbas.</hi> And next,<note place="margin">John 18. 40.</note> this is manifest in Acts 13. 46. where S. Paul said thus to the Jews contradicting him and railing on him, <hi>It was necessarie that the word of God should first have been spoken unto you: but seeing ye put it from you, and judge your selves unworthy of everlasting life; lo, we turn to the Gentiles.</hi> These are they which beat away the Lord of the vineyards servants, and killed<note place="margin">Luke 20. 15.</note> his sonne and heir, and cast him out of the
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:17738:163"/>
vineyard. And these are they of whom our Apostle in his second chapter of his former epistle to these Thessalonians saith, <hi>Who both</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Vers. 15, 16.</note> 
                     <hi>killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us: and they please not God, and are contrarie to all men; and forbid us to preach to the Gentiles, that they might be saved, to fulfill their sinnes alwayes.</hi> These therefore are they which had not received the love of the truth in S. Pauls time, and to this day spurn against it, expecting another Christ: and therefore these he here intendeth, because he speaks in the preterperfect tense, &amp; then knew their aversion. And as for the Gentiles, they were then readie and willing to receive Christ; therefore he excepteth the Thessalonians out of their number, in the thirteenth verse of this chapter, saying, <hi>But we ought alwayes to give thanks to God for you, brethren, because that God from the beginning hath chosen you to salvation, through sanctification of the Spirit, and the faith of truth.</hi> But for the Jews which would not receive Christ when he came amongst them, they are without excuse, in that they looked for the Christ; and the Gentiles looked for no Christ. And had their Christ, whom they still look for, come first, and been born of a virgin according to the prophesie; then might they with warrant reject him that should come after, as the Antichrist; for that there can be no Antichrist untill there be first a
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:17738:164"/>
Christ, in regard of the opposition: but Christ is already come, their own nation have preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, and the world have received him; and therefore whosoever shall usurp this name af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, he must of necessitie be either a false Christ, or the Antichrist. From hence by good consequence the Fathers have collected, of what nation or kindred Antichrist shall be when he comes; that is, of the Jews. For as they were the first that rejected Christ; so in all reason they shall be the first that shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Antichrist; because they to this day look for their Christ, and they will admit none but of their own kindred, in regard of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie to this day observed of them in Deut. 18. 15. <hi>The Lord thy God will raise up to thee a Prophet like unto me, from among you, even of thy brethren; unto him shall ye hearken.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as Christ the true Messias was of the Jews; so Antichrist the false Messias shall be of the Jews too: and as Christ came first to the Jews of whom he was expected, and after that adjoyned the Gentiles unto him; so shall Antichrist come first to the Jews of whom he is looked for, and after that he shall gather to him all other nations.</p>
                  <p>And that Antichrist shall be a Jew, it is confirmed from his figure Antiochus, Daniel 11. 21. <hi>And in his place shall stand up a vile per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, to whom they shall not give the honour of the kingdome: but he shall come in peaceably, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>

But it is known that the Jews are a vile kinde of people, disperst like vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonds amongst all nations, having no king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome nor kingly honour, but are subject to the laws of other countreys among whom they dwell: and among us Christians, whom we detest, we call a Jew. Wherefore S. Hierome, upon this place, after he had first applied it to Antiochus, saith thus, <hi>But our men better and</hi>

This is the reason why babes and fools of the world, perceive that which the Scribe and the disputer cannot see. And though they see it, yet without love it is unsavourie to them, they are not the better for it. This S. Paul sheweth in 1.

Such was the working of Pharaohs inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,<note place="margin">Exod. 7.</note> that when he saw them to throw rods out of their hand, and they turned into ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, therefore he would not beleeve Moses and his miracle, though his rod devoured their rods before his eyes. And so strong was the old prophets lie to the man of God, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesied<note place="margin">1. King. 13.</note> against the altar in Bethel, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he would not obey the revealed word of the Lord, therefore the lie prevailed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him to his destruction. So will the devil fat men in a plerophorie of Antichrists false do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, that they shall be so farre from doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, that they will exult and triumph in it. But here may be demanded how God should be cleared from sinne, when he sendeth such strong delusion, which is the cause of sinne. To this I answer, that this is not here spoken of God properly, but tropically: <hi>Mittit non physicé, sed permittendo &amp; deserendo; He sendeth not delusion naturally, but privatively, by way of forsaking and suffering.</hi> For when God upon just desert withdraws his grace from any, then
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:17738:166"/>
he gives the devil leave to go in; and thus Gods forsaking is in place of sending: because God knows, that when he is departed, the strong seducer will not be long absent. And herein is God justified, in that he never forsakes any, untill he be forsaken of them, according to the School-axiom, <hi>Deus non deserit, nisi priùs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seritur.</hi> If the Jews would not have forsaken the true Christ, they should not have been left to the lies of Antichrist. God for his mercy sake grant to us Christians, that we trust not so much to the strength of our own new phansies, that we utterly abolish the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent truth.</p>

                  <p>This is the summe of Antichrists doctrine: it is a sermon, yea a volume of lies: <hi>A capite ad calcem, from the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> head to the heel,</hi> all is but a lie. The Fathers have expressed some parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, as that he should command circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision, the Jews sabbath for our Sunday, the temple at Jerusalem to be reedified, the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial rites to be observed, and that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self is to be worshiped above all gods. Though Antichrists doctrine have many branches, yet all is but a lie. As a tree, though it hath many arms and boughs, yet it is but a tree; and a body, though it hath many members, yet it is but a body: so is Antichrists doctrine
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:17738:166"/>
in all his parts and members but one main and continued lie. Or els there shall be one master<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, which is, that Christ is not Christ; and all his other lies shall be of the familie of this. And in regard of this his false doctrine, he is called <hi>the false prophet</hi> in the 16, 19, and 20 chapters of the Revelation, as Christ is said to be the true Prophet in John 6. 14. <hi>This is of a truth the same Prophet that should come into the world.</hi>

For when the sinnes of Antichrist shall be ripe, when his followers have suckt in all the delights of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousnesse, when they have fatted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the day of slaughter, when they have played their pageants, and are in their full ruffe; then of a sudden, as our Apostle saith to these Thessalonians, <hi>when they shall</hi>

                     <hi>say, Peace and safetie,</hi> the skie shall alter, and the weather shall change, and then the signes and prodigies of the worlds end and Christs coming to judgement shall act their parts.</p>

               <head>The signes and prodigies of the worlds end.</head>
               <p>The first is the rising from death to life of the two witnesses, after they have been dead three dayes and a half, and their ascending up to heaven in the gaze of their enemies, which is a signe of the resurrection, and of their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows following shortly after. Here beginneth Antichrists horrour, as we reade in Revel. 11. In the three dayes space and half, while the witnesses bodies lie dead in the streets and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inhumed, the Antichristians shall make great mirth, and send gifts one to another: but when they shall see them to stand again upon their feet, and after that to go up to heaven; then shall great fear come upon them.</p>
               <p>The second prodigie is the blacknesse of the<note place="margin">Matth. 24. 29. Acts 2. 20. Apoc. 6. 12, 13</note> sunne, the bloudines of the moon, and the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the stars. As in the worlds creation the light was the first dayes work; so in the worlds destruction the light shall be first obscured. And as when the candles are put out, men take their rest; so when sunne and moon shall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct, the righteous shall be translated to the rest of souls. To the wicked the light shall be put out with utter darknesse: but the godly shall go from the light variable, to the light of glorie. These two lights of sunne and moon, shall be to Antichrist and his companie, two glasses to behold themselves in. The glasse of
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:17738:167"/>
the sunne (which represents the Father of lights) by his black darknesse shall reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their consciences the light of Gods coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance removed from them, and the black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse<note place="margin">2. Pet. 2. 4. Jude 13.</note> of darknesse reserved for them in the pit of darknesse. The glasse of the moon (which sembles the Church) by her bloudy colour shall oppose to them the multitude of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an bloud by them shed in their persecution for the space of three yeares and an half. And the falling of starres like mountains of fire dashing before their faces, shall daze them with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable perplexitie, and record unto them their falling from grace.</p>
               <p>The third is the great <hi>Terrae-motus, such an earthquake as was not since men were upon the earth,</hi> as it is in Revel. 16. 18. One saith it shall be so great, that neither man nor beast may stand upon the earth. Shaking goes before ruine, as a signe of falling. Hereupon the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle inferreth, <hi>that the things which are not shaken</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>may remain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fourth is the roaring of the seas and waves, expressed Luk. 21. 25. And to this <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris-motus</hi> he addeth, that the sea shall lift it self fourtie cubits above the height of mountains; insinuating, that now the waters prepare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to claim their ancient right, which they had in the creation; which is to be above the earth, as then it was, till God commanded the contrary for the seat of men and terrene crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:17738:168"/>
And this is confirmed Revel. 6. 14. where is said, <hi>And every mountain and isle moved out of their places.</hi> Which is not so to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, as though they were to leave their si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation; but for that they shall be no more seen, the mountains being demolished to make<note place="margin">Ezek. 38. 20.</note> the orb even, and the waters being drawn over their faces, like a carpet over a table.</p>
               <p>The fifth is the horrour of the aire by fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full voices, thundrings and lightnings, and the fall of hail, <hi>Every stone about the weight of a ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,</hi> expressed Revel. 16. 21. and Ezek. 38. 22. All the elements shall be out of order, presa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging their dissolution, and the fearfull punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which Antichrist must expect, when shortly after the element of fire shall be out<note place="margin">2. Pet. 3. 12.</note> of his place, and flaming all the world over.</p>
               <p>The sixth is the falling of buildings, mentioned Ezek. 38. 20. and Revel. 16. 19. <hi>And every wall shall fall to the ground: Et civitates gentium ceciderunt, And the cities of the nations fell.</hi> When houses and castles fall, then there will be no more dwelling here. Therefore it behoveth all beforehand, to provide for buildings made without hands.</p>
               <p>The seventh is the strange behaviour of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving creatures, intimated Ezek. 38. 20. <hi>The fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of the sea, the fowls of heaven, and the beasts of the field, and all that move and creep upon the earth, shall tremble at my presence.</hi> One inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preteth, that all the sea-beasts shall be gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:17738:168"/>
together above the sea, and shall give a lowing up to heaven. The fowls shall flock together, and sigh and howl one to another. And the beasts shall go lowing to the field; and when they come there, shall refuse to feed, thereby portending their expected end.</p>
               <p>The eighth is the cleaving and rending of rocks and stones, prefigured by the stones rending at Christs death, and demonstrating the hardnesse of Antichristian hearts, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to melt at the death of Christians, when the inanimate and hard stones break in many pieces. And to this end the woods, trees, and herbs also, shall sweat bloud, as Sibylla fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.<note place="margin">Sibyl. Orac. lib. 8.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The ninth is the opening of graves, and the coming forth of bones standing by the graves, rehearsed by one, and foreshewed by the graves opening, and the bodies coming forth at Christs resurrection. For if such demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration was made for the beginning, then the like premonstration is to be looked for in the fulfilling, as a competent consectarie.</p>
               <p>The tenth is the appearing of the signe of the Sonne of man in the firmament, which the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers understand to be the signe of the crosse upon which Christ suffered. S. Augustine saith, <hi>Quid est quod omnes noverunt signum Christi,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tract. in Joann. 118. circa finem.</note> 
                  <hi>nisi crux Christi? Quod signum nisi adhibeatur, sive frontibus credentium, sive ipsi aquae quâ re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generantur, sive sacrificio quo aluntur, nihil eorum</hi>
                  <pb n="324" facs="tcp:17738:169"/>
                  <hi>rite perficitur: What is that which all have known to be the signe of Christ, but the crosse of Christ? which signe unlesse it be applied either to the foreheads of beleevers, or to the water it self where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are regenerated, or to the sacrifice wherewith they are nourished; none of these are rightly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</hi> This the Gospel placeth as the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate<note place="margin">Matth. 24. 30.</note> preceding signe of Christs coming, like the mace or rod born before Kings and Judges when they go to their tribunals, or like the ensigne or standard carried before conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Emperours. For in this our Lord Jesus triumphed over his enemies, as is expressed Coloss. 2. 14, 15. where it is said, that <hi>he nailed to his crosse the hand-writing of ordinances that was against us, and spoiled principalities and powers, triumphing over them in it.</hi> Wherefore upon the sight of this signe it is said, <hi>Then shall all the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 24. 30.</note> 
                  <hi>tribes of the earth mourn:</hi> because then the Jews which put Christ to death upon it, and Antichrist the Arch-Jew, with the whole earth adhering to him, shall see him with his crosse coming to take vengeance upon them. And<note place="margin">Zech. 12. 10. Joh. 19. 37.</note> then shall the saying be fulfilled, <hi>They shall see him whom they have pierced.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These prodigies with others by S. Luke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated, under <hi>the shaking of the powers of heaven,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 21. 26.</note> and the things coming upon the earth, shall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpose themselves between the end of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christs persecution, and Christs coming, and shall so follow on the neck of one another, that
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:17738:169"/>
they shall be heartlesse and witlesse, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what to do by reason of fears and perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, in gazing upon such insolent accidents. For now they shall see the heavens and elements to muster against them, now Christs people<note place="margin">Luk. 21. 28.</note> shall begin to <hi>lift up their heads,</hi> and come creeping out of their holes where they lay hid from Antichrists finding; and now Antichrists<note place="margin">Apoc. 12. 14. Apoc. 6. 15.</note> armie shall seek holes to hide themselves in. Kings, great men, rich men, chief captains, mightie men, bond and free, all shall runne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to caves and dennes, and the clifts of rocks<note place="margin">Isa. 2. 19.</note> and mountains, and cry out unto them to fall upon them, and to hide them from the face of<note place="margin">Apoc. 6. 16.</note> him that cometh against them so terribly.</p>
               <p>Now when all things are thus prepared, when apostasie is at the furthest, when idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie is at the highest, when the man of sinne hath done his worst, when God hath been most opposed, and his little flock most op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, when all things are out of form and order; then shall our Lord Christ come from heaven, to reform all: he shall come in a day and houre unknown, to prevent mens thoughts, to cause continued preparation, and greater admiration: millions of angels shall attend him: he shall come in a shout, to procure asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment; he shall come with the voice of the Archangel and with the trumpet of God, to sound alarm to the troups of his enemies: all creatures shall be moved at his presence, all
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:17738:170"/>
harbour shall be removed, the heavens shall runne together like a scrowl, &amp; a white throne shall be set up. Then shall the dead arise, and Christ shall send his angels to gather the world before him; a separation shall be made; the sheep shall stand on his right hand, and the strong-sented goats on his left: and in the midst of these on his left hand, as remarkable above the rest, shall stand the Beast &amp; Antichrist with all their marked flock, when the high Judge shall say to them all, <hi>Depart from me, ye cursed,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 25. 41.</note> 
                  <hi>into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels.</hi> Then shall the Beast inwardly roar, Antichrist shall bite his tongue for sorrow, and all his followers hanging their heads shall follow him into the lake of fire and brimstone,<note place="margin">Apoc. 20. 10.</note> where they shall be tormented night &amp; day for evermore. On the contrarie, then shall Christs flock have all teares wiped from their eyes, their foreheads shall shine like the sunne in the firmament, they shall enter heaven gates with the King of kings, and there reigne in blisse and rest world without end.</p>
               <closer>Praise, honour, glorie, and power, be unto him<note place="margin">Apoc. 5. 13.</note> that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lambe for evermore.</closer>
