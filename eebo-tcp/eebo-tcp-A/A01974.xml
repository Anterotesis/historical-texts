            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                        <hi>Queſt.</hi> IS it then lawfull to depart from our owne place and habitation in time of Plague?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> Difference is to be made in this caſe betwixt perſons <note place="margin">Who may fly.</note> that are free, and not by any ſpeciall bond of relation tied to others, and ſuch as are ſo bound. As for the former ſort, ſuch as are free, I ſee no juſt reaſon why liberty of eſcaping ſhould be denied to them.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The departure of ſome may be a meanes in an infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous aire to keepe the infection from violence. Much fuell where fire is kindled increaſeth the fervour and violence of the fire. Multitudes of people to an infected place, are as fuell to the fire of peſtilence.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Such by eſcaping provide for their owne ſafety, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out prejudice to others. For what prejudice can it be that ſuch as are not by any particular bond tied to them that tarry, leave them?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The departure of ſome may make much to the benefit and advantage of ſuch as tarry. For they have the better op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of ſending ſuccour to them. This was one reaſon why the people would not have <hi>David</hi> go into the field, that he might <note n="b" place="margin">2 Sam. 18. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>ſuccour them out of the City.</hi>

                     <p n="4">4. <note n="c" place="margin">Mat. 10. 23.</note> It is permitted to ſuch in time of <hi>perſecution</hi> to fly: yea and <note n="d" place="margin">Mat. 24. 16. <hi>Fugit populus Hebraeorum, ut fides ejus &amp; vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta inter fluctus, ſibi apperiret vi am.</hi> Ambr. de fug ſeculi.</note> in time of <hi>warre:</hi> why not then in time of Plague?</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <hi>Ob.</hi> 1. The Plague is an immediate ſtroke of God; wherby ſuch as he hath appointed to death are ſtricken. It is not infectious.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> I grant it to be an extraordinary diſeaſe, but not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate. The kind of diſeaſe, and the effects thereof on mans body, do ſhew that its no more immediate then many other diſeaſes. If becauſe ſuch as are appointed to death are ſtrucken with it, meanes of eſcaping it might not be uſed: no meanes for avoiding any judgement might be uſed. For the infection of it, let experience determine that caſe.</p>

                     <p n="2">
                        <hi>Ob.</hi> 2. It is a fruit of faithleſneſſe to ſhun the Plague.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> No more then to ſhun other dangers: Men may indeed upon diſtruſt fly: but that ſhewes the frailty of the perſon, not the unlawfulneſſe of the action.</p>

                        <hi>Ob.</hi> 3. If ſome fly, all may fly. So the ſicke be left with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuccour.</p>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Some are more bound to venture the hazard then others. As Magiſtrates for keeping good order: Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters for feeding the ſoule. Neare of kindred for looking to their bodies. Such as are under command, as children and ſervants.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Others are not ſo ſubject to infection: as aged.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Others are not of ſuch uſe, but may better be ſpared: as the poorer and meaner ſort. The people would ſay to <hi>David, thou art worth</hi> 10000 <hi>of us.</hi>

                     <p>SVrely they do more incenſe then appeaſe God, who to the heape of their other ſinnes adde this high pitch of preſumption, <hi>Interceſſion of men or Angels.</hi> Can mans in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented incenſe, offered up with ſtrange fire, pacifie Gods wrath? For, interceſſion of men and Angels is a meere hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane invention: never could any Papiſt give any good proofe for it out of Gods Word: nor ever hereafter can any do it. That which is not in Gods Word cannot be drawne out of it. This is ſuch <hi>ſtrange fire,</hi> as will devoure them that uſe it: even as <note n="a" place="margin">Lev. 10. 1, 2.</note> 
                        <hi>The fire that went out from the Lord devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Nadab and Abihu:</hi> and as <note n="b" place="margin">Numb. 16. 35.</note> that which <hi>conſumed the two hundred and fifty men that</hi> (being of the conſpiracy of <hi>Korah) offered incenſe:</hi> incenſe that much incenſed the fire of Gods wrath. To reaſon the caſe a little with our adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries; Why do they not content themſelves with that pure, and ſweet incenſe that Chriſt our great Prieſt offereth up? Is it not ſufficient? Need any thing, can any thing be added to the dignity and efficacy of that which Chriſt doth? Can man or Angell do any thing more then God-man? Are any more beloved of the Father then he?</p>
                     <p>But they pretend humility forſooth. Sinfull men are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to go to ſo worthy a Mediatour as the Sonne of God. Therefore they have the <hi>Spirits of just men made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in heaven,</hi> and the holy Angels to be their Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atours.</p>

2. Though Angels and Saints in heaven be more perfect then men on earth, yet are they not worthy of ſuch an office, as to be <hi>Mediators &amp; Interceſſors</hi> to God for others. Or this office of <hi>Interceſſion</hi> is too much vilified, or celeſtiall crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures too much dignified and deified by accounting them <hi>Interceſſours</hi> in relation to God.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Chriſt himſelfe is deprived of one of his prime functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and honours, by aſcribing it to others: or at leaſt he hath co-partners, and aſſiſtants joyned with him. Which to do is intollerable preſumption.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The love of Chriſt to man is thereby exceedingly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached. For he was made <hi>like to his brethren, that he might be a mercifull and faithfull High-Prieſt in things pertaining to</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Hebr 2. 17.</note> 
                        <hi>God,</hi> &amp;c. This end of his taking our nature on him, is fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated, if we need other Mediatours to him. To what end is he made man, if there need other Mediatours to preſent us to him? Wherein appeares he to be ſo mercifull, if of our ſelves we may not have acceſſe to him, who was made as our ſelves, <hi>a Sonne of man?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The excellency, neceſſity, ſufficiency, and commodity of <note place="margin">Well uſe, and truſt to Chriſts interceſſion.</note> Chriſts interceſſion being by the Goſpell evidently revealed unto us, it becommeth us to take ſuch notice thereof, and to be ſo inſtructed therein, as we may in all our needs wiſely uſe it, and confidently truſt to it.</p>
                     <p>They wiſely uſe it, that on all occaſions, when they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to God, have the eye of their ſoule fixed on Chriſt abiding in heaven at Gods right hand, and making interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, &amp; thorow his mediation and interceſſion preſent their perſons, their prayers, and all their holy ſervices to God the Father. Eſpecially when Gods wrath is provoked, and any ſignes thereof begin to manifeſt themſelves, then to humble their ſoules at the throne of grace: then thorow the interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Chriſt to crave mercy and pardon. That forme wherwith the Church uſeth to conclude her prayers <hi>(thorow Ieſus Chriſt our Lord)</hi> is a worthy form, and pertinent to the point in hand. In uſing the words, our heart ought to be lift up unto Chriſt, and ſet on him ſitting on Gods right hand.
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:3436:40"/>
Yea, though ſuch words be not alwayes expreſſed, yet every petition made to God, every thanks offered to him, every thing wherein we have to do with God, muſt in mind and heart be intended thorow the mediation and interceſſion of Chriſt. We read of <hi>incenſe offered with the prayers of Saints, the ſmoke whereof aſcended before God.</hi> This incenſe is the <note place="margin">Rev. 8. 3, 4.</note> interceſſion of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>They truſt to his interceſſion, who uſe no others but his, and in the uſe of his, reſt confidently that they ſhalbe accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Thus may we, thus muſt we do. We may do it, becauſe what ſoever is in us to diſcourage us, or any way to make us doubt of acceptance, is ſo abundantly ſupplied in Chriſt, as all matter of doubt and feare is thereby taken away. We muſt do it for the honour of Chriſt, for the comfort of our owne ſoules. Chriſt is much honoured by the ſtedfaſt faith of his Saints, Thereby the dignity of his perſon, the merit of his ſacrifice, the favour of his Father, the efficacy of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion, and other his Divine excellencies are acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged. The ſoule of him that in faith expecteth thorow Chriſt acceptation, cannot but be much comforted. This was it that much encouraged, and comforted <hi>Stephen,</hi> even then when his malicious enemies <hi>gnaſhed on him with their</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Act. 7. 54, 55.</note> 
                        <hi>teeth,</hi> that <hi>he ſaw Ieſus ſtanding on the right hand of God.</hi> That of <hi>Stephen</hi> was extraordinary. For the heavens were actually, really opened, and Chriſt in that body, wherein he was ſeene on earth, and wherewith he aſcended into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, appeared unto him, being in the higheſt heaven. <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phens</hi> ſight was alſo extraordinarily quickned, and enabled diſtinctly to perceive and diſcerne a viſible object ſo far off. Such an extraordinary bodily ſight of Chriſt is not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected of us. Yet as truly, and to as great comfort of ſoule may we with the ſpirituall eye of the ſoule, the eye of faith, ſee Chriſt ſitting in heaven for us: as it is ſaid of <hi>Moſes, By faith he endured, as ſeeing him who is inviſible.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 27.</note> Thus to eye Chriſt with his incenſe, his interceſſion before God, in dangers and diſtreſſes, in feares and perplexities, while we live, when we are giving up the ghoſt, can not
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:3436:40"/>
but bring unſpeakeable comfort to the ſoule.</p>

                     <p>THat it may appeare what juſt cauſe the Lord hath to powre out the vials of his wrath among us, it wilbe a ſeaſonable taske to take a view of our owne times, and to obſerve whether the forenamed ſinnes may be found among us. For too too truly it may now be ſaid of this Land, of this City, <hi>There is wrath gone out from the Lord, the Plague is begun.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In proſecuting this taske I will follow the order before <note place="margin">Sinnes provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Gods anger riſe among us. As, 1.

                     <p n="1">1. For idolatry, though the bright light of the Goſpell hath for <note n="*" place="margin">Since the 17 of Nov. 1558.</note> many yeares diſpelled the thicke cloud of Popery, a deteſtable idolatry: yet in many places that cloud gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, and thickneth againe.

Too many ſeducers are among us: too great countenance is given to them.

Thus a plague may be ſent in wrath againſt a ſociety, and yet therein Gods love be manifeſted to his Saints, either in preſerving them from it, or taking them by it to heaven. In relation to ſuch perſons we may truly ſay, that whether God ſend famine, or war, or any other trouble, he doth it of his goodneſſe and love.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. A judgement may at firſt be in wrath inflicted: and yet upon the ſenſe of the ſmart thereof people may be ſo humbled, and brought to ſuch repentance, as the nature of that judgement be altered, and prove to be an evidence of Gods love. Yea ſuch reformation may be wrought thereby, as that calamity (though generall and extraordinary) prove very profitable, and an evidence of Gods fatherly care over ſuch a people whom he hath ſo purged. <note n="e" place="margin">2 Chro. 33. 11, &amp;c.</note> Inſtance that fearefull judgement that was laid on <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Manaſſehs</hi>  time. This latter fruit of Gods love maketh not againſt the former evidence of his wrath. For on ſuch occaſions God is ſaid to repent him of the evill which he hath ſent. He was angry: but his anger is turned into favour.</p>
                     <p>The concluſion then remaineth true, that a plague (as firſt ſent to a people) is an evidence of Gods wrath.</p>

                     <p>A Plague being an effect of Gods wrath, for ſtaying the plague meanes for pacifying Gods wrath muſt be uſed. So did <hi>David.</hi> He humbled himſelfe, confeſſed his ſinne, and that with a penitent heart, and offered ſacrifice to God. Apply to this judgement of a plague the directions <note n="a" place="margin">§ 4, 5, 6, 10.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore given. And becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> giveth here a direction when this plague <hi>begun,</hi> be carefull betimes, even at the beginning of a plague to ſeeke to aſſwage Gods anger. Hereof alſo <note n="b" place="margin">§ 30.</note> before. And that ye may be the more conſcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable herein, know that plagues come not by chance, come not by any ordinary courſe and meanes. They come from Gods wrath. Let the directions therefore before given for pacifying Gods wrath be rather obſerved, then any phyſicall directions. I denie not but that they are lawfull, needfull, uſefull. But this which I ſpeake of, is more law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, needfull, and uſefull. All other without this is nothing at all. In all diſeaſes Gods helpe is eſpecially to be ſought. It was <hi>Aſa</hi> his fault, that <note n="c" place="margin">2 Chro. 16. 12</note> 
                        <hi>In his diſeaſe he ſought not to the Lord, but to the Phyſitians.</hi> If in all diſeaſes, moſt of all in this that is ſuch an immediate effect of Gods wrath, <hi>The Lord is to be ſought unto.</hi> And ſo much the rather, becauſe the plague (among other evidences of Gods wrath) is a moſt fearefull one, as <note n="*" place="margin">§. 71. 72.</note> hereafter is ſhewed.</p>

                        <hi>GOD can make the beginning of a judgement ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible.</hi> I denie not but that the Lord doth oft times begin very mildly and gently: as he dealt with the Iſraelites in the wilderneſſe, bringing them <note n="a" place="margin">Exo 15. 23.</note> to <hi>bitter wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> making them to feele <note n="b" place="margin">—16. 3.</note> the want of <hi>bread,</hi> and <note n="c" place="margin">—17. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>water,</hi> (not ſtarving them) and <note n="d" place="margin">Deut. 25. 18.</note> ſuffering <hi>Amalek to ſmite the hindmoſt of them:</hi> to try if they would learne to cleave cloſe vnto the Lord. But afterwards his ſtroaks were more heavy upon them. Yet he can, and oft doth make the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his judgements very terrible. At the firſt raiſing of the floud to drowne the world, <note n="e" place="margin">Gen. 7. 11.</note> 
                        <hi>All the fountaines of the great deepe were broken up, and the windowes of heaven.</hi> Was it not a terrible ſight to behold the waters fall downe from heaven, and riſe up out of the earth ſo faſt as they did? Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately upon the <note n="f" place="margin">Gen. 19. 23, 24.</note> 
                        <hi>Sunnes riſing on the earth, the Lord rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned upon Sodom and Gomorrah brimſtone and fire from the Lord out of heaven.</hi> How fearefull a ſpectacle was that even at the firſt ſight thereof. The <hi>Egyptian</hi> plagues give alſo evidence hereof. So doth the drowning of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his hoſte in the red ſea. For while they confidently purſued the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> ſuppoſing to get over as ſafe as the <note n="g" place="margin">Exo. 14. 24, 25</note> 
                        <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did, on a ſudden <hi>The hoſte of the Egyptians was troubled, and their chariot wheeles taken off.</hi> In a word, ſtormes ſo aroſe, and waters ſo fell upon them, as they were all ſoone drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Such were many of Gods judgements in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Such <note n="h" place="margin">2 King. 19. 35</note> the deſtruction of the <hi>Campe of the Aſſyrians:</hi> Such <note n="i" place="margin">Luke 13. 1, 4</note> their death <hi>Whoſe bloud Pilate mingled with their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices,</hi> and theirs <hi>on whom the tower of Siloe fell:</hi> and <note n="k" place="margin">Act. 12. 23.</note> 
                        <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rods;</hi> and many other like judgements.</p>
                     <p>Gods almighty power makes his judgements to be very terrible. His infinite wiſdome makes him know when it is fit, at the firſt, and in the beginning, to manifeſt his terrour: anſwerably he doth ſo. For in wiſdome he ordereth all his
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:3436:53"/>
actions: and that ſo as may moſt make to the glory of his name. Herein <note n="l" place="margin">Eph. 3. 10.</note> his <hi>wiſdome</hi> is manifeſted to be <hi>manifold,</hi> in that he can ſometimes by degrees encreaſing his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſometimes by powring them out at once bring greateſt glory to his name. For by the former kinde of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding with men, he giveth evidence of his patience and long-ſuffering, in that though he be provoked to powre out the vials of his anger, yet he is ſlow to wrath, and would not that men ſhould periſh in his anger, but rather by the beginning of it, be brought to repentance. By the latter kinde, he giveth inſtance of his terrour when he hath to do with obdurate, and obſtinate ſinners.</p>
                     <p>Having to do with ſuch a God, as can make even the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his judgement ſo terrible, how watchfull ought we to be, that we provoke him not at once to powre out the vials of his wrath againſt us? This ſeverity is uſually execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted after contempt of milder proceedings (as hath been <note n="*" place="margin">§. 22.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore proved) or upon the committing of <hi>grievous ſinnes</hi> that cry up to heaven for vengeance, as the ſins of <note n="m" place="margin">Gen. 18. 20.</note>

                        <hi>the famine, and BY the peſtilence.</hi> Others therefore thus tranſlate this text, <hi>Of the plague,</hi> that is, by it. The plague was the inſtrumentall cauſe of their death. Circumſtances ſhew that this plague from the firſt beginning to the end of it continued not a whole day. For ſo ſoone as the people gathered themſelves together againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> the Lord threatned to conſume them. Then inſtantly <hi>Moſes and Aaron</hi> fell on their faces: and <hi>Moſes</hi> then diſcerned that the plague was begun: which ſo ſoone as hee eſpied, he bad <hi>Aaron</hi> quickely offer up incenſe. <hi>Aaron</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly ranne for incenſe, brought it, offered it up: and the plague was ſtayed. Theſe circumſtances duely weighed, who can imagine that there was more then a day from the beginning to the end of this plague: ſo as in the ſpace of a few houres, foureteene thouſand and ſeven hundred died together of a plague. O terrible ſtroake!</p>
                     <p>To aggravate the terrour hereof, mention is made of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fearefull judgement, which fell upon that people not long before, thus inferred, <hi>Beſide them that died about the matter of Korah.</hi> What this matter was, the former part of this chapter expreſly recordeth. It was a conſpiracy of <hi>Ko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah,</hi> here mentioned, with <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> againſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> the chiefe Prince; and <hi>Aaron,</hi> the chiefe Prieſt, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by God over the children of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> 
                        <note n="b" place="margin">Exo. 6. 18.</note> This <hi>Korah</hi> was coſen german to <hi>Aaron:</hi> for they were brothers chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. He therefore being of an ambitious ſpirit, ſcorned that his kinſeman ſhould bee ſo farre preferred before him, as to bee High-Prieſt: Thereupon hee gathers many of the Princes together to take part with him: ſuppoſing by ſtrong hand to wreſt from <hi>Aaron</hi> the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Prieſt-hood, which the Lord had conferred upon them. <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> were of another Tribe, the tribe of <hi>Reuben.</hi> Theſe, as is probable, had ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aime, and that at the chiefe civill government, wherein God had ſet <hi>Moſes. Reuben</hi> being the eldeſt ſonne of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> theſe two brothers were <note n="d" place="margin">

                        <hi>under nephewes</hi> to <hi>Reuben,</hi> three generations from him: and imagined that they comming
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:3436:65"/>
from the eldeſt ſonne ſhould be the chiefe overall. Thus having no regard to the choice which God had made of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> they would thruſt themſelves into places of eminency. The Lord was ſo highly diſpleaſed hereat, as he deſtroyed them, and ſuch as tooke part with them, with two fearefull judgements. The earth ſuddenly opened and ſwallowed up ſome of them alive: and fire ſuddenly flamed out upon others and deſtroyed them. <note n="e" place="margin">Numb. 16. 35.</note> 
                        <hi>Two hundred and fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> are expreſly noted to be conſumed by the fire. How many were ſwallowed up by the earth is not expreſſed: but it may be conjectured that they were a great multitude.</p>
                     <p>This was the matter of <hi>Korah</hi> here mentioned. <hi>Korah</hi> was the Ring-leader of all. For <note n="f" place="margin">Numb. 16. 1.</note> he is the firſt mentioned in the conſpiracy. <note n="g" place="margin">—5.</note> He impudently gathered an head againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> while <note n="h" place="margin">—12.</note> 
                        <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> abode in their tents. <note n="i" place="margin">Numb. 26. 9.</note> It is ſaid of <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> that they ſtrove againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> in the conſpiracy of <hi>Korah.</hi> So as the conſpiracy was <hi>Korahs</hi> eſpecially. He was the chiefe conſpirator. The <hi>matter</hi> therefore here intended com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſeth under it, both the earths ſwallowing up of ſome, and the fires conſuming of others.</p>
                     <p>The people that by the earths opening, and fires breaking out periſhed, are ſaid to <hi>die in the matter of Korah,</hi> becauſe his ambition being the firſt motive of that rebellion, he was a cauſe of their ſinne, and ſo of their judgement. Thus their death is imputed to him. They died in his buſineſſe, <hi>about his matter.</hi>

On ſome it commeth more mildly, and taketh them away without any paine, or extraordinary fervour: on others it falleth more violently, caſting them into extreme burning fits, troubling the braine, diſturbing the underſtanding, making them that are affected therewith, rage and rave, and ſeeke all wayes to make away themſelves. Lamentable experience hath given too evident

                     <p>For the maine point, it ſtands with juſtice and equity, that they who do not onely ſinne themſelves, but alſo draw others into ſinne with them, ſhould beare the puniſhment of their owne and others ſinnes. For in thoſe others he ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth. They are as his inſtruments.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Ratefulneſſe makes inquiſitive. A greatefull mind, both in relation to God, and alſo in relation to man, is ſo affected with kindneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes received from the one or the other, as it is ever plotting and enquiring what it may do, what it may render. In relation to God ſaith a gratefull Prophet, <hi>what ſhall I render unto the Lord for all his benefits towards me? Pſal.</hi> 116. 12. In relation to man ſaith a gratefull King, <hi>Is there yet any left of the houſe of Saul, that I may ſhew him kindneſſe for Ionathans ſake?</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9. 1. Let me ſay it boldly, for I ſay it truly. My ſoule is inquiſitive: as in regard of God, what I may render unto him: ſo in regard of your ſelfe, Good M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi>. Moore, what I may render unto
<pb facs="tcp:3436:74"/>
you. God knowes my minde and heart. For he is the <hi>Searcher of hearts, (Ier.</hi> 17. 10.) To you it muſt be made knowne. <hi>For what man knoweth the things of a man ſave the ſpirit of man which is in him?</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 11. My heart therefore being filled with gratefulneſſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you, I haue caſt this way and that way how to manifeſt the ſame: and that in the beſt manner that I could: which I know not better how to do, then by a publique acknowledgement of the gratefull reſpect I beare, and bounden duty which I owe to you: toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the true and juſt grounds thereof: which, among many other, are theſe in particular.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Your ancient and conſtant reſpect to me and my Miniſtry, even from the firſt beginning thereof. For thereby you firſt tooke notice of me.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The many reall demonſtrations, and evident te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of that entire reſpect, which from time to time you have given me.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Your vouchſafing to take my daughter into your houſe, under your good government, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a mother to the motherleſſe. Among many other, this is one thing which gives me occaſion to ſay in regard of my laſt dangerous ſickneſſe, <hi>It is good for me that I was afflicted.</hi> That ſickneſſe was an occaſion of your taking my daughter to your tuition. What is, what ought to be a fathers care, but (next to the ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his owne ſoule) the good education of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren? What can be more acceptable to him, then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved means tending to that end? May I then, can I then be unmindfull of her, or ungratefull to her that hath affoorded ſuch means? Have I not cauſe to be inquiſitive, and to thinke and ſay, <hi>What ſhall I render?</hi> Render a recompence I cannot. All that is or can be
<pb facs="tcp:3436:74"/>
done, is and can be but a teſtimony of gratitude. Such teſtimonies as are ordinarily preſented for new-yeares-gifts, your bounty (I know) doth not expect, will not accept. Noble ſpirits do herein reſemble the Divine Spirit, which doth good for his owne ſake, for goodnes ſake. All the recompence which they expect is a grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full acknowledgement of the kindneſſe they ſhew, of the goodnes they do. This from my heart I do here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all that ſhall caſt their eyes upon this Dedicatory Epiſtle.</p>
                  <p>There are, beſide theſe particular, other more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall motives, which induce me to prefixe your worthy name before this treatiſe: As, 1. the eminency of your endowments, which make this ſtile M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi>. <hi>Mary Moore</hi> (at leaſt in their judgement who well know you) more eminent, then ſuch titles of honour as are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon many of your ſex. 2. The excellency of your parts, which enable you with judgement to read ſuch treatiſes as are publiſhed to the view of all. 3. The correſpondency of your diſpoſition to the moſt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall points of this treatiſe. This treatiſe is of famine, and of means to remove it, or reſtraine it, and keep it from exceſſe. <hi>Piety</hi> towards him that cauſeth plenty and ſcarcity: <hi>Prudence</hi> in well ordering preſent abundance: <hi>Providence</hi> for the future: <hi>Compaſsion</hi> in times of want: <hi>Liberality</hi> to ſuch as need: <hi>Contentment</hi> in that whereunto God calleth: <hi>Patience</hi> in all judgements: <hi>Diligence</hi> in ſearching after the cauſes thereof: <hi>Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> in uſing the meanes warranted and ſanctified for averting judgements: <hi>Confidence</hi> in greateſt neceſſities are principall points handled in this treatiſe. The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the particulars is enough to give evidence of the ſutableneſſe of your diſpoſition thereunto.</p>

The preſent neceſſity of the times, wherein <hi>bread the ſtaffe of mans life</hi> is ſo ſcarce, have drawne my thoughts to meditate on the ſubject matter handled in this treatiſe (which is in one word, FAMINE) that I might ſtirre up my ſelfe and others to take notice of the beginning of Gods judgement: that wiſely we may ſeek the Lord betimes, and uſe all good means for moderating and removing this inſtant <hi>dearth,</hi> and for preventing the like, or any other heavier judgment for the future. So as I cannot think ſuch a ſubject at ſuch a time to be unſeaſonable: if at leaſt the Compoſer of the Treatiſe were able anſwerably to handle it. But as it is, I have made bold to dedicate it to your patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage; whom, for the reaſons before rendred, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other like to them, I judge to be as fit thereto, as the treatiſe it ſelfe is fit for the preſent time. In all greatefulnes it is preſented unto you. With all kindnes let it be accepted of you. As for recompence, To him that is ready graciouſly to accept, and able plenteouſly to reward all goodneſſe done for his ſake to any of his, knees are humbly bowed at the Throne of his Grace, by</p>

                     <p>It cannot be denied but that the Scripture ſometimes ſo tranſpoſeth hiſtories. Neither will I much contend about the tranſpoſing of theſe hiſtories. No great inconvenience will follow thereupon. Yet the ground of all ſeemeth not to be very ſound. For by many arguments it may be evinced that thoſe <hi>forty yeares</hi> before mentioned, are not to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the forty yeares of <hi>Davids</hi> raigne.</p>

in the yeares of his raigne: ſo as, if <hi>David</hi> had raigned full forty yeares, and entred into another yeare, he would in a round reckoning have beene ſaid to have raigned one and forty yeares.

                     <head>§. 24. Of the extremity of famine in the laſt fiege of Ieruſalem.</head>
                     <p>BEcauſe reference is often made to the hiſtory of <hi>Flavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Ioſephus</hi> of the warres of the Iewes concerning the extremity of famine in the laſt ſiege at Ieruſalem, by the Romanes in the dayes of <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> the Emperour, I think it meet in the end of this Treatiſe diſtinctly to relate the ſaid hiſtory ſo farre as it concerneth the famine.</p>
                     <p>The famine of the City, and the deſperation of the <note place="margin">Ioſeph de Bello Iud. lib. 6 cap. 11. Houſes broken up and ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for corne.</note> theeves both increaſed alike, every day more and more; ſo that now there was no more corne found. Wherefore the ſeditious perſons brake into the houſes, and ſearched every corner for to find corne; and if after their ſearch they found any, then they did beat the owners for denying it at the firſt; and if they found none, they tortured the houſhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, as having more cunningly hidden it: And whoſoever was yet ſtrong of body and well liking, him they preſently killed; for hereby they deemed him to have ſtore of food, or els he ſhould not have been in ſo good plight of body as he was. And they that were pined with famine, were by theſe barbarous ſeditious people ſlaine, who eſteemed it no offence to kill them, who would ſhortly after die, though they were left alive. Many, both rich, and poore, ſecretly exchanged all that they had for one buſhell of corne, and <note place="margin">All exchanged for bread.</note> preſently ſhutting themſelves in the ſecreteſt roome of their houſes, ſome of them did eate the corne as it was unground: others made bread thereof, as neceſſity and feare required. No man in the whole city ſate downe to eate his meate on a table, but greedily taking it, not boiled from the fire, they (even raw as it was) did eare it. Moſt miſerable was this manner of living, and a ſpectacle which none without teares was able to behold; for the ſtrongeſt ſtill got the moſt, and the weakeſt bewaild their miſery: for now famine was the greateſt calamity they endured. And nothing doth arme men more then ſhame: for during this famine no reverence <note place="margin">Food ſnatched out of one anothers mouths.</note> was had towards any man: for wives tooke the meat even out of their husbands mouthes, and children from their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:3436:95"/>
and mothers even from their infants, which was the moſt lamentable thing of all. No body had now any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, neither did they ſpare their deareſt infants, but ſuffered them to periſh even in their armes, taking from them the very drops of life. Yet could they not eate thus in ſuch ſecrecy, but preſently ſome came to take away from them that whereon they fed. For if in any place they ſaw any doore ſhut, preſently hereupon they conjectured that they in the houſe were eating meat, and forthwith breaking downe the doores, they came in; and taking them by the throat, they tooke the meat out of their mouthes already chewed, and ready to be ſwallowed downe. The old men were driven away, and not permitted to keepe and defend <note place="margin">Cruelty uſed to get food.</note> their food from being taken from them: the women were drawne up and downe by the haire of the head, for that they hid betweene their hands ſome part of their meat, and would not forgoe it. No pitie was now remaining, neither to old age, nor infancy, but they tooke young babes eating, their mouth full of meat, and not permitting it to be taken out of their mouthes, and threw them againſt the ground. Now if any one had prevented theſe theeves, and eaten their meat before they could come at them, then they were more cruell; and the other ſo much more tyrannouſly handled, as having committed ſome greater offence againſt them. They alſo deviſed moſt barbarous and cruell torments to extort food from others: for they thruſt ſticks or ſuch like into the cavity of mens yards, and ſharpe thorny rods into their fundaments: and it is abominable to heare what the people endured to make them confeſſe one loafe of bread, or one handfull of corne which they had hidden.</p>
                     <p>The reſtraint of liberty to paſſe in and out of the City <note place="margin">Ibid. cap. 14.</note> tooke from the Iewes all hope of ſafety, and the famine now increaſing, conſumed whole houſholds and families, and the houſes were full of dead women and infants: and the <note place="margin">Multitudes die of famine.</note> ſtreets filled with the dead bodies of old men: And the young men ſwollen like dead mens ſhadowes, walked in the market place, and fell downe dead where it happened.
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:3436:95"/>
And now the multitude of dead bodies was ſo great, that they which were alive could not bury them, neither cared they for burying them, being now uncertaine what ſhould betide themſelves. And many endeavouring to bury others, fell downe themſelves dead upon them as they were burying them. And many being yet alive, went un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their graves, and there died. Yet for all this calamity was there no weeping nor lamentation, for famine over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came all affections. And they who were yet living, without teares beheld thoſe, who being dead, were now at reſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them. There was no noiſe heard within the Citie, and the ſtill night found all full of dead bodies: and which was moſt miſerable of all, the theeves at night came and tooke away that which covered the dead bodies nakedneſſe, and went laughing away, and in their bodies they proved their ſwords, and upon pleaſure onely thruſt many through yet breathing. Yet if any have deſired them to kill him, or to lend him a ſword to kill himſelfe, that ſo he might eſcape <note place="margin">Death deſired by the famish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> the famine, they denied him.</p>
                     <p>What need I recount every particular miſerie? <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Lazarus</hi> flying to <hi>Titus</hi> out of the gate, <note place="margin">Ibid. cap. 6.</note> that was committed unto his cuſtody, and yeelding himſelf unto him, recounted unto <hi>Titus,</hi> that from the time that the <hi>Romans</hi> army was placed neare the City, from the foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth day of Aprill, unto the firſt of Iuly, were carried out <note place="margin">Multitude die of famine.</note> of that gate he kept, a hundred, fifteene thouſand, and foureſcore dead bodies; yet was not he the keeper of the gate, but being appointed to pay for the burying of the dead at the charges of the City, was forced to number the dead bodies. For others were buried by their parents, and this was their buriall, to caſt them out of the City, and there let them lie. And certaine noble men flying unto <hi>Titus</hi> after him, reported that there were dead in all the City ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand poore folks which were caſt out of the gates, and the others that died were innumerable: and that when ſo many died that they were not able to burie them, that then they gathered their bodies together in the greateſt
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:3436:96"/>
houſes adjoyning, and there ſhut them up. And that a buſhell of corne was ſold for a talent, which is ſix hundred crownes: and that after the City was compaſſed with a wall that now they could not go out to gather any more herbs, many were driven to that neceſſity, that they raked ſinkes and privies to finde old dung of oxen to eate; <note place="margin">Dung eaten.</note> and ſo the dung that was loathſome to behold, was their meate.</p>
                     <p>An infinite multitude periſhed within the City thorow <note place="margin">Ibid lib. 7. cap. 7, 8. Food violently ſnatched away</note> famine, ſo that they could not be numbered: for in every place where any ſhew or ſigne of food was, preſently aroſe a battell, and the deareſt friends of all now fought one with another, to take the food from other poore ſoules, neither did they believe them that were now a dying for famine, but the theeves ſearched them, whom they ſaw yeelding up the ghoſt, thinking that they dying for famine, had hid about them ſome food, but they were deceived of their hope, being like mad dogs, greedy of meate, and fell againſt the doores like drunken men, ſearching the ſelf-ſame houſes twice or thrice together in deſperation, and for very penury they eate whatſoever they light upon, gathering ſuch things <note place="margin">Things loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed eaten.</note> to eat, as the moſt filthy living creatures in the world would have loathed. In briefe, they did eate their girdles and ſhoes, and the skins that covered their ſhields, ſo that a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of old hay was ſold for foure Attiques. But what need is it to ſhew the ſharpneſſe of this famine by things that want life? I will recount an act never heard of, neither amongſt the Greekes, nor any other barbarous people, hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible to be rehearſed, and incredible, ſo that I would willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly omit this calamity, leaſt poſterity ſhould thinke I lie, had I not many witneſſes hereof, and perhaps ſhould incurre re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, not fully recounting all accidents of them that are dead.</p>

Her other goods the tyrants had taken from her, which ſhe had brought from beyond the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver into the City, and whatſoever being hid, eſcaped their hands, the theeves daily came into her houſe, and tooke it away, whereat the woman greatly moved, curſed them, and with hard ſpeeches animated them the more againſt her, yet no man either for anger or compaſſion would kill her, but ſuffered her to live to get them meate, but now could ſhe get no more, and famine invaded her with rage and anger more then danger. Wherefore by rage and neceſſity ſhe was compelled to do that which nature abhorred, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king her ſonne unto whom ſhe then gave ſucke, O miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble child (quoth ſhe) in warre, famine, and ſedition, for which of theſe ſhall I keepe thee? If thou continue amongſt the Romans, thou ſhalt be made a ſlave, yet famine will prevent bondage; or elſe ſedition worſe then them both. Be therefore meate for me, a terrour unto the ſeditious, a tragicall ſtory to be ſpoken of by poſterity, and that which is onely yet heard of amongſt the calamities of the Iewes. Having thus ſpoken, ſhe ſlue her ſonne, and did ſeeth the one halfe of him, and did eate it, the reſt ſhe reſerved cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Preſently came the ſeditious, ſmelling the ſent of that execrable meat, threatning preſently to kill her, except ſhe forthwith brought ſome of that unto them which ſhe had prepared. Then ſhe anſwered that ſhe had reſerved a good portion thereof for them, and preſently uncovered that part of her ſonne which ſhe had left uneaten; at which ſight they trembled, and a horrour fell upon them. But the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſaid, this is truly my ſonne, and my doing, eat you of it, for I my ſelfe have eaten thereof. Be not more effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate then a woman, nor more mercifull then a mother. If Religion make you refuſe this my ſacrifice, I have already eaten of it, and will eate the reſt. Then the ſeditious depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, hereat onely trembling, and ſcarcely permitting this meate to the mother. Preſently the report of this hainous crime was bruited all about the City, and every man having before his eyes this excerable fact, trembled as though him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe

                     <p>The inhabitants of the cities of <hi>Maximinus,</hi> ſore pined away with famine and peſtilence, ſo that one meaſure of <note place="margin">Euſeb Eccleſ. Hiſt l 9. c. 8.

driven to extreme need and neceſſity, went a begging into the country, ſhewing forth by their reverend countenance and more gorgeous apparell, an example of that ancient and free manner of feeding: Certaine others whoſe ſtrength was dried up, tottering to and fro, nodding and ſliding much like carved pictures without life, being not able to ſtand, ſell downe flat in the midſt of the ſtreets, groveling upon the ground, with their faces upward, and ſtretched out armes, making humble ſupplication that ſome one would reach them a little peece of bread: and thus lying in extremity, ready to yeeld up the ghoſt, cried out that they were hungry, <note place="margin">Cries of the ſtarved.</note> being onely able to utter theſe words.

                     <p>In <hi>King William the Conquerours</hi> daies there was ſuch a <note place="margin">Stow in his generall Chro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Engl. In the 5. yeare of W.

                     <p>In <hi>King Henry the thirds</hi> raigne was a great dearth and peſtilence: ſo that many poore folks died for want of victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als: <note place="margin">Ibid.

Amongſt theſe is to be noted <hi>Walter Grey,</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Yorke,</hi> whoſe corne being five yeares old, doubting the ſame to be deſtroyed by vermine, he commanded to deliver it to the husbandmen that dwelt in his mannours, upon condition to pay as much new corne after harveſt; and would give none to the poore for Gods ſake. But when men came to a great ſtack of corne nigh to the towne of <hi>Ripon</hi> belonging to the ſaid Arch-biſhop, there appeared in the ſheaves all over the heads of wormes, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, and toads. And the Bailiffes were forced to build an high wall round about the corne, and then to ſet it on fire, leaſt the venomous wormes ſhould have gone out and poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned the corne in other places.</p>

We have a late evidence of the efficacy of ſuch meanes uſed. For in the yeare 1626 it rained all the ſpring, and all the ſummer day after day for the moſt part, untill the ſecond of Auguſt, on which day by publique Proclamation a Faſt was ſolomnly kept thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole Realme of <hi>England,</hi> and Principality of <hi>Wales,</hi> as it had by the ſame Proclamation beene ſolemnized in the Cities of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> and places adjacent, on the fift day of Iuly before.

                              <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The ground of the objection is unfound. For in many things the Old Teſtament gives even to Chriſtians as good warrant as the New. <note n="e" place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 16. 2 Pet. 1. 21.</note> The Old Teſtament is as truly divine as the New.

Though no particular arguments could be diducted out of the New Teſtament, yet becauſe the Old is ſo plentifull in proofs for warre, the New is the more ſparing.

                           <p n="4">4. The Church in thoſe times whereof the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment recordeth the hiſtory, had no outward ſetled ſtate; but was under ſuch civill Governours as were of a contrary profeſſion, as Heathen Emperours and Lords.

                           <p n="5">5. The ſcope of the New Teſtament is rather to ſet out

                           <p>VVArre is a kind of execution of publique juſtice: and a means of maintaining right. For oft there is ſuch conſpiracy of many men together in doing wrong, and ſo obſtinate and violent they are therein, as by no admonitions, perſwaſions, threatnings, penalties of Law, or ordinary means of executing juſtice they wilbe reſtrained. And ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferably ambitious are ſome, &amp; ſo inſatiably covetous, as no dignities or jurisdictions will content them, no revenewes or profits will ſatisfie them. Were not ſuch men reſtrained, and ſuppreſſed by force of armes, none ſhould live in quiet, none ſhould poſſeſſe or enjoy any thing beſides themſelves. So as the iniquity of men cauſeth a neceſſity of warre: and the benefit that thence ariſeth cauſeth pious and righteous men to uſe it. By it a free and quiet profeſſion of the true Faith is maintained: peace is ſetled: kingdomes and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths are ſecured: lands and inheritances quietly poſſeſſed: all manner of callings freely exerciſed: good <note place="margin">

But Gods delight in the ſpirit doth not imply a diſlike, or no liking of a manifeſtation thereof by the body.

                           <p n="2">2. For others, our outward geſture manifeſting our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward affection, they may be brought to adde their prayers alſo, and joyne with us, (as they who ſaw the company of Prophets propheſying, propheſied alſo among them, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19. 20.) or at leaſt ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to our petitions, and deſire God to grant them, as old <hi>Elie</hi> did, when he underſtood how <hi>Annah</hi> had powred forth her ſoule before God, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 17.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. For our ſelves, by the outward geſture of the body our owne ſpirits within us are much affected. For there is a ſympathy betwixt ſoule and body. Bowing the body in prayer, as it teſtifieth the humiliation of the ſoule, ſo it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the ſoule to ſtoupe ſomwhat the lower. Beating the breaſt doth ſomwhat the more breake the heart; lifting up eyes or hands raiſeth up the heart; ſpreading the armes abroad enlargeth the deſire of the heart; ſtanding erect ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the ſoule the more ſteddy. <note place="margin">Exhortation to uſe ſeemely outward ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture in prayer.</note>

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:3436:138"/>
ſoules by the outward geſtures of the body. There needs no great labour after outward, geſture, if at leaſt there be true devotion in the heart. The parts of the body are ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the ſoule, as they will ſoone declare the intent thereof. This is evident by the private prayers which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons truly devoted do make. For when they are alone, and no creature preſent to take notice of the outward geſture, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the affection of the heart, when it is indeed fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, the eyes wilbe caſt up, or caſt downe, the armes ſpread abroad, the hands lift up, or beating the breaſt, the body caſt proſtrate upon the ground, and other like geſtures per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. They who uſe to pray privately and fervently, know this to be true.</p>
                           <p>I urge not this outward geſture, to make men play the hypocrites. Farre be ſuch intents from my mind.

Oft meditate thereon; plead them in prayer before God.

And by a right uſe of what we have, our faith in God may be ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened, as <hi>Moſes</hi> was by the uſe of this rod.

                              <hi>PErſwaſion of others prayers addeth much courage in dangerous imployments.</hi> This was one reaſon why <note n="a" place="margin">Num. 10. 9.</note> God in his Law ordred that his <hi>Prieſts</hi> ſhould go with their <hi>ſilver trumpets</hi> into the armies of his people, that by that ſigne his people might be aſſured of the Prieſts prayers, and be thereby the more encouraged. <note n="b" place="margin">2 Chro. 13. 14</note> Thus were the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in <hi>Abijahs</hi> time much encouraged. This queſtionleſſe was the reaſon why <note n="c" place="margin">Iudg. 4. 8.</note> 
                              <hi>Barak</hi> was ſo importunate to have <hi>Deborah</hi> go with him to the warre. Her ſex might make him thinke that ſhe was not fit to lead an army, or to fight. But he knowing her to be a Propheteſſe, did alſo know that her prayers would be availeable with the Lord: and withall he thought that the ſight of the battell would extend her ſpirit the more earneſtly to call upon the Lord for them. Did not this perſwaſion encourage him, who ſpeaking of his trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, ſaid, <note n="d" place="margin">Phil. 1. 19.</note> 
                              <hi>I know that this ſhall turne to my ſalvation thorow your prayer.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Gods people being acquainted with Gods Word, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by know that God is the fountaine of all bleſſing, and that prayer is the means of receiving all needfull bleſſing from him, and that the prayers of others are availeable with God <note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Muliùm valent preces in commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni multorum.</hi> Hier. Comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. in Rom. 15.</note> as well as their owne, and that when others prayers are joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with theirs, they are ſo much the more powerfull. How can they then but be the more incouraged by their perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of others prayers for them. <note place="margin">Of craving others prayers, See <hi>The whole Armour of God,</hi> on Eph. 6. 19.

                           <p>Good cauſe there is for this very cauſe, when any go about any weighty, difficult, or dangerous worke, or when they are in any dangers or feares, to crave the prayers of ſuch as they count faithfull: as <note n="e" place="margin">2 King. 19. 4.</note> 
                              <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did of <hi>Iſayah.</hi> And for them of whom this duty is deſired, by ſolemne promiſe
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:3436:143"/>
to bind themſelves to do it, as <note n="f" place="margin">1 Sam. 12. 23.</note> 
                              <hi>Samuel</hi> did, that ſo they who deſire it may have the more cauſe to believe that it ſhall be performed. And if the worke enterpriſed be publique, meet it is that a faſt be proclaimed, and publique prayers enjoyned for their good ſucceſſe. By theſe publique prayers more notice may be taken of the many prayers that by many perſons are made for them, and ſo they be the more encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged.</p>

Confeſſ. l. 11. c 43.</note> it followeth, that they who are well inſtructed in the articles of the Chriſtian faith, and anſwerably do believe in Chriſt, cannot but have much comfort and encouragement in all their lawfull enterpriſes, be they never ſo difficult or dangerous, becauſe they cannot be ignorant that Chriſt, in whom they believe, is on an higher hill then <hi>Moſes</hi> here was, even in heaven at Gods right hand, making interceſſion for them. Whom, though he be inviſible, they may ſee with the eye of faith, as <hi>Moſes</hi> by faith ſaw him who is <hi>inviſible, He.</hi> 11 27. Now Chriſts interceſſion is more then al the praiers of all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Saints, though their ſpirits were all joined together, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting one and the ſame petition to God. For Chriſts inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion is that ſweet incenſe that is in it ſelfe acceptable to God, and that, mixed with the prayers of the Saints, makes them acceptable, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8. 3, 4. Let us therefore have our eye of faith fixed on Chriſt at Gods right hand in heaven, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding up his hands continually, and making interceſſion for us. The eye of faith may in this kind work as much bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as the ſight of <hi>Stephens</hi> bodily eye did, when he ſaw <hi>Ieſus ſtanding on the right hand of God, Acts</hi> 7. 55.</p>

God having given his Angels charge over all his, when they are in warre, they will either keepe them from death, or when they die they will take their ſoules, as they did the ſoule of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> to carrie it to bliſſe. Therefore with much confidence he ſlayeth his enemy, with greater confidence he is himſelfe ſlaine. He doth a good turne to himſelfe if he be killed, and an acceptable thing to Chriſt if he ſlay his enemy. When he is ſlaine, he is not deſtroyed, but perfected.

                           <p>Mutuall aſſiſtance of Saints makes prayers much more powerfull and effectuall then otherwiſe they would be.

And that, while the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans prayed, another greater matter fell out beyond their imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and expectation. For, the enemies were ſtricken downe with many ſtroaks of thunder: and the army being even ready to periſh with thirst and want of water, was refreſhed. So effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſurely were the prayers of Chriſtians. Prophane Historians, who have written of the Romane Emperours, have related as much.</hi> I have the rather tranſcribed this hiſtory, becauſe it is ſomwhat pertinent to the pattern of <hi>Moſes</hi> here noted in the text.</p>
                           <p>Faithfull prayer is that meanes which God himſelfe, the almighty and all ſufficient God, the originall fountaine of all <note place="margin">Faith the meanes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from God <hi>Nemo or at niſi quod credit &amp; ſperat.</hi> Bern. ſu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>per Miſſus eſt, Serm 4.</note> bleſſing-hath ſanctified for receiving from him whatſoever he in his wiſdome ſeeth meet to be done for, or given to any of his children. So that, it is as a conduit pipe, conveying all needfull bleſſing from that high fountaine in heaven, to us on earth. In this reſpect, to him, who ſaid unto the Lord, <hi>If thou canst do any thing helpe us,</hi> Chriſt gave this anſwer, <hi>If thou canſt believe, all things are poſſible to him that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, Mar.</hi> 9. 22, 23.

                              <hi>Ob.</hi> This tying of divine bleſſing to faith, which is a gift and grace in man, ſeemeth to impeach the infinite and unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited power of God.</p>

                              <pb n="260" facs="tcp:3436:151"/>
                              <hi>Anſw.</hi> Nothing leſſe. For, faith is not the proper, prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <note place="margin">Mans faith impeacheth not Gods power.</note> and principall cauſe of any divine bleſſing, but onely a meanes ſubordinate to the divine providence. It doth ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no more impeach Gods power, then any other meanes. There are among others, three eſpeciall conſiderations which evidently demonſtrate that faith more manifeſteth then empaireth the power, providence, wiſdome, and other attributes of God. They are theſe.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. God himſelfe worketh in man this gift of faith. <note place="margin">Eph. 2. 8.</note>
                              <hi>Faith is the gift of God.</hi>

                           <p n="2">2. God himſelfe hath appointed and ſanctified this means. No creature hath impoſed it on him.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. The bleſſing which by faith commeth to any, is obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, not by any worth or vertue of faith as it is an act of man, but meerly by reaſon of that order which in wiſdome God hath appointed for receiving from him ſuch and ſuch bleſſings.</p>
                           <p>Good cauſe we have therefore, all of us that are faithfull, in all things wherein we ſtand in need of any ſpeciall favour, ſuccour, and bleſſing from the Lord, to hold up our hands to God, as <hi>Moſes</hi> here did, by faithfull prayer to ſeek it of him, &amp; expect it from him.

The manner of praying with a ſtedfaſt faith (ſignified by <hi>holding up the hand)</hi> is the point here to be eſpecially obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. For, faith to prayer is as fire to powder. In it the life, vigour, and power of prayer conſiſteth. By faith prayer fli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <note place="margin">The power of prayer conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth in faith. <hi>Grandis fidei clamor;</hi> Amb. Comment. in Pſal. 118.

                           </p>
                           <p>For helpe herein, obſerve theſe directions.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. Take good notice of Gods promiſes, and well acquaint thy ſelfe therewith. Gods promiſes are the only, true, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <note place="margin">Directions to pray in faith. Of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, how they are the ground of faith, See <hi>The whole Armour of God,</hi> on Eph. 6. 16. Treat. 2. Part. 6, §. 71, &amp;c.</note> ground of faith. What is promiſed, may, and muſt be believed. What is believed without a promiſe, is not juſtly and duly believed. It is rather raſhly and audaciouſly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Meditate on Gods properties, ſuch as theſe. 1. His ſupreme <hi>Soveraignty,</hi> wherby he hath an abſolute command over all. 2. His <hi>Omnipotency,</hi> whereby he is able to do any thing. 3. His <hi>All-ſufficiency,</hi> whereby, as he hath all trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures in himſelfe, ſo he can give what he will to whom he will. 4. His <hi>Omni-preſence,</hi> or <hi>being every where,</hi> whereby he taketh notice of all things. 5. His unſearchable <hi>wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> whereby he diſpoſeth all things to the beſt. 6. His <hi>Free-grace,</hi> wherby he is moved for his own ſake to do good to ſuch as are unworthy in themſelves. 7. His <hi>Rich-mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> whereby his bowels are ſtirred at the miſeries of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and moved to ſuccour them. 8. His <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe,</hi> which makes him perform all his promiſes. 9. His perfect <hi>Iuſtice,</hi> which makes him judge and revenge thoſe that unjuſtly wrong and vexe his Church. 10. His fierce <hi>Wrath</hi> and <hi>terrour,</hi> which makes him a conſuming fire to his enemies. 11. His <hi>Immutability,</hi> which ſhewes him to be ſuch a God ſtill to us, as of old he was to his Church.</p>
                           <p n="3">
                              <pb n="262" facs="tcp:3436:152"/>
3. Fixe the eye of thy faith on <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> thy Mediator, ſitting at Gods right hand, and making interceſſion for thee: by vertue of which interceſſion thy perſon and prayers are made acceptable to God, ſo as, in much confidence and ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtneſſe of faith thou maiſt expect a gracious accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. Call to mind Gods former works. How theſe are of uſe to ſtrengthen faith hath beene ſhewed <note n="*" place="margin">§. 33.</note> before.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. Wait and expect Gods leiſure. Praeſcribe no time to him. <note n="i" place="margin">Hab. 2. 3. See <hi>The whole armour of God,</hi> on Eph. 6. 17. Treat 2. Part. 7 §. 3, 8, 9.</note> 
                              <hi>There is an appointed time.</hi> This can not be preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, nor ſhalbe overſlipt. To be perſwaded hereof, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerably to wait patiently and contentedly, when at firſt we are not heard, will much ſettle and ſtrengthen faith. Hope, like a good daughter, nouriſheth faith.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. Let thy ſoule be ſo qualified when thou prayeſt, as thy faith be not quailed with the evill diſpoſition of the heart. The right qualification of the ſoule conſiſteth much in the true intent, bent, and inclination thereof, when in truth it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends that which is acceptable to God, and the bent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of the will is thereunto. For, howſoever our good intents, endeavours, and performances are no cauſes of faith, yet, as effects and ſignes they ſo quicken the ſpirit, as they make a man both more ſhew forth, and better uſe his faith then otherwiſe he could. And on the contrary, <note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>The whole Armour of God,</hi> on Eph. 6. 18. Treat. 3 Part. 1. §. 20.</note> ſin damps the ſpirit: and a purpoſe of ſinning is to faith, as water to gun-powder. This he well underſtood, who ſaid, <note n="k" place="margin">Pſal. 66. 18.</note> 
                              <hi>If I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard iniquity in mine heart, the Lord will not heare me.</hi> Thus therefore he profeſſeth to prepare himſelfe, <note n="l" place="margin">—26. 6.</note> 
                              <hi>I will waſh my hands in innocency, ſo will I compaſſe thine altar, O Lord.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="7">7. When the ſpirit is heavy, and the ſoule perplexed; when doubting and feare ariſeth in thy heart; when that ſweet inward ſenſe, joy, and comfort whereby faith uſeth to be ſupported, faileth in thee; then let thy judgement and underſtanding ſuſtaine thy faith: labour by evident ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments taken from Gods promiſes, and other grounds of faith before mentioned, to convince thy ſoule, that God
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:3436:152"/>
heareth thy prayer, accepteth thy perſon in Chriſt, and will do that which in his wiſdome he ſeeth to be moſt fit for thee. Reaſon and expoſtulate the caſe with thy ſoule. Say as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> did in ſuch a caſe, <hi>Why art thou cast downe, O my</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">Pſal. 42. 11.</note> 
                              <hi>ſoule? and why art thou diſquieted in me? Hope thou in God; for I ſhall yet praiſe him, who is the health of my countenance and my God.</hi> There are two props to ſupport our faith. One <note place="margin">Two props of faith.</note> is an inward comfortable apprehenſion, a ſweet ſenſe and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured perſwaſion of Gods fatherly love to us wrought by the ſpirit of comfort. The other is good knowledge and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the true grounds of faith, as Gods promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, properties, and former dealings with others and our ſelves, the mediation of Chriſt, &amp;c. When the former failes men, by the latter they may ſupport and ſuſtaine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. This latter keepes many which want the former from deſpaire: For it makes them not to dare to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt.</p>
                           <p n="8">8. To all other meanes adde prayer. Pray as he that ſaid, <note n="m" place="margin">Mar 9. 24.</note>

<pb n="267" facs="tcp:3436:154"/>
is to intermit the means whereby the bleſſing deſired is to be obtained. It is as if (before the battell be ended) ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſhould ceaſe to fight, or runners in a race fall downe and lie ſtill, before they be come to the goale.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. By ſuch fainting and intermitting prayer, as the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of fleſh in man is manifeſted, ſo the power, truth, wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, goodneſſe, and other divine properties are impeached. How then can it be thought but that much prejudice muſt needs come to ſuch men thereby.</p>
                           <p>The reaſon why mens prayers do in the iſſue prove fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, <note place="margin">Information in the cauſe of fruitleſſe pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</note> may hence be gathered. They faint, they faile, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termit, they give over praying before that for which they pray be accompliſhed. When any judgement publique or private is beginning, or is feared, as plague, famine, ſword, reſtraint of liberty, or the like, hearty, earneſt, extraordinary prayer is oft made, yea and faſting added thereto: but if God ſeeme to tarry long before he remove that judgement, men think it in vaine ſtill to wait, (as he who ſaid, <note n="f" place="margin">2 King. 6. 33.</note> 
                              <hi>What ſhould I wait for the Lord any longer?)</hi> and ſo looſe the fruit of their former prayers, by not following them, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing to hold out till the time appointed of the Lord. The like may be ſaid of prayer for obtaining ſpeciall bleſſings, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven over.</p>
                           <p>How fitly now may that generall encouragement of the Apoſtle, (<note n="g" place="margin">Gal. 6. 9. See <hi>The whole Armour of God,</hi> on Eph 6. 13. Treat. 1. Part 4 § 12.</note> 
                              <hi>let us not be weary of well doing)</hi> yea and the reaſon thereof <hi>(for in due time we ſhall reape if we faint not)</hi> be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to prayer. There is nothing whereunto continuance and perſeverance is more requiſite then prayer. Of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of perſeverance in prayer we ſpake <note n="h" place="margin">§ 44. <hi>Neceſſitatibus implicatus or a fortiter &amp; dic Deo quod habes in Pſalmo, In ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitatibus meis erue me.</hi> Aug.

If therefore deſire of good, or feare of evill be motives of force, there are motives of force to provoke us to all perſeverance, and in holding out to be fervent. Therefore when thou art in ſtraits be ardent, and inſtant in prayer, and ſay to God as thou art taught, <hi>(Pſal.</hi> 25. 17.) <hi>O bring thou me out of my distreſſes.</hi>

For obſerving that when his hands fell, <hi>Amalek</hi> prevailed, he uſed all the helpe he could to keepe his hands up and ſteddy, as is noted in the next verſe.</p>

as ever he was. Let us wiſely obſerve the ends of Gods permiſſion in this caſe, (whereof ſome are noted) and anſwerably make uſe thereof. Theſe times give juſt occaſion <note place="margin">Miſ-judge not ſuch as are vanquiſhed.</note> to make a wiſe application of this point. Enemies as hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to God as <hi>Amalek</hi> was, have in many places had the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per hand of ſuch as have had as true notes of the true Church as <hi>Iſrael</hi> had. What then? ſhall we hereupon impeach God of injuſtice, or make queſtion of the truth of their religion, or, ſo loade them with ſinne, as if they were the greateſt ſinners of all. Farre bee that from us.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. Concerning God, we ought not to ſuffer a thought to ariſe in our minds, derogatory to his juſtice: but if any ſuch do begin to riſe, preſently to quaſh and ſuppreſſe them. God in juſtice may make Idolaters his rod (as he did the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 10. 5.) to puniſh thoſe that are of the true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But after the rod is thus uſed, to what end is it but to be caſt into the fire?</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Concerning the difference of religion betwixt Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants and Papiſts, we are not to judge of it by event and ſucceſſe in warre. There are other more ſure evidences grounded on Gods Word, which give ſuch demonſtrations of the truth of the one, and falſhood of the other, as we may pawne life, ſoule, and eternall ſalvation, upon the truth of that which we profeſſe: and renounce ſalvation, if Popery be the means of attaining thereto.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Concerning their ſins, whether they be more or grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the ſins of others that are of the ſame profeſſion, but not ſo trampled upon as they, we are to leave to the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the higheſt Iudge. The Lord hath given us a wiſe caveat in this caſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</p>
                           <p>Let us believe and hope the beſt; and do as <hi>Moſes</hi> here did, be more earneſt in prayer for them, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 20. 26. <hi>Ioſ.</hi> 7. 6, &amp;c. <hi>Num.</hi> 21. 2.</p>
                           <p>To conclude, when the cauſe of warre is juſt, the danger or conqueſt of a Chriſtian is to be ballanced by the affection of the heart, not by the iſſue of warre. The iſſue of the combate

The wearines of <hi>Moſes</hi> hands is ſet out by the heavines of them. For, if a mans hand be held up long, and ſteddily without ſtirring, it will waxe numne by reaſon of want of bloud, and coldneſſe of that bloud which is. That ſpirit which quickneth the members of a mans body is in the blood: blood failing, or waxing cold, the member for
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:3436:157"/>
want of ſpirit, and the vigour thereof, becomes heavy, (as by experience we may obſerve in dead corps:) and heavineſſe of a mans hands makes him weary in holding them up. Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſſe then (which is an humane infirmity) was the cauſe of <hi>Moſes</hi> letting down his hands: whereby, as by an outward ſigne, the weakneſſe of his faith, and fainting of his ſoule and ſpirit is ſet out: as was noted <note n="c" place="margin">§ 42.</note> before.</p>

                           <p>Such helpe did the fore-mentioned aſſiſtance bring to <hi>Moſes,</hi> as his hands which were before ſo heavy and feeble as he was forced to let them fall, remained <hi>ſteddy:</hi> and that not for an houre or two, but all the day, even <hi>untill the going downe of the ſun:</hi> which implieth, that his ſpirit was ſo revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by their mutuall and joynt prayers, as with much alacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and great ardency he continued to pray all the day long.</p>

                           <p>For our parts, let it be our care firſt to put difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt circumſtance and ſubſtance: and then to preferre this to that. For this end we muſt labour to have our underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding well enlightned by Gods Word, and our hearts filled with an holy feare of God, and true love of man. Thus ſhall we diſcerne what is to be preferred before other, and ſo wiſely order the things we do, as our brother may be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, our ſelves not prejudiced, and God beſt pleaſed. It is an evidence of Gods great and good reſpect to man, thus to give a diſpenſation in matters concerning himſelfe, for mans good. As occaſion is offered either in regard of our owne or others need, let us wiſely make uſe thereof. God would have us uſe that liberty which in his goodneſſe and wiſdome he is pleaſed to grant us. Thus may ſicke perſons pray in their bed, <hi>(Iſa.</hi> 38. 2.) or if they cannot themſelves pray, have others to pray for them, <hi>(Iam.</hi> 5. 14.) and weake per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons not well able to kneele, pray ſitting, as here <hi>Moſes</hi> did: and they that cannot come to Church, have the benefit of Gods ordinances at home.</p>

                           <p>The primary and principall Authour of the <hi>memoriall</hi> here mentioned, is <hi>Iehovah,</hi> the <hi>LORD;</hi> The Miniſter is <hi>Moſes,</hi> of whom we have ſpoken on the 9. Verſe.</p>

Very well did our learned King IAMES, in that ſpeech which he made to both hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Parliament upon the diſcovery of that diveliſh pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-treaſon-plot, obſerve, that <hi>No other ſect of Heretiques, not excepting Turke, Iew, nor Pagan, no, not even thoſe of Calicute, who adore the Devill, did ever maintaine by the grounds of their religion, that it was lawfull, or rather me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious (as the Romiſh Catholicks call it) to murther prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>

                              <hi>or people for quarrell of religion. And although particular men of all profeſſions of religion have beene ſome theeves, ſome murtherers, ſome traitors, yet ever when they came to their end and just puniſhment, they confeſſed their fault to be in their nature, and not in their profeſſion. Theſe Romiſh Catholicks onely excepted.</hi> Preſervations therefore, and deliverances from ſuch miſchievous perſons are the beſt preſervations and deliverances: moſt worthy to be remembred thoroughout all generations: that thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all generations due praiſe may be given to God. If <note place="margin">See the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the powder-trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, in the works of King IAMES.</note> the horrible miſchiefe intended by that powder-plot, if the neare approach of the time of accompliſhing that plot before it was diſcovered: and if the manner of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering the ſame bee well weighed, wee cannot but diſcerne that there was juſt and great cauſe for preſerving both an annuall, and perpetuall memoriall thereof.</p>
                           <p>Though like publique memorials of all the judgements <note place="margin">Private memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials of Gods judgements.</note> which God inflicteth on the enemies of the Church be not made: yet it behooveth particular Chriſtians to take ſpeciall notice of them, ſo farre as they come to their ſight and hearing, and to make ſome private records of them to themſelves: that thereby they may the rather bee provoked both to feare God, and alſo to truſt in him.</p>
                           <p>Private means of keeping in memory Gods judgments, are ſuch as theſe, frequent meditation on them, oft mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them in our praiſes to God, much conferring with others about them, declaring them to our poſterity, writing them in private records of our owne, and other ſuch like.</p>

                           <p>What may be the reaſon that the Lord ſhould ſweare? Is it not enough for him to threaten? Surely in regard of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and his owne divine properties it is enough. God doth not ſweare, becauſe he needs credit. Every word of God is true and faithfull: and it is as an oth. For, God is not faithfull by reaſon of his oth, but by reaſon of God, his oth is true and ſtable. For, he is able to make good every word that cometh out of his mouth; al in heaven and earth cannot hinder the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution therof: and in this kind when by his word his truth is engaged, he wil without failing do what he is able to do. The reaſon therefore of Gods oath reſteth on man, who is prone to make ſleight account of Gods word, who hath a ſtiffe necke, an hard heart, an obſtinate ſpirit. Wherefore to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie him the more, the Lord by oath bindeth himſelf to take vengeance. As on the contrary, Because we are wont to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve more ſtedfaſtly that which is confirmed by an oath, that our faith ſhould not waver, God is ſaid to ſweare. So as the Lord in tender reſpect to the weakneſſe of his children, who
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:3436:188"/>
by reaſon of the fleſh in them, are prone to make queſtion of Gods promiſes, doth bind them with his oath, (as he did to <note n="l" place="margin">Iſa 54. 9.</note>

                           <p n="1">1. FOr warre multitudes of men are gathered: and thoſe for the moſt part luſty, ſtout, and ſtrong men. In ſuch multitudes it is ſcarce poſſible to have none but ſuch as feare God. Many, many armies there have beene in all ages, wherein not one, that truly feared God, could be found. Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few armies have beene heard of, whereof the greater <note place="margin">

Where multitudes of ſuch are aſſembled together, what miſchiefes may not be feared?</p>
                           <p n="2">2. For warre men uſe to be furniſhed with all kind of deadly weapons, and mortall munition, whereby ſouldiers are the more emboldened to all manner of outrages: much cruelty is thereby occaſioned. Hence it comes to paſſe that men aſſembled in armies account all that they can come by, be it by hooke or crooke, right or wrong, to be as their owne. So as the places thorow which they paſſe, and where they make any ſtay, ſuffer much prejudice by them. Inſtance the <hi>Danites</hi> that robbed <hi>Michah, (Iudg.</hi> 18. 16. 17, 25.) This undoubtedly was the cauſe that moved <hi>Iohn the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist</hi> to warne the ſouldiers that came to be inſtructed by him to take heed of <hi>doing violence, Luke</hi> 3. 14. For, the more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent men are, the more forward they are to oppreſſe others. And as for juſtice, it uſeth to ſleep when war moſt waketh</p>
                           <p n="3">3. To maintaine warre, rich treaſures are oft exhauſted, ſubjects much oppreſſed, many husbands taken from their wives, parents from their children, maſters from their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, all ſorts of men from their callings. Trades thereby do much decay, and lands are oft left untilled. Yea of thoſe that are ſo preſt out to the war, many never returne home againe: whereby it comes to paſſe that many women are made wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes; many children fatherleſſe, many old, impotent pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents childleſſe, and other friends friendleſſe, to their utter undoing.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. In war many are brought into moſt lamentable diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:3436:192"/>
and yet no comfort, no ſuccor afforded unto them. Some in the battell have an arme, a leg, or ſome other limb cut off, whereby they are diſabled to helpe themſelves; and yet though they call and cry for helpe, no man pittieth them: but oft lie trampled upon by men and horſes to their greater torture. Among other ends of Flutes, Fifes, Trumpets, Drummes, and ſuch like loud ſounding inſtruments in warre, this is ſaid to be one, that the complaints and cries of woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded men might not be heard. If ſome of theſe by their own paines, or helpe of their fellow ſouldiers being wounded get out of the army, they may notwithſtanding feele the ſmart of their wound, and find the loſſe of their limbs or ſenſes to their dying day.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. By warre many are taken captives, whom malicious and mortall enemies (ſo taken) oft put to exquiſite torments: as the <hi>Syrians,</hi> who <hi>threſhed Gilead with threſhing inſtruments of iron, Am.</hi> 1. 3. and the <hi>Edomites,</hi> who <hi>ript up the women with child of Gilead, Am.</hi> 1. 13. and the <hi>Moabites,</hi> who <hi>burnt the bones of the King of Edom unto lime, Am.</hi> 2. 1. and <hi>Adoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bezek,</hi> who having <hi>cut off the thumbs and great toes of</hi> 70 <hi>Kings,</hi> made them <hi>gather their meate under his table, Iudg.</hi> 1. 7. and the <hi>Caldees,</hi> who <hi>ſlew the ſonnes of Zedekiah before his eyes,</hi> and then <hi>put out the eyes of the ſaid King, and bound him with ſetters of braſſe,</hi> &amp;c. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 25. 7. and the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> who <hi>tooke Sampſon, and put out his eyes, and bound him with fetters of braſſe, and made him grind in their priſon houſe, Iudg.</hi> 16. 21. Others taken by enemies, though they be not ſo tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured, yet may be made perpetuall ſlaves.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. By warre ſtrangers and enemies invade others coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries and kingdomes, enter into them, thruſt out the true Lords therof, take away lands and inheritances, with all their goods and cattell from the true owners: abrogate good lawes: make cruell edicts; deprive people of their privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges and immunities: make noble men meane; rich men poore: free men ſlaves: deflowre mens wives, raviſh their virgins, rip up their women with child, trample on old folkes, toſſe little children on pikes, cauſe weeping,

                           <p n="3">3.

                           <p>Peace is the maine end of juſt and lawfull warre.

                           <p n="2">2. All that man can do, can but <note n="l" place="margin">Mat. 10. 28. Luk. 12. 4.</note> touch the body: it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reach to the ſoule.

So as the uttermoſt which man can do, in compariſon of the evill which reacheth to the ſoule, is little to be accounted of, not to be feared.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Man can inflict nothing upon the body, which may truly and properly be called evill: or which may make it mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable. Degradation from offices, Deprivation of goods,

Reſtraint of liberty, Reproach, Diſgrace, Torture, Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of death, Deniall of buriall, and other externall croſſes like unto theſe, are ſo farre from making Saints miſerable, as thorow the divine providence they turne to their advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. <note n="m" place="margin">Heb. 10 34.</note> Loſſe of goods may prove a gaine of grace: <note n="n" place="margin">Act. 16. 25.</note> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint of outward liberty, a meanes of greater freedome of conſcience: <note n="o" place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 13.</note> Diſgrace, a motive for God the more to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt his approbation: <note n="p" place="margin">Heb. 11. 35.</note> Torment, an occaſion of eaſing the mind: <note n="q" place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 17.</note> Death of body, an entrance into eternall life. What evils can they be, which bring ſo great advantages to men?</p>
                           <p n="4">4. If they ſhould be evils, God can protect and deliver from them all. (Of the many wayes of exempting Saints from judgements, ſee <hi>The Plaiſter for the Plague,</hi> on <hi>Num.</hi> 16. 45. §. 12, 14.)

                           <p>Iuſtly therefore doth the Apoſtle <hi>(Iam.</hi> 4. 13, &amp;c.) taxe their bold preſumption, who without thought of God, or of his over-ruling providence, peremptorily ſay, <hi>To day or to morrow we will goe into ſuch a city, and continue there a yeare, and buy and ſell, and get gaine, whereas ye know not what ſhalbe on the morrow,</hi> &amp;c. This was the proud conceit of him, who by an heavenly voice is called <hi>Foole,</hi> for ſaying to his ſoule, <hi>Soule, thou haſt much goods laid up for many yeares, take thine eaſe, eate, drinke, and be merry.</hi> The doome which was denounced againſt him upon that conceit, giveth evidence that he was an egregious foole. It was this, <hi>This night thy ſoule ſhall be required of thee: then whoſe ſhall thoſe things be which thou hast provided?</hi> Thus we ſee what it is to purpoſe or promiſe any thing without the Lord.</p>
                           <p>On the contrary, they queſtionleſſe were well inſtructed in this all-ruling, and over-ruling <hi>Providence</hi> of God, who in all their purpoſes had ever a reſervation to God, as he that ſaid, <note n="e" place="margin">1 Chro 13. 2.</note>

Gods will, will we, nill we, ſhalbe accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. If then we will nothing, but that which may ſtand with Gods will, in the effecting of Gods will, our will muſt needs be effected. And becauſe Gods will ordereth and diſpoſeth all things to the beſt, on the ſame ground, that which we will muſt needs fall out to the beſt. But ſuppoſe our will ſhould wiſh any thing that God would not have: what skilleth it? We may know what we would have: but God knoweth what we ſhould, and ſhall have. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore much better that our purpoſe and deſire be croſſed, if at leaſt it be contrary to Gods, then effected. If Gods counſell and determination be accompliſhed (as accompliſhed it ſhalbe) it is enough.

(as we in <hi>England,</hi> according to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient account of moneths and dayes in <hi>Christendome,</hi> doe reckon the time) but the 5. of Nov. (as the late Gregorian account reckons it.) <note place="margin">The occaſion of the great concourſe.</note>On that day a common report went up and downe, farre and neare, that one <hi>Drurie,</hi> a Romiſh Prieſt would preach in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone, in a faire houſe in <hi>Black-Friers London,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they that would, might freely come to heare him.</p>
                           <p>Vpon this <hi>Rumour</hi> (fame alſo ſetting an high commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation on the excellency of the mans parts, and eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of his gifts) very many, Proteſtants as well as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, Schollers as well as others, aſſembled thither about three of the clocke in the after-noone.</p>
                           <p>
                              <note place="margin">A Deſcription of the place.</note>The roome where they were aſſembled was a long garret, the uppermoſt ſtory of an high edifice, built with ſtone and bricke.</p>
                           <p>The maine manſion houſe was inhabited by the
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:3436:218"/>
                              <hi>French Ambaſſadour.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>To the foreſaid garret there were two paſſages. One out of the <hi>Ambaſſadours</hi> with-drawing chamber, which was private. The other more common, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the great gate of the ſaid manſion houſe.</p>
                           <p>Vnder the garret was a great ſquare chamber, which one <hi>Redyate</hi> another Popiſh Prieſt had hired for himſelfe. Whereunto Papiſts much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorted, to make confeſſion, and heare maſſe.</p>
                           <p>Vnder that, the fore-ſaid with-drawing chamber of the French Ambaſſadour. And this with-drawing chamber was ſupported with arches of ſtone: being immediately over the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the great houſe.</p>
                           <p>At the South end of the garret, and on the Weſt ſide thereof, there were bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chambers and cloſets which other Prieſts had hired.</p>
                           <p>The bed-chamber at the South end was ſevered from the other part of the garret only by a partition of Wanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cote, which was taken down for the Sermon-time. The length of the garret from North to South was almoſt 40 foot. The bredth but 16
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:3436:218"/>
foot. For, it was within the roofe: and ſo gathered in narrower then the roome below it: which was about 20 foot ſquare.</p>
                           <p>The two fore-mentioned paſſages met on one paire of ſtairs leading to the ſaid garret, which had one onely doore entring into it.</p>
                           <p>
                              <note place="margin">The great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</note>More came to this place, then poſſibly it could hold, ſo as many could not get in, but returned backe againe. Others went into the foreſaid <hi>Redyats</hi> chamber, and taried with him. The whole garret, roomes adjoyning, doore, and top of ſtaires were as full as could be.</p>
                           <p>In the garret were ſet ſome ſtooles, and chaires for the better ſort. Moſt of the women ſate on the floore, but moſt <note place="margin">The preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made.</note> of the men ſtood thronged together. About two hundred are ſuppoſed to be there aſſembled. About the middeſt of the roome was a chaire and a little table before it for the Preacher.</p>
                           <p>All things thus prepared, and the multitude aſſembled, <note place="margin">The Preachers manner of entrance.</note> about three a clock the expected Preacher, having a ſurplice on him girt about his middle with a linnen girdle, and a tip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet of ſcatlet on both his ſhoulders, came in, being attended upon by a man carying in one hand a booke, and in the other an houre-glaſſe.</p>
                           <p>So ſoone as he came to the table prepared for him, he kneeled downe, with ſhew of private devotion a little while. Then riſing up, and turning himſelfe to the people, he croſſed himſelfe, and tooke the foreſaid booke (which was ſaid to be the <hi>Rhemiſh Testament)</hi> out of the hand of the man that followed him: and the houre-glaſſe being ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the table, he opened the booke, and read the Goſpell ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed (according to the direction of the Romiſh Calen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) <note place="margin">The Text.</note> for the 21 Sunday after <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> as that was. That <hi>Goſpell</hi> is recorded by S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Matthew,</hi> chap. 18. 23, &amp;c. The text being read, he ſate downe in his chaire, and put on his head a red cap, over a white linnen one turned up about the brimmes.</p>
                           <p>He made no audible prayer at all: but having read his
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:3436:219"/>
text, he firſt ſpake ſomthing of the occaſion of it (it being the Parable of forgiving debts:) and then propounded three eſpeciall points to be handled out of it.<note place="margin">The principall points hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</note>
                              <list>
                                 <item n="1">1. The debt we owe to God. </item>
                                 <item n="2">2. The mercy of God in forgiving it.</item>
                                 <item n="3">3. Mans unmercifulneſſe to his brother.</item>
                              </list>
                           </p>
                           <p>Having inſiſted ſome while on the miſery of man by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the debt wherein he ſtands bound to God; he paſſed on to declare the rich mercy of God, and the meanes which God had afforded to his Church for partaking thereof. Among theſe he reckoned up the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> and eſpecially preſſed the <hi>Sacrament of Penance,</hi> as they call it.</p>
                           <p>He was diſcourſing on theſe points about halfe an houre, when on a ſudden the floore whereon the preacher and the <note place="margin">The diſmall fall.</note> greater part of his Auditory ſtood, fell downe with ſuch vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, as therewith the floore of the chamber under it (where <hi>Redyate</hi> before mentioned and ſome company with him, were) was borne downe: ſo as both the floores, the beames, girders, joyces, boards and ſeelings, with all the people on them, fell downe together upon a third floore, which was the floore of the <hi>French Ambaſſadours</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing chamber, ſupported with ſtone arches, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid.</p>
                           <p>Here by the way, the Providence of God in the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Ambaſſadour,</hi> is remarkable. This with-drawing <note place="margin">The Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour abſent.</note> chamber was next to his bed-chamber. He had oft recourſe thither. It was ſaid by his Attendants that that very after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone. he was in that withdrawing chamber: and that not long before the ſermon he came out of it to go to the Court.</p>
                           <p>There being a partition on the South ſide of the middle chamber which reached up to the floore of the garret, and <note place="margin">How many of the Auditory fell not.</note> ſupported it, that part of the garret which was beyond that partition South-ward, fell not: ſo as all the people thereon were ſafe. Onely they had no way to get out. For, there was but one entrance into the garret, which was at the North-West corner. Hereupon ſome thorow amazement
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:3436:219"/>
would have leaped out of a window, almoſt forty foot from the ground. But the people without told them of the danger if they leapt downe, and ſo kept them from that deſperate attempt. At length by breaking the wall on the Weſt ſide, they diſcerned chambers adjoyning thereto: and thorow the hole which they made, they crept into thoſe chambers, and were ſaved.</p>
                           <p>All that ſtood on the ſtaire-head at the doore leading into the garret, were alſo ſaved. For, the ſtaires were without the roome, and nothing fell but the floores: nor walls, nor roofe.</p>
                           <p>Among thoſe that fell, many eſcaped: for, ſome of the <note place="margin">Who fell, but eſcaped death.</note> peeces of timber reſting with one end on the wall, and with another on the third floore that yeelded not, both ſuch as abode upon thoſe peeces, and ſuch as were under them, were thereby preſerved. A Miniſter that was there and fell with <note place="margin">He himſelfe told me this ſtory.</note> the multitude, thorow the providence of God fell ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt two pecces of timber, as that timber kept his upper parts from cruſhing, and helpt him, by his claſping about the timber, to pull out his feet from among the dead corps.</p>
                           <p>Among others the preſent preſervation and future de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>Parker</hi> is very remarkable. This <hi>Parker</hi> was a <note place="margin">One that eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped death in the fall, ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> kind of factor for Engliſh Seminaries and Nunnes beyond ſea, eſpecially at Cambre. He ſo dealt with two brothers of his in <hi>England,</hi> as he obtained of one a ſonne of his, and of another a daughter, to ſend them to religious houſes (as thoſe ſuperſtitions places are called) beyond Sea. This <hi>Parker</hi> tooke his <hi>Nephew,</hi> a youth of 16 yeares age, to the fore-mentioned fatall conventicle, where <hi>Drury</hi> preached. Both theſe, <hi>Parker</hi> and his <hi>Nephew</hi> fell with the reſt. The youth there loſt his life, but <hi>Parker</hi> himſelfe eſcaped with a bruiſed body, being a corpulent man. So farre was he from praiſing God, as with much diſcontent he wiſhed that he had died for his <hi>Nephew,</hi> and ſaid, that God ſaw not him ſit to die among ſuch Martyrs. Strange Martyrs! Yet not ſo ſtrange, as thoſe martyrs which died under gallowſes and
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:3436:220"/>
gibbets for treaſon. Such are Romes martyrs. But about ten days after this <hi>Parker</hi> ſhooting <hi>London</hi> bridge with his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid <hi>Neece,</hi> whom he was conveighing over Sea, both were caſt away in the <hi>Thames.</hi> Iudge hereby (O Parents) whether God be well pleaſed with committing your children to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts for education.</p>
                           <p>But to returne to our ſtory.</p>
                           <p>Others there were, that were pulled out alive, but ſo brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, or ſo ſpent for want of breath, as they died within few houres after, others within few daies after.</p>
                           <p>The floore of the chamber immediately over this, where <note place="margin">Cauſes of their death.</note> the dead corpſes lay, being fallen, there was no entrance hereunto, but thorow the <hi>Ambaſſadours</hi> bed-chamber: the doore whereof was cloſed up by the timber of the floores that fell downe. The wals of this roome were ſtone: onely one window therein, with extraordinary croſſe iron barres. Thus, though Smiths and other workemen were ſent for, yet it was more then an houre before ſuccour could be affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded unto them.</p>
                           <p>When paſſage was made for others, I had acceſſe into the roome, and viewing the bodies, obſerved ſome (yet but few) to be mortally wounded or bruiſed with the timber; others to be apparently ſtifled, partly with their thick lying one on another, and partly with the duſt that came from the ſeeling that fell.</p>
                           <p>On the Lords Day night when they fell, there were num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred <note place="margin">The number flaine.</note> 91 dead bodies: whereof many of them were ſecretly conveighed away that very night. For, there were a paire of water ſtairs leading out of the garden, appertaining to that houſe, into the <hi>Thames.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>On the morrow following the <hi>Coroner</hi> and his <hi>Inquest</hi> comming to view the bodies, found remaining but 63.</p>
                           <p>Of thoſe that were caried away, ſome were buried in a <note place="margin">Their buriall.</note> burying place within the Spaniſh Ambaſſadours houſe in Holborn, among whom the <hi>Lady Webb</hi> was one, the Lady <hi>Blackstones</hi> daughter another, and one <hi>Miſtris Vdall</hi> a third. <hi>Maſter Stoker</hi> and <hi>Maſter Bartholomew Bavine</hi> were buried
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:3436:220"/>
in S. <hi>Brides</hi> pariſh. <hi>Robert Sutton, Iohn Loccham,</hi> and <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gail Holford</hi> in S. <hi>Andrewes Holborne; Captaine Summers</hi> wife in the vault under <hi>Black-Friers</hi> Church, and her woman in the <hi>Church-yard.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>For the Corpſes remaining two great pits were digged, one in the fore-court of the ſaid <hi>French Ambaſſadours</hi> houſe, 18 foot long, and 12 foot broad, the other in the garden be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind his houſe, 12 foot long, 8. foot broad: In the former pit were laid 44 corpſes, whereof the bodies of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named <hi>Redyat</hi> and <hi>Drury</hi> were two. Theſe two wound up in ſheets were firſt laid into the pit: and a partition of looſe earth to ſever them from the reſt. Then were others brought: ſome in ſomwhat a decent manner, wound up in ſheets: but others in a more lamentable plight, the ſhirts onely of the men tied under their twiſt: and ſome linnen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied about the middle of the women: the other parts of their body naked: one poore man or woman taking a corpſe by the head, another by the feet: and ſo piled them up al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to the top of the pit.</p>
                           <p>The remainder were put into the other pit in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</p>
                           <p>Their manner of buriall ſeemed almoſt (if not altogether) as diſmall, as the heape of them when they lay on the floore whereupon they laſt fell.</p>
                           <p>No obſequies or funerall rites were uſed at their buriall. Onely on the day after, a blacke croſſe of wood was ſet upon each grave. But ſoone was it by authority commanded to be taken downe.</p>
                           <p>Thus they being interred, thorow ſearch was made about the cauſe of the failing of the timber. The timber of <note place="margin">The ſcantling of the timber that brake.</note> each floore was laid together: and the meaſure of the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miers that brake, taken.</p>
                           <p>The maine Summier which croſſed the garret was ten inches ſquare. Two girders were by tenents and mortaiſes let into the midſt of it, one juſt againſt another. The Summier was knotty where the mortaiſes were made: whereupon being over-burdened, it knapt ſuddenly aſunder in the midſt</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="400" facs="tcp:3436:221"/>
The maine Summier of the other floore that fell was much ſtronger, being 13 inches ſquare, ſmooth and ſound e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where, no knot in it: neither did the girders meet ſo juſt one againſt another. Yet that alſo failed: not in the middeſt, as the uppermoſt, but within five foot of one end, and that more ſhiveringly, and with a longer rent in the timber, then the other. For, this chamber was almoſt full with ſuch perſons as comming too late to get into the ſermon, went into <hi>Redyats</hi> chamber. Beſides, it did not only beare the weight which lay on the upper floore, together with the weight of that floore that fell, but alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived all that weight with a ſudden knock; and ſo the maſſy timber ſhivered in two, as ſuddenly as the other knap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped aſunder, and the people were irrecoverably downe (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they could feare any ſuch thing) on the third floore, which was above 20 foot from the firſt.</p>
                           <p>If this be not an evidence of the eye and hand of the divine <hi>Providence,</hi> both ſeeing and ordering things below, what evidence can be given thereof?</p>
                           <p>True is that of the Wiſeman, <hi>All things come alike to all.</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">Eccl 9. 2.</note> 
                              <hi>There is one event to the righteous and to the wicked,</hi> &amp;c. There is nothing that befalleth any one, but may befall every one. And even ſuch an accident may befall an aſſembly of true worſhippers of God, as either the floore to fall under them, or the roofe and walls to fall upon them. For,</p>

How farre mine owne pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe was from any ſuch purpoſe, God is my witneſſe.

                           <p>IN the two verſes before my Text, it is ſaid, that there <hi>were left of the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zites, and the Hivites, and the Iebuſites, who were not of Iſrael:</hi>

They were too meane and unmeet perſons, for a function ſo high and honourable. On <note place="margin">Who not fit for Warre.</note> the contrary, in the words immediately before my Text, it is ſaid, <hi>Of the children of Iſrael, did Salomon make no ſervants for his worke.</hi> They being men of better note and name, were <note place="margin">2 Chron. 8. 9.</note> reſerved for a more honourable imployment, which my Text thus expreſſeth, THEY were MEN of WARRE; which words are inferred on the former, by way of oppoſition, with this adverſative Particle BVT. They were <hi>no ſervants for worke:</hi> BVT THEY were MEN of WARRE. As the meaner and baſer ſort were made <hi>ſervants for worke,</hi> ſo <note place="margin">Who fit for Warre.</note> the better and excellenter ſort were made <hi>Souldiers for War.</hi>

For, ſome of our Shires are larger then ſome of their Tribes were: and yet our Shires are in number above foure times more then their Tribes were: For, wee have <note n="*" place="margin">In England 39. in Wales 13.</note> above foure times twelve ſhires.

                           <head>§. 18. Of warlike recreations.</head>
                           <p>WEre your Artillery exerciſes onely for recreation, they are the beſt recreations that can be uſed. Were there at this time no need or uſe of them, they may be heraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of abſolute neceſſity. Delight in the things which men do, ſwalloweth up the pains that is taken about them, makes men the more diligent and conſtant in their exerciſes, and bringeth them to the greater experience &amp; perfection there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. Not only expert ſouldiers, but experienced Captains alſo are made by Military recreations uſed in <hi>Artillery Gardens.</hi> So as if ſuddenly Armies were to be raiſed of more men then all the Military Companies can afford, yet might ſufficient ſtore of Captains, and other Commanders and Officers be taken out of your Companies to governe and guide, to inſtruct and encourage ſuch as for want of former exerciſing were altogether inexperienced. Of the <hi>fifty thouſand</hi> that out of <hi>Zabulon</hi> came to <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Hebron,</hi> by way of commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it is ſaid that they could <hi>ſet a battell in array, and lead an</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">1 Chron. 12. 33, 38.</note> 
                              <hi>army.</hi> This implieth, that by their practiſing of Artillery ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes, they were all able to lead and order armies, to ſet them in array, and go before them. Beſides the policy of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nations and ages, our <hi>Anceſtors</hi> will diſcerned the need, uſe, and benefit of ſuch recreations as might fit men for War: which moved them to make ſuch ſtrict Statute Lawes for the exerciſe of ſhooting, as they did: For,</p>
                           <p n="1">1. Every Maſter of a Family (except ſpirituall men, &amp; Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <note place="margin">9. Statute in 33. yeare of Hen. 8.</note> of one Bench or other) was to exerciſe ſhooting himſelf.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. He was to keep bows &amp; arrows continually in his houſe.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. He was to bring up thoſe that were in his houſe in the exerciſe of ſhooting.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. If he ſuffred any betwixt the age of 7 and 17, ſon or ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to abide in his houſe without bow or arrowes a moneth together, for every ſuch default he was to pay 40 ſhillings.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. If a ſervant took wages, his Maſter might buy him bow, and arrowes, and deduct the price out of his wages.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. If any man-ſervant betwixt the yeares of 17 and 60,
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:3436:236"/>
that took wages, were a moneth without bow and arrowes, for every ſuch default he forfeited 6 ſhillings and 8 pence.</p>
                           <p>In thoſe daies guns (the ſure and ſore meſſengers of death) were not ſo in uſe as now they are. Strength and skill in ſhoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting was it that made our Engliſh nation famous for War. Their exerciſe therof in time of peace, and that for recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, made them ſo expert as they were therein, at times of War. The <note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 48. 22.

                           <p>Such recreations in peace as are preparations unto War, juſtly deſerve to be reckoned up among thoſe neceſſary vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations whereby Polities are preſerued: and while you are exerciſing your ſelves therein, you are imployed in your cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and you go on in that way, where in <hi>God</hi> promiſeth to <hi>give his Angels charge over you, to beare you up in their hands,</hi>

                           <p>VVHen I duly weigh that little which hath been ſaid, and withall conſider how much more might be ſaid of, and for the warrant, honour, need, uſe, and benefit of your Artillery profeſſion, I cannot ſufficiently wonder at the blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, careleſnes, improvidence, and ſecurity of this our age, in neglecting and diſ-reſpecting a matter of ſo great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, ſo nearly concerning the glory, tranquillity, and ſafety

Me thinks that it is more then meet that every City and Corporation, if not every Towne and Village through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Land, ſhould have an <hi>Artillery Garden:</hi> and that the great populous Cities, eſpecially LONDON, ſhould have as many <hi>Artillery Gardens,</hi> as it hath <hi>Wards:</hi> and that publique allowances ſhould be afforded to ſuch as willingly offer themſelves to theſe Military exerciſes. I have heard of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall legacies and bountifull donations given for making Cawſies, mending High-waies, building Bridges, and other ſuch like works, but little or nothing for purchaſing and maintaining <hi>Artillery Gardens,</hi> and the Warlike exerciſes appertaining thereto.

                  <head>Since <hi>Englands Deliverances</hi> (noted in <hi>The Churches Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,</hi> §. 93.) were printed, I found a remarkable one omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which I had rather ſhould be here ſet out of place, then not ſet downe at all. <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Camden</hi> thus relates it.</head>
                  <p>OVt of the ſmothered fire of the rebellion in the <hi>North,</hi> there brake forth as it were out of the embers, a new flame, at <hi>Naworth</hi> in <hi>Cumberland</hi> neare the wall of <hi>Severus,</hi> called <hi>Picts Wall:</hi> kindled by <hi>Leonard Dacres</hi> ſecond ſonne to <hi>William Lord Dacres of Gilleſland.</hi> This <hi>Leonard Dacres</hi> (when the <hi>Lord Dacres</hi> his <hi>Nephew</hi> by his elder brother di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) ſtomacked much that ſo goodly an inheritance was come by law to his <hi>Neeces</hi> (whom the <hi>Duke of Norfolke</hi> their father in law had betrothed to his ſonnes) and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced ſuit againſt them: which, when it proceeded not according to his deſire, he fell to plotting and practicing with the <hi>Rebels.</hi> But when they had taken up the banners of <hi>Rebellion</hi> ſooner then he thought, and were proclaimed Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to their Country, whiles he was at <hi>Court,</hi> he was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to ſalute the <hi>Queene,</hi> tendring her his beſt ſervice againſt the <hi>Rebels,</hi> and in that reſpect was ſent home againe.
