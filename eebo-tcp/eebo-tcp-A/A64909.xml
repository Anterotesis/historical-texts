            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A Just Reprehension to <hi>Iohn Norris</hi> of <hi>Newton</hi> St. <hi>Loe,</hi> for his Unjust Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction on the <hi>Quakers,</hi> in his Book, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled, <hi>Reflections upon the Conduct of Human Life,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Iohn Norris,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Need no Apology for this brief Reprehension, if thou think'st I do Review the first page of thy Epistle Dedicatory, (viz.) <hi>He that shall point out any of the Irregularites or Mistakes of the Conduct of Human Life, ought to be lookt upon as a universal Friend, and promoter of the publick Happiness; and the more severe he is in his Censure (provided it be true and well grounded) the more charitable he is in his undertaking, and the more like to be serviceable in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When first I perused thy Reflections upon the Conduct of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Life, with reference to the studdy of Learning and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, I was and still am pleased with all that tends to the propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Original and necessary Truth, but rejoyce where I find it spring from an upright mind, pure intention, and clean Vessel; for whoso undertakes to reprehend the intelligible Conduct of Human Life, ought first to purge himself from the Irregularities of his moral Conduct, which doth cloud and darken his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.</p>
            <p>Howbeit, I was so far from a Spirit of Detraction or Emulation, that considering from whence it came, I in some sort rejoyced in it so far as it was sound and true, hoping and desiring that what was either clearly and rightly detected, or equally and fairly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended, might gain upon the Understanding of such whose
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55044:3"/>
Education and Literature had either prejudiced, or at best mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stated and unfitted them for receiving the same Truth, and divine Principle by meaner Instruments, respecting worldly esteem; which Principle hath been and is by many such faithful Witnesses plentifully born testimony to, as well by doing as suffering, by the supposed learned Rabbies of our day, as also by Doctrine, in Word and Writing, though not altogether under some of thy Terms, or pretended Phylosophical Notions; yet according to the Demonstration of the Spirit, and in words approved and chosen of God to make known himself by, and taught us in the holy Scriptures, God having in his divine Wisdom in this Age, as in former Ages, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.27, 28, 29. <hi>Chosen the foolish things of the world to Confound the Wise; and the Weak things of the world to Confound the things that are mighty, and base things of the world, and things that are despised hath God chosen; yea, things which are not, to bring to naught things which are, that no Flesh should glory in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.</hi> Agreeable to this is that divine acknowledgement of Christ Jesus to his Father, <hi>Matth.</hi> 1.11, and 25. <hi>I thank thee, O Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth, that thou hast hid these things from the Wise and Prudent, and hast revealed them unto Babes.</hi> Matth. 18.10. <hi>Take heed that ye despise not one of these little Ones</hi>: I fear thou art guilty in this perticular, <hi>viz.</hi> of despising the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of God in this Age through the meanness of the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; Consider what is said, <hi>Thes.</hi> 10.4.8. <hi>He therefore that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath also given unto us his holy Spirit.</hi> From the too apparent Reflection thou makes in the 77th page of thy Book <hi>New Edition,</hi> one might at first think, that thou wert a great stranger to the Conversation of the People, called <hi>Quakers,</hi> and more especially to their Writings, which had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warily subjected thee to a rash and immature Censure, in rendring them dark, aukward, untoward, and unprincipled in the way of representing their Principle, <hi>viz.</hi> the Light within, thereby dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crediting, as thou sayest, one of the noblest <hi>Theories</hi> in the World; but the thing in it self, rightly understood, is true. I being under some dissatisfaction about these Expressions of thine, took occasion to visit <hi>Ioseph Langton</hi> of <hi>Newton</hi> St <hi>Loe,</hi> a person of my respect and acquaintance, and near Neighbour of thine, with whom I had some discourse about thy aforesaid Book, and in perticular the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55044:3"/>
above recited passage, recommending to him <hi>Robert Barclay's</hi> Apology for the true Christian Divinity for thy perusal, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving understood by him, thou hadst been Conversant with it, I confess it extreamly dampt me, and gave occasion for other thoughts than a supposed Ignorance of the Persons, and manner of their representing their Principle, whom thou hadst thus evilly treated, and exposed without reason or provocation as I know of; and now I shall proceed to show thee wherein, though I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume thou already knowest: <hi>Robert Barclay</hi> in his fifth and sixth Propositions treating of this universal and saving Light of Jesus Christ, page 110. calls it <hi>supernatural Light and Grace,</hi> quotes <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.9. <hi>That was the true Light which lighteth every man that cometh into the World.</hi> Which place, as he observes, doth so clearly favour the <hi>Quakers</hi> Doctrine, that it is called their Text; hence he draws this necessary Conclusion, That the Life that is in him, <hi>viz.</hi> the Word Christ, is the Light of Men, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.4. In other places he calls it according to Divine Instruction, The Seed sown in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral sorts of Ground, The Word of the Kingdom, The Word of Faith, The Implanted or Ingrafted Word which is able to save the Soul; quoting <hi>Cyrillus Alexandrinus, Clemens Alexandrinus, Augustine, Buchanan,</hi> &amp;c. in confirmation of this Doctrine, as thou mayst see at large, whereby it appears, whatever thou art, he was so far from the Ambition of being thought the first promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gator of that heavenly Doctrine of the Universallity and Suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of this Light within for Salvation, that he rejoyces to meet with it, imbracing it where-ever he finds it, improves the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest of it, and instead of calumniating its Votaries, represents it to the world, Cleared from the Rust of darker Ages, and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taged with the Confessions and Testimonies of purer Primitive Times.</p>
            <p>And now I Enquire, what are the Dark, aukward and unto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Expressions, and unprincipled way of representing this Principle that thou alledgest the <hi>Quakers</hi> are guilty of? are any of these here quoted out of the afore-mentioned Author part thereof? or in what other Book or Writing of the <hi>Quakers</hi> may they be found?</p>
            <p>I shall now farther say, that this <hi>Divine Word,</hi> Light, Grace and Truth, or whatever else it hath been called by its Followers
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55044:4"/>
through divine instruction in any age, is a wise and understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spirit, Holy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> according as 'tis written in the Book of <hi>Wisdom,</hi> Chap. 7. <hi>In all Ages entring into holy Souls, maketh them Friends of God and Prophets.</hi> And in Chap. 4. vers. 4. Its said, <hi>Into a malicious Soul Wisdom will not enter, nor dwell in the Body that is subject unto Sin; for the holy Spirit of Discipline will flie Deceit, and remove from Thoughts that are without understanding, and will not abide when Vnrighteousness cometh in; for Wisdom is a loving Spirit, and will not acquit a Blasphemer of his Words, for God is witness of his Reins, and a true beholder of his Heart, and a hearer of his Tongue.</hi> Vers. 8. <hi>Therefore he that speaketh unrighteous things can't be hid, neither shall Vengeance when it punisheth pass by him.</hi> Now seeing these Sayings are true and righteous, and that it is possible to profess this Doctrine of the Divine Word, Light, Grace, Spirit of Wisdom and Truth, and the Teachings of it, and yet not possess it nor be learned of it, nor led by it, but whilst preaching of it to others, but a Cast away: I advise thee to consider in what ground and nature thou yet stand'st and liv'st in, and what Spirit lives and rules in thee: hath not Unrighteousness entred in through Self-love and Esteem, which blinds the Eye, and causeth the Tongue to speak unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous things? Is not Self exalted to sit in the Temple of God, as God in thee? And art thou not decking thy self with thy corrupt wisdom, which is the forbidden Fruit, and will prove folly in the end? Be not high-minded, but fear, so shalt thou learn the Ways of the Lord, and walk therein safely, and have unity and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with the Saints in Light, not in the talk and profession of it only, though never so high; for with the Heart man must believe, before with his Mouth Confession is made unto Salvation.</p>
            <p>Who knows this Work, can glorifie God, and bear Testimony of his Son Christ Jesus; and the work he hath done in his earthen vessel, which none else could do, <hi>viz.</hi> of Sanctification &amp; Redemption through the Truth, whose Word is Truth, whereof he hath made many living Witnesses to the Praise of his Name, whose own Works praise him, and to the joy of the upright for evermore. And this is better and beyond all the high Notions, and Self-conceited Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations from the wisdom that is below, and who is brought to this estate, and abide therein, walking in Wisdom's Path, dare not speak unrighteous things, knowing he cannot be hid, nor be
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55044:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a Blasphemer of his words; for God is witness of his Reins, and a true beholder of his Heart; know therefore, its not a light thing to speak Evil of things one understands not; read 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. vers. 12. and <hi>Iude</hi> 10. much less wilfully to blast the Fame of God's Name and Work in the Earth, in and by his People, because they agree not with man's ways and conceited wise Notions, which God's wisdom from above ever did, and will confound; and how great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thou art found gulty in this perticular, by the following Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on thy Postscript may appear: And so I conclude this part, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving discharged my self to thee on the afore-mentioned occasion.</p>
            <p>Since my first perusal of thy Book, I have lately met with thy Postscript, whereby I perceive thou art zealous of being esteemed a Proselite to the <hi>Quakers</hi> Doctrine; I am ready to believe thy above recited Ignominious Reflection, was calculated to obviate such an Imputation, which perhaps thou thought would be as little honour to thee, as they may justly conclude thy Pretentions to their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple would be a Credit to it; for they desire no such Proselites who affects not their Principle for its own sake, but for some worldly Honour and Esteem they hope to get by it; Therefore though theirs, if rightly understood, be true, as thou confessest thy self, page 77. and that it is such <hi>Quakerism</hi> as makes a good part of St <hi>Iohn's</hi> Gospel, and St <hi>Austin's</hi> Works; and according to thy Post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script, if the <hi>Quakers</hi> understood their own Notion, it would not very much differ from thine, which I take to imply a sort of Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to their Principle; for Truth and Error are opposite, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it seems must lie somewhere, and that according to thy Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment must be the <hi>Quakers</hi> Ignorance, how to explain their Notion of the Light, and into what Principles to resolve it; but seeing this would imply a Difference only in <hi>Terminis,</hi> and so not reach thy Case, like one that forgets what he had said last, thou proceeds to magnifie the difference to set thee far enough from being reputed a <hi>Proselite,</hi> which to avoid them needed a greater Discrimination; This I take to be the Design of thy Postscript, where thou undertakes to explain the <hi>Quakers</hi> Principle, by thy Suppositions &amp; false Distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the better to set off &amp; expose thine, by rendring it the more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel to this age, and so to avoid symbolizing with the <hi>Quakers</hi> in thy notion of the Divine Light; how unfairly and unsincerely, as also confusedly, with respect both to their and thy own Principle
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:55044:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thou hast dealt herein, is my present design to manifest; whoso undertakes to Confute the Principles of any People, ought to take them up and state them rightly, and honestly, according as they are believed and owned by themselves, quoting their own Words and Authors, and not barely as he conceives and imagines them to be, as suiting his design: Otherwise he is unjust, and quarrels with his own Shadow, and is like a man that beats the Air, which in thy Postscript thou art found doing; for first thou sayst, <hi>The</hi> Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers <hi>usually talk of this Light within, as of some Divine Communication and manifestation (only:)</hi> How does this appear to be true, thou quotes no Author for it, I apprehend thou intendest hereby, or else thy assertion has little weight or matter in it, <hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>Quakers</hi> own the Light within to be an accident, and not a substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial inherent Principle of Divine Excellency, which is a great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake, and it is to be feared a wilful one too, seeing 'tis generally known, and thou confessest it too, that they quote the Testimony of <hi>Iohn</hi> the Evangelist for their Principle, as thou hast done for thine, they believing according thereunto, Chap 1. vers. 4. <hi>In him was Life, and the Life was the Light of Men</hi>: And if the Life of the Word be the Light of men, then surely the <hi>Quakers</hi> cannot be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to believe it any thing less than a Real Spiritual Substance, which the Soul of man is capable to feel and apprehend; <hi>For all things were made by him, and without him was not any thing made that was made,</hi> John 1.3. Thus thy first distinction falls to the ground: Thy second is as insignificant, and like an Arrow shot at Random, lights on thy own head, being attended with some Contradiction to thy former, <hi>viz.</hi> Thou sayest, <hi>The</hi> Quakers <hi>represent this Light within as a sort of extraordinary Inspiration</hi>: Where learnt thou this? Before it was a Divine Communication and Manifestation only; and now an Extraordinary Inspiration. Thou wouldst have done well to have let the <hi>Quakers</hi> Principle alone till thou hadst learnt it better, and more honestly to represent it: Is not Extraordinary more than Common, or Communication and manifestation (only?) Have not the <hi>Quakers</hi> declared the Light to be Universal, as well as Divine, in its gift and manifestation to the Sons of men? It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly true they have, and yet I deny not but such who apply their minds in Obedience to the teachings of this Light and heavenly Gift, may be made partakers of more, <hi>viz.</hi> extraordinary Gifts
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:55044:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and Graces by the Inspiration of the same Spirit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If for this they have the Name of <hi>Enthusiasts</hi> given them, as in the Section of thy Postscript; Though it be in Derision, they will rejoyce in it, for it shall be as an Ornament of Grace to their Head, and Chains about their Neck. Again, in the same Section thou sayst, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it, viz. <hi>The Light within to be a man's natural and ordinary way of understanding.</hi> And just before thou made it to be the very Essence and Substance of the Deity, which are thy own express words; see thy Confusion and Self-contradiction; by these Words, (<hi>viz.</hi>) a man's natural and ordinary way of understanding, I take thee to intend the same thing as in <hi>page</hi> 77. where thou call'st it Reason and Conscience; and yet at the same time call'st it, <hi>The divine <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and Region of Truth, in which are hid all the Treasures of Wisdom and Knowledge, the great and universal Oracle lodged in every man's Breast, whereof the ancient Vrim and Thummim was an express Type or Emblem.</hi> Here thou Debasest and Confoundest thy Principle, making it to be a part of man's Nature, whereas the Principle or divine Light, as held by the <hi>Quakers,</hi> is a distinct thing from man's Soul, Reason, or natural Conscience, <hi>viz.</hi> a more excellent Spirit and Principle. And herein I confess is a <hi>material Difference</hi> betwixt thy principle of Light, and the <hi>Quakers,</hi> as thou hast exprest it; sure I am it is a great Error to render the Divine <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, by which all things were made, and are upheld, to be no higher a Principle than man's Reason and Conscience, or natural and ordinary way of understanding, which reason is a property Essential to him as Man. I confess, to know the things of a man, according to that Scripture, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9, 10, 11. <hi>But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor Ear heard, neither have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the Heart of man the things that God hath prepared for them that love him, but God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit; for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the Deep things of God: for what man knows the things of a man save the Spirit of a man that is in him, even so the things of God knoweth no man but the Spirit of God.</hi> Again, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.27. <hi>Neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him.</hi> By which it manifestly appears, that the true knowledge of God and Spiritual things are attained by the Spirit, which is superior to man's rational Principle or natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, which may be defiled, and corrupted, as 'tis said expresly of the Impure, that even their Mind and Conscience is defiled, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.15.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:55044:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>In thy <hi>third Sestion,</hi> thou com'st in with (a <hi>Salvo Errore</hi>) <hi>If I mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake not) the</hi> Quakers <hi>confine their Light within to some certain Objects, namely Morral and Spiritual Truths, in order only to the direction of Practice.</hi> How shouldst thou do otherwise but mistake the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of others, seeing thou art so confused about thine own? how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I must tell thee its no small Fault at such an uncertainty to Expose peoples Principles, and 'tis an abuse to say the <hi>Quakers</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine the Light within: It is Divine, Supernatural and Uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribeable, in it are hid all the Treasures of Wisdom and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; where have the <hi>Quakers</hi> taught otherwise? Have they not testified and declared the Light and the Spirit of Truth are one and the same in <hi>Being,</hi> which will guide into all Truth, <hi>Iohn</hi> 16.13. The <hi>Quakers</hi> believe this divine Light to be the quickness of their understandings to know, and of their wills to love, and practical Truth, and that it assists the natural Faculties of the Soul in the attainments of necessary Arts and Sciences, as well as capacitate it to know and practise Morral and Spiritual Truths. Thou mayst read what the Author to the Book of <hi>Wisdom</hi> says on this subject, in the 9th and 10th Chapters.</p>
            <p>And whereas thou sayst, <hi>The</hi> Quakers <hi>make the Light within a Supplement to Scripture, which they say is not sufficient without it, nor indeed any more than a meer dead Letter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Answer; These words <hi>Supplement to Scripture</hi> are thy own, not ours, and this seems to be a Composition of thy own notion of the <hi>Quakers</hi> Faith concerning the holy Scriptures, without any quotation of their Words or Writings, and as 'tis an objection is built upon thy mistake. In thy former <hi>Section,</hi> viz. <hi>The</hi> Quakers <hi>represent this Light within as a sort of extraordinary Inspiration</hi>; Which hath been already answered, proving the Universallity of the Divine Light in man, which considered, there's no just cause for this as an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection against the <hi>Quakers,</hi> assigning the Scriptures to be insufficient without the Light, because the knowledge of the holy Scriptures cannot occur to the understanding without it, and the formal reason thereof is its presence and manifestation. The <hi>Quakers</hi> believe that Christ Jesus by his divine Light within, doth in these days, as in the Days of his Flesh, expound, fulfil and open to the true Believers the holy Scriptures, which according to the Apostle's exhortation to <hi>Timothy,</hi> Chap. 2.3, 15. <hi>Are able to make wise unto Salvation</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:55044:6"/>
(note) THROUGH FAITH <hi>which is in Christ Iesus.</hi> The word <hi>Supplement</hi> in this sense, I hope, will be found no Error, but according to thy Construction of the <hi>Quakers</hi> representing the Light within as a <hi>sort of extraordinary Inspiration,</hi> Sect 2. <hi>Or special priviledge of a certain order of men their own party,</hi> as in Sect. 4. And then making them to say the <hi>Scriptures with relation only to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Practice,</hi> as thy Lines import, Sect. 3. are not sufficient without it, <hi>nor indeed any more than a meer dead Letter,</hi> is to render the <hi>Quakers</hi> not only singular and Erronious in their Principle of the Light, (which shall be more duly observed in its place) but also Contemptuous of the holy Scriptures, as useless and insufficient to all but themselves, which is a great and hainous abuse of a Society of People, without cause and provocation, and contrary to their publick and known Assertions, both by Word and Writing, who believe according to the same Apostle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> Chap. 2.3.16, 17. <hi>That all Scripture given by Inspiration of God, is profitable for Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, for Instruction in Righteousness, that the man of God may be Perfect, throughly furnished unto all good Works.</hi> And this shall suffice for an Answer to thy <hi>third Section.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>fourth</hi> is a down-right falsity (viz.) <hi>The</hi> Quakers <hi>make their Light within a special Priviledge of a certain Order of men their own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, not indeed as to the possibility, yet they do as to the act making none but those of their own way to be actually inlightned by it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is so abundantly Confuted by the Writings in general of those People, more perticularly in the afore-recited Book of <hi>Robert Barclay</hi>'s, which considering thou hast read, I am the more amazed at thy Assertion: They say all are actually inlightned by it, all are Called, but all have not obeyed, according to these Scriptures, <hi>Micah</hi> 6.8. <hi>He hath shewed thee, O man, what is Good, and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do Iustly, and to love Mercy, and to walk Humbly with thy God,</hi> 1 John 9.3.19. 1 Cor. 13.7. Tit. 2.11. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thy distinction of a possibility, and not actually with respect to the Divine Illumination of this Principle, is trivial, though not with respect to Salvation by it: The Capacity or Possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility is not, nor can be in man abstract from the actual Illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Power and Spirit, no more than seeing if the light be seperate from the Eye; The <hi>Quakers</hi> have, and still do declare, that Christ Jesus, the Light of the World, is the universal free Gift of God, for
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:55044:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the benefit of all men, in order to their Salvation; and is not this Common yet Special priviledge, because dearly purchased and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bestowed on lost man, that thou mayst not want occasion to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the <hi>Quakers,</hi> thou hast so much over-done it in this <hi>Section,</hi> as to contradict thy self in the <hi>fifth</hi>; as for instance, <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. to be actaully inlightned according to thy Principle, is no special privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but the common and universal benefit of all men, yea, of all the intelligent Creation, who all see and understand in this Light of God, without which there would be neither Truth nor Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding: On the contrary, Postscript <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. thou sayst, Thy Light does not formally enlighten or instruct thee, but when thou carefully attends to and consults it, and read what is written in those Divine Ideal Characters: The like Doctrine thou hast, <hi>pag.</hi> 71. of thy Book, <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. and 6. where treating of thy <hi>double illumination of thy divine</hi>

               </gap>, viz. <hi>Fundamentally and Potentially, or else effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally or actually, in the former sense</hi> (thou sayest) <hi>he inlightens every man in the latter, only those who duly consult him, and attend to him.</hi> See what Contradiction thy strained Notions run thee into one while to be actually enlightned, is the Common and Universal benefit of all men; another while only of those who Consult it, and attend to it, and all to avoid being thought to Symbolize with the <hi>Quakers</hi> in thy notion of the Divine Light; thy Distinction of Potentially and Actually can have no more in it than the Difference in the subject, the one universal act of the Word or Light, enlightning every man, comprehends both; these are but new invented terms to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press the most ancient, and more Divinely, and better revealed Truths of the Gospel: Thy <hi>fifth</hi> I take in the first part of it to be the same in substance with thy first, Differing in form of expressions, viz. <hi>The Quakers by their Light within understand some Determinate formed dictate or proposition expresly or possitively directing or instructing them to do so or so</hi>; as in thy first thou call'st it, <hi>some divine Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation or Manifestation ONLY.</hi> Where didst thou learn this defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Quakers</hi> Faith and Doctrine of the Light within? The <hi>Quakers</hi> believe the Light of Christ within to be God's divine Oracle of Wisdom in the Soul, the former Dictater, and determiner of heavenly Propositions, their Directing and Instructing what to choose, and what to refuse, as the original Cause of the knowledge and love of Truth, which are its proper effects. Now wherein is
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:55044:7"/>
the <hi>Quakers</hi> Light, as thou term'st it, Inferiour to that which thou call'st thine, except in the Differing Character thou givest it? they own the Real and Substantial Truth of God, the Life of the Word, the Light of men, as Christ said of himself, <hi>I am the Way, the Truth and the Life</hi>: That this divine Light which is the Light of men, is always in some degree and measure present in the Soul, by which it is upheld either in God's love or anger, the <hi>Quakers</hi> believe; and that in him we live, move and have our being, though with respect to operation after a different manner and measure, and passing the understanding of man. And whereas thou sayest, <hi>Thy Light is only the essential Truth of God</hi>: This is a high presumption, about which I have already shewed thy Confusion in other places, calling it Reason and Conscience, and a man's natural and ordinary way of understanding; consider <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.22.23. <hi>The Light of the Body is the Eye; if therefore thy Eye be single, thy whole Body shall be full of Light: but if thine Eye be evil, thy whole Body shall be full of Darkness; if therefore the Light that is in thee be Darkness, how great is that Darkness?</hi> So may I say, if that Doctrine &amp; Principle thou recommendest to the World for Truth &amp; Excellency, be erronious and faulty, how great is that Error and Fault? Again, thou sayest, <hi>Thy Light is always present to thy understanding, and Intimately united with it still,</hi> Sect. 5. Which in thy sense of the Light, is to say, thy Soul is never without thy Reason and Conscience; I wish they were both reformed, that thou mayst be no more guilty of these and such like false Aspersions; That the Light, as supposing it to be what really it is, <hi>viz.</hi> a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Principle from the Soul is always present to the understanding, which implies its operation upon the natural Capacity, or Organ, the ordinary means of knowing, I conceive is more then can be safely or experimentally said, because the Organ may be hurt, and the understanding in that sense interrupted, and consequently no fit Medium or Receptacle either for the Soul or its Light: besides, the Soul may be absent from the natural understanding, by the interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of Spiritual, as well as Natural causes, and yet present with the Light in its spiritual way of understanding: But to say as thou dost, that <hi>Thy Light is only the Essential Truth of God, and that it is always present to thy understanding, and intimately united with it, and yet that it does not formally inlighten or instruct it, but when carefully at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to and consulted</hi>; seems to discover a Contradiction in it self,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:55044:8"/>
and to the formal Reason of its Being, and Presence, and Sufficiency in the one act of the same Principle, as well as to the state and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Intimate Union; for how can any thing be intimately uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to its Principle, and not partake of its Nature and Influences, which is the reason and manner of its union? And how can this be, and not carefully attended to and consulted? is not this manifest Confusion? That the presence of the Light does enlighten and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct all in some sense and degree, is sufficiently proved by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; By thy word <hi>formally enlighten,</hi> I apprehend thou intendest the operative Exercise, as in page 17. and as here applied to, Light signifies no more than actually to enlighten, <hi>ex parte objecti</hi>; I grant such as do not carefully attend to and consult this Divine Light, does not witness the increases of it unto the Redemption and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Souls.</p>
            <p>It is the Path of the Just that is as the shining Light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day; if the Light, as thou asserts, doth not formally enlighten or instruct, but when carefully attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to and consulted, how then should it quicken and raise the Soul from Death to Life, according to the multiplied Experience of holy <hi>David?</hi> And how doth God speak once, yea, twice, yet man per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth it not? <hi>Iob</hi> 33.14, 15, 16, 17. <hi>In a Dream, in a Vision of the Night, when deep Sleep falleth upon men, in slumbring upon the Bed, then he openeth the Ears of Men, and sealeth their Instruction, that he may withdraw man from his purpose, and hide Pride from man.</hi> Again, in <hi>Isa.</hi> 65. <hi>I am sought of them that asked not for me, I am found of them that sought me not: I said, Behold me, behold me, to a Nation that was not called by my Name.</hi> How frequently doth the Lord complain by his Prophets of his Calling to his people to return and Repent, but they would not answer. <hi>Note,</hi> the Call of God is not without In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction; read <hi>Micah</hi> 6.8. and <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. from 20. to the end. And see what Wisdom does also in <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> how they rebelled against God, notwithstanding he gave his good Spirit to Instruct them. The Testimony of <hi>Iohn</hi> the Evangelist, the 5th and 21st. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.1. 4, 5. <hi>You hath he quickned, who were Dead in Trespasses and Sins; but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love wherewith he hath loved us, even when we were dead in Sins, hath quickned us together in Christ, by Grace ye are saved.</hi> 2 Cor. 4.6, 7. <hi>God who commanded Light to shine out of Darkness, hath shined in our Hearts, to give us the Light of the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:55044:8"/>
knowledge of the Glory of God in the face of Iesus Christ; but we have this Treasure in earthen Vessels, that the excellency of the Power may be of God, and not us.</hi> These and many other Texts abundantly prove that God quickens and enlightens man, before man can turn unto him: Thy sixth and last <hi>Section,</hi> I take to be an extravagant noise and bluster against the <hi>Quakers,</hi> to supply the want of real matter of Objection; what means else so great and general Reflections, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offering any Proof, or reducing it to a perticular Charge, to say the <hi>Quakers</hi> do not offer any rational or intelligible account of their <hi>Light within</hi> proves nothing; to tell the world, as thou dost, they Cant in some loose &amp; general Expressions about the Light, does little else but impose upon trust, which is to beg Credit, whilst thou mentions not what those loose and general Expressions are; but to say they Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm them by the authority of St <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Gospel, is in some sort to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict thy assertion, for so to confirm them, argues they agree to what is there taught, and if so, as is most certainly true, and that the <hi>Quakers</hi> do adhere to those divine Words and Expressions; it looks like too much prophaneness, to account them loose and Cant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and to say, that the <hi>Quakers</hi> understand neither the Light which they profess, nor St <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Gospel, is an Evil presumption, and what if I say Blasphemy, against some that dwell in Heaven. As for thy terms, <hi>viz.</hi> Omniformity of the Ideal world, they may be either thy own, or some borrowed Invention, which not being taught them by the holy Spirit and divine Testimony thereof in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the <hi>Quakers</hi> reject the more, seeing it is such an Idol, that although they sincerely confess and believe in the Light, according to <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Gospel, they shall not be allowed to understand either, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bowing thereto; What art thou O man, that boasteth thy self? art thou wiser than thy Maker? whose Wisdom hath brought forth and taught his People these expressions; Canst thou by searching find out God, or the Almighty unto perfection? I tell thee nay, but God will Confound thy Wisdom, and bring to naught thy under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, wherein it is exalted; for he hath Determined to stain the Pride of all Flesh, the Mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.</p>
            <p>This is written for the clearing of Truth's Testimony from the Rubbish thou hast cast thereon, in good Will to all, and desiring thy Soul's welfare.</p>
