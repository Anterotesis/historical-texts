            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

brought an Action againſt <hi>Titus Otes,</hi> ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon the Statute <hi>de Scandalis Magnatum,</hi>
for very Slanderous and Opprobrious Words,
the Defendant ſuffered Judgment to go againſt him
by default, and thereupon a Writ of Inquiry was
taken out, directed to the Sheriff of the County of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:102020:3"/>
               <hi>Middleſex</hi> to enquire by a Jury of that County, what
Damages the Plaintiff had ſuſteined hereby, and upon a
Motion made at the Court of Kings Bench, a day was
given to the Defendant to ſhew cauſe why that Writ of
Inquiry ſhould not be executed at the Bar of that Court,
which he not doing, it was ordered that it ſhould be
executed at the Bar on this day, and that the High
Sheriff ſhould appear and attend the execution of the
Writ in perſon. Accordingly this day Sir <hi>Peter Daniel</hi>
Knight, and <hi>Samuel Daſhwood,</hi> Eſquire, the preſent
Sheriff of the County of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> came into this Court,
and being placed at the Table at the Judges feet, were
during the Execution of the Writ, covered. Mr. <hi>Tho.
Rous</hi> the preſent Underſheriff managed it, and proceeded

Sheriffs, and Gentlemen of the Jury, His Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
the Duke of <hi>YORK</hi> is Plaintiff, and <hi>Litus Otes</hi>
is the Defendant; And this is in an Action of Treſpaſs and
Contempt, grounded upon the Statute of <hi>SCANDALUM
MAGNATUM,</hi> wherein his Royal Highneſs ſets forth,
That whereas ſuch a Statute was made, prohibiting the
Slandering the Great Men and Peers of the Kingdom, and
the Plaintiff being the KING's Onely Brother, and a
Peer, the Defendant upon a Diſcourſe between him the
Defendant and ſome other Perſons, about a Letter that
the Defendant had then in his Hands, Publickly, Falſly,
and with an intent to ſcandalize the Plaintiff, ſpoke theſe
<hi>Engliſh</hi> words:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This Letter</hi> (meaning the Letter then in the Defendant's
Hands) <hi>coſt Me</hi> (meaning the Defendant) <hi>Nine-pence, and
might have been brought for a Penny; I</hi> (meaning the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant)
<hi>know no Body is the better for it, but that Traytor</hi>
JAMES <hi>Duke of</hi> YORK, meaning the Plaintiff.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, This is not all, the Declaration goes on
further, and ſays, That the Defendant intending further
to ſcandalize the Plaintiff, the Sixth of <hi>December</hi> in the
Thirty fifth Year of this King, upon a Diſcourſe had and
moved by and between him the Defendant and ſome
other Perſons, in the preſence of divers venerable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
ſaid theſe words of the Plaintiff:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Duke of</hi> YORK (meaning the Plaintiff) <hi>is a Traytor;</hi>
And this is laid to the Plaintiff's damage of One hundred
thouſand Pounds: The Defendant has not pleaded, and the
Plaintiff has ſigned his Judgment; and now you, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
are to enquire of the Damages.</p>

               <p>You obſerve, Gentlemen, the Words
are acknowledged by the Defendant's default, and not
pleading; ſo that they were ſpoken, is owned by him,
and you are to enquire only of the Damages: And, I
think, there will need nothing to be ſaid for the Aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them, they are Words of the higheſt Nature, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of Slander and Scandal, that can be ſpoken or
thought of, Accuſing Him of Treaſon. We ſhall only
call you ſome Witneſſes to prove this way of Diſcourſe to
be his conſtant habit in all places, and among all perſons
and Company, inveighing againſt the Government, and
particularly againſt his Royal Highneſs the Plaintiff; and
then you will, I know, give ſuch Damages, as may be fit
to repair the Plaintiff's Honour.</p>

truth is, the proving of the Words, will demonſtrate the
Malice of them; and the Manner and Circumſtances of
ſpeaking, will make them appear to be ſuch, as need no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to be ſaid for their Aggravation at all: Swear Mr.

Dr. <hi>Otes</hi> and I were ſitting there, and ſome Diſcourſe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened

Villains</hi> (or ſome ſuch expreſſion as he was wont to

I to him, Doctor, you are a good Man at a matter of Fact,

that, we came to ſome high Words about that and other
things, and, among the reſt of the Diſcourſe, he ſaid, <hi>The

Doctor, you lie under a great Error in that, I ſuppoſe, by
miſtaking a Statute made againſt Popery; ſays he, <hi>No mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

Nay, Doctor, you need not call your Men to your Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance,

1679. I happened to come into the Company of <hi>Otes</hi> the
Defendant, upon the account of an Election that was to be
of Parliament-men for <hi>Grinſtead</hi> in <hi>Suſſex,</hi> by the means
of one <hi>Aukland; Otes</hi> was to go down thither in my Lord
<hi>Wharton</hi>'s Coach, and then we came firſt to be acquainted,
and afterwards we frequently did eat together, and became
very well acquainted. And in my Lord <hi>Scrogg</hi>'s time,
when he was Chief Juſtice, there was ſome Preſentment
intended to be brought in by the Grand Jury here at the
Term, againſt his Royal Highneſs for being a Papiſt, and
not coming to Church, and this <hi>Otes</hi> was the main Proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
of it. He was uſed often to come up to me, and ſpeak
to me when he met me; and I was about that time walking
in the Court that was built up here for the Tryal of the
Lords in the Tower, it was after that Grand Jury were
diſmiſſed, which was done a day or two before they uſed
to be diſmiſt in the ordinary courſe, and walking there I
met <hi>Otes,</hi> and ſaid I to him, Doctor, Now you are Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuited,
what will you do now? <hi>Oh</hi> ſays he, <hi>we will do well
enough; there will be a Seſſions after the Term, and there we
will at him again; and we will have no more regard for him,
than if he were a Scavenger of</hi> Kent-ſtreet: And upon that
he was called away from me, and he went away.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi>Otes</hi> went out one morning with <hi>Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ben</hi>
and <hi>Robin Nichols,</hi> two of his men, from his Lodgings
at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> and while he was dreſſing, he ſaid he went
out in order to draw up a Bill of Indictment againſt the
Duke of <hi>YORK;</hi> but he did not do it, becauſe he was
otherwiſe adviſed by ſome perſons, as I heard. Then at
<hi>Michaelmas,</hi> 1682. when he was going to dreſs him, I held
the Baſon to him to waſh, as he commonly had two or
three every day to wait upon him to dreſs him, there came
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:102020:10"/>
in a Gentleman that came newly out of <hi>Suſſex,</hi> I cannot
remember his Name: He asked him how all Friends did in
<hi>Suſſex,</hi> and then fell a talking about the Election of She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs,
and abuſing them that were then choſen, and reflected
very much upon Sir <hi>John Moor,</hi> and called him Rogue, and
ſaid he deſerved to be hang'd up as an Example. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,
he ſaid the City of <hi>London</hi> was fired by the Duke
of <hi>YORK</hi>'s Order, and Sir <hi>Thomas Bludworth</hi> had a hand
in it; and the Forces at <hi>Black-Heath</hi> were to have plunder'd
the City, and killed all the honeſt Proteſtant Diſſenters in
<hi>London:</hi> And this he would prove<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if ever they had a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
to their mind that ſhould ſit. At another time
there was one <hi>Starkey, Henry Starkey</hi> that was concerned in
<hi>Colledge</hi>'s buſineſs at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and one Mr. <hi>Paſchall,</hi> and, I
think, Capt. <hi>Clare,</hi> and ſome others that uſed to keep him
Company, and Mr. <hi>Otes</hi> ſtep'd up on a ſudden, and ſaid,
<hi>The Duke of</hi> YORK <hi>was a Son of a Whore, and he ſhould
live to ſee him hanged; and if they could but get a Parliament to
their mind, they would ſoon ſend the Duke and all his Gang out of</hi>
England, <hi>for he must never expect to ſucceed to the Crown.</hi>

               <p>The Duke of <hi>YORK,</hi> and <hi>London</hi> was

               <p>It was the laſt time the Duke went into
<hi>Scotland</hi> with her Royal Highneſs, I think it was in <hi>October</hi>
1680. I was commanded over Night to wait at the Duke's
Lodgings, till a Paper ſhould be delivered me by my Lord
<hi>Rocheſter;</hi> I ſtay'd there till Twelve a Clock at Night, and
not ſeeing my Lord come out, I went away, and came
early the next Morning. And when the Duke and
Dutcheſs went to take water at the <hi>Privy-Stairs,</hi> I came
down through the Guard-Chamber, and Dr. <hi>Otes</hi> was in the
Gallery that leads betwixt that and the Gate; when he ſaw
me, I bid him, Good Morrow Doctor, or he bid me, Good
Morrow; one of the two, I cannot exactly tell which:
Says he to me, <hi>You will never leave, till you have loſt your Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</hi>
Why, what is the matter now, Doctor, ſaid I, I
hope my Reputation is not hung upon ſo ſlender a Thread,
as to be loſt for my going any where? Says he, <hi>You have been
with</hi> JAMES: Who do you mean by <hi>JAMES,</hi> ſaid I?
<hi>YORK,</hi> ſays he. Surely, ſaid I, it might have been the
Duke of <hi>YORK,</hi> or his Royal Highneſs: <hi>No,</hi> ſaid he,
<hi>he is a Raſcal, a Papist, and a Traytor, and I hope to live to ſee
him hanged.</hi> Truly Doctor, ſaid I, now let me give you a
little advice to govern your Tongue and your Paſſions, I
aſſure you they will do neither you nor your Cauſe good;
it may do you a great deal of hurt in time, if you do not
take care.</p>

               <speaker>Lord Chief Juſtice.</speaker>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Otes, Titus Otes</hi> you mean.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Warcup.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, my Lord, the Room had a Partition
by a Hanging or Curtain, and I was firſt in the other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
beyond the Partition, and there ſome Body began a
Health to his Royal Highneſs the Duke of <hi>YORK;</hi> this
Health went round, and <hi>Otes</hi> was, it ſeems, in the next
Room, and heard this Health I ſuppoſe: when I came into
Sir <hi>William Jennings</hi> Company, <hi>Otes</hi> was gone; the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
there told me what <hi>Otes</hi> had ſaid, as Sir <hi>William Jennings</hi>
has declared, they all agreed thoſe to be the words, <hi>That
he had ruined or betray'd the Nation; and if the Devil had a hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
place in Hell than other, he hoped he would beſtow it upon him.</hi>
I met <hi>Otes</hi> afterwards, and asked him why he would ſpeak
ſuch irreverent words of the DUKE? His Anſwer was,
<hi>He was a Traytor, and was in the Plot;</hi> and he told me, <hi>I
was a</hi> Yorkiſt, <hi>and he would remember me for it.</hi>
               </p>

               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Did not that afright you, Mr. <hi>Warcup,</hi> to
have him threaten you ſo?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Warcup.</speaker>
               <p>I had then an Impeachment againſt me,

            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord Chief Juſtice.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Warcup.</speaker>
               <p>They did all agree thoſe to be the Words;
and I met him afterwards, and asked him why he would
ſpeak ſo Irreverently of the Duke, conſidering he was the
King's Brother, and as virtuous a Prince as trod upon the
Earth: Says he, <hi>He is a Traytor, and in the Plot; and you
are a</hi> Yorkiſt, <hi>and I will remember you for it.</hi>

               <speaker>Mr. Sol. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>We ſhall only call one more, to ſhew in
what mind he continues to be, even ſince this Action brought.
Swear Mr. <hi>Charles Chapman.</hi>

            </sp>

               <speaker>Mr. Chapman.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I met Mr. <hi>Swift,</hi> the Duke of
<hi>YORK</hi>'s Attorney, when he was going over, as he told
me, to demand a <hi>Plea</hi> of the Defendant Mr. <hi>Otes,</hi> and he
deſired me to go along with him, I did ſo; and when we
came to him, Mr. <hi>Swift</hi> told <hi>Otes</hi> the Rules were out, and
deſired to know what he intended to do, whether he would
plead or no. <hi>Otes</hi> asked him, <hi>If he were the Duke's Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney?</hi>
He anſwered him, Yes: Says he, <hi>I do not value the
Duke, nor his Attorney neither, I will plead as I ſhall ſee cauſe
according to Law; I declare I neither love the Duke, nor fear
him:</hi> And ſo turned his back, and was going away, and
comes up again, and ſays to him, <hi>It may be I may be in for
One hundred thouſand Pounds here, but if ever a Parliament ſit,
I do not queſtion but to have ſome Body elſe in my place.</hi> Mr.
<hi>Swift</hi> asked him to explain himſelf who he meant, ſays he,
<hi>Do you come to Trapan me?</hi> and away he went.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, we have now done, if the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
pleaſe to conſider of it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord Chief Juſtice.</speaker>
               <p>Is there any Body here for Mr. <hi>Otes,</hi>
to offer any thing to leſſen the Damages?</p>
               <stage>(To which No Body anſwered.)</stage>
               <p>Then, Gentlemen of the Jury, your Buſineſs now is to
enquire what Damages you think fit to aſſeſs to his ROYAL
HIIGHNESS, by reaſon of the ſpeaking of the Words
mentioned in the Declaration, there being in this Action
Judgment by Default obtained by his ROYAL HIGH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NESS;
and you have nothing now to do, but only to aſſeſs
to the Plaintiff ſuch Damages as you ſhall think fit.</p>
               <p>Now, Gentlemen, though the acknowledgment of this
Judgment (for ſo it is in effect, it being by Default) be
a ſufficient Confeſſion of the Words being ſpoken as they
are laid in the Declaration, yet they have given you Proof
of the very Words.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:102020:12"/>
The Declaration is in an Action grounded upon the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
<hi>De SCANDALIS MAGNATUM,</hi> taking notice that
His Royal Highneſs is a great Peer of this Kingdom, and
His Majeſtie's only Brother; and that <hi>Oates</hi> the Defendant
knowing him to be ſo, to bring him under Reproach and
Calumny, and to cauſe Diſcord to ariſe between the King
and him, and between him and other Great Men, did ſpeak
the words laid in the Declaration which you have heard
read, and which are theſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The firſt are,</hi> This Letter (Oates <hi>having a Letter in his
Hand</hi>) coſt Me Nine-pence, and might have been brought for a
Penny; I know no Body is the better for it, but that Traitor
<hi>JAMES</hi> Duke of <hi>YORK. This is laid over again with a
very little variation,</hi> This Letter coſt Me Nine-pence, and might
have been afforded for a Penny; I know no Body is the better for
it, but that Traitor <hi>JAMES</hi> Duke of <hi>YORK: which are
words of the ſame Sound, and to the ſame purpoſe with
the former; they differ only in ſome minute Circumſtances
a word or ſo, but import the ſame thing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next words are theſe, <hi>The Duke of</hi> YORK <hi>is a Traitor;</hi>
and theſe words too are laid two ſeveral ways, differing
but in very ſmall Circumſtances (<hi>Is a Traitor,</hi> and <hi>Was a
Traitor</hi>) the Subſtance of the words is the ſame.</p>
               <p>Now I ſay, Gentlemen, Though it is not your Buſineſs
to enquire whether or no <hi>Oates</hi> ſpoke theſe words, for by
letting Judgment go againſt him by Default, he doth in
Law confeſs the words, but you are to enquire what Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages
may be fit to be given to the Plaintiff by reaſon of
theſe words; yet in as much as this Caſe is a Caſe of an
extraordinary Nature, Weight and Moment, having rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to ſo great a Prince, His Royal Highneſs the King's
only Brother, requires this extraordinary Solemnity, it ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
not been uſual heretofore, that is to have Writs of
Enquiry executed at the Bar. But the Occaſion is extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary,
ſuch as has not happened before this Age, this
Corrupt Age, this Profligate Age wherein we live, and
wherein common ordinary Fellows, the meer Scum and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:102020:13"/>
Scoundrels of the Factious Party, have taken a Liberty to
reproach and calumniate Magiſtracy and Government, and
the greateſt Perſonages concerned in it, not ſparing even
Majeſty it ſelf, nor Him, who is next in Degree to His
Sacred Perſon, His onely Dear and Royal Brother. And
therefore as the Caſe is extraordinary in its Nature, ſo
ought the Example of it to be made as Publick as can be
in order to ſatisfie all People what a ſort of Fellow this
Defendant is, who has been ſo much adored and looked
upon with an Eye of Admiration, courted with ſo won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
an Affection, and ſo, I had almoſt ſaid, <hi>Hoſanna'd</hi>
among People that have been Factious and Tumultuous
to the Government.</p>
               <p>Such as he, ought to be made Publick Examples of;
and therefore the King's Counſel have deſired that this
Cauſe might be canvaſed here at the Bar, and the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
as he has made himſelf Eminent for ſome particular
Qualifications, might be made a Publick Example for
this Offence.</p>
               <p>Thus this Writ comes to be executed here. Now
though the Words laid in this Declaration are words that
do import in themſelves ſo much Scandal and Reproach,
ſo much Malice and Venom, that they need no Aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
beſides themſelves, and his ſuffering it to go by
Default ſhews they are no way to be extenuated, but are
thereby acknowledged. Yet however to ſatisfie all People
that deſire or have any inclination to be ſatisfied, that this
Proſecution is highly reaſonable, nay abſolutely Neceſſary;
they come here and give you an Account that theſe in the
Declaration are but a ſmall Part of the Scandalous and
Malicious words that the Defendant uſeth concerning the
Plaintiff. And indeed it doth plainly appear, that the Malice
of the Defendant is attended with all the moſt Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian
and Uncharitable as well as Diſloyal and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient
Circumſtances that any thing can be, with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
to Traduce and Diſparage a Subject ſo Loyal,
and a Perſon ſo Great and Illuſtrious as His Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:102020:13"/>
As to the firſt words, you have the firſt Witneſs Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi>
and he gives you this Account, He was in a <hi>Coffee-Houſe</hi>
where he met the Defendant <hi>Oates;</hi> and the Defendant in a
Vain-glorious huffing ſort of manner, takes occaſion though
none was offer'd him by any thing ſpoken to him by any
Body, but only on ſet purpoſe to expreſs his Malice and
Venom againſt the Plaintiff. He takes up a Letter that it
ſeems came to him by the Poſt, and to gratifie his own
malicious Inclination, and to give it vent, he Proclaims,
<hi>This Letter coſt Me Nine-pence, it might have been brought or
afforded for a Penny; and I know no Body is the better for it, but
that Traitor</hi> JAMES <hi>Duke of</hi> YORK.</p>
               <p>So you ſee, Gentlemen, he takes hold of every little Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion,
if he can but happen upon an Opportunity, ſuch as
this was in an open <hi>Coffee-Houſe,</hi> to reek his Malice upon
His Royal Highneſs. And ſure there can be no greater
imputation of Scandal brought upon any Man than
this upon the Plaintiff. That the firſt and greateſt Subject
of the King of <hi>England</hi>'s ſhould be taxed with the greateſt
Crime in the Law, Diſloyalty and Treaſon to his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign.
And ſo at once not only chargeth him with being
Perfidious to his only Brother, againſt that Affection
which by Nature he is obliged to pay him, and which
all that know any thing, cannot but obſerve to have always
been extraordinary; but alſo touches that which is much
dearer to him than his Life, his Honor, by charging him
with the fouleſt of Crimes, Treaſon and breach of his
Allegiance, which as a Subject he owes to his Soveraign.
And thus beſides the Defendant's Confeſſion by this Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
you have the very words proved that are in the
Declaration.</p>
               <p>The next Witneſs is one Mr. <hi>Whaley,</hi> and he gives you
an Account of another Paſſage which I cannot but take
notice of by the way, to ſhew you what a wonderful
Chriſtian Temper this Man is endued with. Mr. <hi>Whaley</hi>
ſays, That being at the Biſhop of <hi>Ely</hi>'s Houſe upon a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Feſtival either of <hi>Easter</hi> or <hi>Whitſontide</hi> (and he is ſure it
was one of thoſe two, <hi>Becauſe,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I never uſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:102020:14"/>
the Sacrament in</hi> London, <hi>but upon one of thoſe two days;
and therefore I take it upon me to ſay it was one of thoſe two days
that I heard theſe words) Oates</hi> having it ſeems received the
Holy Sacrament at the Biſhop of <hi>Ely</hi>'s Chappel with
Mr. <hi>Whaley</hi> that day. When a Body would have thought
that if Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> would have been believed to be ſo Hearty
and Pious a Proteſtant as he pretends to be, he ſhould have
remember'd that he ought, according to the Proteſtant Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
to have left behind him at his approach to the Altar,
all Malice and Rancour, and ill Will and Hatred to every
Body: But you ſee what kind of Deportment his was.</p>
               <p>For after ſuch time as he had been at the Sacrament, he
takes occaſion without any Provocation to fall foul imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
upon his Royal Highneſs, giving him the Name of
<hi>a Profligate Wretch;</hi> and then particularly he comes to ſay,
<hi>The Duke of</hi> YORK <hi>was a Traitor.</hi> This Gentleman being
concerned, as every Honeſt and Loyal Man ought to be,
and I hope every good Subject is, and ever will be, to
hear ſo great a Prince, the King's onely Brother, ſo tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
and vilified, reproved him for it; but ſo far was he
from taking the Correction due to his Extravagant Tongue
in a becoming manner, that he preſently (as the Gentleman
Phraſeth it) calls for his Myrmidons, two Fellows that he
had along with him to come to him, upon which the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
was pleaſed to ſay to him, <hi>Nay, Good Mr.</hi> Oates, <hi>you
need not be in ſo very much fear of your ſelf as to call for your
Men, no Body here intends you any harm.</hi> Nay certainly,
Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> did apprehend himſelf to be ſecure from all
manner of Correction, or he would never have been ſo Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent
to ſpeak ſuch words.</p>
               <p>But you will no doubt take notice, as all Men cannot
but do, of what an excellent Goſpel Spirit, what a delicate
Chriſtian temper the Man is of, after the receiving the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
that very Morning to come and belch out ſuch
extravagant words of Calumny and Reproach.</p>
               <p>And it ſeems this Perſon had obtained to make ſuch a
wonderful Figure in the World, that every Body was afraid
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:102020:14"/>
to ſpeak to him; for you hear what the Witneſs ſays when
he came to beg the Biſhop of <hi>Ely</hi>'s Pardon for being ſo loud
and hot at his Table, the Biſhop gave him Thanks for it,
and told him, <hi>None of us dare ſpeak to him.</hi> Such a Conſiderable
Man hath he been that he might rail againſt the King, and
the Duke, &amp; the Government without Controul. He was got
into ſuch a Poſt that no body durſt meddle with him, but
he muſt have liberty to ſay any thing of any Body. To what
an height of Corruption were we grown, that we could
ſuffer ſuch a Fellow's Inſolence, at which no man living
that has any ſpark of Modeſty or Loyalty left in him, but
muſt Bluſh and Tremble.</p>
               <p>Then they produce to you one Mr. <hi>Johnſon,</hi> who gives
you an Account, that after ſome Diſcourſe between him
and the Defendant <hi>Oates,</hi> about the Duke of <hi>YORK,</hi> he
immediately told <hi>Johnſon,</hi> That <hi>the</hi> DUKE <hi>was either to be
Hanged or Baniſhed;</hi> it ſeems he was ſo Ill a Man in his Eye,
<hi>but of the two, Hanging was the fitter for him.</hi> So the Dr. ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
what a wonderful Kindneſs and Affection he has for
the Duke, and what thoughts he has of his great Deſer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Bowring</hi> is the next Witneſs, and he comes and tells
you, That the Dr. could not be prevailed with to Dine
with the Gentlemen of the Pariſh of <hi>Foster Lane,</hi> becauſe
ſome of them had dined with the Duke, which he calls
<hi>Dining with the Devil.</hi> It ſeems he made as though he would
Preach there to them, he got up into the Pulpit and took a
Text, and pretended to Preach, and if he would have
Preached according to the Duty of a Church of <hi>England</hi>
Divine, he was by that to have Preached not only Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
and Submiſſion to Authority, but Reſpect to Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors,
and Charity among all Subjects towards one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and if he did Preach it, it was worſe in him not to
Practice it. But you ſee after he had performed his painful
laborious Preachment, after he had taken ſuch a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
deal of Pains, as no doubt he did in inſtructing his
Auditors, what his Language is in anſwer to a Civil Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
to Dinner by the Church-Wardens. <hi>Have any of you
Dined with</hi> YORK <hi>at the City Feaſts?</hi> as they not anſwering,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:102020:15"/>
but being ſilently amazed at the impertinent Impudence
of the Queſtion, <hi>why truly he would not Dine with thoſe that had
dined with the Devil.</hi> It ſeems his Royal Highneſs had been
pleaſed to Honor ſome Societies of Loyal Men in the
City of <hi>London</hi> with his Company at ſome Entertainments
they made, and that is a great Offence to the Defendant;
and as for thoſe that had received that Royal Favour from
His Highneſs, he takes notice of them as ſuch whom he
would neither Eat nor Drink with, for <hi>truly they had eaten
and drunk with the Devil;</hi> but immediately the Doctor in his
great Zeal and wonderful concern for the Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
broke up from the Company, would neither Eat
nor Drink with them, but choſe rather to Dine at a
private <hi>Braſier</hi>'s by <hi>London-Wall;</hi> a properer place in
good truth for him, than any ſuch Converſation they
offer'd him.</p>
               <p>Then further to ſhew what mean Thoughts he had
of the Plaintiff, Mr. <hi>Fairfax</hi> he comes and teſtifies, That
there being ſome talk of a Preſentment or Indictment
againſt the Duke of <hi>YORK</hi> by the Grand Jury here, but
that meeting with a Diſappointment, he met <hi>Oates,</hi> and
asked him, <hi>What he would do, for,</hi> ſays he, <hi>now you are Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuited?</hi>
that is, you have happened not to obtain the End
that you deſigned, <hi>Oh,</hi> ſays <hi>Oates, No matter for that, that
is all one, we will at him next Seſsions; and for my part, I will
have no more regard to him than I would to a Scavenger.</hi> Nay,
and becauſe they ſhould ſee the very utmoſt of his Malice,
and the low Thoughts he had of his Royal Highneſs, as
if it had not been Malicious enough to have compared him
to a Scavenger of <hi>London</hi> or <hi>Westminſter,</hi> no, that was a
Station too honorable for him in his Thoughts, but he
muſt neceſſarily be compared to a Scavenger of <hi>Kent-street;</hi>
which we all know to be one of the meaneſt, filthieſt, and
moſt beggerly parts of the Town.</p>
               <p>The next piece of Evidence is, that which is given by
one Mr. <hi>Philips,</hi> and when he came to him, he began to
have ſome Reflexions about the Houſe of Commons and
the Duke; <hi>and truly he did not doubt but he ſhould ſee him at the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:102020:15"/>
Bar of the Houſe of Commons; and it would be no Diſparagement
to him to come there, for there were a great many Members there
that were as good Men or better than he.</hi> And even by this
Fancy of his he would fain degrade His Royal Highneſs;
for in Caſe he had him in no other Conſideration but as a
Peer, he ſhould know that no Peer of this Realm can
be forced by any Vote or Order of the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
to come to their Bar. But he had a mind to take
off his very Privilege of Peerage, and it would be no
leſſening of his Greatneſs, ſince that Houſe had in it
many Members better Men than the Duke himſelf. I
preſume he meant ſome particular Friends of his own
in that Houſe.</p>
               <p>The next Man is one Mr. <hi>Aſhlock,</hi> and he tells you, That
becauſe he would engage all People into an hatred of the
Duke's Perſon, he muſt as a thing of the greateſt Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
in order to it, make it be believed, that the Duke
had a great hand and concern in the Diſmal Fire of <hi>London</hi>
in Sixty Six, that thereby he might make him obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to the Rancour and Malice of all that ſuffered in that
dreadful Calamity. And with what handſom Expreſſion
he cloaths it? <hi>He fired the City of</hi> London, <hi>he is the Son of a
Whore, and we will have him hanged or ſent out of</hi> England <hi>for
it, whenever a Parliament meets.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that here is not only a Perſonal Reflexion, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
Indignity done to His Royal Highneſs, but carries
in it a great Reflexion upon His Sacred Majeſty himſelf
in his Relations, and he is not contented only to belch
out his Venom and Malice againſt thoſe that are alive, but
even againſt thoſe that are Dead too. For you ſee it
is a moſt foul Imputation and Slander againſt Her late
Majeſty the Queen Mother to our Soveraign and His
Brother, by calling him the <hi>Son of a Whore;</hi> which
is an Expreſſion of that Impudent and Inſolent Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as is not fit to be mentioned in a Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:102020:16"/>
Theſe things I think my ſelf obliged to take Notice
of for Example's ſake, and to induce all People to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
to what a height of Corruption we were grown
when ſuch Scoundrel Fellows as this dare to take ſuch
baſe words into his Mouth, of the Royal Family.</p>
               <p>Then comes Captain <hi>Creſſett,</hi> and he gives you an
Account, That when His Royal Highneſs and the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſs
were going laſt to <hi>Scotland,</hi> as the Captain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
from the Duke's Lodgings, he met with the
Defendant, who fell upon him, <hi>What, you have been with
JAMES?</hi> it ſeems he was one of his intimate Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
and very Familiar he was with his Name.
Indeed a Man would have thought, if in Caſe he had
ſpoke as one man ought to ſpeak of another, that he
had been ſpeaking of one of his Myrmidons, and it
would have been a very hard matter to have known
who elſe he meant by that familiar Appellation. Says
the Captain, <hi>What</hi> James? <hi>Why</hi> YORK; and he was
very kind that he gave him that Addition to let him
know what <hi>JAMES</hi> he meant; But when the Captain
chid him, and told him, <hi>Sure you might either ſay the
Duke of</hi> York, <hi>or His Royal Highneſs,</hi> then immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
inſtead of that, he flies out, <hi>He is a Papist, he
is a Traitor, and I hope to live to ſee him Hanged, and
you will go near to loſe your Reputation if you go ſo often
thither.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that I perceive, if he will not be adviſed by
this Gentleman, he ſhould loſe all his Credit; and
yet I preſume it is wonderfully for the Advantage of
Mr. <hi>Creſſett</hi> to loſe the Credit he could get by any
Characters or Commendations ſuch an one as he could
give him.</p>
               <p>Then Captain <hi>Creſſett</hi> kindly adviſed him to take
Care of injuring his Party by his Paſſion, and his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent
Behaviour, and told him, it would turn to his
Prejudice at laſt. And truly now I think, if all his
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:102020:16"/>
Party were in his Condition, and made to ſmart for
the Laviſhneſs of their Tongues, I think it were a good
Accompliſhment of his Prophecy, and if we were rid of
them, we ſhould be more at Peace. And we may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
offence hope to ſee that ſooner, than what the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant
ſays he hoped to ſee.</p>
               <p>The next is Sir <hi>William Jennings,</hi> who tells you of a
Paſſage at the Parliament at <hi>Oxford,</hi> which ſhews his
wonderful Goſpel and Chriſtian temper. When a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of Gentlemen were met together to Drink a Glaſs
of Wine, and were wiſhing Health and Long Life to
His Sacred Majeſty, His Royal Highneſs, and the Royal
Family, he would not be contented to refuſe the Glaſs,
but to ſhew how wonderful a Chriſtian Spirit he was
of, and to evidence his true Proteſtant Charity (and by
his Carriage who was one of the Heads of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
we may gueſs at the Temper of all the Party) he
cries out, <hi>He has ruined the Nation, and if there be any
hotter place in Hell than other, I hope the Devil will preſerve
it for him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I preſume his great Converſation with him he ſpoke
of, hath given him ſome Intelligence there is in Hell
ſome hotter places than others, and who they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
for. But Gentlemen, I ſpeak not this that I
think any thing that is thus proved by the by, doth
in the leaſt aggravate the Damages, for the Words in the
Declaration are as bad as bad can be; but to let you ſee
the diſpoſition of this Man that has been ſo much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired
and courted.</p>
               <p>After him comes Mr. <hi>Warcup,</hi> who tells you, he was
not in the Room with <hi>Oates</hi> when the laſt words were
ſpoken, but coming in immediately after, they all told
him the ſame words, and he afterwards meeting with
<hi>Oates,</hi> and reproving him for his indecent Behaviour and
Expreſſion, inſtead of any remorſe concern that he
had upon him, by reaſon of his having ſpoken ſuch
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:102020:17"/>
words, he doth ſtill add to it, <hi>The</hi> DUKE <hi>of</hi> YORK
<hi>is a Traitor, he is in the Plot; and becauſe you take
his part you are a</hi> Yorkiſt, <hi>and we will be even with you
for it at one time or another.</hi> So he threatens him only
for asking him why he behaved himſelf in ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent
manner towards His Royal Highneſs.</p>
               <p>The laſt Witneſs Mr. <hi>Chapman,</hi> is produced to ſhew
what Mind he continues in. After all this is paſt,
and a body would have thought he might by this time
have been brought to ſome Conſideration and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
to Authority; yet you ſee how the Man is.
The Witneſs tells you ſince the beginning of this Term,
the Declaration being delivered and by the Courſe of
the Court he ought to Plead within ſuch a time, the
Attorney goeth to him for a Plea in order to make
his Defence if he could in the Action now before you,
but he lets Judgment go by Default; and ſo far is
he from repenting of what he had formerly done,
that he perſiſts in it, and tells him, <hi>Are you the DUKE's
Attorney?</hi> Yes. <hi>Well, I care not a farthing for the DUKE
nor his Attorney neither; it may be I may be in here for</hi>
100000 <hi>l.</hi> (and that I believe is one of the trueſt
things he ever ſpoke in his Life) <hi>but ſuppoſe I be, I
do not doubt but when a Parliament meets a time will come
when ſome other People may come in my place.</hi> But tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſince he has declared his Hopes, I think it may
not be amiſs for us to declare ours too; and for my
part, to ſay I hope I ſhall never ſee ſuch a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
