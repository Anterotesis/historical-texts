            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Wherein they Declare their Integrity and Faithfulneſs to the Solemn Engagement of the Army made at New-Market, and Triploe Heaths, June 5. 1647. and to that end have choſen Agitators for their Reſpective Troups; Agreeing and Reſolving not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band or divide, or ſuffer themſelves to be disbanded or divided, till the Freedoms of England be firſt ſetled, and the Rights of the Souldiery obtained, according to the many Declarations and Remonſtrances of the Parliament and Army.</p>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s be juſt and equal, to carry us into another Land before you have made good your Engagement at Home; and that upon ſuch ſleight terms, as if a man ſhould owe a Servant Twenty pounds, and then tell him he will give him Five pounds of the ſame, upon Condition, that he will do another Service for him (which is greater) in another place, and ſurniſh himſelf for that Service with the money which he receives. For who is at the greateſt Charge in the ſetting forth of the Service? Is nor the Two months pay we are to have as our Advance, a part of that which is due unto us for the Service we have already done? and the Horſes we are to ſerve upon, are they not thoſe which we have bought or muſt buy with our own money? Have we left our Trades and Callings, ſpent the prime of our Youth, expoſed our Selves to ſo many Dangers, and many of us ſpent our Eſtates to buy us Horſe and Arms, and now to be thus dealt withall! and not only ſo, but to be made a Reproach to the People, and to be accounted the falſeſt of men by reaſon of your not fulfilling your Promiſes made to the People and us in your Remonſtrances and Declarations, and now to engage us to go out of the Land before we ſee them fulfilled.</p>
            <p>We thought alſo you would have bin ſo reaſonable, as to conſider our condition by your own; For we know you cannot be ignorant of the dearth of Proviſion, both for Man and Horſe: Can any of you Quarter himſelf and horſe one night in an Inne, under four or five ſhillings? Your own Conſciences will tell you that you cannot: How then can we find our ſelves Horſe, and Arms, and Proviſion both for Man and Horſe, at two ſhillings a day, but that we muſt of neceſſity oppreſs the People where we come? And this is the way to make us a Reproach, and to cauſe the People generally to hate us: We therefore entreat you to conſider of theſe things, and to be more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable in your Actings towards us, which will be for your Honour and our Happineſs.</p>
            <p>Further, We deſire that what hath bin here declared, might not be underſtood, as if it were our Deſires to hinder or retard the Service of Ireland; For when we ſhall ſee the Freedom and Liberty eſtabliſhed in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for which we did engage, and which hath bin ſo often Promiſed in your ſeveral Remonſtrances and Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations; As alſo ſuch ſatisfaction for our ſelves as ſhall be reaſonable, we ſhall to the utmoſt of our Abilities engage our ſelves in the Service of that Land, as we have done in this.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, we are reſolved (according to our Engagement) not to go out of the Land, nor ſuffer our ſelves to be divided or disbanded, upon any pretenſe whatſoever.</p>
            <p>In theſe Lines lyeth the ſubſtance of our Deſires and Reſolutions, which we humbly Preſent to your ſerious Conſiderations.</p>
