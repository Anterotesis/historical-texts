            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>BVT what is ſaide of the Church of Englande? Truely that it is no Church but after a ſorte: and why? Becauſe it lacked Diſcipline, for ſo ſay the Papiſtes, that it is not the true Church, but <hi>ſecundum quid,</hi> after a manner. But what of this? This is but a ſlaunder giuen to the church by them, as a citie can not ſtande with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Walles, no more can a Church without Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, yet ſayeth the holy Father Maiſter <hi>Gualter,</hi> writing vpon the Epiſtle to the Corinthians: For lacke of Diſcipline, no man ought to depart from the Church. The ſame Father writing vppon the Epiſtle vnto the Galatians, whiche is applied to Iames King of <hi>Sicile, Ego, ſi quis Diſciplinae formam in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogat, in omnibus gentibus eandem conſtitui non poſſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtimo.</hi> I doo thinke that if any man doo aske of the forme of diſcipline, that the ſame cannot be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in all Countries and Nations through the worlde. In a Catechiſme printed here at London not long agoe, the Scottes Catechiſme, the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is asked, <hi>What may the Elderſhip doe in the Church?</hi> The anſwere is made againe, <hi>Admitte vnto the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mentes, and exclude from them according to God his worde.</hi> Nowe as concerning Prieſtes, it is ſaide that they are worthie of great prayſe, which doo their office

iuſtlie. And Saint Paule ſaith in his 5. Chap. 1. Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moth, The Elders that rule well, were worthie of double honour, eſpecially they which labour in the worde and doctrine, we ſay the place is vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode of the Preachers of the worde. <hi>Peter Verides</hi> and <hi>Nicholas Emingius</hi> in the 133. pa. of their booke ſay, That ſuch Preiſtes are worthie of double ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor. There is one noted, that when he was about the ſame matter and buſines that there is ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of, he affirmeth the Teſtament of <hi>Reames</hi> neuer came into his hands, and in deed I dare be bolde to ſay, it did not, for he inteprreteth the place, that they Which labor are worthie of double honour: but he did not ſpeak of any Miniſters, ſaue only the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which preached the worde ſincerilie. Therefore he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth and maketh difference betweene Preacher &amp; Preacher. I ſay not by the authoritie of the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Reames,</hi> but by the authoritie of holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers or Prophetes, which the Apoſtles doe note. <hi>S.

                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſunt</hi>? but they, which do not labor in their calling <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> ſaith, <hi>Bonus paſtor vitam ponit pro ouibus</hi>: A good Paſtor will lay downe his life for his ſheepe. And againe ſaith <hi>Ciprian, Boni &amp; fideles diſpenſatores, duplici honore digni ſunt. S Ambroſe</hi> ſayth, <hi>Praesbiteri, &amp; qui bene praeſunt vita &amp; doctrina, duplicem moerentur ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norem à ſubiectis quibus praeſunt: Presbiters, and they that doe gouuerne well, bothe in life and doctrine, doe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue double honour of thoſe ſubihctes, whome they rule</hi>: ſo that here we may ſee, he doth vnderſtande the places of the preachers of the worde of God. But they ſay, if we ſhould ſo expound it, we ſhould make the Apoſtle to goe backwarde and not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde. Surelie, nothing leſſe: for this is the ſence, that they which labour, are worthie of double ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: they which do not, are worthy of none. So that here we may ſee that the interpreter doth not
<pb facs="tcp:12891:4"/>
expound this place after the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> or of <hi>Reams</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but <hi>S. Ambroſe, Chriſoſtome</hi> and <hi>Auguſtin.</hi> Here we ſee that the Apoſtle doth ſeeme to make twoo kindes of miinſters: The one which were occupied in the word, but not wel: &amp; why ſhould that ſeme ſtrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge to make two kindes of preachers or mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters? For my part I wiſhe with all my harte that al that are placed in Englande, were better then my ſelf, and that it were ſo through all Nations where the worde of God is preached, and I pray to God, that the Goſpell of Ieſus Chriſte were preached throughout the whole world. The Apoſtle ſayth, that in his time there were many which laboured not ſo much as he. I thanke God (ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle) I laboured better then they all, yet they deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued honor: but not ſo much as he, becauſe they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured not ſo much as he, for God hath not giuen to euery one the ſelf ſame gifte. Furthermore they define this worde (<hi>labour</hi>) is ſpoken to all, as well that are able to doo moſt, as thoſe that are able to doe leaſt: Therefore the Apoſtle writinge to the Theſſ. calleth them labourers, although there were ſome which were wicked amongeſt them. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, they adde this diſtinction is diſſolute, and cleane voyde of true diſcipline, if they bee but Miniſters, and take not ſo great paynes, yet they are worthie of honour, though not ſo great as the reſt, but of the honour of Widowes, and he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of honour of Widowes in Chap. 5. ver 1, 2. Honor the elder women as mothers, the yonger as ſiſters. Honor Widowes whiche are widowes in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deed. The Apoſtle ſaith, Rom. 12.6.7. Seing then that when we haue gifte, &amp;c. And agayne in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt. 1. Cor. Cap. 12.28. God hath ordeined ſome in Churches, as firſte<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c. Therfore they ſay, there muſt be <hi>presbiteries</hi> in the Churche: but I doo not
<pb facs="tcp:12891:5"/>
allowe of this their argument, as they had El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in the Church then, ſo it muſt be nowe. For the learned Father M. Gualter ſayth, That there are certaine which would erect a presbiterie, they muſt proue they haue the ſame giftes as the presbiterie had then, Propheſie, working of mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and other giftes written in 1. Cor. Cha. 12. They that do theſe things are thought to trouble the order of the Church of God, and to bring in contention, the ciuill Magiſtrates went to get vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them ſelues eccleſiaſticall authoritie, but this turned into popiſhe tyrannie. There was a little booke printed in the yeare of our Lord 1558. that is called The admonition of Englande and Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande, you ſhall finde as much there.

<pb facs="tcp:12891:7"/>
where he hath the verie wordes you alledge: hee ſaieth, <hi>That the Miniſters haue no Diſcipline further then rebukes by worde: That there muſt be no Eccleſiaſticall ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion from the Sacraments: No excommunication: Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, there muſt be no Diſcipline but ciuill, at the appointe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment af the Magiſtrate, and that by ciuill perſons.</hi> Will the Biſhops allowe this, that by the worde of God Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall Gouuernours haue no authoritie to <hi>ſuſpende,</hi> to <hi>excommunicate</hi>?

Well did Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Copquot</hi> conſider that it was farre from the
<pb facs="tcp:12891:7"/>
true meaning of the Apoſtle, which neuer would account an ignorant Miniſter, vnſauerie ſalte, a blinde watchman, a dumme Dogge, and an Idoll ſhepheard, worthie either of double honor, or the name to rule well. Well alſo did he conſider that it was a ſmall piece of gouernement, to reade a fewe prayers or part of the Liturgie, and to doo all as he is preſcribed. Vppon good reaſon he left that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt meaning, I would he had as eaſilie receyued the full and proper meaning of the holy Ghoſt. But let vs come to the matter in hande: Hee thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth him ſelfe iniuried that he is charged to haue learned his aunſwere <hi>of the Ieſuites, which he had</hi> (he ſaith) <hi>from holy Fathers and Prophetes.</hi> If you bringe the interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Prophetes for you, we will put our hande to our mouth and giue glorie to the trueth and to you, although we muſt ſtill acknow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge that we redde it in the Ieſuites papers, before we heard it out of your mouth. But how is it that we heare a ſounde of Prophetes, but finde the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences onely of Fathers? Lette vs examine them notwithſtanding, to ſee if they diſcharge you from being the Ieſuites ſcholler. The ſentences which are alledged, make nothing for you, ſome are expreſlie againſt you. The firſt 2. are made to ſay, Such Prieſtes are worthie of double honour as do rule well, admit they ſay it: but do they ſaye this place maketh two ſortes of Preachers, whiche is the queſtion? Haue you no other Fathers then theſe firſte? Yes, <hi>Auguſtin, Ciprian, Ambroſe, Chriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome,</hi> theſe are worth the hearing, let them ſpeak. <hi>S. Auguſtin</hi> ſaith, They onely <hi>non bene praeſunt,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che doo not labour in their calling. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the place of the Apoſtle is to be vnderſtoode of Preachers only not of gouerning Elders. I am not worthy for learning to beare Doctor Copquot bookes: yet I
<pb facs="tcp:12891:8"/>
know the man whom he now ſeeketh to confute, would laugh at ſuche a reaſon. For all that I will vouchſafe an anſwere. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in giuing no more for the interpretation of theſe wordes, <hi>whiche rule well,</hi> then that they do it which labour in their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, doth applie it no more to Preachers onely, then to Deacons, Kinges, yea Shipmaiſters, who all muſt labour well in their calling. Nay, by vſing ſo generall wordes in interpreting the firſt part of the verſe, he manifeſtlie declareth, that hee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood it was general to both ſorte of Elders, both teaching and vnteaching, and ſo he might applie it to which ſoeuer ſorte of Elders he had occaſion to ſpeake of. The ſame anſwere may ſerue the words which he ſayeth are <hi>Ciprians,</hi> who yet can not bee founde either ſo much as to alledge that place, much leſſe fully to interprete it. And if he thinke that <hi>Ciprian</hi> was ſuch an enemie of vnteaching El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, let him reade againe his Epiſtles, and he ſhall finde almoſt in euery Epiſtle, that hee is a great friende vnto them. He will ſay peraduenture, thoſe Elders were preachers: we anſwer, it is not credible that in one Church there could be ſo many as hee there nameth and paynteth out, eſpecially in the time of perſecution. But to put the matter out of doubt, his owne wordes are alledged, where hee ſaith,<note place="margin">

His wordes are: <hi>Quid eſt autem bene prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſe? audi dicentem Chriſtum: Paſtor bonus animam ponit pro ouibus. Bene igitur praeeſſe, hoc eſt, nulli parcere illorum regiminis gratia: maximè inquit, qui laborant, in verbo &amp; doctrina: vbi modo ſunt qui dicunt ſermone &amp; doctrsna non opus eſt: &amp; hos omnium maximè iubet honorari, cauſamque addit, dicens: Nullum enim labore<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuſtinent:</hi> that is, <hi>What is it to rule well? heare Chriſt ſpeaking or telling it: A good ſhephearde layeth downe his lyfe for his ſheepe. Therefore to rule well, is this, to ſpore none, or nothinge, for the ſake of their gouernement: eſpecially (ſayth he) thoſe which labour in the worde and doctrine: where are they nowe which ſaye, there is no neede of the worde and doctrine: and he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth that theſe be chieflie honoured, and ſheweth the cauſe, ſaying: becauſe they ſuſteyne much labour.</hi> By all whiche is manifeſt, firſt that the firſt part of the verſ. he vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth onli of gouernement (for giuing the ful se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſe of it, he maketh it to be to ſpare none in reſpect of their gouernment) &amp; ſo maketh with vs Elders which
<pb facs="tcp:12891:9"/>
gouerne onely: and Elders whiche alſo teache. Secondlie, ſeeing he doeth by the ſeconde parte confute thoſe who ſayde, there is no neede of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine: he ſheweth that although ſome are to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne onely, yet ſome which muſt haue great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, muſt teache alſo. Yea, if he had vnderſtoode your ſenſe of this place, he would haue ſaide vpon the firſt part of the verſe: <hi>All muſt teache well,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is neede of doctrine in euerie place: this argument could not haue bin left out, and had bin more neceſſarie, if he had ſeene that to be the mea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning of the Apoſtle. Laſtlie, in confutinge by this reaſon their negligence, <hi>becauſe they muſt labor in the worde,</hi> and not with yours, becauſe <hi>they muſt labour more then others:</hi> he ſheweth your interpretation ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer came in his minde. Thus three of his witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes haue done him much more harme then good. What ſayeth the laſt? <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſayeth, <hi>Presbiters</hi> .i. <hi>Elders, and thoſe whiche gouuerne well, both in life and doctrine, deſerue double honour, of thoſe who are vnder them.</hi> Is this to proue that Ambroſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeth the place of Preachers only: when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thoſe which gouerne both in life &amp; doctrine, he ſpeaketh of Elders and Auncientes? If you wil ſay that (<hi>and</hi>) doeth not here couple diuers thinges, but interpret only, what reaſon haue you to proue it? Seeing he doeth alledge the texte expreſſely as we doo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> What goeth before, what followeth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to proue it? Nay, in the laſt wordes he would then haue ſaide. They deſerue double honour, of thoſe whom they teache, but becauſe hee woulde make it generall to both, hee ſayeth of thoſe that are vnder them: which may haue relation to both ſortes of Elders. If Ambroſe had miſliked this of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, or not counted it perpetual, you had had ſome reaſon to interprete <hi>Et</hi> (and) by theſe words <hi>that is</hi>:
<pb facs="tcp:12891:9"/>
But ſeeing he calleth for it and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaineth for the decay of it, as we doo: ſeeing he proueth it by the ſame places wee doo: his interpretation hath no coulor to mainteine it ſelf. The firſt is manifeſt by his wordes on 1. Tim. 5. <hi>Vnde &amp; Synagoga, &amp; poſtea Eccleſia ſeniores habuit, quorum ſine conſilio nihil agebatur in Eccleſia. Quod qua neglige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tia abſoleuerit, neſcio, niſi for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tè Doctorum deſidia<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> aut magis ſuperbia, dum ſoli volunt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquid videri:</hi> that is, <hi>Whence alſo the Synagogue, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Church had Elders, without whoſe counſell nothinge was done in the Church: which, by what neglige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce it is worne out of vſe, I knowe not, vnleſſe perhaps by the ſlothe of the Teachers, or rather their pride, whileſt they alone will ſeeme to be ſomewhat.</hi> The ſecond is manifeſt by his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of the 1. Cor. 12. which we alledge (<hi>Hee hath ſet in his Church gouernors</hi>) of which wordes his whole interpretation (after he had ſpoken vppon the former wordes of the Teachers) is: <hi>Sunt &amp; gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernatores qui ſpiritualibus retinaculis, hominibus docume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>to ſunt: There are alſo gouernors which with ſpirituall bridles order me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> Where, in ſaying, there are alſo, he ſheweth beſides the teachers, there are alſo rulers: and ſuch as rule with ſpirituall bridles, not with the ciuill ſworde. Thus the Fathers are heauie friendes to this interpretation. It may be notwithſtanding he can ſo confute our reaſon brought againſt his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as we muſt of force yeelde it into his handes. For triall ſake therefore, we come to his anſwere. Wherein obſerue two faultes whiche are generall: then you may the better deale with the particular deceites of his anſwere. The one is, that he cleane paſſeth by one principall reaſon, which is made againſt him, and it is this: If the Apoſtle had ment to haue made two ſortes of Preachers, hee ſhould haue ſaide, <hi>They which rule well in worde and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, are worthie of double honor, eſpeciallie thoſe which la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor in it, or labor more th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:12891:10"/>
doctrine co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to both. For by what law of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, will you doo it? Will you interprete, <hi>Ruling by teaching? gouernement by doctrine?</hi> One diuers thing by another? Is that to interprete, or to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founde? An other faulte is, that hee repeateth the fourth reaſon, but maketh no aunſwere at all vnto it. The cauſe peraduenture is, for that it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in a connexiue ſyllogiſme, not a ſimple or <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

We will nowe expect his anſwere, although with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauill he can hardly anſwere it.

To the ſecond reaſon his anſwere is, that is this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, <hi>they doo nothing leſſe then make the Apoſtle go backward and not forwarde.</hi> For this is our meaning which we giue (ſaith he) <hi>That they whiche labour, are worthie of double honour: they which do<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:12891:10"/>
of honor, which is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to all that may haue any honor in their office? Beſides this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tradictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which is euident in his owne words, he toucheth not the force of the obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is: Whatſoeuer ſenſe maketh the Apoſtle, in the ſecond member of the verſe, giue more to the part, then in the firſt to the whole, maketh him go backward nor forward in his word eſpecially. But this ſenſe of theirs ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the Apoſtle giue more to him that laboreth in preaching, which is but a parte, then to him which doth it wel, which is to do it with great paynes, pu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ritie, wiſdom, zeale, power, ſoundnes, fitnes, &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other things beſides labor. Therefore this ſenſe maketh him goe backewarde not forwarde, in his worde eſpecially. This reaſon is playne. What ſaith the anſwer? Doth it diſtinguiſh? No. Doth it denie the firſt part? No. What then? It denieth the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, againſt all rule of reaſon. Yet by what reaſon doth he denie it? By giuing an interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which doeth not make, either two ſortes of Elders, or of ſincere preachers, but only two ſortes of preachers, one good &amp; worthie of honor, an other euil, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che take no paynes, worthie of no honour. So that this hauing no degrees of compariſon (which are manifeſtly expreſſed in <hi>S.</hi> Paules words) can not ſo much as reſemble the ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the Apoſtle, much leſſe interpret it. His meaning here peraduenture is as after, that al that do it wel, ſhal haue double ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor: but they eſpecially, who take yet more paines in doing it well. This his meaning hath two fowle ſpots in it, as faire as he would make it. The firſt is againſt the rule of reaſon, becauſe he beggeth the queſtion: for to proue his denial of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluſion of our reaſon, he bringeth this meaning of his, which is the queſtion we diſpute about. The ſecond fault is againſt plaine dealing in interpreting the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, &amp; that in two reſpects: one is in interpreting <hi>ruling well, or being ouer others well,</hi> by preaching well. Which is to interprete the generall by the eſpeciall.
<pb facs="tcp:12891:11"/>
If he ſay, one may do ſo where there is a Trope or an vnproper ſpeache: he muſt firſte proue by eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent reaſon out of his text, or other ſcripture, that there, is a Trope, elſe he ſeeketh a knotte in a ruſhe. Beſides this, a figure can not ſtande here, becauſe the Apoſtle doth ſpecifie the general, of being ouer others, into the ſpeciall of being ouer alſo in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine: ſo that he can by no meanes enter here vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuch an vnproper ſpeache, but muſt be content to reade, <hi>ruling wel, ruling wel,</hi> not teaching well. After this ſtraunge interpreting, before this new coyned meaning (carying the very ſtampe of the Ieſuites) enter, he muſt (not without great blame if he look not to it) adde to the wordes of the Apoſtle. For, all the force of his interpretation ſtandeth vpon an addition, to the wordes of the holy Ghoſt: which is, to make him ſay, he that taketh <hi>more great paynes then they whiche preache well</hi>: All whiche wordes, <hi>more then others which doo it well,</hi> are neither in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle in expreſſe wordes, nor in any of like force to them, neither hath he, or can he With any Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſme conclude it out of his wordes.

Wherefore (as the Author of the <hi>Counterpoyſon</hi> ſaid before, ſo I ſay againe, this is dallying, &amp; not interpreting: And What ſoeuer he ſaye, this Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of his, is diſſolute. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>or if men preache well, they are worthie of double honor, whiche is more then the Widdowes honour. if oteerwiſe they are worthie (as he ſaide before) of none. His anſwere followeth to the laſt reaſon out of Roma. 12.6.7. Where the Elder for gouernement onely, is made a proper member of the church, differing in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per action from the Teacher, Exhorter, Diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: And out of the 1. Cor. 12. where God is ſaide (beſides all other miniſteries and giftes) to haue <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned gouernours in his Church</hi>: wherevnto he ſaieth, he denieth the argument, <hi>there were ſuch then, therfore there ſhould be ſuch nowe Becauſe</hi> (as <hi>M.

We mainteyne out of theſe places, that they are perpetuall. Firſt, becauſe they are members ordeyned of Chriſt, hauing acti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ons for the profit of the whole body. For vnleſſe he can proue God hath repealed them, who ſhall cutt them off from the body?

            <p>Nowe that wee haue proued that hee requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the perpetuitie of theſe offices: lett vs come to his reaſon, why he denieth them to be perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, whiche is, becauſe wee can not firſte proue the Elders to haue ſuch giftes of prophecying, dooing miracles, &amp;c. But wee bidde him proue firſte this ſtrange and monſtrouſe aſſertion: that it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie
<pb facs="tcp:12891:14"/>
for vs to proue it. Secondly, we will ſhew him the vanitie and deteſtable abſurdities which folow this his demande. The vanitie may appeare by theſe reaſons out of the text. The gouernours and the gift of gouernement are as much diſtinguiſhed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Prophetes &amp; doers of miracles, as they are from teachers: therfore to require ſuch neceſſarie for go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement more then doctrine, is to ouerthrowe the purpoſe of the Apoſtle, which is to ſhew howe euery office hath his ſeueral &amp; proper gift. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if the vſe of ſuch giftes as he ſpeaketh of, be no part of gouerneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, what neceſsitie is there of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Elders as they are Elders? Thirdly, we demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of him, whether he require theſe giftes in al Elders or in ſome, &amp; in whom he doth require the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he would haue all thoſe giftes to be in them or ſome only. If he require them in all, he muſt proue firſt that they were in al the Elders in the Apoſtles time, which he ſhall do <hi>ad graecas kalendas,</hi> that is, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. If he require all thoſe giftes in any, let him proue that any Elder was furniſhed with them al, which he ſhal neuer do. If ſome only, let him ſhew whiche are neceſſarie, and which not. And let him out of the ſcripture proue his ſaying, and we will yeelde. Thus we haue ſeene the vanitie of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mande, marke the abſurdities following. Firſt, that they make themſelues wiſer then the Apoſtle, who requireth no more in the dutie of an Elder, <hi>then to be ouer the flocke with diligence, Rom.</hi> 12.5.6. Secondly, they require more in the Elders the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Apoſtle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in a teaching Elder or a Biſhop, when he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the rule of his examinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, 1.

Thirdly they may by the ſame rule throw out teachers, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this place the Apoſtle giueth ſuch giftes no more to the Elders then to the teachers: eſpecially this conſequence is neceſſarie, becauſe the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall ende of thoſe giftes, being eyther to deliuer doctrine, or giue credit to it, is more neceſſarie for the teacher then the gouuernor.</p>

Vineyard, and bring in igno<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rant, vngodly, riotouſe, idle and couetous perſons, in their ſteede. Nay, ſome of theſe are not onely thought, but manifeſtly by experience in manye places felt. Secondly, you may obſerue howe the light of his conſcience ſtroue with his affections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the cauſe. His affection and deſire was to diſgrace the cauſe it ſelf, as preiudiciall to the peace of the Church and ciuill Magiſtrate. Now, When in his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience he found he could deduct no ſuch thing out of the matter of Diſcipline, hee turneth from the matter to the perſons, and ſayth, they are thought ſo to do. Why doth he not ſhew who they be that ſo thinke of them, vpon what groundes, by what ſignes and tokens, by what counſelles, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, examples or deedes they haue giuen likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of it? If hee can neither conclude any ſuche matter out of the cauſe it ſelf, nor proue any thing againſt the perſons which ſeeke it. How, Is it not the maintenance of a malitious ſlaunder? We haue haue harde what he ſayth: will he adde no ground of it? Yes, An admonition to Scotlande, printed An. 1558. co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teineth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluſions as ſtraunge againſt the Eſtate, as <hi>D. Sanders</hi> (that traytors booke) doth. What doth it? Doeth it conteyne flat treaſon, that the Prince by any Eccleſiaſticall power may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed or reſiſted? That the Queens moſt Excellent Maieſtie is an heretike, or receyueth not Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and thetefore muſt be excommunicated, and after accounted no lawfull Queene? Hath any fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring Diſcipline writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe things, or the like? If he can not ſhewe any ſuch thing, what is he but a Preacher of ſlaunders at Pawles Croſſe? The booke he ſpeaketh of, to my knowledge, I haue not ſeene: neyther knowe where to haue it. Yet I aſſure my ſelfe, he can bring foorth no ſuche con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions
<pb facs="tcp:12891:16"/>
from any which hath ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or written for Diſcipline. But be it that ſome one man had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten without ground or reaſon contrarie to the ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, ſhal that or any mannes abuſe, blot out the credit which ſo many Churches in <hi>France, Scotlande, Germanie, the lowe Countries,</hi> hath brought to it, as fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it holy, peaceable, and no ſmall pillar, both of the peace of the Church and ciuill gouernement? When we conſider what inconueniences followe any matter, we muſt not conſider what ſome (whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che hold the cauſe) would haue, but what the cauſe of his owne nature will inferre. For, as the good meaning of a good man will not make a perilouſs cauſe ſafe, ſo the ill meaning of a noughtie ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, will not make a ſafe and iuſt cauſe dangerouſe. I mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile what cauſe may be found out to make Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline hurtfull to the common wealth: or what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why the Magiſtrates authoritie and it,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Chro.</hi> 19.11. <hi>Iere.</hi> 19.1. <hi>Heſ.</hi> 10.8. 2. <hi>Reg.</hi> 6. 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 30.27 28, 29, 30. <hi>Actes</hi> 4.5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6, 12. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5.21 <hi>Act.</hi> 23.14.15.16. <hi>&amp;</hi> 25, 15.</note> ſhoulde not dwell peaceably togither. The Kings and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of Iſrael found it not ſo: The Romanes after them found it not ſo, they being Heathen, more cu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rious to looke into ſuche matters then any: more ielouſe, more politike, moſt ielouſe ouer the Iewes of all others, becauſe of the King which they loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for to come in worldlie glorie, could neuer yet finde out any ſuch ſuſpition. In all their times it was quietly practiſed. The Kings and Princes, both Proteſtant, which haue allowed it, and popiſh (as in <hi>France</hi>) which haue permitted it, they haue founde no ſuch thing in it. For the ſeconde point<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> By what reaſon ſhould the Magiſtrats authoritie be at ſuch enimitie with Diſcipline, or diſcipline with it? Is it becauſe the Magiſtrat will or can doo that, which the Elders doe, or the Elders will or can doe that which he doth? Will the Magiſtrat watche o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer particular flockes, admoniſhe euery ſinner they finde out, followe menne by ſpirituall meanes, till they bring them to repentance? will they them ſel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ues
<pb facs="tcp:12891:16"/>
execute the ſpirituall cenſures of ſuſpentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, and ſuch like? Is this his office, or can his conſcience beare this burthen? Doeth the Elders meddle with any ciuill cauſe, or vſe anye o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her meanes then which are ſpirituall? Shall they doe things ſo cloſely, that al their actes may not be ſeene of the Magiſtrate, if he ſuſpect any thinge? Nay, muſt not all thinges they doo, come to open knowledge, if they paſſe a priuate admonition? Will they bring no good to the common wealthe: meete with no ſeedes of ſedition? Shall they not be able to giue notice of the diſpoſitions of al men? Shall they not finde out Ieſuites and all heretikes, and bring them to light? Shall not the ſmaler vices and ſometimes foule ones alſo, whiche the lawe nowe meddleth little with, by this meanes bee cu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t off? In deede, then mens purſes ſhoulde not bee picked, as they are nowe. Then ſo manye Veluet coates ſhould not be maintayned by ſpiritual reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes. But I will ſpeake no more of theſe matters. Only I conclude, ſeeing men haue in the tyme of proſperitie more neede of admonition and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Diſcipline: ſeing the Elderſhip doth nothing which the Magiſtrat doeth, nor can any way hurte him, but he may ſee it better ordred then in perſecution: that as this order is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie alwayes, ſo eſpecially in the time of peace. The Lord giue vs all to be of one minde, to ſee the trueth, and practiſe it.</p>
