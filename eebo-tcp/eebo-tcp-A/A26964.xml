            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>SOme years ſince I was called upon by a <hi>Perſon of Quality,</hi> to acquaint her Ladyſhip with the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of my <hi>Non-conformity:</hi> for it had been ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted to her Ladyſhip, that I had none; but only was ſwayed by the Example of ſome others, much reverenced by me, to tread in their ſteps, at all adventures. As if I had been one of thoſe mentioned by Origen in his firſt Book againſt <hi>Celſus,</hi> who choſe <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to be of this Sect and Party, not out of any ſound mind and judgment, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> but by a certain <hi>illogical hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of determination without all deliberation.</hi> 
               <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon this I was neceſſitated, to put pen to paper, and give her Ladyſhip ſuch an haſty account, as the time would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit: which was under the limit of five or ſix days. I could not therefore ſearch into all things affording matter of ſcruple, they being too large and numerous; but only ſingled out thoſe mentioned in my letter, as being next at hand, and moreover obvious, and eaſie to be underſtood by her Ladyſhip, at the firſt read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them. A Copy of this letter, ſuch as it was, without adding, diminiſhing, or the leaſt alteration, was appointed to be printed about three months ſince:
<pb facs="tcp:64663:3"/>
but printed it was not a long time after; at leaſt I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed ſo. But when I deemed no ſuch matter, my Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py was brought unto me printed, together with a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Confutation of it at the ſame time in Quarto. This ſeemed ſtrange to me, but I being in that inſtant op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with bitter grief, by the death of a darling-Child, was not in a condition to read it over, much leſs to juſtifie my ſelf againſt it. And now within leſs than a week after, another ſecond Confutation was directed to me, upon which I thought I had a loud call, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding my great indiſpoſition, to undertake mine op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents, and make good my reaſons againſt all their gainſayings. With what evidence of truth, I muſt leave you and others to judge, my ſheets are now ready for the Preſs, but when that will give them a more publique Paſsport, I know not. Farewell.</p>

            <p>BEfore you would confute me, you thought meet to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fame me, in theſe words; <hi>Being lately in a Book ſellers Shop, I met with a Letter pretended to be writ from a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter to a Perſon of Quality, ſhewing ſome Reaſons of his Non-conformity.</hi> And you add,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Page</hi> 1.</note> 
               <hi>I have often obſerved this humour in ſome mean, but vain people, who dare not look upon Perſons of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, when they are preſent, to talk of them with great familiarity, and as their peculiar Intimates and Confidents.</hi> But I anſwer; Why ſhould you a Miniſter be ſo cenſorious and uncharitable, as to charge one who is ſtiled a Miniſter, and I ſuppoſe utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to your ſelf, with Pride and Lying at the firſt daſh? with Pride, in a vain humour of aſpiring unto acquaintance with Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Quality; with Lying, in pretending unto ſuch a familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, when indeed there is no ſuch matter. The Printer, or ſome other, affixed this Title, for my Copy had none at all; but yet it is altogether truth; though I have reaſon to bluſh, and crave par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for being no more mannerly and Courtly in my Stile and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to ſuch a Perſon of Honour. By this, and what follows, I obſerve in you a ſtrange Spirit, which I pray God convince you of, and deliver me from: a ſpirit haughty and ſcornful, bitter and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeful, and yet elſewhere too too friendly and amicable.</p>
            <p>

            <p>In the words of the Declaration there is an Agent, an act, the object: The Agent is the Perſon or Miniſter declaring, and this unfeignedly and ſincerely from his heart; the Act is this perſon his aſſenting and conſenting: Now this act of aſſenting, as to the Party declaring, relates to his underſtanding; and as to the thing aſſented to, relates to the truth and rightfulneſs of it: So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe again, the act of conſenting relates to his will, and as to the thing conſented to, to the goodneſs, expediency, and behoofful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it. This is what you deride, and hold that the interven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of truth and goodneſs need not be ſuppoſed as a neceſſary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient to what we declare we aſſent and conſent unto; but in ſo declaring we mean and intend only this, that we will ſubmit <hi>to the uſe of all and every thing</hi> contained and preſcribed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64663:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
who framed and injoyned them to be declared. For I take it for granted, that this Declaration was thus worded by the moſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Clergy, Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Deans, and ſuch other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, and this too for Divines and Miniſters of the Goſpel to be declared by them, as the teſt of their worthineſs and meetneſs for the Miniſterial Function; accordingly therefore ſuch perſons may rationally and well be ſuppoſed to uſe the words in <hi>ſenſu Theologico,</hi> in a Divine or Scriptural ſenſe, and not otherwiſe: Now in the Scripture phraſe we find <hi>aſſent and conſent,</hi> fully and altogether according to the expoſition which I have given of them.

By what I have ſpoken, we may the better perceive the genuine force and meaning of <hi>aſſent and conſent</hi>; the Object of theſe acts now therefore offers it ſelf to our conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which I ſay (according to the Declaration) <hi>is all and every thing contained and preſcribed in and by the Book intituled the Book

               </gap> bruit Animals, rather than rational Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; ſurely they would not thus reproach them of their own Coat, who bear themſelves high upon their own underſtanding above others, and think it but Juſtice to be reputed the moſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pient and judicious amongſt men. It appears by the woful event, that more than a thouſand Non-conforming Miniſters could not thus conſtrue the words of the Declaration, when it was firſt put unto them, and required of them; which (with ſome other things commanded) made them to turn out, and loſe all, rather than loſe their Souls, in doing what was clearly againſt their Conſciences. So that it is not perverſeneſs and folly (what-ever you ſay or think) to ſtick at the words <hi>aſſent and conſent,</hi> but rather from the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of a ſound mind, influenced and awed by the fear of the Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir,</hi> Far beyond my deſert, by the good Providence of God, I have had the favour and countenance of ſeveral great Perſons of Quality, who have received me very lovingly and familiarly:
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64663:6"/>
This I ſpeak (my Witneſs is in Heaven) neither to vaunt my ſelf with the glory of it, nor yet to put you under any diſarray again by the vanity of my pretenſion, but to acquaint you with ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to our purpoſe in the matter before us. A little before the black <hi>Bartholomew,</hi> one of the foreſaid in diſcourſe enquired of me, what mine intentions were? and whither I would conform, yea or not? I anſwered his Lordſhip, ſuch things were required and enjoyned, as I could not ſwallow, and therefore ſhould be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated to march off, and ſound a Retreat. His Lordſhip ſeemed to be much concerned for me, uſing many Arguments (as good as ever I have heard or read from any) to reconcile me to a compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; but perceiving me not to be overcome by them, while I urged ſome of theſe things now mentioned as a juſt cauſe of my refuſing; at laſt he ſaid with a ſigh, <hi>I wiſh it had been otherwiſe; but they were reſolved either to reproach you, or undo you.</hi> Of which wiſe and weighty Apothegm I leave you to be the Interpreter. Was not Conformity contrived in ſuch a way and manner on purpoſe, either to expoſe us to common Infamy, as Perſons who would ſay, and ſwear, and do any thing, rather than loſe our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings? or elſe to ruine and undo us, by turning us out a grazing in the woful wild of extreme poverty and want? About a year after another great Peer ordered me to wait on his Lordſhip, and propoſed ſomething to be done by me with reference to the Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, which (as I thought) in my then preſent circumſtances, having neither call nor neceſſity to do, I humbly craved leave of his Lordſhip to be excuſed therein; and ſpeaking yet further, about the ſtrict and hard terms of Conformity, his Lordſhip replied, <hi>I confeſs I ſhould ſcarcely do ſo much for the Bible, as they require for the Common-Prayer.</hi> Both theſe, I aſſure you, are great and learned Noble-men, and as far from being <hi>Presbyterians</hi> as your ſelf; yet you may ſee their Reſentments, as to what was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, how little they were pleaſed with ſuch high and rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous proceedings, and how in the bottom of their hearts, they were rather the Advocates, than the Accuſers of the Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters: Yea, I perſwade my ſelf, that many among your ſelves had ſcruples more than a few, or eaſie, and would then with all their hearts have declined the <hi>Teſt of aſſent and conſent,</hi> if by any other means they could have eſcaped the danger: it is well for
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64663:6"/>
them if they tentured not their Conſciences, while they tendered their worldly intereſts and neceſſities; but to chuſe to do it from any free act of their own option and will, as what was deſired and delighted in by them (ſetting aſide ſome high Prelatical Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who returned in anger and meditated retaliation) was not to be found in the Boſom of many; yet even theſe are called forth to <hi>declare their unfeigned aſſent and conſent, &amp;c.</hi> than which words, I know none more ſignificant of heart and good will, of love and choice, as to all and every thing contained in and preſcribed by the Book of Common-Prayer. For I pray, Sir, were you to expreſs your judgment and affection in any matter, and how your whole ſoul and mind is fully pleaſed, ſatisfied, and gratified therein, and this beyond all demur and exception; how could you more clearly diſcover your <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, than by the <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> of <hi>an unfeigned, aſſent and conſent unto it?</hi> for mine own part, I profeſs I know not: Therefore it is well remarked by you, <hi>that aſſent and conſent, and approve,</hi> are words ſynonymous. But you ſay, <hi>Cannot we approve of the uſe of a Book,</hi>
               <note place="margin">p.o.l. <hi>3.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>or approve of a Book, as lawful to be uſed, as well as aſſent and conſent to the uſe of it</hi>? Yes ſurely: But you miſtake me,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 9. <hi>l.</hi> 5, 6, 7.</note> for I neither <hi>can aſſent nor conſent, nor approve of the Book, or the uſe of the Book,</hi> ſo as hereby to witneſs mine own will or deſire for the ſame; yet I can uſe it in ſubmiſſion to Command, if I ſhall judge it not ſimply unlawful and ſinful to do it: I, can, as I have ſaid, ſilently and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently ſwallow down ſome Gnats, if my Superiours will have it ſo; but if I ſhall be required to ſay, <hi>I aſſent and conſent, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of ſwallowing down Gnats,</hi> this alters the caſe; and now I can no more ſwallow them down, than if they were <hi>Camels.</hi> Wherefore, <hi>eo nomine,</hi> upon the very ſame account, as you inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly confeſs, <hi>you would be a Non-conformiſt to any Church in the World,</hi> I am at this preſent to the Church of <hi>England.</hi>

                  <hi>p.</hi> 3. <hi>l.</hi> 20.</note> And up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame ſcore I think preſent Conformity harder than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, the now Declaration being much more comprehenſive in its own nature, and taking in much more of our mind, will, and approbation, as to all and every thing recounted and ſpecified therein, than any foregoing ſubſcription; eſpecially than that mentioned by your ſelf in the time of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> wherein the Clergy were only required to ſubſcribe this promiſe; <hi>I shall
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64663:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
read the Service appointed plainly, diſtinctly, and audibly, that all people may hear and underſtand.</hi> As for the Articles publiſhed by the Authority of King <hi>Edward</hi> the VI. and particularly that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Book of Common-Prayer, with ſubſcription there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 5. <hi>l.</hi> 2.</note> I have not ſeen them, except in your Quotation, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can ſay nothing in the caſe, one way or other: but I have two Books of Common-Prayer printed in his days, the firſt about the middle,<note place="margin">1549. 1552.</note> the ſecond in the laſt year of his Reign; in neither of which is to be found <hi>any Rubrick aſſerting the certainty of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens undoubted Salvation out of Gods Word, though they are bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed and die before actual ſins</hi>; there is not, I ſay, one ſyllable to the ſaid purpoſe in either of them. Even this very particular would have rendred Subſcription more facile and paſſable to me, had I lived in thoſe days. As for the ſubſcription of the three Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles in the time of King <hi>James,</hi> I acknowledge this was one, <hi>Quod Liber Publicae Liturgiae, &amp;c. That the Book of Common-Prayer contains in it nothing contrary to the Word of God, &amp;c.</hi> Unto which I had rather, and ſhould much ſooner <hi>ſubſcribe,</hi> than declare <hi>my unfeigned aſſent and conſent</hi> (ſuppoſing the ſame Book of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer) <hi>to all and every thing contained in, and preſcribed by it.</hi> For though I cannot prove ſuch and ſuch things to be abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely contrary to, or againſt Gods Word, yet I cannot therefore preſently affirm them to be according to Gods Word, either as expreſly revealed, or poſitively commanded by the Sacred Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non; which yet I muſt be able to do, before I can declare <hi>my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned aſſent and conſent</hi> to the ſaid particulars; elſe I ſhould ſtrangely violate my Conſcience, and blindly ruſh forward at all adventures, without all reaſon or judgment. As for example, though I cannot ſay concerning Children baptized, and dying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore actual ſin, <hi>that their undoubted Salvation is abſolutely contrary to the Word of God</hi>; yet never the more can I affirm, <hi>that their undoubted Salvation is certain and expreſs by the ſame.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though perhaps I might ſubſcribe to the former, yet I could not declare my unfeigned aſſent and conſent to the latter.</p>
            <p>One thing I take notice of in theſe Subſcriptions, and I wiſh you would alſo for your better information; <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>aſſent and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, relate unto the acknowledgment or avouching the truth and goodneſs of the things aſſented and conſented to,</hi> as well as to the uſe</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:64663:7"/>The Great Ends generally mentioned for theſe Declarations and Subſcriptions, are <hi>Unity and Uniformity</hi> in the matters of Religion and Worſhip; whereas the contrary effects of <hi>animoſity and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> have wofully followed hereupon, time after time, as we have ſeen by long and ſad experience in continual breaches and diſſentions. There is, and will be, a <hi>judicium diſcretionis</hi> in every perſon, who will be a Judge in his own concern <hi>contra Gentes</hi>; his own mind and apprehenſion ſhall and will dictate to him what is right, and what is wrong, what is good, and what evil, both to be believed and practiſed by him; the greateſt Authority of his Superiours, and the wiſeſt Models of their deviſed forms for his devotion, in any wiſe notwithſtanding; nothing ſhall be able fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſubjugate his thoughts to any Idea or Syſtem of Service, than to what may be truly ſaid to be his own, I mean according to his own underſtanding; and therefore much leſs to an oneneſs and ſameneſs of opinion and judgment of it with thoſe that are above him (though commending and commanding it to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and obſerved) meerly becauſe they are ſo. Wherefore as it is the wiſdome of the Church to chuſe ſuch a Creed, as all who ſtile themſelves Chriſtians do univerſally agree in; ſo likewiſe it would be the higheſt prudence, to pitch upon ſuch a Declaration which all Miniſters might ſecurely and freely <hi>aſſent and conſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> without all ſcruple or heſitation, as the Teſt of their Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity. I will not preſume to mention the nature and quality of ſuch an one; but ſhall leave it wholly to my Superiours and Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: And let theſe, in Gods Name, enjoyn all Miniſters both <hi>to declare and do</hi> whatſoever the Word of God requires of them, to capacitate them for Church-work, and no more; then ſhould I expect Unity and Uniformity in all things of moment, with peaceable toleration and forbearance in the reſt, to the glory of God, and the greateſt edification of the Church, and never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:64663:8"/>
Then alſo I would be among the firſt, who would humbly offer my ſelf as a Candidate to that high and holy Function, though in the meaneſt and pooreſt place of preferment.</p>
            <p>But it is high time to come to particulars: I cannot approve of the Order appointed for the reading of the Scriptures; my reaſon was, becauſe many Books of <hi>Apocrypha</hi> are commanded to be read for the Leſſons of the day, as the fabulous Legends of <hi>Tobit</hi> and his <hi>Dog, Bell</hi> and the <hi>Dragon, &amp;c.</hi> while ſome Books of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Canon are wholly left out, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This I perceive touches you to the quick; this is confidence <hi>and impudence,</hi>

                  <hi>p.</hi> 9. <hi>l.</hi> 30.</note> this is matter of exclamation againſt our <hi>inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomed tongues</hi> and pens,<note place="margin">

I ſee your zeal for <hi>Apocrypha</hi> will cauſe you preſently to fly on the faces of thoſe who ſhall dare to ſpeak a word in any diminution or derogation of it, and this only too as it Rivals the Holy Canon: Yet ſay what you can in the juſtification of <hi>Apocrypha</hi> (how the ſtories therein were received by many of the <hi>Ancient Fathers for truth and reality,</hi>

                  <hi>p.</hi> 10. <hi>l.</hi> 33.</note> they can profit as much at a Play, as at a Sermon) yet <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crypha</hi> is <hi>Apocrypha</hi> ſtill, and thoſe very Books appointed ro be read, full of abſurdities and impoſſibilities, as I could eaſily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate in ſeveral notorious circumſtances; but this would be <hi>actum agere,</hi> ſince it hath been ſufficiently manifeſted by many <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Pens againſt the <hi>Papiſts</hi>; here therefore I ſhall leave you to be cenſured and chaſtiſed of all, who are not of the <hi>red Letter,</hi> or looking that way: As for mine own part, I ran over the Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lender, and ſaw there one whole Month together: <hi>viz. October,</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:64663:8"/>
filled with <hi>Apocryphal</hi> Books, Forenoon and Afternoon, appointed for the Leſſons of the day; the ſame likewiſe in <hi>November,</hi> unto the twenty fourth day of it, beſides what went before in <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> of the ſame kind, while ſome Books Canonical are wholly left out, which I did not approve of; neither can I find any thing of better information from your ſelf to change my mind: and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe I am fully perſwaded ſome parts of Scripture are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted and ſhut out, which contain in them more to the profit and edification of the Hearers, than all the Books of <hi>Apocrypha</hi> put together; yea, it were little leſs than a Blaſphemy to ſay and think otherwiſe: Let us not preſume to be wiſer than God. But you ſay, <hi>Nothing of</hi> Apocrypha is <hi>appointed for Sundays</hi>;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 9. <hi>l.</hi> 29.</note> whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver laid this to your charge? Yet if you ſpeak truth, then ſome of your Miniſters are not well skill'd in the order of reading, who, as I am told by Ear-witneſſes, do ſometimes on Sundays read out of <hi>Apocrypha</hi>; whether they then read according to the common Monthly Kalender, and not according to the proper Leſſons ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for Sundays, or whether they ſo read when an Holy-day, whoſe proper Leſſon is out of <hi>Apocrypha,</hi> falls to be on a Sunday, when there is proper againſt proper, and the Miniſter left at diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion which of the propers he will chuſe; I ſhall not trouble my ſelf about it, but leave it in <hi>medio,</hi> to the wiſe and learned in the caſe. You ſay <hi>in our Conventicles we read little of Scripture</hi>;<note place="margin">p. <hi>9.</hi> l. pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nult.</note> indeed too little! <hi>Pudet haec opprobria nobis,</hi> and wiſh it were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe with all mine heart; for I am as far from <hi>aſſenting and conſenting to any ſuch omiſſion and neglect, as I would be to all and every thing contained in, and commanded by the Book of Common-Prayer:</hi> Should I be required to give my approbation of this fault, or elſe could not be admitted into Society with them, I would rather bear their Excommunication, and like an Hermit ſerve God in the Wilderneſs by my ſelf alone, than joyn myſelf to them. So vaſt a difference there is between being in Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion where faults are (for what Church is free from them?) and owning thoſe faults; yea, making ſuch an owning and approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the <hi>Lydius lapis,</hi> whether we are fit for Communion yea or not. Now this is the very caſe of poor <hi>Non-Conformiſts,</hi> with thoſe who have outed them. But to return, Recrimination is no Self-juſtification: beſides, in moſt of our Meetings, there is on

               <hi>Godfathers and Godmothers are not ſo ſtrictly required as to make it eſſential to the nature of Baptiſm, as is evident in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Baptiſm, which is declared valid without it.</hi> I never objected any ſuch eſſential ſtrictneſs; this therefore is meer impertinency: Yet reading over the Miniſtration of private Baptiſm, as it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be further and fully compleated by the Miniſter, there I find Godfathers and Godmothers interrogated, and fully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging on the Childs behalf, as well as in publick. But ſuppoſe Godfathers and Godmothers are not called upon in private Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm to make ſuch a promiſe; this is only in a rare extraordinary caſe of extremity, and out of the general uſual road: we know ſome others, in the like exigency, will grant a greater liberty; ſo much do they attribute to the <hi>Opus Operatum,</hi> that they will give leave to the Midwife to baptize, rather than fail: One Swallow makes no Summer. Herein alſo you run from the matter in hand. I ſay, Godfathers and Godmothers are uſually brought to the Font to avouch a great untruth; for though they make ſuch a ſolemn promiſe on the Childs behalf, they ſeldome perform it.

As we may not make more ſins than God has made ſins, ſo neither more duties than God has made duties: why therefore in particular ſhould we impoſe the duty on Godfathers and Godmothers, to look to the well education
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64663:9"/>
of the Child baptized, when God has not impoſed it? eſpecially we may not do it, where the fulfilling this duty is an utter impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility, as ſometimes it falls out in the matter before us. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times perſons are Sureties for Children by their Proxies, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves living in another Country; how can theſe ſee the <hi>said Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren vertuouſly brought up,</hi> when they never ſee them? Sometimes Boys and Girls ſtand as Godfathers and Godmothers for the Infant at the Font; theſe are very likely to make good their promiſe, when they are ſcarce in a capacity to underſtand what they ſay; ſo far are they from a right apprehenſion of the matter they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in: Whereby it appears, that the great care of the Church for the health and ſafety of thoſe ſhe receives into her Boſom, (which is ſo much ſpoken of, and magnified) is no more than a meer pretence, and dwindles into a ſorry ſhadow of words and names: For if there was ſuch a true and real care as is given out, and vaunted, why will ye, the Miniſters, admit of any ſuch, as I have now mentioned, to be Godfathers and Godmothers? ye ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept againſt none, that I hear of. And why will you lay a charge upon theſe, of doing what in reaſon ye cannot but be convinced they are not in a condition to perform? Verily, if a man ſhould judge according to your Quotidian practice, I ſhould be prone to believe, ye your ſelves ſcarce think it an abſolute neceſſity, for Godfathers and Godmothers to perform their Font-promiſes; for ſetting aſide only what is there barely read before them, I never met with any Book, Sermon, or Diſcourſe, wherein the duty of Godfathers and Godmothers is preſſed upon them, with reference to their God-children, not any thing to mind them of their Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, or move them to the fulfilling of it: Who therefore can imagine ye think it much material, further than the Pomp and Ceremony of their appearing, whether ſuch Godfathers and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothers look to the good manners of the Children baptized, yea or not? If men and women were throughly convinced by the Word of God, what great Bonds they lye under by being God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers and Godmothers, according to their own oral proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and form of ſpeech there dictated to their hands, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding what you ſpeak <hi>of the eaſineſs of the performance of the promiſe,</hi> it would be hard to find out ſuch voluntary Stipulators,<note place="margin">

               <hi>your own conceſſion</hi>? yea, if he be not expreſly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med as a Debtor, in point of Law, he has nothing to do with the Bond, or the Bond with him; which yet is the thing you would expoſe me for. Your compariſon affects me not, nor makes againſt me, but rather on my ſide: For let the Father be the chief Deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to bring up his own Child in the nurture and admonition of the Lord, and ſome of his Friends (I mean Godfathers and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothers) be Sureties with him, that this Debt ſhall faithfully be paid and diſcharged; ſhall not this Chief, and indeed ſole Deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, be called upon, and that too in the firſt place, to pay his Debt? In right reaſon he ſhould; and you your ſelf would be of the ſame mind, were you in ſome great Bond only Collateral Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity to a Friend, and this too in little more than a Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

to perform the ſame, and all little enough: If not always Nature, yet always Religion does bind Godfathers and Godmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <hi>quae tales</hi> to perform the promiſe made on the behalf of the Child baptized, for if it be not from Religion, there can be no tye in the caſe; yet the Church thinks not Religion enough to bind them, without the further help of additional Exhortation: why therefore ſhould not the ſame be thought neceſſary to the Father himſelf, to bind him alſo to his duty, notwithſtanding any preceding Obligation of Nature?</p>
            <p>I approve not <hi>of the Sign of the Croſs,</hi> nor that Sacramental myſtical way of ſigning with this Sign, as if baptizing with Water in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, were not ſufficient; but moreover, the Sign of the Croſs needful, to bind the Conſcience, and confer the Bleſſing.

But how? Thus; You dare not but acknowledge that the great and learned Sages of the Church, who compoſed and worded this Declaration, were <hi>compotes mentis,</hi> and underſtood what they did better than your ſelf, or any ſuch Expoſitor; and therefore had, as it hath been ſhewn already, when they put in theſe words, <hi>aſſent and conſent,</hi> into the ſaid Declaration, <hi>credenda</hi> as well as <hi>agenda</hi> in their thoughts and intentions, they had equally an eye to both theſe in the time of the compoſing it. Beſides what is there ſpoken for the clearing of this truth, I am now further confirmed in my Opinion by the two following Participles, <hi>contained in, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by,</hi> which very naturally, and almoſt neceſſarily, anſwer the foregoing Subſtantives <hi>Aſſent and Conſent,</hi> to ſuch an end and purpoſe; as thus, <hi>I declare my unfeigned aſſent to all and every thing (as truth and right to be believed) which is contained in the Book of Common-Prayer: and I declare my unfeigned conſent to all and every thing (as good and eligible to be practiſed and obſerved) which is preſcribed by the Book of Common-Prayer.</hi> Here is Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar and ſenſe, and I ſuppoſe the very ſenſe intended by the Law-makers. Surely they well weighed every ſeveral and diſtinct word in ſuch a ſet and ſolemn Proteſtation; and therefore every ſeveral diſtinct word in it, hath its ſeveral diſtinct weight and purpoſe; for far be it from me to charge ſuch conſiderate Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:64663:13"/>
as guilty of any <hi>Tautology,</hi> much leſs of <hi>Battology</hi>; unto which you will cauſe them to approach too near, if <hi>aſſent and conſent unfeigned aſſent and conſent to all and every thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and preſcribed in and by the Book, &amp;c.</hi> do refer to, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate <hi>upon uſe and practice only,</hi> without any further aim; then it had been fully enough to ſay, <hi>I declare my unfeigned conſent to all and every thing preſcribed by the Book of Common-Prayer,</hi> and no need at all either of the word <hi>aſſent,</hi> or of the word <hi>contained in,</hi> to be once mentioned or thought upon. You therefore deſerve a rebuke from your Superiours for your preſumptuous intruſion; who made you of their counſel? why ſhould you leave out, or put in any thing without their Commiſſion? why ſhould you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert the word <hi>uſe,</hi> which they never inſerted? But then you go further; for having inſerted the word <hi>uſe,</hi> you ſay confidently enough, <hi>that aſſent and conſent to all and every thing contained in, and preſcribed by,</hi> centre wholly upon the word <hi>uſe,</hi> and have no other matter to reſpect; and then again from hence you think you have gained another point (<hi>conceſſo uno abſurdo, &amp;c.</hi>) of freeing your ſelf from the difficulty and preſſing force of the Exception a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſtned Infants, their certain and undoubted Salvation, dying without actual ſin, by ſaying, <hi>You are not bound to give aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and conſent to this Rubrick; becauſe though it be contained in,</hi>

Surely to the latter, as well as the former: Every Collect, every Prayer has in it a <hi>Credendum,</hi> as well as an <hi>Orandum</hi>; and without the firſt the laſt cannot be performed, ſince Faith is of the very eſſence of Prayer, properly ſo called? But what do you imagine, the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration binds the Miniſter only to ſay over thoſe Prayers, and not to pray them, or pray in them? that is, not to believe what he

prays for to be right, and according to Gods holy will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure? This ſeems to me highly Paradox, and of a moſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous conſequence. Grant you this Poſtulate, and you ſpoil the whole Declaration, as to the great intents and purpoſes of it; for who may not declare in theſe words, <hi>I aſſent and conſent to all and every thing, &amp;c.</hi> if nothing of belief, but only uſe and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion be intended by them? I have heard of ſome <hi>Jews,</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing ſuch, without any change of their Religion, officiating as Prieſts among the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and Celebrating <hi>Maſs</hi>; now why may not ſuch <hi>Jews,</hi> yea <hi>Turks</hi> alſo, thruſt in among our Clergy, if by declaring their <hi>unfeigned aſſent and conſent to all and every thing contained and preſcribed in and by the Book of Common Prayer,</hi> they ſignifie no more, than that they will <hi>read over thoſe Prayers, perform thoſe Offices and Ceremonies, and ſubmit to the uſe and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of every thing enjoyned</hi>; but in the interim, without being obliged at all to believe the things ſo <hi>contained in, and preſcribed by the Book, and ſo ſaid and done by them,</hi> to be right, good, and juſtifiable? They may act as upon a Stage for a livelihood, and have no concern about the thing acted, or whom they perſonate: Therefore Sir, I tell you again, you cannot wave the diſpute, but are bound to <hi>believe,</hi> as well as <hi>to do all and every thing contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in, and preſcribed by the Book of Common-Prayer, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this in particular, concerning the undoubted Salvation of Children baptized, and dying before actual ſin</hi>; and this too as a <hi>truth aſſerted plainly and evidently out of Gods Word, paſt all cavil, or gain ſaying.</hi> Wherefore I humbly and earneſtly entreat you, as a moſt learned Textuary, to quote the place, and ſatisfie my ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; for until then, I dare not declare my unfeigned <hi>aſſent and conſent unto ſuch a doubtful and queſtioned Propoſition contained in the Book.</hi> But you would know of me, <hi>whether nothing be undoubtedly certain by Scripture,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, There is no ſuch word in the Rubrick <hi>as regularly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted</hi>; which makes me wonder at your confidence, to add what you pleaſe, from time to time, to ſerve your turn. 'Tis an hard queſtion, whether all Children in <hi>England</hi> be regularly admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted (as you may expound the words) by Baptiſm into the Church, yea or not? I cannot divine what are your thoughts in the caſe, nor what an Avenue and Start-hole you would find <hi>from regularly admitted,</hi> rather than be ſet up, and Mated. There is a great ambiguity in the word <hi>regularly admitted,</hi> which muſt be aſcertained: wherefore we muſt ſuppoſe all Infants baptized in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> according to the Liturgy, <hi>are regular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly admitted</hi> into the Church of Chriſt, for the Rubrick intends at leaſt all of them; yea, it ſpeaks of Children indefinitely: <hi>wherefore if theſe being regularly admitted</hi> (as we ſuppoſe they are) <hi>into the Church of Chriſt, have a right unto the bleſſings of the</hi> Covenant, <hi>then they have a Title to Salvation.</hi> I anſwer, If by having a right to the bleſſings of the Covenant, you mean <hi>all the bleſſings of the</hi> Covenant, even to the ultimate and great bleſſing of all, <hi>viz. Salvation,</hi> then there is <hi>Petitio Principii</hi> not to be granted, until it be proved, as being the Bone of Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: But if by having a right to the bleſſings of the Covenant, you mean <hi>ſome bleſſings of the</hi> Covenant, I ſhall readily concede; for even their admiſſion into the Church, as viſible Church-Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, is a great Covenant-bleſſing, immediately inveſting them with the <hi>actual priviledge of having God for their God, in a more peculiar manner,</hi> than thoſe without the Pale; beſides, with a foundation right of enjoying the Oracles, Ordinances, Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Saints, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Their admiſſion into the Church by Baptiſm, gives them from that time forward <hi>jus in re,</hi> though not <hi>jus ad rem,</hi> by reaſon of their preſent incapacity.</p>
            <p>But you further argue;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 18. <hi>l.</hi> 15.</note> 
               <hi>If they have not a right to the bleſſings of the</hi> Covenant, <hi>through a regular admiſſion into the Church by Baptiſm, then Baptiſm is an inſignificant Ceremony, and not the Seal of the</hi> Covenant. I anſwer, They have many bleſſings of the Covenant (as I have now ſhown) though yet they may fall ſhort
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64663:15"/>
of the greateſt of all; and therefore Baptiſm notwithſtanding is not an inſignificant Ceremony, but a Seal of the Covenant. Shortly, Baptiſm ſupplied the room of Circumciſion, which was a Seal of the Righteouſneſs of Faith; yet we cannot avouch, that all who were <hi>regularly circumciſed,</hi> ſhould have been <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly ſaved,</hi> had they died in their Infancy; for <hi>Eſau</hi> was Circumciſed as well as <hi>Jacob,</hi> concerning whom, without all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect either of their doing good or evil, that the Purpoſe of God might ſtand according to Election, it is written, Jacob <hi>have I lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and</hi> Eſau <hi>have I hated: Eſau</hi> was hated both before and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Circumciſion; which therefore could never have been his ſure Convoy to happineſs, had he immediately expired upon the receiving of this Seal: Salvation depends upon Election, and not at all upon our ſooner or later dying after we are baptized. Theſe are your Arguments,<note place="margin">

            <p>My following Queries are neither captious nor impertinent, but natural and appoſite, if we look upon the words of the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick, as conſidered in themſelves; viz. <hi>It is certain by Gods Word, that Children which are baptized, dying before they commit actual ſin, are undoubtedly ſaved</hi>; for here is the <hi>Opus Operatum, Children baptized,</hi> and dying before actual ſin; here is the effect, at leaſt, the ſure conſequent of it, ſuch are <hi>undoubtedly ſaved</hi>; here is nothing mentioned concerning the <hi>Modus,</hi> how and in what manner the work is or ought to be done to produce ſuch an effect or fore-ſignifie ſuch a Conſequent. Now therefore, if ſuch a Conſequent do neceſſarily follow after ſuch a Cauſe; then if it be in the power of Man to be ſuch a Cauſe (as to kill a poor In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant preſently after Baptiſm) it will be in his power alſo to bring about ſuch an effect, <hi>viz.</hi> the Salvation of ſuch an Infant.

               <hi>Regularly admitted by Baptiſm, which the Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land

               <hi>ſuppoſes, anſwers moſt of my captious Queries.</hi> I anſwer, Let me have liberty to put in and out, and ſuppoſe what I pleaſe in all caſes, (as you do from time to time) and I will, <hi>nullo negotio,</hi> untye every <hi>Gordion</hi> Knot; I will affirm or deny any Propoſition, be it in it ſelf true or falſe, right or wrong, without any ſcruple or heſitation; no Prieſt or Jeſuite ſhall be able to out-do me. How know you that the Church ſuppoſeth theſe words, <hi>Regularly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by Baptiſm</hi>? Why ſhould you preſume to ſet ſuch limits, to put ſuch a cloſe Hedge about the Rubrick, when it lies open, and in common? But if you will thus incroach preſumptuouſly from your own head and heart, why am I bound to give credit unto you? or govern my Faith and Practice by your private Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? Yet I wiſh theſe words, <hi>Regularly admitted by Baptiſm,</hi> had been expreſſed in the Rubrick; which perhaps might have ſaved me the trouble of objecting, and ſo you of confuting. But granting the truth of the Rubrick in its latitude; I ſaid,
<q>That a Miniſter would be very cruel and unmerciful, to deny a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Children their Chriſtendom, though their Parents out of weakneſs or tenderneſs of Conſcience ſcrupled Godfathers and Godmothers, and the Sign of the Croſs, and durſt not upon that ſcore bring their Children to be baptized; yet, <hi>as I added,</hi> if he were a true Son of the Church, and punctually obſerved his preſcribed Rule, he muſt not baptize any Infant without Godfathers and Godmothers, without ſigning of it with the Sign of the Croſs, whether it be ſaved or damned.</q>
Here you ſay, <hi>I am a man of Conſcience,</hi> that is of no Conſcience at all,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 20. <hi>l.</hi> 6.</note> of a <hi>tender Conſcience,</hi> that is cauteriz'd: But why? for bringing in ſuch a falſe and unjuſt Charge againſt the practice of the Church of <hi>England</hi>; which,<note place="margin">

<q>plainly appeareth in the form of private Baptiſm, has expreſly ordered her Miniſters to baptize Children without Godfathers and Godmothers, or the Sign of the Croſs: You know not what remark to make on this,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>p.</hi> 2. <hi>l.</hi> 19.</note> but leave it to my ſelf, and every impartial Reader, to think on it.</q>
Though you do not know what Remark to make on my Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet I know what Remarks to make on your Confutation; for plainly, I obſerve in it falſeneſs, and weakneſs: Firſt, there is a great untruth in it; for though you ſay,
<q>The Church of <hi>England</hi> has expreſly ordered (in that private form
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:64663:16"/>
of baptizing) to baptize Children without Godfathers and Godmothers, or the Sign of the Croſs; <hi>yet there is no ſuch thing</hi> expreſſed or mentioned in the Order,</q>
but at the uttermoſt it is only ſuppoſed by a Mute; and will you call ſilence expreſſion? Here I leave you to your ſelf, and ſerious thoughts; ſo likewiſe to the thoughts of the impartial Reader, how far you can ſtretch to bring in an Accuſation. If the Miniſter in private Baptiſm ſhould ſign the Infant baptized with the Sign of the Croſs, would he croſs the intent of that ſilent (which you call expreſs) Order, yea or not? I believe nothing at all; which to do, had it been an expreſſed or declared Order, would have been a manifeſt violati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſame: And then as to Godfathers and Godmothers, they are both mentioned, and interrogated, and as clearly brought in for the Conſummation of private Baptiſm, as in publick. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, There is a great weakneſs in our Confutation; for my Objection lies againſt the manner of baptizing in ordinary, and you anſwer me from the manner of baptizing in extraordinary, <hi>as in caſe of any apparent danger of death.</hi>
               <note place="margin">

               <hi>how ſcrupulous ſoever they be,</hi> (as you avouch they may) come to their Chriſtendom? What ſhall theſe, whether theſe Children be in imminent peril of death, yea or not, come with a lye in their mouths to the Miniſter, and ſay,
<q>Pray, Sir, baptize our Children according to the private or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Baptiſm, for they are ready to die, though they are not?</q>
Well, he comes, and on the contrary ſees their Children ſtrong and well; ought he now to baptize them according to the private or publick form? Surely according to the publick, becauſe the pretended neceſſity of the private is found a falſity: Here <hi>ergo</hi> the ſcrupulous Parents are at the ſame Bar as at the beginning, and their Children as far from being baptized as ever; and this too becauſe the Miniſter <hi>will not,</hi> and, <hi>according to order, ought not to baptize their Children without Godfathers and Godmothers, and the Sign of the Croſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now what I have here ſpoken is not an idle Suppoſition, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

matter of fact; for I know the Perſon very well, who has again and again been deſired by Parents to baptize their Children, and being unwilling and averſe to intermeddle in that affair, hath ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely counſelled the ſaid Parents to have a recourſe to their own Pariſh-Miniſter to do it for them, whoſe proper office it was: but they have replied,
<q>He will not baptize our Children without Godfathers and Godmothers, and we know not where to get them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>My laſt ſcruple was againſt the Order and Office for the Burial of the Dead; wherein we have as much ſaid, as can well be ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified and expreſſed by word or tongue, concerning the moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſalvation and happineſs of every one buried by the Miniſter, though of the worſt of men, though of the moſt flagitious and facinorous perſons, ſo living, and ſo dying. What think you of S. <hi>Coleman</hi> the Traytor? I am aſſured from an Eye and Ear-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that he was buried in S. <hi>Giles</hi>'s Church-yard by one of the Readers, and by the Common-Prayer Book; and ſo perhaps were the reſt, not of the Loyal, but Liolan and lying Saints after him: At every ſuch Interment, the Miniſter ſaith,
<q>Foraſmuch as it hath pleaſed God of his great mercy, to take unto himſelf the Soul of our dear Brother here departed,<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
What can more plainly ſignifie the ſafety and bliſs of ſuch a Soul? what can more fully declare the love and favour of God towards it, and place it in Heaven? You ſay,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 21. <hi>l.</hi> 14.</note>
               <q>It is no more than that of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> in the <hi>Eccleſiaſtes,</hi> Chap. 12.7. Then ſhall the duſt return to the Earth as it was, and the Spirit ſhall return unto God who gave it.</q>
But ſurely, in my judgment, <hi>God his taking to himſelf (and this too in mercy, in great mercy) every ſuch particular ſoul,</hi> (whoſe body is committed to the ground) ſounds and imports much more than <hi>Solomon</hi> intended, <hi>by his returning, of the Spirit unto God after death</hi>; for the whole verſe is but a general deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of death, and to give us to underſtand, that after death the Body goes one way, and the Soul another; the Body to the Ground, and the Soul unto God; that is, ad <hi>Deum Judicem,</hi> unto God as unto a Judge, before whoſe dreadful Tribunal the Soul immediately after death ſhall be brought to appear, and there ſhall be ſentenced according to deſert, either to weal or woe, for ever and ever. This is quite another thing from <hi>God his receiving

I confeſs, in this particular, your Charity and Hope is much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond mine, and yet I think mine is regulated according to the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>But your fulleſt juſtification of your Church in this matter, is by ſuppoſing this Office of Burial to be performed only to <hi>perſons dying in Communion with the Church.</hi> I look upon it as the beſt Apology, and I have heard it again and again, yet it is not equal nor ſatisfactory; becauſe it ſuppoſeth, if not an impoſſibility, yet the greateſt improbability: For it is known upon matter of fact, that Excommunication was never duly exerciſed, nor Church-Diſcipline ever duly adminiſtred, nor indeed likely to be for the future; while in the interim multitudes, multitudes of ungodly men are brought to the ground, and there the laſt Office done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, as if they were the moſt Godly, and approved by the Church. The Church ſuppoſeth or maketh a Foundation which
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:64663:18"/>
is not, and then buildeth her practice upon it, againſt all right and ſeemlineſs: It is as if I certainly knowing ſuch and ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to be really mad, and out of their wits by a long <hi>Quotidian</hi> experience, and yet from time to time would treat and converſe with them, as perſons moſt ſober and diſcreet, becauſe being men, it muſt be ſuppoſed that they have exerciſe of reaſon and underſtanding.</p>
            <p>But rather than not juſtifie the Office for the Dead, and not to help out the defect of due Excommunication, you ſay,
<q>I doubt not but whoſoever ſhall leave out that ſentence,<note place="margin">

I anſwer, <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quum obtines,</hi> you are <hi>ſemper idem,</hi> beginning and ending with the ſame mind, and in the ſame way. You can put in, and leave out, to ſerve a turn, according to your pleaſure, and yet not be a Tranſgreſſor, but <hi>comply with the intention of the Church.</hi> Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there is no ſuch matter; for the Church hath expreſly ordered concerning the laſt prayers for the Office, whereof theſe words, <hi>as our hope is this our Brother doth,</hi> are a part, in this manner, <hi>Then the Prieſt ſhall ſay,</hi> ſhall ſay, that is, he muſt and ought to ſay them, and never omit them. Here the Miniſter is expreſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and much more, than to baptize without the Sign of the Croſs, as you could urge in the caſe of private Baptiſm, though moſt illogically, and moſt remotely from true reaſon, as far as a privative is from a poſitive, and a Non-entity from a Being. To conclude, if you do not when you bury the dead (though known beyond all peradventure to die in their ſins) uſe theſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry words, <hi>as our hope is this our Brother doth,</hi> you are a Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor againſt the Church, inaſmuch as you directly diſobey her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs order and rule, and you contradict your own Declaration, and little leſs than give the Lye to your own ſolemn Oath and Aſſeveration; for then and there you declared your <hi>unfeigned aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and conſent to all and every thing contained and preſcribed in and by the Book, entituled, the Book of Common-Prayer; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to all and every thing contained in and preſcribed by the ſaid Book for the Burial of the Dead</hi>; which yet you like not, nor ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove in ſuch and ſuch caſes that too often occur, as to ſuch and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:64663:18"/>
ſuch perſons, which are every day upon the Biere; but rather you think it right and meet to omit and skip them over, as not proper to be applied, not good to be mentioned. On the other ſide, if you uſe theſe words, <hi>as our hope is this our Brother doth,</hi> viz. <hi>reſt in Chriſt,</hi> at the Sepultures of the Sons of <hi>Belial,</hi> while you obey the Churches order, you are a tranſgreſſor againſt your own Conſcience, in uttering what you believe not; and a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor againſt God, in mentioning this your hope before him in your prayers, as if you had good ground and authority for it out of his holy Word, concerning the perſons deceaſed; when as in reality there is nothing in the Scriptures of Truth to intimate or countenance ſuch an hope, but altogether, on the contrary, to ſtrike a fear in our hearts of their moſt miſerable reſtleſs ſtate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der eternal death and damnation.</p>

            <p>You ſay, <hi>Becauſe of ſome poſſible</hi> Errata <hi>or faults that may eſcape in the printing of the Book of Common-Prayer, or otherwiſe, I ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to give my unfeigned aſſent and conſent</hi> unto all and every thing contained in it; <hi>but this is a weak foundation,</hi>

It is you, and not I, who make ſuch <hi>Errata,</hi> properly ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led (which may be found in the Common-Prayer Book, as well as in any other Book, wholly beſides the intention of the Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of them) to be the true, proper, and main ground of my bogling at the Declaration; for I plainly by name except againſt the <hi>Order appointed for reading the holy Scriptures, againſt the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der appointed for the adminiſtration of Baptiſm, and ſo againſt the Order appointed for the burying of the Dead:</hi> Now the things wherein I except againſt theſe, in my apprehenſion, are not <hi>Erra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> but <hi>Errors,</hi> not <gap reason="foreign">

let me inſert theſe words, <hi>Saving all errours which may be found therein,</hi> (as your Fore-man was good at inſerting) and I will readily declare <hi>my unfeigned aſſent and conſent to all and every thing contained in, and preſcribed by the Book of Common-Prayer.</hi>

                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.1.</note> now ſuch are many things contained in the Liturgy, as the <hi>reading of</hi> Apocrypha, <hi>ſigning with the ſign of the Croſs,</hi> &amp;c. theſe things are not of an infallible truth, nor are we ſure of the goodneſs of them in their own nature by the Word of God: wherefore here the forementioned rule is moſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite and neceſſary, <hi>Hast thou Faith? have it to thy ſelf:</hi> in theſe uncertain doubtful matters compel not others to judge as thou judgeſt, nor to affirm what thou affirmeſt. But, ſay you, <hi>Why, or how then can there be any publick</hi> Sanctions <hi>in the world</hi>?<note place="margin">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 3. <hi>l.</hi> 55.</note> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, There ſhould be no publick Sanctions, eſpecially in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of God, and his Worſhip, unto which every private Profeſſor ſhall be called, and neceſſitated to give his <hi>unfeigned aſſent and conſent</hi> (as we are bound to do in all things, with reference to the Liturgy) but the truth and goodneſs of them, in their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſhould inſtantly and apparently be ſeen by every eye, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all ſcruple, or doubtful heſitation; for otherwiſe, whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhall ſo declare his <hi>unfeigned aſſent and conſent,</hi> will either do it blindly, at all adventures, or elſe unfaithfully, with a wavering uncertain judgment, or elſe wickedly, againſt his own mind and thoughts. Wherefore the higheſt of publick Magiſtrates may not abuſe their Power into any oppreſſive compulſion, but are bound for Peace ſake, and for Conſcience ſake, not to bind the Conſciences of the people to believe and imbrace their private particular Sentiments, as if they were Oracular, and beyond all
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:64663:21"/>
queſtioning; but leave them to their own liberty to judge as they pleaſe, until ſuch time as they are better informed, and more fully convinced.</p>
            <p>But, ſay you, <hi>A publick Church-Officer may reject an Heretick.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 3 <hi>l.</hi> 43.</note> I anſwer, What is this to the matter before us? Becauſe he may reject an Heretick, that is, one who denies the Fundamentals of Religion and Godlineſs, therefore he is above this rule, <hi>Haſt thou Faith? have it to thy ſelf</hi>; and may compel thoſe under him to believe what he believes, and ſay what he ſaith: From ſuch a kind of wild reaſoning, <hi>libera nos</hi>! I profeſs I am at my wits end here, as in ſeveral other places, to find what you drive at; how then ſhall I fence my ſelf againſt you? I wiſhed, as to the Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, our Law-givers had required no more than <hi>uſe and ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as preceding Governours,</hi> h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>And what is more required</hi>? I anſwer, Very much: for when I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare <hi>my unfeigned aſſent and conſent to all and every thing, &amp;c.</hi> I ſpeak as much as can be ſpoken in words, to <hi>expreſs my love, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, and choice,</hi> concerning all and every thing contained in, and preſcribed by the Book, as moſt true and unqueſtionable to be believed, as moſt eligible and deſirable to be obſerved in every Office, Service, Rite, Ceremony, and Circumſtance thereof; but when I only ſubmit to the uſe of the Liturgy, <hi>I yield,</hi> for peace and order's ſake to my Superiours, <hi>in things not ſimply ſinful and unlawful,</hi> though in themſelves far from <hi>perfection,</hi> and far from <hi>my deſire</hi> in my own free choice and election. And what I have now aſſerted with little leſs than a contradiction to your ſelf, you have acknowledged already in your foregoing diſcourſe, <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph</hi> 4. And in this very <hi>Paragraph</hi> you do it again; when you ſay,
<q>'Tis our Zeal too they are offended at,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>p.</hi> 4. <hi>l.</hi> 18.</note> that beyond what our preceding Governours did, with reference to this Book of Common-Prayer, we thus ſtrictly enjoyn, that Miniſters do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare their unfeigned aſſent and conſent; but are not the men we have to deal with, thoſe that are gone off from all obedience to Church and State, and is it not reaſon we take ſome pledge of them for their future integrity? Is any man found guilty of a much leſs hainous Indictment, and yet diſcharged without gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Sureties for his behaviour? Shall men who have broken through Oaths of Allegiance, ſhall ſuch men be diſpleaſed, if
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:64663:22"/>
we cannot take the Viper into our Breaſt without pulling out the Sting? That we dare not admit men of theſe Principles and Practices to come into the Church, without giving ſuch Caution of their being in good earneſt, as may juſtifie thoſe in admitting them, who have the care of the Publick?</q>
Now what is the purport and meaning of all theſe words, and many more of the ſame nature, but plainly to tell us, that an harder Yoke is now put upon our Necks, than upon Miniſters in former days? and that our Governours had all reaſon to make our Bonds ſtronger, as for the puniſhment of by-paſt miſcarriages, ſo for the preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of future relapſes? Here therefore you forget your ſelf.</p>
            <p>But, you ſay,
<q>It is not neceſſary to the aſſent and conſent here required,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>p.</hi> 4. <hi>l.</hi> 59.</note> that every particular perſon ſhould take upon him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly to determine in all theſe points, 'tis ſufficient that nothing is ſinful; much leſs doth it become his humility to oppoſe the Opinion he hath of a thing's being good and expedient, to the ſenſe and reaſon of his Governours; 'tis matter of obedience belongs unto him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
I anſwer, Though this be your mind and judgment, I am clearly of another Opinion; I muſt deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, in all points, whether the things be <hi>right and good,</hi> yea or not, before I can <hi>aſſent and conſent</hi> unto them; I muſt be well aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certained what I affirm for a truth, to be a truth indeed, elſe I may be guilty of ſome degree of lying in ſpeaking the very truth. It is not contrary <hi>to humility,</hi> but the juſt and due <hi>exerciſe of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> to ſearch into the goodneſs and expediency of whatſoever I am called <hi>to aſſent and conſent unto,</hi> by whomſoever command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; yea, and to oppoſe my private Opinion to the ſenſe and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of my Governours, if what they ſtile ſenſe and reaſon, ſhall evidently appear to be without ſenſe and reaſon, and at the wideſt diſtance in a contrary way. Every man is bound to ſee with his own eyes, and to judge from his own underſtandings, if he will act like a rational Creature; it is not the part of <hi>Goſpel-humility,</hi> but of <hi>Sheepiſh ſtupidity</hi> to follow our Leaders, not at all conſidering or judging of the way, but by a blind Implicit Faith and ſubmiſſion, yielding to be turned into every path, meerly becauſe it is their pleaſure and appointment. Thus far in general, now in particular.</p>
            <p>I excepted againſt the order and appointment for the reading of the holy Scriptures, becauſe many Books of <hi>Apocrypha</hi> are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:64663:22"/>
to be read for the Leſſons of the day, as the Book of <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, Bell</hi> and the <hi>Dragon, &amp;c.</hi> while ſome of the Sacred Canon are wholly left out, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now for the removing this Exception, you ſay,
<q>We deſire that our Governours be not blamed,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>p.</hi> 5. <hi>l.</hi> 9.</note> if ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their beſt diſcretion they have choſen out ſuch parts of Scripture to be read in the Congregation, which are moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible; and if they have omitted others, which they thought would not be for the edification of a vulgar Auditory; and if they have mixed ſome of <hi>Apocrypha,</hi> as may be of wholeſome inſtruction.</q>
I anſwer, Though you would not have your Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours blamed for this mixture, yet ſome others will queſtion their zeal and <hi>diſcretion</hi> herein, and think they have juſt reaſon ſo to do: For who ſhall preſume to be wiſer than Chriſt for the good nurture of his Church? who ſhall take on them to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine which is moſt <hi>intelligible, and moſt edifying to the people,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the holy Scripture, or any other writings? I am ſure he that knows it, hath ſaid, <hi>All Scripture</hi> (and therefore that part of Scripture alſo, which is left out of the Kalendar) <hi>is given by in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſpiration of God, and is profitable for Doctrine, for reproof, for cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, for inſtruction in righteouſneſs, that the man of God may be perfect, throughly furniſhed to all good works.</hi> There is no ſuch te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony left on Record, concerning any of the <hi>beſt parts of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crypha,</hi> though ſome of thoſe appointed to be read in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation are far from the beſt; to ſay no more: Therefore this appointment by our Governours may well be ſcrupled; but then the other appointment upon this appointment is moſt highly to be blamed, I mean in their requiring all Miniſters to <hi>declare an unfeigned aſſent and conſent to this their appointment,</hi> though in their own hearts (at leaſt many of them) do not approve of this order, but wiſh it were otherwiſe. <hi>But is this a reaſon,</hi> ſay you,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 5. <hi>l.</hi> 16.</note> 
               <hi>to break Communion with a Church, let any man judge</hi>? To this I have anſwered already; for though I would read ſome Books of <hi>Apocrypha,</hi> rather than break Communion with the Church, as poſſibly not being in it ſelf ſinful and unlawful; yet I would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther break Communion a thouſand times over with the beſt Church in the world, than be a wilful tranſgreſſor; and ſuch ſhould I be in a notorious manner, if <hi>a Lye</hi> be a tranſgreſſion; and I ſhould lye moſt egregiouſly to declare my <hi>unfeigned aſſent
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:64663:23"/>
and conſent,</hi> that is, <hi>my will and deſire to read the Apocrypha,</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than Scripture in the hearing of the people; for in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of my Soul, and in the truth of my Reins, I am utterly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it.</p>
            <p>I excepted againſt the order appointed for the Miniſtration of Baptiſm, becauſe of the ſtrict requiring of Godfathers and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothers, to ſtand as Sureties and Undertakers for the Child brought to his Chriſtendom, and this upon ſeveral accounts; as,</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 5. <hi>l.</hi> 37.</note>Firſt, Becauſe it is unſcriptural: Unto this you ſay,
<q>It cannot be ſuppoſed that this order of Godfathers and Godmothers ſhould be preſcribed in Scripture, the receiving of perſons by Baptiſm there being upon their own actual Faith, and before there was any National Church wherein this order could be obſerved; and it was ſufficient that the Children were then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Baptiſm, as they were in the Covenant; that is, by the Faith of the Parents.</q>
I anſwer, In theſe words there ſeems to me to be a plain contradiction in themſelves, but nothing of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why Godfathers and Godmothers are not mentioned in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for the baptizing of Infants. There is a contradiction in them; for you ſay, Perſons in thoſe times were received upon their <hi>own actual Faith</hi>; and yet you preſently add further, that Children were then admitted to Baptiſm <hi>by the Faith of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</hi> There is nothing of reaſon in them for what they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded; for though Parents were received by their own actual Faith, and Children by the Faith of ſuch Parents, what is this of bar and impediment to Godfathers and Godmothers at the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing of Infants? or why they ſhould not be mentioned and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in Scripture? Surely, in my weak apprehenſion, nothing at all: But the Adult, as you truly ſpeak, in Scripture-times were admitted into the Church by Baptiſm through their own actual Faith, and their Children were inveſted with the ſame Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge, by <hi>virtue of the Covenant,</hi> as being there declared in that <hi>Royal Charter and Patent, Fellow-Inheritors</hi> of the ſame Promiſe together with their Parents. And are not Children in our days received by Baptiſm in the ſame way, and upon the ſame terms and conditions, as from the beginning? Since there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (according to your own Conceſſion) their Children then had no Sureties when they were baptized, neither need ours in the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:64663:23"/>
like Circumſtances. You would confute me, and you confute your ſelf. But you ſay, <hi>Abundans cautela</hi> ſhould not be ſcrupled,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 5. <hi>l.</hi> 41.</note> but rather commended. I anſwer, Let us not pretend to be more careful than God, in the receiving of thoſe into his Family, whom he commands us to receive; but leave him wholly to his own moſt Sapient Providence, and admit of all ſuch upon his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, and conſult no better.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I objected, that the Father of the Child is left out, not mentioned, nor at all taken notice of at the baptizing. For the vacating of this Objection, you ſay,
<q>The receiving the Child, ſuppoſes the Father concerned in it,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>p.</hi> 5. <hi>l.</hi> 45.</note> becauſe it is through his Faith he is in Covenant.</q>
I anſwer, You ſpeak ſo much in the Clouds, that I am utterly at a loſs what Arrow you let fly at me, or what you intend. Every Child I know ſuppoſeth a Father, and every baptized Child a believing Parent; yet this believing Parent <hi>is left out</hi>; who notwithſtanding is and ought to be the main Suſceptor and Surety for his Childs good abearing: on him, I ſay, it is incumbent, to promiſe and vow to bring up his Child in the knowledge and obedience of the Chriſtian Faith, much rather than upon Godfathers and Godmothers. But you ſay,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 5. <hi>l.</hi> 47.</note>
               <q>As to the particular ingaging of the Father for the Childs Education, he muſt be worſe than an Infidel, if he do not take care for thoſe of his own Houſe.</q>
I anſwer, Though I will not, yet ſome would be ready to reply, And therefore the Miniſter is worſe than an Infidel, if he do not mind him of his duty; eſpecially at ſuch a proper and peculiar ſeaſon, when this Parent may well be ſuppoſed to bring his Babe to the Miniſter, deſiring him to receive it, and make it a viſible Church-Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: But in the whole Office of Baptiſm, the Father is not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, nor any thing of his duty ſignified unto him. But you ſay,
<q>Not to admit Godfathers and Godmothers,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>p.</hi> 5. <hi>l.</hi> 5</note> might in ſome caſes be totally to debar the Child of Baptiſm, becauſe it may ſo fall out that the Father may be dead before the Child is born; and then how ſhall he be offered to Baptiſm?</q>
I anſwer, Though the Father of the Child be dead, yet ſome one or other at all times, either by Nature, as being next of Kin, or by Deputation from the Perſon deceaſed, or ſome other way, will appear <hi>as a Propater, a ſecond Father</hi> to the Child, to offer him to Baptiſm:
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:64663:24"/>
but put the caſe that none ſhould appear, yet for want of ſuch a <hi>Sponſor,</hi> the Babe muſt not be debarred of its right, but ought by the care of the Church both to be baptized, and edoctrinated in the Chriſtian Faith.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I objected, that Godfathers and Godmothers are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally brought to the Font to a vouch a great untruth, and make themſelves obnoxious of lying and Perjury in the Face of God, and the Church.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 5 <hi>l.</hi> 51.</note> You ſay, <hi>If they be guilty of this, this is their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe of what is well intended.</hi> I anſwer, Whatſoever is found by along Quotidian experience to be the occaſion of much ſin, (if it be not in it ſelf abſolutely neceſſary to be done and continued) in prudence and piety alſo it ought to be diſuſed.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 5. <hi>l.</hi> 54.</note>But ſay you,
<q>The Child alſo may not anſwer the intents and purpoſes of that ſolemn Vow in Baptiſm, neither the Father make good his promiſe on the behalf of him; and therefore if Godfathers and Godmothers ſhall be detained from ingaging, for fear and danger of falſifying their promiſes and ingagements,</q>
with parity of reaſon the Child alſo upon the ſame account may be detained from being baptized, and the Father likewiſe from being a Surety for him. I anſwer, What God commands is one thing, and what Man commands is another: Whatſoever God commands to be obſerved, muſt be obſerved without regarding Conſequences (and ſuch I hope you apprehend at leaſt the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Infant-baptiſm, if not alſo of the Father his then being chief <hi>Sponſor</hi>;) but in all humane commands and appointments conſequences are much to be weighed and conſidered, either as a Motive for them, or a Bar againſt them; and therefore ſuch hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane commands ſhould not be impoſed which are never likely to be performed, much leſs thoſe which (as ſuch, and ſuch circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances may and often do ariſe and occur) are <hi>tantum non,</hi> next to an impoſſibility; now of this nature are thoſe duties required of Godfathers and Godmothers, with reference to their God-chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and of this kind is the task impoſed upon them, which yet raſhly and inconſiderately enough they undertake to make good and fulfil. You know the charge then given them by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and have given it your ſelf, I ſuppoſe, many and many a time, in theſe words;
<q>Foraſmuch as this Child hath promiſed by you, his Sureties, to renounce the Devil, and all his works,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:64663:24"/>
to believe in God, and to ſerve him: Ye muſt remember, that is your parts and duties to ſee that this Infant be taught, ſo ſoon as he ſhall be able to learn, what a ſolemn promiſe and profeſſion he hath here made by you: And that he may know theſe things the better, ye ſhall call upon him to hear Sermons, and chiefly ye ſhall provide that he may learn the Creed, the Lords Prayer, and the ten Commandments in the vulgar Tongue, and all other things which a Chriſtian ought to know and believe to his Souls health, and that this Child may be vertuouſly brought up, lead a godly and Chriſtian life.</q>
Speak now, Sir, your Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and let not prejudice blind you, but tell me, <hi>bona fide,</hi> do you believe when you give this charge to Godfathers and Godmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that they are ever likely to perform it? Do you think when you call them to this arduous Province, they can anſwer the ends of it according to the truſt committed to their hands, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their ingagements; and not be found lyars? Godfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Godmothers, you know ſometimes live far from their God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> children in another Hamlet, Village, Town, City, County, Country<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> generally they are at a diſtance in another houſe, and in another Street: how therefore is it poſſible for them <hi>to ſee</hi> the ſaid Children to <hi>be taught as ſoon as they are able to learn</hi>? and particularly to be inſtructed concerning the nature and quality of thoſe ſolemn baptiſmal promiſes made on their behalf? How is it poſſible for them to <hi>provide</hi> that the ſaid Children ſhall <hi>learn the Creed, &amp;c. with all other things which a Chriſtian ought to know and believe to his Souls health</hi>? Can theſe things be brought to paſs, and effected, while God-children are down upon their knees, and ask their Godfathers bleſſing? or do they not require conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of time, with a continual care and diligence?
<q>Theſe words which I command thee this day ſhall be in thine heart,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.6.</note> and thou ſhalt teach them diligently unto thy Children (<hi>not God-children</hi>) and talk of them, when thou ſitteſt in thine houſe, when thou lieſt down, and when thou riſeſt up.</q>
Parents who are daily and hourly converſant with their Children <hi>by often talking</hi> in their hearing concerning the matters of Religion both of Law and Goſpel, and by a frequent catechiſing and inſtructing them in the Rudiments thereof, may cauſe the knowledge of Chriſtianity <hi>guttatim</hi> to inſtill into their minds; and ſo train them
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:64663:25"/>
up in the right way for their <hi>ſouls health</hi>; but for others to ſee this diligently proſecuted, and faithfully diſcharged, it is ſcarce feaſible, but rather on the contrary utterly impracticable. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore although you ſay, this Objection cannot <hi>bear any weight with conſidering men,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 5. <hi>l.</hi> 48.</note> it will be found, to be otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>Before I paſs on to what follows, if it might not diſpleaſe you, I would ask you one queſtion more about Godfathers and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothers, Whether when you give them the forementioned charge, your ſelf hold them bound to perform the obligation of it? Did you ever in good earneſt, either in the Pulpit; or out of the Pulpit, mind them of their duty? Did you ever confer with them in private about the greatneſs and momentouſneſs of their Font-ingagements? One Mr. <hi>Falkner,</hi> I perceive, has written much in the high commendation of the Liturgy; has he any word of Conviction to chide with Godfathers and Godmothers for their Quotidian neglect, and to ſhew them the ſin and danger of it? has he any word of Exhortation to ſtir them up to pay their Vows, and bind their Conſciences to a due care and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs herein? What, are we in earneſt, or in jeſt? what, is all meer formality without reality? <hi>At non ludendum eſt in ſacris</hi>; this Scene is not ſeemly, and I wiſh it might not continue.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 5. <hi>l.</hi> 63.</note>You ſay, <hi>My reaſoning against the Croſs is ſo trifling, that you wonder with what face any can urge it</hi>? I anſwer, Be it ſo; but withall, pray let us ſee what ponderous Reaſons you can bring for it?<note place="margin">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 6. <hi>l.</hi> 11.</note> They follow in theſe words, <hi>Did the Ancient Fathers plead ſo much for it in any other ſenſe than Chriſt commanded his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, to take up their Croſs, and follow him? Are they to imitate their Maſter in doing this, in the whole courſe of their life, and may they not uſe ſo much as a ſign of it to expreſs it to others, or bring them in mind of their duty themſelves? Davus ſum non</hi> Oedipus: I neither underſtand the ſenſe nor the ſcope of theſe words, much leſs how they are urged either againſt me, or for the good and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediency of the ſign of the Croſs in the Miniſtration of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm. If the Ancient Fathers did plead ſo much for the Croſs in no other ſenſe, <hi>but in Chriſts ſenſe, then in your ſenſe</hi> they pleaded not for it at all; that is, for the ſign of the Croſs to be made in the Forehead by the finger of a Miniſter: For was this the Croſs Chriſt commanded his Diſciples to take up, and follow him?
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:64663:25"/>
               <hi>Are they again,</hi> ſay you, <hi>to imitate their Master in doing this, and may they</hi> (his Diſciples) <hi>not uſe ſo much as a ſign of it, to expreſs it to others,</hi> (I ſuppoſe you mean by others, <hi>the children baptized</hi>) <hi>or to bring them</hi> (theſe children) <hi>in mind of their duty themſelves</hi>? I anſwer, God never ordained the ſign of the Croſs, to bring us in mind or remembrance of bearing Chriſts Croſs, that is of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining <gap reason="foreign">

For, firſt, the Croſs is aiery and tranſient upon the fleſh, and not inured in the fleſh; how therefore ſhall that that is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed bring the Child hereafter in mind of his duty, as <hi>to confeſs the Faith of Chriſt crucified, and manfully to fight under his Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner? &amp;c.</hi> Secondly, becauſe the Child baptized is then not a Subject capable of knowing, regarding, or minding what Croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing imports. Surely therefore if the ſign of the Croſs ſhall be thought at all requiſite and expedient, it would be much better deferred and reſerved for the time of Confirmation; for then Children may well be ſuppoſed to have attained and gained the uſe of Reaſon, to know and remark what is ſaid and done unto them: Yet I confeſs if many of them be not, yet they may and ought to be confirmed (though wholly beſides the true intent and end of that Church-conſtitution) while they are very Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; for this is according to the order in that caſe, which runs in theſe words, <hi>Ye</hi> (Godfathers and Godmothers) <hi>are to take care that this Child be brought to the Biſhop, to be confirmed by him ſo ſoon as he can ſay the Creed, the Lords Prayer, and ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the Vulgar Tongue, &amp;c.</hi> My Children, I thank my God, could ſay all theſe as perfectly as my ſelf before they were four years old, and I aſſure you too in the Vulgar Tongue; for I pray tell me, what Proteſtants now teach them their children in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin? what need therefore of that grave <hi>Item</hi> and Caution? only we muſt ſtill go on in the old road, when the cuſtoms of things are altered and antiquated, and the reaſon of them utterly anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilated: But in the interim, I thought not my Children then fit for Confirmation, but wiſh they may be found worthy ten years after.</p>

               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:64663:26"/>And now, notwithſtanding what has been ſpoken to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, I will grant you your Plea, viz. <hi>That the ſign of the Croſs is to bring the children baptized in mind of their duty,</hi> to confeſs the Faith of Chriſt crucified, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But then will it not be too too like a Sacrament upon a Sacrament, thus to add the ſign of the Croſs unto Baptiſm; though for me to ſay ſo, <hi>you ſtile it frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous</hi>? For what is a Sacrament? <hi>Is it not,</hi> according to the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm, <hi>an outward and viſible ſign of an inward and ſpiritual grace</hi>? Is not the ſign of the Croſs <hi>an outward and viſible ſign</hi>? and is not the minding of our duty, or the practical remembrance of confeſſing of the Faith of Chriſt crucified, and of manfully fighting under Chriſts Banner, <hi>the inward and ſpiritual grace</hi>? I leave it to your conſideration.</p>
            <p>Baptizing it ſelf, I ſaid, <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> does oblige the perſon bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, and withall exhibits a vertue to every worthy Partaker, to confeſs the Faith, and to fight againſt Sin, the World, and the Devil.<note place="margin">

You would pick ſomething out of the words <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> which yet there imply no more than this, when the baptizing is over, or the waſhing of water in the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, is done or performed by the Miniſter, without any future or further ſigning with the ſign of the Croſs. And yet after all, the Sacraments are not <hi>nuda ſigna, ſed ſigna exhibentia &amp; obſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantia</hi> to every worthy Partaker of them; and who are thus worthy, I will acquaint you in ſomething which ſhall be ſpoken to by and by. But to requite you for your kindneſs, I pray Sir, let me know whether my ſaying, <hi>That baptizing in the Name of the Father,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>obliges the perſon, and exhibits the power,</hi> &amp;c. does import and imply the Sacraments conferring grace <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> and not your Rubrick much more, which ſaith, <hi>It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain by Gods Word, that children which are baptized, dying before they have committed actual ſin, are undoubtedly ſaved</hi>?

            <p>For the juſtification of this Rubrick I called for Scripture, and

I anſwer, I think S.<hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks nothing to the juſtification of the Rubrick; but only thus far in general, That as <hi>Noah</hi> and his Family in the Ark were ſaved from the Deluge, ſo people by Baptiſm are ſaved from the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer Deep; and theſe not only Children before actual ſin, but even the Adult alſo after the perpetration of the ſame; for ſuch were all they who were houſed and ſaved in the Ark. If therefore you will frame an argument from hence for the ſalvation of Infants baptized before actual ſin, the argument is of like force for men and women baptized, though actually guilty: And then from hence it will follow, that all perſons baptized are undoubtedly ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Here is <hi>opus operatum,</hi> conferring grace with a witneſs, and without all failure: Though it is far otherwiſe, as we may ſee even in that Type of Baptiſm; for notwithſtanding <hi>Cham</hi> was ſaved in the Ark with an Ark ſalvation, yet we think him a Caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>away; ſo thouſands may be ſaved with a Baptiſm-ſalvation, and yet periſh eternally.

And beſides all this, remiſſion of ſins, there ſpoken of, relates not ſo much unto Baptiſm, as unto Repentance; for <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> his great work was to call people to Repentance, <hi>In thoſe days came the Baptiſt preaching, and ſaying, Repent ye, for the Kingdom of God is at hand</hi>; upon this account his baptiſm is ſtiled, <hi>The Baptiſm of Repentance</hi>; and he himſelf ſaith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.11. <hi>I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance</hi>: And as a teſtimony of their true repentance, he called them to his baptiſm, and not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; and accordingly if their repentance were unfeigned and ſincere, anſwerable to the outward ſign of it in Baptiſm, their ſins ſhould be remitted unto them, elſe abide upon them, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that waſhing.

Baptiſm, the one of Water, and the other of the Spirit; the one to purge away the filth of the body, the other to purge away the filth of the ſoul. Now there is a wide and vaſt difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe two, which are not only diſtinguiſhable, but ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and often ſeparated the one from the other. The Baptiſm of Water is often without the Baptiſm of the Spirit, and the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of the Spirit without the Baptiſm of Water. Where theſe two happily meet together in the ſame perſon, there the bleſſed reſult and conſequence hereof is <hi>ſure pardon, and remiſſion of ſins,</hi> and the final iſſue, undoubted ſalvation; otherwiſe not. But now who ſhall preſume to tell, as to <hi>hic &amp; nunc</hi> (when this and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Child is baptized) concerning the certain concurrence of both theſe? who hath known the mind of God herein? who can diſcover this inſcrutable ſecret? But yet let me not be miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken when I ſaid, <hi>otherwiſe not</hi>; for it is to be reſtrained only to the firſt Baptiſm: for though this cannot ſeal unto us the pardon of ſins without the laſt, yet the laſt can do it by it ſelf alone with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the firſt. All the Ancient Patriarchs, and Prophets, and holy Confeſſors, and Saints before Chriſt's Incarnation, had only the laſt Baptiſm; and ſince that time, all thoſe Infant-Martyrs under the butchery of <hi>Herod,</hi> had only this laſt Baptiſm; thouſands of the Seed of believing Parents, ſome of them dying before they were born, and ſome of them immediately after, have had only this laſt Baptiſm: that bleſſed Babe which brake out of the Womb, while the Mother of it was now ſacrificing her Body in the Flames, for a teſtimony to the Truth againſt curſed Papiſts, (who moſt cruelly and unnaturally forthwith condemned this young Heretick to be burnt, together with the old one) had only this laſt baptiſm; notwithſtanding the ſins of all theſe (and of all others in the ſame circumſtances) were undoubtedly remitted, and their ſouls undoubtedly ſaved. Though they were not made partakers of the outward waſhing, yet the inward waſhing was graciouſly vouchſafed to them unto life everlaſting: this there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is that which I would call the true and real Goſpel-baptiſm, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, by way of Eminency; whereas the outward Baptiſm of Water, which is only in the power of man to adminiſter, can never do away ſin, neither can it aſſure us of the remiſſion of the ſame. <hi>He is not a</hi> Jew <hi>who is one outwardly, neither is that
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:64663:28"/>
Circumciſion which is outward in the fleſh; but he is a</hi> Jew <hi>who is one inwardly, and Circumciſion is that of the heart, and in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> Rom. 2.28. In like manner, he is not a Chriſtian who is one outwardly, neither is that baptiſm which is outward on the fleſh, but he is a Chriſtian who is one inwardly, and baptiſm is that of the heart, and in the ſpirit: this, this only is the unerring infallible ſign and ſeal unto us of our intereſt in the Covenant of Grace, and the great bleſſing annexed to it: <hi>I will be merciful un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their unrighteouſneſs, and their ſins and iniquities I will remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber no more, Heb.</hi> 7.12. But now who knows, whether all and every one among the multitude of young children that have the baptiſm of the fleſh, have alſo the baptiſm of the heart, and in the ſpirit? This is thick darkneſs, and we cannot pierce through it. Since therefore here we are left <hi>at uncertainty, though the ſaid children be baptized, and though they die before they have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted actual ſin, yet never the more can we be certain by Gods Word, that they are undoubtedly ſaved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet for all this, the baptiſm on the fleſh, or waſhing with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is not an inſignificant Ceremony, but has its weighty and momentous ends, according to the wiſe counſel of him that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained it, handing forth many general, bleſſings to all that are baptized; and beſides theſe, more ſpecial favours to every wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy partaker of it; and this ſignal one among others,<hi>Remiſſion of ſins.</hi> And now why tarrieſt thou? ariſe and be baptized, and waſh away thy ſins, calling on the Name of the Lord. But then we muſt carefully ſingle out who are the worthy partakers; there is therefore a double worthineſs, the one external, and the other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal: now theſe ſpecial bleſſings are imparted not to thoſe who are only worthy with an external worthineſs, but with an internal alſo. All they may be ſaid to be externally worthy, who have an outward call, and are duly qualified, according to the rules of the Goſpel, to participate of that Ordinance; and among others, the children of Profeſſors, or the children of believing Parents: All they, and only they have an inward worthineſs, who are the <hi>called of God according to his purpoſe, and choſen in Chriſt before the foundation of the world:</hi> now unto all theſe, and only unto theſe, the Sacrament <hi>does ſign, ſeal, exhibit, and convey the grace of the Goſpel.</hi> When I ſay, <hi>exhibit and convey,</hi> I mean only in <hi>ſuo genere,</hi>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:64663:28"/>
according to the nature of the Ordinance, as an Inſtrument in the hand of Omnipotency, who worketh in, and by, and with what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever means he will, and effecteth all his counſels and ſtupendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous works, in this way and manner, with never failing ſucceſs; as when with the blaſt of Rams horns he tumbled down the Walls of <hi>Jerico,</hi> or to come nearer to the matter in hand, when with the waters of <hi>Jordan</hi> he healed the <hi>Syrian</hi> of his Leproſie. You ſee therefore, that it is not the Sacrament it ſelf, as it is <hi>opus operatum</hi> in the adminiſtration of it, but the Omnipotency and faithfulneſs of God in the application of it, conferring grace; and yet not unto all, but only unto the worthy Partakers, and theſe alſo with an inward worthineſs. To conclude therefore, <hi>as Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is for remiſſion of ſins,</hi> ſo likewiſe <hi>the Lords Supper, This Cup is the New Teſtament in my Blood, ſhed for many for the remiſſion of ſins.</hi> It was indeed <hi>for remiſſion of ſins unto the Eleven, but not unto</hi> Judas, though he drank of that Cup as well as his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagues, yea and had a worthineſs for it, that is an outward wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs, and was rightly admitted unto it, but wanted the inward: To the inwardly worthy the bleſſing is communicated, but from all others the bleſſing is ſuſpended.</p>

In a word, Baptiſm is as the mutual ſealing, when both ſides are agreed; the Articles are drawn up, all things are concluded, and now only to be conſummated, by ſetting their Hands and Seals.</p>

Of theſe two, <hi>Undoubtedly ſaved</hi> is the firſt, and <hi>a Salvable condition</hi> is the laſt. You know the <hi>Proverb,</hi> A bird in the hand. <hi>Undoubtedly ſaved</hi> is a Ship arrived, put in and ſafely come to ſhore, paſt all danger; a <hi>Salvable condition</hi> is a ſhip far off on the main; Though ſhe be a ſtout and ſtrong built Veſſel, with all her Tacklings firme and compleat, and in a good and likely way to make a proſperous Voyage yet ſhe may miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and periſh in the deep. Your paraphraſe therefore is pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radox to the Text, though ſound and Orthodox in it ſelf; Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren Baptized are indeed in a Salvable condition, not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but alſo after they have committed actual ſin: yea (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Doctrine of the Liturgy, in the order appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the burial of the dead) not only Children, but grown up men, committing actual ſins (ſins of the deepeſt die, moſt groſs immoralities, not to be named among Chriſtians, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven-daring and Hell-deſerving ſins, all the days of their lives, unto their laſt <hi>Exit</hi>) are ſtill in a Salvable condition: Or elſe how can they be thought to be in an hope-able condition? You know what is read over all ſuch, when they are brought to the Grave. <hi>That when we ſhall depart this life we may reſt in him (in</hi> Chriſt) <hi>as our hope is this our Brother doth.</hi> There is a <hi>Goſpel without an hope</hi> to relie upon the promiſe of it, and there is <hi>an hope,</hi> I ſee, <hi>without a Goſpel</hi> to juſtifie the reaſon of it. But that remains yet to be diſcuſſed: I therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the matter before us. <hi>Children Baptized</hi> are in a <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable condition,</hi> that is in a right, hopeful, and probable way of ſalvation, according to the Goſpel. For though Chriſt hath ſaid it, <hi>many are called, and few are Choſen</hi>; and though from hence, even becauſe of the multitude who are called into Gods Family continually by Baptiſme, as from other Objections,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:64663:29"/>
ſome Scruples may ariſe in our minds, powerful enough <hi>to take off,</hi> and hinder the full Aſſurance, and <hi>certain belief of the undoubted Salvation</hi> of all ſuch; yet becauſe the ſecret things of Election belong wholly to God, and the revealed things of the outward call only unto us, we according to what is revealed unto us in that outward call, may and ought to judge Charitably concerning all Infants Baptized, and hope well of their Eternal State. In the general, we have good reaſon to believe, that God will own and bleſs his own Ordinances, and grant Salvation to his people in his own ways and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions appointed for ſuch an end. Truth hath ſaid it, <hi>He that believeth and his Baptized ſhall be ſaved.</hi> Children, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs cannot actually believe, and ſo perhaps this promiſe is not properly theirs: yet they cannot wholly be debarred of it; for even in their infancy, the ſeed of Grace, and the ſeed of Faith, may be ſown and Rooted in their Hearts; but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they are <hi>actually Baptized,</hi> which leads on directly to the <hi>Bleſſing</hi> there mentioned, and has ſuch a full and fair Aſpect upon the ſame, that I would not be wanting of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Baptiſme my ſelf, nor deprive my Children of it for Thouſands of Gold and Silver; and the rather becauſe Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom hath ſaid again, <hi>Except a man be born of Water, and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You have therefore my vote and ſuffrage, for the <hi>Salvable condition Children Baptized:</hi> I leave them in the way of life, while yet they are living: in <hi>via Salutis, dum viatores,</hi> but how they can be thought or ſaid to be ſo <hi>in termino,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they are gone to their long, laſting, Everlaſting home; or how you can apply this for the vindication of the Rubrick, is beyond my underſtanding. <hi>It is certain by Gods Word, that Children which are Baptized, dying before they commit actual ſin, are undoubtedly ſaved; that is,</hi> ſay you, in your explanation, <hi>they are put at leaſt in a Salvable condition,</hi> what are they ſtill but <hi>in a Salvable condition after dying</hi>?

In particular I brought down the queſtion to a True be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, whoſe Child had an unqueſtionable right unto Goſpel Baptiſme according to the Terms and conditions of the Goſpel; Whether, if ſuch a believer ſhould bring his Child to the Font, and deſire the Miniſter to have it Baptized, but yet either out of weakneſs or tenderneſs of Conſcience, Scruples God-Fathers and God-Mothers, and the ſign of the Croſs, and dares not admit of them, the Miniſter may and ought upon that ſcore deny his Babe Chriſtendom?

            <p>I Objected againſt the order for the burial of the dead; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe what is there ſpoken to God and man, though often at the interment of the worſt of ſinners, is ſpoken of them as if they had been Saints. and moſt devout Holy perſons, and their Souls then in a ſafe and happy State. For firſt the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation by the mouth of the Miniſter ſpeaks as it were to themſelves one to another, concerning the party deceaſed, <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as it hath pleaſed God of his great mercy to take unto himſelf the Soul of our dear brother.</hi> He is a Brother, a dear Brother, his Soul is now taken by God, taken in mercy, in great mercy, and it is taken to himſelf.

               <hi>That it is in the judgment of Charity we prenounce this of all.</hi> I anſwer, Charity with judgment, is a gracious Excellency, but without judgment, it is the greateſt abſurdity, and nothing elſe but the vain opinion of an over-pittiful ſimplicity. But if Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity be with judgment, then it muſt have ſome Rule of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: and if the right Golden Rule, then this Rule is the Word, for I know no other; Now if Charity hath this Golden Rule of the Word to judge by, then Charity can have no hope for ſome (many) flagitious abominable ſinners, ſo living and ſo dying, when they are brought to be buried; as ſuppoſe two Hectors falling out, and fighting for a Miſs, and both killing one another in the place; or let it be one of them: which happens too too often: ſuppoſe ſome High-way Gentlemen in the very Act of Robbery, ſhot down ſtark dead the ſame mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by the Honeſt Traveller, and thus I might inſtance in many like Caſes. Here, if we will ſpeak ſoberly and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Truth, we can have no hope: nothing being written in the whole Bible, from end to end, to ground the leaſt of any ſuch hope upon. Here to mention, <hi>what happened to the Thief upon the Croſs, and what may be the dealings of God with the moſt profane wretch at the laſt Minute,</hi> as you do; and what may befall the moſt profligate perſons, <hi>inter pontem &amp; fontem,</hi> as ſome others; is a vain execuſe, and cannot afford the leaſt ſhew or ſhadow of a juſt Apology. As for the Thief upon the Croſs, a wonderful Act of mercy was exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to him at the laſt, by an extraordinary priviledge, at an extraordinary occaſion; but withal we know what a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful extraordinary Teſtimony he gave of his Faith, and of the Change of his heart before expiration. The order for the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial of the dead, might have been proper enough at his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terment: but would it alſo have been as proper at the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the other his Copartner in ſin? Had he ſuffered in <hi>England</hi> (ſuppoſing all things then as now) he might have then been buried according to Liturgy. For I ſee none elſe exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but the <hi>unbaptized, Excommunicate, and laying violent hands upon themſelves</hi>; and yet even theſe alſo upon your grounds may equally be admitted to Chriſtian burial; I am ſure the firſt of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:64663:31"/>
them, <hi>the unbaptized,</hi> may upon far better; and as for the worſt of the other, who knows how gracious God may be <hi>in his deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with them in the laſt Minute</hi>? Who knows? None can know: and becauſe none can know, therefore none can hope: for hope without knowledge is a meer Nullity. As for what we know con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning ſuch abominable wicked workers (if we believe the Holy Scripture, which ſaith, <hi>Neither Fornicators, nor Idolaters, nor Adulterers, nor Thieves, nor Covetous, nor Drunkards, nor revilers, nor Extortioners ſhall ever inherit the Kingdome of God</hi>; which ſaith, <hi>without regeneration and holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord,</hi> and every where to the like purpoſe) it ſpeaks their conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on deſperate and damned; and therefore with ſilence, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hope, we muſt leave them wholly to the diſpoſition and determination of God their judge. And this alſo you ſeem to to acknowledge and concede: for in making good thoſe words, <hi>ſince it hath pleaſed God of his great mercy to take unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self</hi>—you ſay, <hi>That it is not neceſſary the Words</hi> in great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy <hi>ſhould refer to the Perſons taken away, for it may be mercy,</hi>

               <hi>and a great mercy, to them who ſuffered by their injury, or ill Examples, ſuppoſing them to be ſuch in whom no ſhew of goodneſs did appear.</hi> I anſwer, I thank you heartily for this new No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which never before came upon the imagination of my thoughts, nor perhaps of any other: ſo that you may ſay in a boaſt as <hi>Zabbarel</hi> (if I hit right upon his name)<hi>Ego primus hoc inveni.</hi> Verily the <hi>Gens Togata,</hi> I mean all of the Clergy, are much your Debtors, and I hope in gratitude will highly extoll the <hi>acumen</hi> of your wit, and the pregnancy of your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention. For a recompence, I think my ſelf bound to tell you a ſtory, which this rare piece of Fancy of yours brought freſh into my remembrance. In thoſe days (when the Book of ſports and paſtimes, as Lawful and expedient to be indulged to youth, and fit to be exerciſed on the Lords day) was commanded to be publiſhed, and accordingly was read in moſt Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; <hi>Deus bone</hi>! What are the beſt of men, the Tribe of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi,</hi> the Sons of the Church themſelves, when they come to be Tryed! Yet there were ſome of them Non-conformiſts to the reſt, who neither could nor would do what was then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, what ever they ſuffered. One of them a moſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Preacher, was deſired by ſome of his Chief Pariſhoners to
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:64663:32"/>
viſit his friends in another County, and to abſent himſelf from them three weeks or a month together: and in the interim they procured an Old certain Saint <hi>John</hi> (a very obſcure per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who neglected his dreſs, but cheriſhed the Hair of his face and beard at a ſtrange rate) to do this good turn for him: who by the like Crotchet of an extraordinary fancy was ready at their ſervice, and made no bones of it. He comes therefore, and appears in the Desk, after the manner of ſome Wild Satyr out of a Wood, and for the better grace of the matter, what he ſpake was with a Twanging Tone out of his Noſe. Well; he ſets upon the performance of the work, and reads over the Book of Sports diſtinctly and audibly: but when he had done, he added as followeth; Beloved Brethren! Here the King gives you liberty to play on Sundays, and to exerciſe youth in vain ſports and paſtimes, which to do is apro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanation of the Sabbath, and a breach of Gods Holy command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: but now, brethren! do you underſtand the Kings mind, and his true intent and meaning herein? Why, I will tell you, my brethren! a Father has a ſtubborn rebellious Child, and he ſees his Temper, and ſpirit from time to time, aukward and croſs to do any thing he is bidden, but rather more reſolved and forward to do the contrary; wherefore the Father, when he would have anything done by this perverſe and froward boy, forbids him the doing of it: but what indeed he would not have done, he charges him to do it. Thus in like manner, my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren! Our good and gracious King has commanded us to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Sabbath in coming to Church, and in a Religious ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and Worſhipping of God, by many good preceeding Laws, and Orders for that end and purpoſe: but ſtill ſuch is our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumacy and wickedneſs, that we drink and play, and have our Dances and Revels on that bleſſed day, in a ſhameful manner: wherefore he ſeeing our perverſe Rebellious carriage, againſt his former good Precepts, he ſpeaks unto us by contraries, He <hi>bids now play on Sundays,</hi> but his true meaning is, that we <hi>ſhould no longer play,</hi> as formerly we have done, but keep God's Sabbath better, and more Religiouſly; this is all our good and gracious King (judging of us according to our wonted croſſeneſs) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in publiſhing this book of liberty, and I hope will follow
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:64663:32"/>
upon the reading of it. Here was a ſtrange unexpected, and unlooked for enucleation of the mind of the King, as now yours is of the words of the Liturgy. When I heard this relation firſt, I was hugely pleaſed with it: and ſaid, it was pity ſome Courtier had not not acquainted the King with it; who certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly would have rewarded this rare interpreter with a Dean's or Prebend's place, for his eminent underſtanding and ſervice here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: I wiſh you the ſame ſucceſs in your parallel Atchievement. But in the interim we muſt conſider, whether thoſe words <hi>in great mercy</hi> can admit of any ſuch avulſion from the words following, which relate unto the dead, to be an Apoſtrophe to them that are living? Let us read them and weigh them, <hi>For as much as it hath pleaſed God of his great mercy, to take to himſelf the Soul of our dear brother here departed,</hi> &amp;c. Therefore the perſon here ſpoken of cannot be (as you would ſuppoſe him) a man of an <hi>ill example, an injurious perſon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 7. <hi>l.</hi> 17.</note> 
               <hi>and in whom no ſhew of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs did ever appear,</hi> for he is a brother, a dear brother, and his Soul now taken to God and accordingly theſe words, in <hi>great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> muſt refer unto himſelf the perſon taken away, and not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to others; unto whom this his being taken away, was rather <hi>in judgment,</hi> and for Correction, by the loſs of ſuch a dear bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Notwithſtanding procure <hi>a Rubrick</hi> to confirm your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, for until then (according <hi>to your own look</hi>) I may not believe it: but when I ſhall ſee that once affixed,<note place="margin">

               <hi>Nor have I ever thought the perſon Officiating, obliged to uſe this form of burials intirely in all Caſes—ſomething I conceive may be left to the diſcretion of the Prieſt, eſpecially with the advice of his Ordinary,</hi> &amp;c. Your meaning plainly is this, that you may leave out ſome part of what is appointed to be read for the burial of the dead, if the perſons buried be not ſubjects proper for it, but utterly the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. As for Example, if the perſon to be buried, has been a notorious flagitious offender from firſt to laſt, then <hi>after your own diſcretion,</hi> eſpecially with the <hi>advice of your Ordinanry,</hi> you may
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:64663:33"/>
leave out the words, <hi>in great mercy,</hi> and <hi>to himſelf dear,</hi> and the like, and read only thus, <hi>For aſmuch as it hath pleaſed God to take the Soul of our brother, we therefore commit his body,</hi> &amp;c. Thus likewiſe in the cloſe, you may omit thoſe words, <hi>as our hope is this our brother doth,</hi> and read it thus, <hi>That when we ſhall depart this life, we may reſt in him, and at the general Reſurrection be found acceptable in his ſight,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I Anſwer, It would be well, if the Miniſter might thus be left to his <hi>own diſcretion,</hi> ſuppoſing all parties agreed, and that there would be no ſcandal in the Caſe; which I look upon as an impoſſibility. For put the Caſe, after you have declared <hi>your unfeigned Aſſent and Conſent to all and every thing contained in the book of Common-prayers,</hi> before the face of God, and the Congregation, one of them ſhould immediately ſtep forth and ſay, Sir do you like and approve of all, and every thing contained in, and preſcribed by the order for the burial of the dead? E're long your Office will call you to bury as curſed, Reprobate wretches as ever breathed; for too too many ſuch are among us. Do you think it lawful and expedient to ſtile e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one of that ſort, <hi>dear brother</hi>? can you then with a good Conſcience ſay, <hi>God in great mercy hath taken his Soul to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf?</hi> Or can you expreſs <hi>your hope</hi> before God, even <hi>ſure and certain hope, of his reſting in Chriſt,</hi> and eternal happineſs? What now will you anſwer to his Queſtions? will you bring in your laſt mentioned plea, and think to help and juſtifie your ſelf by it? Will you replie thus, Friend, I have indeed in your hearing, as in the hearing of the whole Congregation, <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared my unfeigned aſſent and conſent to all, and every thing contained in, and preſcribed by the book of Common-prayer,</hi> and by conſequence, as you juſtly infer, <hi>to all and every thing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the burial of the dead</hi>; but yet you muſt know, I have a mental reſervation according to <hi>my own diſcretion</hi>; and beſides, <hi>my Ordinary,</hi> though I have avouched I will do this and that, <hi>has given me a ſecret Licence, to leave it undone inſuch and ſuch Caſes</hi>; and in this very Caſe in particular about burying the dead; and therefore when I ſhall judge it meet and neceſſary, I will omit ſeveral Expreſſions, when they ſhall not be proper nor applicable to the perſons to be buried, or at leaſt I will
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:64663:33"/>
take the words in a contrary ſenſe, according to what they are uſally taken? ſhould this be your anſwer? but with what forehead could you utter it? How quickly might the ſaid perſon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply upon you, to your ſhame and confuſion, in this or the like manner? Belike, Sir, though you have declared <hi>your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned aſſent and conſent to all, and every thing contained in and preſcribed by the book of Common-prayer,</hi> you have but jugled in all you have declared; you have your private reſervations and exceptions, and your Ordinary has given you a Licence to profeſs one thing, and do another; I ſee your heart and mouth have not gone together, but you ſpeak and think two ſeveral ways. I took you for a good Proteſtant Miniſter, but I perceive you are a meer Jeſuite: an <hi>Ireland,</hi> a <hi>Gavan</hi> can do no more. What way you could deviſe, to free your ſelf from this impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is altogether beyond my thoughts.</p>
            <p>Sir, You well obſerved a certain ſort of Miniſters among your ſelves, <hi>pitied in their Non conformity, as doing, good men,</hi>

               <hi>what they would not do, if they were not forced to it,</hi> and therefore they huddle up <hi>and curtail the prayers,</hi> and ſhew induſtriouſly by the manner of performance how little they like and approve of what they do. This what you ſay, I have heard my ſelf ſpoken in their praiſe, and themſelves much commended for it; but I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways thought them ſo far from being worthy of praiſe, that I have eſteem'd them moſt worthy of cenſure and condemnation; and my heart has riſen againſt them beyond all others. This is wretched ſimulation, and a baſe pitiful diſguiſe. Surely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>I had declared my unfeigned aſſent and conſent to all and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing contained in the Liturgy, before</hi> the whole Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I would be faithful to mine own word, and juſtifie my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion by a conſonant practice: I would not <hi>curtail the prayers,</hi> but have the Courage before all the world to read them diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and reverently, and do all in a moſt ample manner, as the matter did require, ſcorning <hi>aucupare famam,</hi> to get the good opinion of any, by ſhewing my ſelf an Hypocrite. And thus, Sir, it ſhould be with you in your own concern; after <hi>your decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> it behoves you to be True unto it in every Iota and Tittle, frankly, roundly, and entirely coming up to the full perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of it, and of all and every thing required by it, yea even

            <p>I Have yet two Queries to propound to mine Opponents, to each of them their queſtion, and ſo I ſhall take my leave of them for the preſent.</p>
            <p>You therefore, Sir, who appeared firſt againſt me, highly applaud the writings of the Apochrypha, and plead much for the verity of them in themſelves, and the uſefulneſs of them as to the reading of them to the people; for you ſay, <hi>Few Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Writers of any note,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 10. <hi>l.</hi> 16.</note> (I would you had named ſome of thoſe noted men) <hi>but have commended, at leaſt have allowed of the reading of them</hi>; that is, in the publique Aſſembly, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, as well as other Scripture; and you except againſt me for ſtiling them, <hi>Fabulous Legends,</hi> and ſay,<hi>many of the ancient Fathers did believe them to be true ſtories,</hi> (as true as Goſpel) <hi>and though he</hi> (A.B.) <hi>is pleaſed to call them</hi> Fabulous Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gends, <hi>I never yet ſaw any Arguments to prove them Fables, but what would admit of a fair ſolution, and when this Author produces any, I ſhall conſider them.</hi> And you add, <hi>but ſuppoſing them Fables, they are nevertheleſs fit for all that to be read in the Chriſtian Aſſemblies: ſince they may ſerve for instruction, or comfort, or reproof, as the Parables of our Saviour do.</hi> What, Sir, do you think what you ſpeak? What <hi>as the Parables of our Saviour do</hi>? What, ſhall the Fables of Apochrypha bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouched, <hi>to ſerve for inſtruction, comfort and reproof as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables of our Saviour do</hi>? Is this <hi>as</hi> a Conjunction of equality, or onely of aliquality? To my beſt Remembrance it is <hi>Aquinas</hi> his diſtinction, and it is needful here to free you from an hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid blaſphemy: you might well therefore have affixed ſome word of rebate to your word <hi>as,</hi> to have avoided all imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. Yet this is not the queſtion I have to propound: but ſince you declare your mind and judgment, for the truth and goodneſs of the Apochryphal writings, I would enquire of you,</p>
            <p>Q. What ſtrong convincing, and Cogent Motives of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence wrought you into this perſwaſion, and brought you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this mind?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:64663:35"/>The reading of this Paragraph ſet me a wondring; but certain<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly you have <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> ſomthing hidden in your breſt beyond vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar knowledge to juſtifie <hi>Apocrypha</hi>; which I would gladly underſtand for my better information. For I confeſs unto this day, I have entertained a quite different, yea utterly a contrary apprehenſion of them. Among many others theſe are two of my reaſons: firſt, becauſe they contain in them ſeveral Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, not only inconſiſtent with themſelves, but alſo repugnant to the Scriptures of the Old and New Teſtament. Secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they report and witneſs many things as really tranſacted and done, which ſound reaſon and common ſenſe (if they may beheard to ſpeak) will unanſwerably tell you, can be nothing elſe but Monſtrous and incredible fiction, impoſſible in nature, and at as great an Elongation from Faith and Verity, as whatſoever was Hatched in the brains, or mentioned by the pens of <hi>Heſiod, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> or any other of the greateſt and moſt famous of thoſe ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Poets, I remember very well, when I was but a little young School-boy in reading over the books of the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> many of thoſe ſtrange ſtories found as little belief in me; but that of one <hi>Razis,</hi> a Jew I judged to be a notorious untruth, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to be of the ſame mind unto this day. For thus it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of him, 2 <hi>Maccab. Chap.</hi> 14. <hi>v.</hi> 37. <hi>Now there was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed unto</hi> Nicanor <hi>one</hi> Razis <hi>one of the Elders of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>a lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of his Country men and a man of very good report, who for his kindneſs was called, a Father of the</hi> Jews— <hi>ſo</hi> Nicanor <hi>willing to declare the hate he bare unto the</hi> Jews <hi>ſent above five hundred men of war to take him—now when the multitude would have taken the Tower, and violently broken into the utter door, and bid the fire ſhould be brought to burn it, he being ready to be taken on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſde, fell upon his Sword Chuſing rather to die manfully</hi> (that is to be guilty of ſelf Murder) <hi>then to come into the hands of the wicked, to be abuſed otherwiſe then beſeemed his Noble Birth: but miſſing his ſtroak through haſt, the multitude alſo ruſhing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the doors, he ran boldly up to the wall, and caſt himſelf down manfully amongſt the thickeſt of them; but they quickly giving place, and a ſpace being made, he fell down into the midſt of the void place. Nevertheleſs while there was yet breath within him, being inflamed with anger he roſe up, and though his blood gaſhed
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:64663:36"/>
out like ſpouts of water, and his wounds were grievous; yet he ran through the midſt of the throng, and ſtanding upon a ſteep Rock, when as his Blood was now quite gone, he pluckt out his bowels, and taking them in both his hands, he caſt them upon the throng, and calling upon the Lord of Life and Spirit to reſtore him thoſe again, thus he died.</hi> Here is ſuch a Concatenation of prodigies, in this one Narration, that nothing leſs than a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digy of credulity can aſſent to any one particular of them. It is marvellous that the fall of <hi>Razis,</hi> from the Top of the High wall of the Caſtle (eſpecially he caſting himſelf down violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from thence, and falling upon the bare ground or pavement, for they quickly gave place, and did not bear him up) had not immediately done his buſineſs for him upon the ſpot; had not immediately beaten his brains out of his head, his bowels out of his belly, and breath out of his body; at leaſt put him out of all Capacity of riſing and running; and this through a throng of people, and theſe a throng of Souldiers and Armed men, and they alſo Aſſayling him on every ſide; for they were ſent to Seize his perſon, and to bring him Priſoner. Alas our <hi>George,</hi> and <hi>Arthur</hi> are not ſo much, if compared with this great Heroe <hi>Razis,</hi> as a Graſhopper with <hi>Goliah</hi>! The moſt renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of ſuch Knights have loſt their Spurs; <hi>Ecce homines Homun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciones blancati quaſi libia,</hi>

               </note> as he ſaid merrily in another Caſe: which will more notoriouſly appear in the concluſion of this moſt aſtoniſhing Tragical Exploit: for behold though <hi>his blood guſhed out like Spouts of water,</hi> yea when <hi>his blood was now quite gone,</hi> and not one drop of it left in the veins, (which might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall him, either by the violence of the aforeſaid fall, or from the many wounds he had received from the Swords of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, or othewiſe; for we are left at uncertainties.) <hi>Yet even then he called upon the Lord of life</hi>! It is written indeed of our Saviour, that after he had loſt much blood upon the croſs, he cryed out with a loud voice, ſaying, <hi>Eli, Eli, lama-ſabachthani, and yeilded up the Ghoſt.</hi> But this was wholly and altogether above the power of nature, and therefore worthily counted one of his laſt Miracles; becauſe great Effuſion of blood does neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily enervate the parts of the body inſtrumental and requiſite to ſpeech, beyond the poſſibility of framing or uttering any
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:64663:36"/>
articulate voice, or indeed any ſound at all. Which therefore (as ſome have thought) the Centurion hearing and obſerving, being (as well he might be) a Naturaliſt and a Philoſoper, did convince him, that the perſon then ſuffering was not only a juſt and righteous man, but alſo much more then, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, meer man; for he ſaid, <hi>Truly this was the Son of God, Mat.</hi> 27. v. 54. Compared with <hi>Luk.</hi> 23. v. 46. Though it is evident that our Saviour had yet much of his blood remaining within him, when he loudly lowed out (if I may ſo ſpeak with all due reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence) that bitter Lamentation; for afterward it is ſaid, <hi>one of the Souldiers with a ſpear pierced his ſide, and forthwith came there out blood and water,</hi> Joh. 19.34. Wherefore as for our <hi>Razis,</hi> it may be ſaid, if it could be without unpardonable blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, <hi>Behold a greater than Chriſt is here</hi>; for now when his blood <hi>was quite all gone, he called upon the Lord of life and ſpirit:</hi> yet this is no great matter, if conſidered with what is ſtill fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reported of him: For now notwithſtanding all his blood was gone, he had not only Power and vigour to <hi>call upon God,</hi> but alſo <hi>to pluck out his own bowels,</hi> ſurely they hung very looſe, <hi>and take them with both his hands</hi>; it is ſtrange that neither of them was hurt and diſabled by his fall; <hi>and caſt them upon the Throng.</hi> If this be not a Thumper, I never heard one in my life.</p>
            <p>But you will object, and ſay, theſe books of the <hi>Maccabees</hi> are not in the Kalendar, neither are they appointed to be read. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, though they are not in the Kalendar, yet they are in Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chrypha; of which in the whole Lump you are a ſtrenuous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnator, without any Limitation or Exception. Nevertheleſs to give you all fair play imaginable, I will return from the <hi>Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabees</hi> to the Hiſtory of <hi>Tobit</hi> and his Dog, which hath its courſe in the Desk, and that too by order, as well as any part of the Holy Bible it ſelf, <hi>Tobit,</hi> I ſay, <hi>and his Dog:</hi> For though you were pleaſed to flurt at me for mentioning of his dog, and ſay, <hi>I ſuppoſe this Author does not know that the Fifth Chapter of</hi> Tobit <hi>is left out,</hi> (that is, out of the Kalendar) where <hi>Tobit</hi> and his dog are found together; yet how cauſeleſly and weakly you do it, will inſtantly appear; inſomuch that if <hi>Tobit's</hi> dog were
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:64663:37"/>
yet alive he had reaſon enough to reſent the injury with aſnarl, and not only ſo,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 7. <hi>l.</hi> 13.</note> but alſo bite you by the heels, for putting ſuch a ſlight and affront upon him; for why ſhould you ſhut him out of the <hi>Holy place,</hi> as an unclean thing; ſince he is admitted and received as well as his Maſter? Yet ſuppoſe I had not known that the Fifth Chapter was left out, it would have no more challenged my knowledg or underſtanding, then if you ſhould be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> upbraided with ignorance, becauſe you know not to handle your needle, nor how to cut out a gown in right Mode &amp; faſhion, as well as any French Taylour in the Town; for what have you to do with ſuch a knowledg? and ſo what have I to do with the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity and intreague of the Kalendar in this particular? Yea, I believe your ſelf would be put to a ſtand, to give a good and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory account,<note place="margin">

And the rather, becauſe if you obſerve it in this Fifth Chapter, the main plot and foundation of the whole Tragick-comedy is brought in and laid, as it is uſual upon the ſtage, in ſome of the firſt ſcens.

Well, notwithſtanding he profers his ſervice to <hi>Tobit</hi> the Son, v. 6. And is entertained to waite upon him in his Travail; <hi>and ſo they went forth both and the young mans dog with him,</hi> ver. 16. And it is this <hi>Raphael,</hi> this ſervant which teaches his young Maſter thoſe unheard of Rarities, and puts him upon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming thoſe wonderful exploits in the following Acts. <hi>Davus Omnia: Raphael</hi> is all in all, and young <hi>Tobit</hi> is nothing without him. Why therefore this neceſſary ſcene of introduction, ſhould be left out and omitted, and this <hi>buſie Davus</hi> and moſt extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ſervant ſhould abruptly and ſuddenly appear, none under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding from whence or how, is wholly beyond my apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. I would gladly know, whether Mr. <hi>Falkner,</hi> (unto whom you owe much) in any of his great labours, and learned Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citations
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:64663:37"/>
about the Liturgy, has given us the true reaſon of this Chaſme and Hiulcan leap in the Kalendar? Surely there is ſome Myſtery in it: but what, <hi>Raphael</hi> knows for all me. In the interim it may well purple your Cheeks, that you ſhould rather then not twit me with ignorance, betray your own; for though the Fifth Chapter is left out, and conſequently <hi>Tobit,</hi> and his Dog, yet if you had looked forward unto the Eleventh Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (ordered to be read) there you ſhall find <hi>Tobit</hi> and his Dog again: for thus it is recorded, v. 4. <hi>So they went their way, and the Dog went after them.</hi> And for the better convincing you of the truth of what I now ſpeak, be pleaſed, if you count it worth the while, to go to any of our Cathedral-Churches, next third day of <hi>October,</hi> in the forenoon in the year one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Six hundred and eighty, and ſo <hi>quotannis</hi> for the future, and you will be ſatisfied. Saint <hi>Paul's</hi> is not yet reedified, therefore that of <hi>Weſt-minſter</hi> is neareſt; where if you will do your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions in that grave and ſolemn aſſembly, graced with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of a great and generous Biſhop: together with his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bends, Prieſts, and Deacons, beſides a loud Chorus of ſinging men, and ſinging boys alternatly reſponding; you ſhall ſee the reverend reader in due time and place coming out of his ſeat, firſt making his lowlie obeiſance, with his face to the earth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Holy Altar, though without a ſacrifice; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore why he ſo bows, is not a little Myſterious; and then turning about to ſhew the ſame reverence to the preſul of the quire, and going into the Pew, you ſhall hear him pronounce with a loud voice, theſe or the like words, <hi>The holy leſſon appointed, for this morning ſervice is the Eleventh Chapter of the book of</hi> Tobit; and then he proceeds to his work. <hi>After theſe things</hi> Tobias <hi>went his ways praiſing God, that had given him aproſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous journey, and bleſſed</hi> Raguel <hi>and</hi> Edna <hi>his Wife, and went on his way till he drew near to</hi> Ninive. <hi>Then</hi> Rapahel <hi>ſaid to</hi> Tobias; <hi>thou knoweſt brother, how thou didſt leave thy father; let us haſt before thy wife, and prepare the houſe; and take in thine hand the Gaul of the Fiſh. So they went their way, and the Dog went after them.</hi> I wonder there is no Aſterisk or finger in the margent pointing to the place, for it is <hi>Valde Notabile</hi>; and then you could not have ſo eaſily over looked it. Give
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:64663:38"/>
me leave, for I think it innocent and harmleſs, and I am ſure 'tis opportune, to impart unto you a merriment. I once heard a young Lord (now a great and grave Senator) whoſe Tongue is excellently well hung, who to exerciſe his faculty of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, would needs take upon him to preach <hi>Extempore</hi> (as he ſaid but too looſly,) and what ſhould be his Text, but this very verſe, though not exactly repeated to a letter, but in this manner, <hi>So</hi> Tobit <hi>went out, and his dog followed him.</hi> I remember his firſt work was to make inquiry, for he ſaid it was of great importance, What kind of Dog this might be, whether a Spaniel, Gray-hound, Water-dog, or ſome other: for from hence ſaid he, we may very probably find out the temper and genious of his Maſter. If this Dog were a Spaniel, then young <hi>Tobit</hi> in all likelihood was a Gentleman, and one who delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Hawking; but why then do we not read of an Hawk on his fiſt, as well as a dog at his heel? If this dog were a Gray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hound, then young <hi>Tobit</hi> took his pleaſure in Courſing: if this dog were a water-Spaniel, then young <hi>Tobit's</hi> recreation was Ducking. But yet perhaps the dog was none of all theſe, but rather a meer Pedlars-Cur; for it is ſaid, <hi>the dog followed after him,</hi> juſt like ſuch a Cur; for as for the forementioned they are ſeen to be more Aiery, metalſom and ſprightly <hi>than heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to follow after,</hi> but Range up and down the fields far from their Maſters feet, and hunt after prey; and ſuch a dog might well ſute with his Maſters mean condition for the preſent, becauſe his Mother was but a kind of Chair-woman, as old <hi>Tobit</hi> the Father reports of her, Chap. 2. v. 11. <hi>And my Wife</hi> Anna <hi>did take womans work to do,</hi> by which ſhe earned her liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, v. 14. This and much more was his Oratory, which I liſt not further to repeat, and the rather, becauſe what I have ſaid already, is indeed more than ſufficient to convince you of your miſtake about <hi>Tobit</hi> and his dog. But beſides, I have ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral doubts ſtill remaining concerning old <hi>Tobit</hi> the Father, and young <hi>Tobit</hi> the Son; which how they can be ſolved, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by others, as true and real, do utterly mate and non plus my thoughts.</p>
            <p>Concerning old <hi>Tobit</hi> the Father we read thus, Chap. 2.v. 9. <hi>The ſame night I returned from the burial,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

the Wall of my Court-yard, being polluted, and my face was uncovered; and</hi> I <hi>knew not that there were ſparrows in the wall, and mine eyes being open, the ſparrows muted warm dung into mine eyes, and a whiteneſs came into mine eyes</hi>; whereby he became blind. If he ſlept, how came it to paſs that his eyes were open? I have heard this to be the property of an hare (but I ſuppoſe it a vulgar error) and of nothing elſe living upon the earth. But though the good man ſlept with his eyes open, how could two ſparrows joyn by a Conſpiracy againſt him to make him blind? One ſparrow could not work him this miſchief alone by its ſingle muting; what did they ſecretly whiſper, and ſoby conſent, in one and the ſame moment, turn up their tailes, and let fall this into one eye, and that into the other, and put them out together? <hi>Oh hateful unhappy birds!</hi> elſe though ſuch a ſhrewd miſchance had befallen one of his eyes, yet the other might have been preſerved: ſurely he would have been more watchful for the future, after he had underſtood the danger of it.</p>
            <p>Concerning young <hi>Tobit</hi> the Son we read thus, Chap. 6. 1, 2, 3. <hi>And as they went on their journey, they came in the evening to the River</hi> Tigris, <hi>and they lodged there, and when the young man went down to waſh himſelf, a fiſh leaped out of the River, and would have devoured him; then the Angel</hi> (his ſervant <hi>Raphael) ſaid unto him, take the fiſh; and the young man laid hold of the fiſh, and drew it to land.</hi> This was a ſtrangebold fiſh to forſake its own Element to devour a man.<hi>Forté Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potamus,</hi> ſaith <hi>Grotius</hi> upon the place: but it is forty to one that it was not; ſince that kind of water-beaſt (for ſo it may be called rather then a fiſh) is reported to live only in the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Nile,</hi>

Well; drawn this fiſh is upon the bank, and by the appointment of the ſervant (for here the man commands the Maſter) it is gutted, or rather unbowelled, <hi>the heart, liver, and gaul being taken out, and carefully preſerved,</hi> v. 4.

And he ſaid unto him, Touching the heart and the liver, if a Devil, or any evil Spirit trouble any, we muſt make a ſmoak thereof before the man or the woman, and the party ſhall be no more vexed: as for the Gall it is good to anoint a man that hath whiteneſs in his eyes, and he ſhall be healed.</hi> This is repeated again, v. 16. <hi>When thou ſhalt come into the marriage Chamber, thou ſhalt take the Aſhes of perfume, and ſhalt lay upon them ſome of the heart and liver of the fiſh, and ſhalt make a ſmoak with it: and the Devil ſhall ſmel it, and and flee away, and never come again anymore.</hi> The reaſon of this (as you know) was thus; a Match was reſolved upon by the Angel between young <hi>Tobit</hi> and a young Virgin that was lov'd by a devil;<note place="margin">

I dare be bold to ſay, the devil of Maſcon was not, as he ſaid himſelf, more terrified with the <hi>Croſs and Holy water,</hi> then this evil Spirit with the <hi>ſmoak,</hi> ariſing from the heart and liver of that watery monſter. For ſo we read it, Chap. 8. v. 1. <hi>And
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:64663:39"/>
when they had ſupped, they brought</hi> Tobias <hi>in unto her; and as he went, he remembred the words of Raphael, and took the Aſhes of the perfumes, and put the heart and the liver of the fiſh there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, and made a ſmoak therewith; the which ſmel, when the evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit had ſmelled, he fled into the uttermoſt parts of Egypt, and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel bound him.</hi> Surely this ſmoak was a moſt Helliſh fogg, darker than ever any from the bottomleſs pit; and this ſmel a moſt diveliſh ſtrong ſmel to out-ſtink the devil, and put him thus to flight; no <hi>Aſſa Foetida</hi> could be a thouſand part near ſo noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. It is commonly reported, that when the devil appears and frights people, at his departure for a farewell, he leaves an horrible Sulphureous ſtink behind him, ready to poyſon all in the room: but here was a more dreadful damnable breath, ſo that old nick the ſtinker was afraid to be poiſoned himſelf, and forced to hurry away, and remove farther off at a diſtance ſufficient, as will preſently appear. But in the interim I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how the Bride and the Bridegroom could abide by it? Yet poſſibly they had the cunning to ſtop their Noſes, until the ſmoak and ſmel was paſt and vaniſhed; and ſo might the devil, if he had not been a ſtark fool. A ſilly Devil indeed, to be frighted with ſmoak, and to be driven from his Amaſia with a ſmel! could he not (as I have ſaid) have ſtopped his noſe, and kept out the ſtink? Could he not have gone and opened the window for a little while, and relieved himſelf with the freſh and ſweet Air? could he not have ſmelled out before hand what was conſulted againſt him? could he not have provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded himſelf with a counter-charm? could he not have furniſhed himſelf with ſome rare civet, musk, or other ſuch like per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume on the knob of his ſtaff: by whoſe ſweet and odorife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſent, he might eaſily have ſecured himſelf from thoſe bane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and killing Exhalations, and not received the leaſt dammage from them? Had he not been a meer fungus and dolt of a devil, he would have ſet his brains a work, and tryed a thouſand con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions before he would have ſo meekly and patiently parted with his admired adored Miſtreſs; and left her in the boſome, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces of a ſtranger before his eyes. Yet poſſibly there might be an Antipathy, and a particular averſion in his nature againſt this foul fetour and venemous vapour; which therefore no ſooner did ſteam into his noſtrils but preſently put him into a cold ſweat,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:64663:40"/>
and made his face look as pale as a white cloth. Alas poor De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil!

               <hi>he fled to the uttermoſt parts of Egypt.</hi> From whence? <hi>From Ecbatane. Ecbatane</hi> was the place where the great exploit was acted, a City of the <hi>Medes: Media</hi> is a country not far from the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea; between which and <hi>Egypt</hi> lieth all <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> and all the deſarts of <hi>Arabia,</hi> and the Red-Sea, and then the hither moſt parts of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and then over <hi>Nilus,</hi> and then the uttermoſt parts of <hi>Egypt</hi>—thither <hi>Aſmodeus</hi> fled and took Sanctuary in <hi>montanis illis locis quibus Aegyptus a Lybia dirimitur,</hi> in thoſe vaſt range of mountaines, by which <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Lybia</hi> are divided. This was an huge long poſt, above a thouſand Miles, as I gueſs, in a right line; but how many windings and turnings he made, whether he went by the ſtring or the bow, who knows? <hi>Aſmodeus</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly wanted his box of ſnuſh; for had he but ſoundly ſneezed, it would have perfectly cleared his noſe of that peſtilent whiff, without going the hundred part of ſuch a tedious journy. But I would gladly be informed how, and in what manner this evil Spirit fled? whether by any Magical operation he changed himſelf into the ſhape of any Beaſt, Dromedary, Gray-hound or the like? or whether he changed himſelf into the ſhape of any Fowl, Stork, long wing'd Hawk or the like? or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into the ſhape of an Oſtrich, and ſo by the help both of wings and heeles together ran faſter and ſwifter then any race<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horſe, ſtraining out himſelf to the greateſt ſpeed to beat his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low? Or if he continued in his old form without <hi>Metamorphoſie,</hi> whether he went on horſe-back, or in a Chariot, or made uſe of any other vehicle for his more ſuddain paſſage? well; though we know not the manner how, yet the place whether he fled for ſhelter, is plainly told us, <hi>the uttermoſt parts of</hi> Egypt; ſo great was his fright, that he durſt never ſtand ſtill nor look back until he was at that diſtance, and fully recovered that <hi>Aſylum.</hi> And yet his peril is not paſt; for no ſooner ſtood he ſtill, but the <hi>Angel bound him.</hi> Alas poor <hi>Aſmodeus,</hi> this was very ſevere after ſuch ſore Travail! but <hi>Aſmodeus</hi> muſt patiently endure it: for bound he was, not able to move hand or foot, not able to ſtir or turn himſelf this way or another; but perhaps continue in the ſame place and poſture unto this day. But it is now more than
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:64663:40"/>
high time to be ſerious; Has therefore a Spirit fleſh and bones? our Saviour ſaith, <hi>it hath not.</hi> Has a Spirit corporal parts, and bodily members? has a devil the Organs of carnal ſenſe? has he eyes to ſee, as man ſeeth? has he ears to hear, as man heareth? has he fingers to touch, as man toucheth? has he a palat to taſte, as man taſteth? or has he a noſe to ſmel, as man ſmelleth? <hi>Thou ſhalt make a ſmoak with the liver and heart of the fiſh, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil ſhall ſmel it, and flee away,</hi> very true: <hi>his ſmelling and flee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> are both of the ſame certainty; no ſooner did he one, but he did the other alſo. But is the devil capable <hi>of ſmelling?</hi> even as much as the great huge ſtone (in an open ſtreet of the Town, wherein I was born) is capable of hearing: whereof it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſaid, as I well remember, to poor little Children, <hi>That whenſoever it heard the Clock ſtrike twelve it turned thrice round</hi>; and it was puzling enough to them. But is it poſſible for ſmoak or any material fume to affect, and excruciate an immaterial and ſpiritual being or eſſence, or put ſuch an exiſtency under the leaſt conſternation? Oh how does the devil laugh behind the curtain! Oh how is he pleaſed, that ſuch ludicrous repreſentations, and ridiculous ſtories ſhould be given out and credited concerning himſelf! Here is the old heatheniſh Doctrine revived and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued under Goſpel light (which teacheth us better things) of the <hi>Gods or Daimons their burning in love, their burning in filthy lust, with young beautiful Virgins and women</hi>; as <hi>Jupiter</hi> was deeply in love with <hi>Danae</hi> the daughter of <hi>Acriſius, Apollo</hi> with <hi>Daphne</hi> the daughter of <hi>Peneus,</hi> and others in like manner: So here this Dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon or Devil is with <hi>Sarah</hi> the daughter of <hi>Raguel.

What ſignal ſervice do ſuch great Doctors, and Pluraliſts perform unto God and his Church? what uſe do they make of their vaſt incomes and ſalaries? how do they anſwer the truſt repoſed in them? how good and faithful are they in their Steward-ſhip? we ſee them <hi>rem facere</hi> purchaſing eſtates, we ſee them riding up and down with coach and horſes in great pomp and glory.

I would not bring ſuch guilt of the blood of Souls up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mine own Soul, to reap the whole profit now in the hands of all the Church-men of <hi>England</hi> put together. But in the interim, are not they guilty of Sacriledge? I think, if any other, theſe may be arraigned for it with a witneſs, and ſtand charged with it in a moſt notorious manner. Suppoſe a Knight, or Gentleman, has a Parſonage or Living in his gift, of two or three hundred pounds <hi>per annum</hi>; he puts in a Parſon or Miniſter, but yet by ſome clancular pact and condition, reſerves a third of the profits to himſelf; the Clerk preſented is of moſt approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed abilities for the place, and carries himſelf worthily in it. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, if this thing be known, the Patron ſhall be ſharply,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:64663:44"/>
and ſeverely cenſured, as one that hath unpardonably violated the rights of the Church, and <hi>bainous Sacriledge</hi> ſhall be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to him; the poor Miniſter ſhall be outed for Simony, and another will quickly force in upon the Premiſes. But who is the man? perhaps ſome great Doctor, who has ſeveral Church-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions already, but he muſt, and will have another, ſince it falls ſo luckily in his way. Well; he comes, and according to Law takes full and quiet poſſeſſion; but then he being elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where richly accommodated, and pleaſantly ſeated, cannot think of removing, but ſends his Curate to do the work for him; and for his Salary allows him not half ſo much, as the true Patron did the former Incumbent: he has found out a Ten pound <hi>Levite,</hi> and that ſhall ſuffice, all the reſt muſt come to his own purſe, to keep up his port, and for other certain uſes beſt known to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; nevertheleſs here is nothing of Sacriledge in the caſe; who dares to think, or ſpeak ſuch a word? No, here is nothing but what is right and praiſe-worthy in the whole procedure. Fye upon it! How does covetouſneſs blind our eyes? How does evil cuſtom impoſe upon our reaſon and judgment? is it odious and deteſtable Sacriledge in one perſon, and not in another? can meerly <hi>taking holy Orders,</hi> take away the name and thing of what we call <hi>Sacriledge</hi>? can the <hi>putting on a canonical habit,</hi> put off all guilt and demerit in that kind? then let the aforeſaid Knight, or Gentleman, be made a Clergy-man, and immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he is <hi>rectus in Curia,</hi> and no longer Sacrilegious. Be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, God is not mocked. To conclude, the Curate, or perſon ſubſtituted, who ever he be, that actually performs the office, and does the duty of the Miniſter, either he is worthy or elſe he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of the place. If he be unworthy, then much more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy you to thruſt ſuch an unable and unmeet man upon the people, to their apparent ruin and deſtruction. He ſaid haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily like himſelf, <hi>Viderit utilitas,</hi> hang gain, I will look to mine honour: and you ſay in your actions, not only ſordidly but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piouſly. <hi>Viderint animae,</hi> let Souls be damn'd if they will; I muſt and will look to my gain, and to have a good income. But if he be worthy, then the dues and profits ariſing from the ſaid place, both by the Law of God, and of the Land (if pure juſtice and right might not be wreſted from its direct and firſt
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:64663:44"/>
intention) do, <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> belong unto the ſaid Miniſter or Curate, as in the reward of his ſervice; and I think it both oppreſſion and ſacriledge, by any plea or pretext (though of being legally the Rector or Parſon of the pariſh) to detain them from him. Thus much in requital, for your charge of <hi>Sacriledge, and my ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down a Steeple, when time was,</hi> with the Spire upward or downward, whether you pleaſe. Farewell.</p>
