            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </list>
            <p>Theſe <hi>Queries</hi> are propoſed in meekneſs and fear for you, or any of you to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
for the heat of Perſecution is violent upon the Innocent; and it is but a
reaſonable thing to demonſtrate your minds for the Nations ſatisfaction, and in
plainneſs make it known wherefore ſuch things come to paſs; and if you can
make it appear that it is for any cauſe of evil that we are ſo afflicted, then you
will manifeſt ſomething to ſatisfaction; for it's believed you have very much
provoked the preſent Authority unto it, and alſo promote the Execution of it;
And though the Magiſtrates in doing of it give you eaſe, and ſo you keep your
ſelves more cloſe from appearing in action, yet it is believed that you follow it
with your ſtrength, and that by your ſtrength the Magiſtrates hand is both lifted
up and pulled down: and if it be not ſo, then clear your ſelves from it, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to reſtrain the Evil of it, that the backs of the Righteous may be
ſmitten no more, and all that have their hands in that work may ſay, <hi>It is enough,</hi>
leſt Judgment fall mercileſs becauſe no mercy is ſhewed: for is it a light thing
to drive Innocent People from their Peaceable Meetings with Armed men, and
to thruſt them into Holes and Priſons, for no other cauſe but the exerciſe of their
Conſciences towards God, and then to ſend them away, and baniſh them into
Remote Countries, and ſo tare and rend the Bowels of the Nation, and lay
Families waſte that are a good ſervice in their places? O preach the doctrine
of Love and Peace amongſt them, and let Pitty and Mercy overſway Cruelty,
that God may divert his Vengeance which unto Cruelty belongeth, from which
none can eſcape that perſiſt in perſecuting the Innocent: Therefore you Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
and Miniſters conſider your places, and do not preach and promote that
which will draw down God's Vengeance, but preach and promote the Goſpel
of Peace and Salvation, that the noiſe of Cruelty and Perſecution may ceaſe
and no more be heard in the Land.</p>
            <p>And all you Magiſtrates and People hear what your Biſhops and Miniſters will
anſwer, for this matter is not to be carried on with Clubs and Staves, theſe
were the weapons of <hi>Judas</hi>'s Band; that's but a bad Religion that muſt be ſo
upheld: therefore ſtay your hands, and let thoſe that are accounted Spiritual,
ſtand forth in the Spirit of Meekneſs; and if in that Spirit they will appear,
we are ready in the ſame Spirit to make our defence, but we cannot uſe Clubs
and Staves in it, <hi>for our weapons are not carnal,</hi> and our Conſciences are tender
towards God; therefore be you ſtill and quiet, and let them have time to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
and give their Anſwer; which if they do not, you may well forbear ſtanding
in their defence, and alſo ſtay your hands from afflicting or perſecuting us any
further; for we have a good Cauſe, and our patience and peace is in it; and in
the midſt of our Afflictions that is our Joy and Crown of Rejoycing. Glory
be unto the Lord God for ever.</p>
