            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have received the third part of <hi>No Protestant Plot</hi>
which you were pleased to send me out of <hi>England:</hi>
And I cou'd have wished the two preceding parts
had accompanied it which I don't find are to be
met with in this Kingdom; But I am apt to believe
you did forbear the sending of them, because they might not
possibly contain such things as the other does is Relation to
<hi>Ireland,</hi> and concerning which you onely desire to be satisfied
in. And therefore I am as heartily thankful for this, as I have
been honestly careful to inform my self by the most Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
papers and the most knowing persons in Affairs here,
with what truth the Particulars of it touching this Kingdom
are related in it; For I will not pretend to meddle with its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
as to other places, both because they are no part of
your commands to me, and in regard I have not the same
opportunities of coming to the knowledg of them: But this I
may adventure to say, that if the Author did use no greater
sincerity in his delivery of passages as to the one, than he has
shewn as to the other, he is absolutely one of the most Mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
and Barefaced <hi>LIBELLERS</hi> that (even in this
time of Excess of such Creatures) has been produced: For not
to detain you too long with Prefacing, but as briefly as may
be to come to the matter, neither therein to follow this <hi>LI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BELLER</hi>
with a direct or formal Answer, for fear of
falling into the Error against which <hi>Solomon</hi> thus Cautions,
<hi>Answer not a fool in his own kind least thou also be like unto him.</hi>
But only to make some few Animadversions upon his <hi>LIBEL,</hi>
for the detection of his Mallice, and the conviction of his Fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods
in those parts of it which touch this Kingdom and the
Government of it, according as you expect, and I have premised;
I find, that althÃ´ at his first entrance upon <hi>Irish Affairs</hi> in <hi>page</hi>
the <hi>2d.</hi> of his <hi>LIBEL,</hi> he appears as an <hi>Abhorter</hi> of the
Bloody and Cruel Massacres committed by the <hi>Papists</hi> in the
late Rebellion of <hi>Ireland,</hi> yet he onely assumes that shape in
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:40595:3"/>
this Conjucture of <hi>Time,</hi> the better to <hi>Insinuate</hi> himself with,
and the more plausibly to <hi>Convey</hi> unto the too <hi>Credulous Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulace,</hi>
his designed <hi>Calumnies</hi> upon persons <hi>Concerned</hi> in the
present <hi>Government</hi> of this Kingdom; who are all firm <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,</hi>
and most of whom by their <hi>Zealous</hi> oppositions of the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
Party</hi> during the time of that <hi>Rebellion,</hi> as every of them
by their steady <hi>Administrations</hi> since, have manifested the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
<hi>Abhorrency</hi> in the World of those <hi>Cruelties;</hi> Although they
are opposite to the present <hi>FACTIOVS</hi> and <hi>Pretended Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Party;</hi> Which therefore thus <hi>hires</hi> and <hi>employs</hi> base and
<hi>Mercenary</hi> fellows to invent and publish scandals of them.</p>
            <p>And notwithstanding he wou'd in page the 16. where he
makes his next step as to <hi>Ireland,</hi> seem only to inveigh against
the ingratitude of the <hi>PAPISTS</hi> for the <hi>lenities</hi> they might
have received, yet in his handling thereof, he scatters malicious
invectives against the <hi>Ministers</hi> here, and unjustly glances
upon them, by making instances of <hi>lenity</hi> to have been exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to the <hi>PAPISTS,</hi> and of <hi>severity</hi> to have been measured
to the <hi>DISSENTERS</hi> since the Kings restauration, most where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
are perfectly invented, and not any of them can this <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
reasonably be charged with. Of the former sort are these
his following allegations musterd up in page the <hi>17th</hi> viz.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>that</hi> PRIESTS <hi>and</hi> FRIERS <hi>are tollerated to swarm
and openly to Celebrate</hi> Mass <hi>in</hi> Ireland. The contrary where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
is universally known in the Kingdom; Repeated Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
having been <hi>Issued</hi> from the Lord <hi>Lieutenant</hi> and <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi>
for the Banishing of <hi>FRIERS,</hi> and all others of the <hi>Popish
Regular</hi> and <hi>Titular Clergy</hi> out of this <hi>Dominion,</hi> and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<hi>Rewards</hi> which have been <hi>punctually</hi> performed to such as
shou'd <hi>find</hi> and <hi>seize</hi> them, which for a great while has render'd
that sort of People not to be <hi>visible</hi> in these parts, and for the
<hi>PRIESTS</hi> (who were permitted to stay in all times, in so much,
that not any of the <hi>ORDERS</hi> which came out of <hi>England,</hi> nor
even an <hi>ADDRESS</hi> which was lately made by the House of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi>
there to the King, &amp; by his Majesty sent hither for <hi>banishing</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:40595:3"/>
the rest of the <hi>Popish Clergy,</hi> did mention them) AlthÃ´ they are
suffer'd to remain, yet are they so strictly inhibited by <hi>Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations,</hi>
and those of them caught <hi>Offending</hi> so severely <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished,</hi>
that for a <hi>Considerable</hi> time here has not been any such
open <hi>Celebration</hi> of the <hi>MASS</hi> heard of amongst us, as the
<hi>LIBELLER</hi> hath falsly suggested,</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>that the Introduction of the whole</hi> Popish Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy
<hi>into this Kingdom was Connived at, and a publick Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
of the</hi> PAPAL Clergy <hi>allowed by a Commission of the Duke
of</hi> ORMONDE <hi>to be held and to sit in</hi> 1666. The scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
untruth of both which, do upon inquiry appear very evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently,
for as to that pretended <hi>Commission</hi> for <hi>Assembling</hi> of
the <hi>Papal Clergy,</hi> which I begin with, because from what I shall
say by way of <hi>answer</hi> to it, will naturally flow a confutation of
that feigned <hi>connivance</hi> of the <hi>Popish Hierarchy:</hi> it is to be <hi>obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi>
that as my Lord Duke of <hi>Ormonde,</hi> whose word will surely
outweigh that of the <hi>LIBELLERS,</hi> do's utterly deny his ever
having granted a <hi>Commission</hi> of that kind, so is there no such
thing to be found, nor the least footstep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap> of it to be met with in
any of the <hi>Offices,</hi> through which all <hi>Commissions</hi> must pass be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they can be of any vertue, and where they are <hi>Recorded</hi> for
every one to have recourse unto; Besides, the <hi>Ground</hi> upon
which it is manifest the <hi>LIBELLER</hi> wou'd raise this <hi>stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,</hi>
and the <hi>sourse</hi> from <hi>whence</hi> it is plain <hi>he</hi> wou'd derive
this Objection, when explained, and considered, cannot bear or
<hi>Warrant</hi> any such thing, for they stand thus, <hi>Peter Walsh</hi> (who
was a stiff opposer both of the <hi>Popes Nuntio,</hi> and of the whose <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious</hi>
party in <hi>Ireland</hi> during all the time of the <hi>Irish Rebellion</hi>)
sometime after the Kings <hi>Restauration</hi> having projected and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to his <hi>Majesty,</hi> a <hi>Remonstrance</hi> signed by him and divers
other <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> of this Kingdom, and containing the
highest expressions of Loyalty to his Majesty, and the largest
assurances of Fidelity to the <hi>Crown,</hi> that had ever before
been tender'd by <hi>Papists,</hi> and which proved so <hi>derogatory</hi> to
the <hi>Vsurpations</hi> of the <hi>Pope,</hi> that it was <hi>discountenanced</hi> and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40595:4"/>
Censur'd at <hi>Rome, Lovain,</hi> and other <hi>Popish Vniversities,</hi> and
oppos'd by the <hi>Popes Internuncio</hi> then residing at <hi>Bruxels,</hi> who
did all that in him lay to dehort <hi>PAPISTS</hi> against it, and upon
the account of all which, the subscribers and adherers to it have
not dar'd unto this day to adventure their persons into any
forreign parts where the <hi>Pope</hi> bears sway. His Majesty was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well satisfied with it, and upon <hi>Walsh</hi>'s repairing into this
Kingdom about the year 1666. for propagating such the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of it (which no Loyal Protestant cou'd be against) was
pleased to send his instructions to my Lord Duke of <hi>Ormonde</hi>
His then Lord Lieutenant, for his suffering of <hi>Peter Walsh</hi> to
meet with some <hi>Titular Bishops,</hi> at that time here, to perswade
them by his Arguments, and to gain others of the <hi>Papists</hi> by
their Examples, to subscribe unto that <hi>Remonstrance;</hi> which
meeting His <hi>Grace</hi> accordingly Permitted, but onely, and so
strictly to that end proposed, as He was both vigilant in seeing
that those <hi>Bishops</hi> did not make use of it to any other purpose,
and careful in providing that they shou'd not take up too
much time, even in the doing of that business, and therefore
very early perceiving that they cou'd not come to such an
Agreement as might produce the effects which were expected,
He Ordered them not only to <hi>disperse,</hi> but to quit the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
insomuch that afterwards when <hi>His Grace</hi> was call'd
from the Government, there were not above three <hi>Popish Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi>
remaining, <hi>two</hi> whereof were <hi>Bedrid</hi> and the <hi>third</hi> ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sconded;
althÃ´ when His Grace returned again to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(in immediate Succession to my Lord of <hi>Essex</hi>) he found
no less then <hi>thirteen</hi> of <hi>them</hi> to be <hi>here,</hi> and <hi>them</hi> he has caus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be driven <hi>out</hi> also, and this sufficiently <hi>confutes</hi> the
<hi>LIBELLERS allegation,</hi> of His Graces conniving at the
<hi>Popish Hierarchy</hi> being introduced, which in <hi>English</hi> is <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,</hi>
since He did thus expel the <hi>Governors</hi> in whom it resided.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>That when the</hi> PLOT <hi>was to have been executed
in</hi> ENGLAND <hi>anno 1678. there were no fewer than fifteen She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs
in</hi> IRELAND, <hi>who were either professed and avowed</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:40595:4"/>

<hi>Libell</hi> because it is of the same <hi>nature,</hi> and of the like <hi>truth</hi>
with them: For my Lord <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>ORMONDE</hi> was so far
from granting a <hi>Warrant</hi> to <hi>that Earl</hi> to hinder his <hi>house</hi>
from being <hi>searched</hi> for <hi>Arms,</hi> that he never so much as gave
him a <hi>Licence</hi> to keep any, but contrarywise where the <hi>Earl</hi> of
<hi>ESSEX</hi> in his <hi>Government</hi> had given the said <hi>Earl</hi> his <hi>Licence</hi>
to keep a <hi>quantity</hi> of <hi>Armes,</hi> they were since by my Lord <hi>Duke
of ORMOND</hi>'s Orders taken from him, and delivered into
the <hi>publick stores.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly he alleadges, <hi>That yet while all this forbearance
and tenderness have been expressed to the</hi> PAPISTS, <hi>the</hi>
DISSENTERS <hi>have fallen under the misfortune of having an
express Law made against them, and divers of them have been
prosecuted to Fine and Imprisonment upon it.</hi> Wherein the
<hi>LIBELLER</hi> shews his <hi>Ignorance</hi> as well as his <hi>Malice,</hi> for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>2d. Eliz.</hi> for the <hi>Vniformity</hi> of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer</hi>
in this <hi>Kingdom</hi> (which is without doubt against
the <hi>PAPISTS,</hi> and who are frequently prosecuted upon it)
should by construction be extended unto the DISSENTERS,
(as I never <hi>heard</hi> it to be so <hi>Adjudged</hi> in the Case of
any of them, so far are they from having been <hi>Prosecuted</hi>
notwithstanding their openly <hi>numerous</hi> and <hi>frequent Meetings</hi>)
yet was there never any <hi>Particular express Law</hi> made against
<hi>them</hi> either before, or as the <hi>LIBELLER</hi> wou'd have it
believed, since the <hi>KINGS Restauration,</hi> And as that too
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40595:5"/>
moderate <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>2d. Elizab.</hi> be all that is in <hi>Force</hi> against
the <hi>PAPISTS</hi> or that can be supposed to be against the <hi>DIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SENTERS,</hi>
so it is to be wished that for the quiet of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<hi>more</hi> and <hi>severer Laws</hi> were made against <hi>both.</hi> And this
brings me to the <hi>latter part</hi> of my <hi>Assertion,</hi> that as most of the
<hi>LIBELLERS</hi> instances of the <hi>Lenity</hi> shewn the <hi>PAPISTS</hi>
and of the <hi>severity</hi> extended to the <hi>DISSENTERS</hi> in this
<hi>Kingdom,</hi> since the <hi>KINGS</hi> restauration are <hi>invented,</hi> which I
hope I have fully proved to you, so that <hi>none of them</hi> can be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably
charged upon the present <hi>Government,</hi> which I think, I
shall be able very easily and briefly to shew you, For all the <hi>LI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BELLER</hi>
observes with <hi>semblance</hi> of <hi>truth</hi> and which looks
like an <hi>Objection</hi> in that <hi>point</hi> as to this <hi>GOVERNMENT</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
which he <hi>levells it,</hi> is, <hi>that there hath not any Laws been
made against the</hi> PAPISTS <hi>in</hi> Ireland <hi>since the Kings return,
save one against there living in Wall'd Towns,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if the method of enacting <hi>Laws</hi> in <hi>Ireland</hi> be thought
upon, how that by <hi>Poynings Act</hi> the Chief Governour cannot
call a <hi>Parliament,</hi> for the making of Laws in that <hi>Kingdom,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he prayes the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Councils</hi> leave for it, and transmits
some <hi>Bills</hi> for their <hi>Approbation</hi> to be <hi>passed</hi> in it, and untill he
receives those <hi>Bills</hi> back again with <hi>Licence</hi> for the calling of
a <hi>Parliament,</hi> and if it be Consider'd that my <hi>LORD LIEVTE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NANT</hi>
the Duke of <hi>ORMOND</hi> since his being here, hath <hi>RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PEATEDLY
prayed</hi> such <hi>Licence,</hi> and <hi>Transmitted Bills,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
some <hi>were</hi> as effectuall against the <hi>PAPISTS</hi> (although
there <hi>were none</hi> among them against other <hi>DISSENTERS</hi>)
as cou'd be <hi>devised,</hi> and that he and the <hi>Kingdom</hi> were disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
therein, by the oppositions of <hi>some Persons</hi> who are
mightily extoll'd by the <hi>LIBELLER,</hi> that objection of there
being <hi>no more Laws</hi> against the <hi>PAPISTS</hi> cannot in the least
affect this Government, especially in the person of the <hi>Duke</hi>
of <hi>ORMOND,</hi> neither can <hi>his Grace</hi> be thought to be concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the letter of <hi>suspension</hi> of, or <hi>dispensation</hi> with the <hi>Law</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>PAPISTS</hi> living in <hi>wall'd Towns,</hi> which the <hi>LIBELLER</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:40595:6"/>
mentions; that being procured and executed when the Lord
<hi>BERKLY</hi> was <hi>Governour,</hi> no more than <hi>he</hi> is to be <hi>responsible</hi>
if the <hi>Orders</hi> for the taking off that <hi>suspension</hi> which the

            <p>After the <hi>LIBELLER</hi> has thus, as in a false <hi>Artificial

<hi>them; he</hi> proceeds to <hi>page</hi> the <hi>40th,</hi> and from having

indulgences</hi> to the <hi>PAPISTS</hi> incourage <hi>them</hi> in the old

them with being <hi>ABETTORS</hi> with them in the new fang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>PROTEST ANT PLOT;</hi> But the <hi>persons</hi> he names for sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of this <hi>Charge</hi> are some of them, so <hi>ridiculously</hi> Idle, and
others of them so <hi>notoriously</hi> wicked, and the instances he
brings for proof of it, are all of them so <hi>manifestly false,</hi> that
if the <hi>LIBELLER</hi> were not possest with a singular <hi>spirit</hi> of
<hi>folly</hi> as well as of <hi>lying,</hi> he wou'd never have mention'd <hi>them,</hi>
for as to <hi>SMITH</hi> who I find to be the first of the persons
named, he is such an <hi>abject wretch,</hi> and so great a <hi>malefactor,</hi>
and even in the <hi>Goal,</hi> where he has most <hi>deservedly</hi> layn for
a great while, and still lies, do's daily appear so <hi>vicious</hi> a <hi>thing,</hi>
that he had been only fit for the <hi>Laws</hi> to take notice of, were
it not for the <hi>nature</hi> of the <hi>Information</hi> he gave in, which
<hi>Authority</hi> wou'd not pass over without examining, for be it
known unto the <hi>LIBELLER</hi> and to all <hi>such</hi> whose turn
<hi>he</hi> wou'd serve, and under <hi>whose</hi> pay he writes, that those in
<hi>GOVERNMENT here,</hi> are as <hi>apprehensive</hi> of <hi>Dangers</hi> as they
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40595:6"/>
can be; Though not as inventive of <hi>them</hi> as <hi>they,</hi> for this only
reason, are, because not in <hi>GOVERNMENT</hi> there; Therefore
of the great <hi>sholes</hi> of <hi>Informations</hi> brought in here, since the
first <hi>discovery</hi> of the <hi>Plot,</hi> and which tended to the <hi>proof</hi> of it,
not <hi>one</hi> was ever <hi>rejected,</hi> althÃ´ coming from the <hi>vilest</hi> of <hi>Men.</hi>
And therefore when that of <hi>SMITH</hi> against the Priest <hi>St.
LAWRANCE proffer'd</hi> it self at <hi>DUBLIN,</hi> it was immediately
<hi>received</hi> and <hi>solemnly proceeded upon,</hi> the Lord <hi>PRIMATE</hi>
who was then the <hi>first</hi> of the <hi>Council</hi> on the place, by the <hi>Lord
LIEUTENANTS</hi> happening at that time to be in the <hi>Country,</hi>
having conven'd such <hi>COUNSELLORS</hi> as were in the <hi>Town,</hi>
and with <hi>them</hi> having given all <hi>necessary Orders</hi> in that <hi>affair,</hi>
which produced the <hi>immediate apprehension</hi> of St, <hi>Lawrence,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the <hi>seisure</hi> of his <hi>papers,</hi> and the <hi>Commitment</hi> of his <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
and <hi>SMITH</hi> had all the <hi>Encouragement</hi> fit to be given <hi>him</hi>
in this <hi>his Discovery,</hi> insomuch that if any persons, were found,
reflecting upon his <hi>Evidence,</hi> they were <hi>reprimanded</hi> by the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistracy</hi>
for it, But this did not answer <hi>his</hi> end, in what <hi>he</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
and expected by making such <hi>discovery,</hi> being no less than
that <hi>he</hi> shou'd forthwith be <hi>permitted to go</hi> out of <hi>prison</hi> upon

much,</hi> wou'd not be so passed upon by <hi>them</hi> and yet at the
same time were pleased so far to take notice of <hi>those papers,</hi> as
to send them <hi>over hither</hi> with Orders to proceed upon them
<hi>according to Law here,</hi> where the <hi>matter</hi> of them were proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Conizable,</hi> and where <hi>preparations</hi> were made for <hi>St Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi>
his being strictly prosecuted upon <hi>them,</hi> The <hi>KINGS
Counsel</hi> having <hi>by order</hi> and with <hi>great circumspection</hi> formed a
firm <hi>Indictment</hi> for <hi>misdemeanor</hi> (which was all that in <hi>their
Opinions</hi> the <hi>matter</hi> could bear) to be preferred against <hi>him,</hi>
and the <hi>Iudges</hi> having carefully <hi>provided</hi> that no <hi>PAPIST</hi> nor
any <hi>suspected</hi> to be <hi>POPISHLY affected</hi> shou'd pass upon the
Tryal of <hi>him,</hi> which came on the last <hi>Michaelmas Term</hi> in the
<hi>Kings bench,</hi> Where a <hi>Iury</hi> all consisting of the <hi>strictest prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants</hi>
and <hi>ablest Cittizens</hi> of the City of <hi>Dublin</hi> did appear,
where <hi>SMITH</hi> had the greatest <hi>liberty</hi> and <hi>latitude</hi> afforded
to <hi>him,</hi> and which <hi>he</hi> made use of in the <hi>proffering</hi> and <hi>manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
of his <hi>evidence,</hi> that any <hi>Court</hi> did <hi>ever give</hi> or <hi>Witness
take,</hi> and where St. <hi>LAWRENCE</hi> (whose <hi>person I know</hi> not,
and whose <hi>professien I abominate,</hi> and therefore, you may be
sure I speak impartially what was observed universally) had
nothing beyond <hi>meer Iustice</hi> extended to <hi>him,</hi> and as a part
thereof was that of <hi>Allowance</hi> of <hi>Counsel</hi> to plead for him,
(which the <hi>LIBELLER</hi> with more <hi>Malice than Law</hi> makes
his Observation upon) to be rekon'd, since he standing
<hi>indicted</hi> for <hi>misdemeanor</hi> only, no <hi>Iudicature</hi> cou'd have refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:40595:7"/>
it to him <hi>Iustly,</hi> so as all things seemed to <hi>concur,</hi> if not to
have been <hi>calculated</hi> for St. <hi>LAWRENCES Condemnation,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<hi>SMITH</hi> himself, who by <hi>variety</hi> of <hi>villanies</hi> proved up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>him</hi> in other Cases, which <hi>he</hi> cou'd not deny, and by <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>
and <hi>palpable incoherences</hi> and <hi>contradictions</hi> that fell from
<hi>him</hi> in this <hi>Case,</hi> which were not to be <hi>reconcil'd,</hi> did wholy
<hi>prevent</hi> it, for they were the reasons that particularly <hi>swayed</hi>
with the <hi>Jury</hi> to acquit St. <hi>LAWRENCE</hi> by their <hi>verdicts,</hi>
and generally made <hi>all others</hi> who <hi>heard</hi> them, to do the like
in their <hi>Judgments,</hi> and these were the <hi>motives,</hi> which made
the <hi>Gentlemen</hi> of the <hi>long Robe</hi> (as they have declared) to <hi>forbear,</hi>
because <hi>they</hi> were <hi>ashamed</hi> to appear on the behalf of such
a <hi>blur'd</hi> and <hi>stellionated Creature,</hi> and none of those <hi>wild instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
which the <hi>LIBELLER</hi> invents and mentions only to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>base</hi>
them, and to <hi>reflect</hi> upon <hi>Authority,</hi> and which it is to be
observed <hi>he</hi> at once <hi>insinuates</hi> to be believed by others, and yet
expresly says, <hi>he will not so much as conjecture them himself:</hi>
so as <hi>he</hi> needed not in the <hi>Conclusion</hi> of this his <hi>fable</hi> of <hi>SMITH,</hi>
have any more told us that he was no <hi>diviner,</hi> than I need tell
you after all this that he is an <hi>idle Dreamer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next man our <hi>LIBELLER</hi> produces is <hi>JAMES MOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEY,</hi>
whom <hi>he</hi> Stiles <hi>Captain MORLEY,</hi> though I know not for
what reason, unless it be because of <hi>his</hi> appearing at the <hi>head</hi>
of the band of <hi>IRISH WITNESSES,</hi> which somtime since
<hi>Marched</hi> to <hi>LONDON,</hi> and of his <hi>drawing them</hi> up with what
he would <hi>have them swear unto</hi> for <hi>him,</hi> but however <hi>true</hi> he
may be in giving of that <hi>Title</hi> to <hi>him,</hi> I am <hi>sure</hi> he is <hi>most false</hi>
in those things <hi>he</hi> relates <hi>of</hi> and possibly <hi>from him,</hi> and because
the <hi>LIBELLER</hi> will not be long before <hi>he</hi> makes my words
<hi>good</hi> (though neither I nor all the World will ever be able to
make his so) he no sooner <hi>mentions</hi> the name of <hi>MORLEY,</hi>
but as if it were a <hi>spell</hi> to raise a <hi>lye</hi> with, he falls plum into
the telling of <hi>one</hi> concerning <hi>him,</hi> by introducing and expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of <hi>him</hi> to have <hi>appeared</hi> and <hi>Sworn</hi> before the <hi>Committee</hi>
of <hi>LORDS</hi> and <hi>COMMONS</hi> in <hi>England, two Consults which the</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:40595:8"/>
Papists <hi>had in</hi> Ireland <hi>in reference to the extirpating the</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Religion <hi>in that</hi> Kingdom; whereas it appears by
<hi>MORLEYS Examination</hi> taken either before a <hi>Committee</hi> of the
<hi>LORDS,</hi> or of the <hi>COMMONS,</hi> or <hi>both,</hi> that <hi>he</hi> did not <hi>swear</hi>
to those <hi>Consults,</hi> but only to a <hi>hearsay</hi> touching <hi>them;</hi> which
<hi>he</hi> said he had from <hi>HUBBERT TIRRELL</hi> &amp; <hi>Henry</hi> Ã´ <hi>Neal,</hi>
who it is to be observed, were <hi>two Beggars,</hi> &amp; such <hi>miscreants,</hi>
that an <hi>honest</hi> and a <hi>discerning PROTESTANT</hi> who knew <hi>them</hi>
as well as <hi>MORLEY</hi> did, wou'd hardly have <hi>adventur'd</hi> to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peate</hi>
any <hi>thing</hi> after <hi>them,</hi> much less to <hi>conduct</hi> what they
shou'd <hi>say,</hi> unto <hi>publick assemblies,</hi> &amp; in prejudice <hi>of any</hi> who was
a <hi>PROTESTANT</hi> also, especially Considering that as it is well
know <hi>MORLEY</hi> had such experience of their <hi>villanies,</hi> as
before that time, <hi>he</hi> did <hi>reject</hi> their <hi>proferr'd Oaths</hi> to <hi>him</hi> in
some <hi>Trial</hi> which <hi>he</hi> had in this <hi>Kingdom,</hi> however afterwards
<hi>he</hi> became so <hi>reconcil'd</hi> to <hi>them,</hi> as in the last <hi>PARLIAMENT</hi>
at <hi>Westminster</hi> to make <hi>use</hi> of <hi>their names</hi> for injuriously
<hi>accusing</hi> of Sir. <hi>IOHN DAVIS,</hi> a person <hi>who</hi> with all <hi>his Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
have ever been <hi>eminent professors</hi> of the <hi>PROTESTANT
Religion,</hi> and for that <hi>reason</hi> known to be <hi>obnoxious</hi> to the
<hi>POPISH</hi> Party, and it is besides to be <hi>remarked</hi> that <hi>Tirrell</hi>
has <hi>lately</hi> and <hi>solemnly disavowed his ever having known of any
such Consults,</hi> and <hi>declared</hi> that what <hi>he</hi> had <hi>informed</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<hi>them</hi> was a <hi>meer fiction,</hi> which as <hi>TYRRELL</hi> alledges
<hi>MORLEY prompted</hi> and <hi>hired him</hi> to make, and to <hi>get others
to swear unto for carrying on some designs of his own,</hi> and
what is yet more <hi>remarkable</hi> Ã´ <hi>NEAL</hi> (who was lately
<hi>hang'd</hi> for a <hi>Robbery</hi> in this <hi>KINGDOM</hi>) did just before he
was thrown off the Ladder, <hi>Confess himself</hi> to be <hi>perjured,</hi>
both in what he <hi>deliver'd</hi> as to those <hi>CONSVLTS,</hi> and in
what he had <hi>sworn</hi> against Sir. <hi>JOHN DAVIS,</hi> and that
<hi>he</hi> was by <hi>MORLEYS desire led</hi> into the <hi>latter perjury,</hi>
which <hi>Confession</hi> coming from <hi>one</hi> in the instant <hi>he</hi> was
going to the <hi>dead,</hi> must be <hi>convincing</hi> with all but
<hi>such</hi> who will not be <hi>perswaded thÃ´ one rose from the dead;</hi>
After the <hi>LIBELLER</hi> has thus begun and dispach'd
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:40595:8"/>
this <hi>untruth</hi> of <hi>MORLET,</hi> who has no reason to <hi>con him thanks</hi>
for it, since it has <hi>provoked</hi> and produced the representation of
these <hi>truths</hi> concerning <hi>him, he</hi> growes upon his own hands,
and to shew his proficiency in the <hi>lying-trade, he</hi> proceeds to
the <hi>delivery</hi> of a <hi>grosser falcity,</hi> in <hi>asserting, that six or seaven
witnesses have been procured to depose in this Kingdom, that</hi>
MORLEY <hi>was suborned by the Earls of ESSEX and</hi> SHAFTS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BURY,
<hi>and by Sr.</hi> ROBERT CLAYTON, <hi>to swear treason a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Duke of</hi> ORMONDE <hi>the Lord</hi> CHANCELLOR
BOYLE <hi>and Sir</hi> JOHN DAVIS, whereas upon <hi>search</hi> in
the <hi>Offices</hi> where <hi>things</hi> of that <hi>nature</hi> (if any had been,)
wou'd be lodg'd, and upon <hi>inquiry</hi> from the <hi>Officers</hi> who cou'd
not but know of <hi>them</hi> if they were <hi>there,</hi> it cannot be <hi>found</hi>
that ever any <hi>one such deposition</hi> was <hi>taken,</hi> or <hi>so much as heard</hi>
of, but several <hi>Examinations</hi> (and with <hi>probability</hi> of <hi>truth too</hi>
considering the before mentioned <hi>proceeding:</hi> of <hi>MORLET</hi>)
do appear of his <hi>Contrivances</hi> of that kind with <hi>people of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
lower rankes,</hi> and it is to be hoped <hi>of infinite different princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi>
too, than it can be thought the <hi>Earls</hi> of <hi>ESSEX</hi>
and <hi>SHAFTSBURY</hi> and Sir <hi>Robert CLAYTON</hi> are of,
who the <hi>Lord Duke</hi> of <hi>ORMONDE</hi> and <hi>those</hi> named with <hi>him</hi>
do not suppose wou'd <hi>Imbarque themselves</hi> with such a <hi>sort of</hi>
man as <hi>MORLEY</hi> is, and in <hi>such manner of Designs</hi> as <hi>he was
upon,</hi> so as the setting up of these <hi>imaginary depositions,</hi> which
never <hi>had being</hi> but in this <hi>LIBELLER's idle brain,</hi> and in
his <hi>Idler LIBELL,</hi> must have been a piece of <hi>MORLEY'S
magick,</hi> by such <hi>Incantations</hi> to charm those <hi>persons</hi> of <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>
to stand by <hi>him</hi> in this time of <hi>his</hi> deservedly <hi>Expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Credit,</hi> and to raise <hi>their Spirits</hi> (thÃ´ most <hi>Vndeser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly</hi>)
against <hi>others</hi> whom <hi>his</hi> and the <hi>LIBELLERS ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice</hi>
would <hi>point them unto,</hi> and <hi>whom</hi> (though it be <hi>impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible</hi>
to <hi>find them</hi> out by the <hi>mark</hi> the <hi>LIBELLER puts upon
them,</hi>) of having obtain'd those <hi>depositions,</hi> because there
were <hi>never any such,</hi> yet by all this <hi>Lurry</hi> about <hi>Morley,</hi> I
gess <hi>them</hi> to be certain <hi>persons</hi> of such <hi>uprightness</hi> and <hi>integrity</hi>
as I am certain, <hi>they</hi> will not fear to have <hi>their Actions</hi> pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c'd
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:40595:9"/>
in that <hi>approaching light</hi> of a <hi>PARLIAMENT</hi> with
<hi>which</hi> the <hi>LIBELLER</hi> threatens them, and <hi>which</hi> then
<hi>shines brightest</hi> when <hi>MORLEY</hi> and the <hi>LIBELLER,</hi> and such
other <hi>sons</hi> of <hi>darkness</hi> are <hi>scatter'd</hi> from <hi>before it,</hi> and
thanks be to <hi>GOD,</hi> we have no reason to <hi>despair</hi> of a <hi>blessing
of that kind</hi> to attend that time, for the <hi>weather</hi> seems to <hi>clear</hi>
very much, and the <hi>aire</hi> to be so well upon <hi>Puryfying,</hi> that
those <hi>infections</hi> cannot <hi>remain.</hi> And as the <hi>LIBELLER</hi> has
thus <hi>ingenuously</hi> in this Paragraph represented <hi>things that never
were,</hi> so <hi>he</hi> will not leave it off untill he has <hi>as ingenuously</hi> misre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
<hi>Matters otherwise than they were,</hi> according to the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

which was given in here against <hi>MORLEY, for such
treasonable expressions as</hi> are not fit to be repeated, but in a <hi>Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial</hi>
way of proceeding against <hi>him,</hi> and from the <hi>transmission</hi>
which was made of it to the <hi>KING</hi> and <hi>COVNCIL</hi> in <hi>ENG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAND</hi>
infer a <hi>fondness,</hi> &amp; I do not know <hi>what,</hi> to have been in
<hi>them</hi> of it, whereas <hi>they</hi> did but as <hi>they</hi> were <hi>bound,</hi> in taking
a <hi>matter</hi> of that <hi>dangerous import</hi> when it was <hi>offer'd,</hi> and as
<hi>they</hi> wou'd have done, if it had related to <hi>any one elss</hi> besides
<hi>MORLET,</hi> and only observed their <hi>duty</hi> and the <hi>Custome</hi> of
their <hi>predecessors</hi> in transmitting (as they alwaies did) <hi>things</hi>
of such <hi>a transcendent nature,</hi> let <hi>them</hi> concern whomsoever
they wou'd, And why this <hi>ordinary practis'd method</hi> in all
other Cases, shou'd be thus <hi>extraordinarily handled</hi> and <hi>repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented</hi>
in <hi>MORLEYS</hi> by the <hi>LIBELLER,</hi> is what I cannot
think of any other <hi>reason</hi> to be given for, but this, that <hi>he</hi>
is a <hi>LIBELLER;</hi> Besides, suppose it were true, as the
<hi>LIBELLER</hi> says, (and it is the only thing <hi>he</hi> says
of <hi>affairs</hi> in <hi>IRELAND</hi> which supposition it self can help)
<hi>That at the time of this transmission as to</hi> MORLEY <hi>it was
withal desired he shou'd be sent over hither to be Tried, where
his Crime was supposed to be done,</hi> (althÃ´ really no such thing
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40595:9"/>
was desired) and that the <hi>KING</hi> had granted it, which <hi>He</hi>
neither did, nor denyed, because no <hi>application</hi> was made
for it, dos the <hi>LIBELLER believe</hi> himself? or can he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
any one elss will <hi>believe</hi> him in, but <hi>laugh</hi> at him for, this
his <hi>doctrine</hi> thereupon, <hi>That it were illegal and Arbitrary to
send a Malefactor to be Tryed here for a fact commited by him
here;</hi> For surely that is as <hi>legal</hi> and looks some thing more <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable</hi>
than to send for <hi>persons</hi> from <hi>hence</hi> to be Tryed in
<hi>England</hi> for <hi>things they</hi> are only charged to have <hi>Commited here,</hi>
as we see has of late been practised, and which thÃ´ the <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers</hi>
say may be done in this <hi>Case,</hi> I am sure no <hi>Lawyer</hi> will
ever allow what the <hi>LIBELLER</hi> sayes in the other <hi>Case,</hi>
especially, if no pertinent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>r <hi>reason</hi> be given than this, which he
assignes for it, <hi>because the party was born and bred and has an
Estate in ENGLAMD,</hi> For such <hi>Circumstances alone,</hi> can never
<hi>protect</hi> any <hi>one</hi> in <hi>ENGLAND,</hi> or <hi>IRELAND,</hi> from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering
for his breach of the <hi>Laws</hi> in either <hi>KINGDOM,</hi> and
in that <hi>KINGDOM</hi> too, where <hi>he</hi> so broke <hi>them</hi> if the <hi>KING</hi>
please to have him sent thither, Nay in this <hi>Case of MORLEY,</hi>
if the <hi>matter</hi> charged upon <hi>him</hi> to be <hi>Committed here</hi> (from
<hi>which</hi> I shall not with the <hi>LIBELLER</hi> acquit <hi>him</hi> only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he is a <hi>PROTESTANT,</hi> considering: <hi>what kind of one</hi> he
shewed <hi>himself</hi> in the times of <hi>usurpation, thorough-pacedly ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi>
of <hi>them,</hi> and what sort of <hi>one he</hi> manifests <hi>himself</hi> in the
<hi>present time of faction,</hi> by those baser Offices of <hi>subornation</hi> and
<hi>Perjury</hi> ministering to it,) were any felony under Treason, I
speak it with reverence, it were <hi>unjust</hi> not to send him <hi>hither</hi> to
be tryed, because the <hi>Statute of</hi> Hen: <hi>the 8th for Tryal of forreign
matters in</hi> England, extends <hi>expresly</hi> &amp; only to <hi>Treasons,</hi> so that
<hi>lesser Offences</hi> done <hi>here</hi> cannot be tryed <hi>there,</hi> and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
to have kept <hi>him</hi> in such <hi>Case</hi> on the <hi>other side</hi> from appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>here,</hi> wou'd be to hinder a <hi>malefactor</hi> from being brought
to <hi>Justice,</hi> which were not <hi>Just;</hi> But as <hi>MORLEYS Case</hi> is,
being for <hi>Treason</hi> Committed <hi>here,</hi> which by that <hi>Statute</hi>
may be Tryed <hi>there,</hi> the <hi>KING</hi> can <hi>Justly</hi> enough (if He
Pleases) detain <hi>him</hi> to be Tryed in <hi>ENGLAND,</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:40595:10"/>
or (if he thinks fit) <hi>as Justly</hi> too may send him <hi>hither</hi> for <hi>Tryall,</hi>
for by that <hi>Statute</hi> it is in the <hi>KINGS</hi> Choise, in which of the
<hi>KINGDOMS</hi> such a <hi>Case</hi> shall be <hi>Try'd;</hi> But then if the <hi>Tryal</hi>
be ordered to be <hi>there</hi> upon a <hi>Treason</hi> Committed <hi>here,</hi> the
<hi>Judges</hi> in <hi>ENGLAND</hi> are therein to <hi>Govern</hi> themselves accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> that is, they are not to <hi>adjudge</hi>
any thing to be <hi>Treason,</hi> but what is so by the <hi>Law</hi> of
<hi>IRELAND,</hi> or by some <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>PARLIAMENT</hi> in
<hi>ENGLAND</hi> where <hi>IRELAND</hi> is named, or that is Enacted
in <hi>IRELAND;</hi> And this Rule holds concerning <hi>Pleas</hi> in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
of <hi>Treason</hi> also, wherefore though <hi>MORLEYS charge</hi>
consists of <hi>Treasonable words</hi> only, and they really <hi>were spok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
two years ago</hi> as the <hi>LIBELLER</hi> observes, whereby <hi>he</hi>
was to be discharged by the late <hi>Statute</hi> in <hi>ENGLAND</hi> (if
they were alledg'd <hi>there</hi>) yet being laid to be spoken <hi>here,</hi>
where that <hi>Statute</hi> not naming <hi>IRELAND,</hi> nor being Ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
in <hi>IRELAND</hi> dos not extend, <hi>he cannot</hi> reap any <hi>Benefit,</hi>
by it; From all which though I will not take upon me to conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
what were the <hi>Causes</hi> MORLEY was not sent <hi>hither,</hi>
yet I may rationally conclude, that <hi>they</hi> cou'd not be any of <hi>those</hi>
which are <hi>given</hi> by the <hi>LIBELLER</hi> for it, so as <hi>he</hi> proves to be
as grosly out in his <hi>Matters of Law as he is notoriously mistaken
in his Matters of fact;</hi> And where, for Conclusion of this <hi>his</hi> Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph,
and for the bringing off <hi>MORLEY</hi> by it, he says, <hi>it is
remarkable that what MORLEY did declare,</hi> (I suppose he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to the <hi>PARLIAMENT</hi>) <hi>in relation to the</hi> Duke <hi>of</hi>
ORMONDE <hi>the</hi> Lord CHANCELLOR, <hi>and Sir</hi> John Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis,
<hi>he refer'd himself for, the truth of it to the</hi> Council <hi>Books
or to depositions before the</hi> Council <hi>of this</hi> Kingdom; it is
more <hi>remarkable</hi> that <hi>MORLEY</hi> did declare <hi>nothing there</hi>
(whatsoever he has done <hi>elswhere</hi>) as to any of those
<hi>Persons,</hi> save only Sir <hi>IOHN DAVIS,</hi> and as to him
that <hi>he</hi> refer'd nothing to the <hi>COUNCIL BOOKS,</hi> or <hi>to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions</hi>
before the <hi>COUNCIL</hi> to prove, other than a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Copy <hi>he</hi> produced of the said Ã´ <hi>NEAL</hi> or <hi>TYRRELLS
Examination,</hi> but of <hi>which</hi> there never was any <hi>Originall</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:40595:10"/>
in the <hi>Council books</hi> or at the <hi>Council Board,</hi> or indeed in <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
so as the LIBE LLER by his thus <hi>elaborately</hi> attempting
to preserve <hi>MORLEYS</hi> gasping <hi>reputation,</hi> for support of
his <hi>Scandalous reflections</hi> upon the <hi>GOVERNMENT,</hi> does but
destroy his own <hi>Credit, and confound</hi> his own <hi>Devices.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are <hi>two</hi> other <hi>persons,</hi> whom the LIBELLER
brings by head and shoulders into this Paragraph for <hi>evidence</hi>
of what <hi>he</hi> amies at by it, but he giving only surnames to them
as <hi>HANLON,</hi> and <hi>MURPHY,</hi> whereby it is Impossible
without more certainty, out of the <hi>herds</hi> that are of those
<hi>names,</hi> to gather <hi>whom</hi> he means, and not assigning any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
to have come from <hi>them,</hi> in proof of his <hi>General as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion</hi>
which he Cites them for, by means whereof <hi>he</hi> only sets
up <hi>Shadows</hi> to be contested within them; I will therefore pass
them over and come to that more <hi>solid body</hi> in the LIBEL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LERS
single opinion of Mr. <hi>HAWKINS,</hi> whom he shews as
his <hi>next</hi> and <hi>last man,</hi> but <hi>who</hi> performed such a <hi>part</hi> when <hi>he</hi>
first brought <hi>himself</hi> upon the <hi>stage,</hi> as I cannot tell whether
<hi>folly,</hi> or <hi>something that is worse</hi> were his greatest <hi>Vice,</hi> and
therefore I will determin on neither side, but give a <hi>true ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count</hi>
of it, as it has been collected out of the <hi>Original papers</hi>
of that <hi>matter,</hi> and then let any <hi>sober</hi> and <hi>impartial man</hi> make
his <hi>Judgment</hi> of it, and of <hi>him</hi> upon it, which was thus;
Mr. <hi>HAWKINS</hi> (between <hi>whom</hi> and some of the <hi>mac GEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NISES
his neighbours</hi> there were some differences) came to
my <hi>Lord</hi> LIEUTENANT to the <hi>CASTLE,</hi> having made <hi>his</hi> way
as being a stranger by presenting of a letter from Sir <hi>HANS
HAMILTON</hi> a late member of the <hi>Council</hi> unto <hi>his GRACE,</hi> &amp;
there acquainted <hi>his Grace</hi> that one <hi>Daniel Hanvy</hi> came to <hi>him</hi>
to his house in the Country, and told <hi>him</hi> of a meeting which
he had a little before with one <hi>Con mac Gennis</hi> at <hi>Down-Patrick,</hi>
and that among other things which at that meeting passed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them, <hi>mac GENNIS</hi> engaged <hi>him</hi> to joyne with <hi>him</hi> in
swearing <hi>HIS GRACE,</hi> Mr. <hi>HAWKINS</hi> and <hi>others</hi> into the
<hi>Plott,</hi> and at the same time did give <hi>him</hi> a <hi>little money,</hi> and
promised him a great deal more when they shou'd afterwards
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:40595:11"/>
meet, as they then agreed to do at <hi>Dublin,</hi> where the design
was to be carried on betwixt <hi>them,</hi> That with this <hi>Information</hi>
Mr. <hi>HAWKINS</hi> repaired to Sir, <hi>HANS HAMILTON,</hi>
who advised <hi>him</hi> to carry it to my <hi>LORD</hi> LIEUTENANT
where he thus brought it, hereupon my <hi>Lord</hi> LIEUTENANT
caused Mr. <hi>HAWKINS</hi> to bring <hi>HANVY</hi> to <hi>him,</hi> and after
<hi>his GRACE</hi> had with great privacy taken his <hi>Examination,</hi>
which was much to the purpose aforesaid, he asked Mr.
<hi>HAWKINS</hi> if he knew <hi>CON mac GENNIS</hi> and where he
was to be found, which <hi>he</hi> said <hi>he</hi> did very well, and that as
<hi>HANVY</hi> told <hi>him,</hi> he was come to Town in order to their
aforesaid appointed meeting, which was to be <hi>sometime</hi> on
<hi>that</hi> or the <hi>day following,</hi> and though Mr. <hi>HAWKINS</hi>
did not know the <hi>certain house</hi> where it shou'd be in, yet
he wou'd learn it from <hi>HANVY,</hi> and thereupon he proposed to
<hi>his GRACE</hi> that for having more <hi>wittnesses</hi> besides <hi>HANVY</hi> of
what shou'd pass at that intended <hi>meeting, his GRACE</hi> wou'd
appoint another <hi>Trusty person</hi> to joyn with one <hi>NEAL mac
LAVGHLIN</hi> whom Mr. <hi>HAWKINS</hi> designed to employ,
for so disposing of <hi>themselves</hi> in the Room of the house
where the <hi>others</hi> were to meet in, that <hi>they</hi> might (without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
observed by them) see <hi>them,</hi> and hear the discourses be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<hi>them;</hi> Which my <hi>LORD</hi> LIEUTENANT complied
with, and was accordingly done, only with this Variation,
that Mr. <hi>HAWKINS</hi> employed <hi>another</hi> in that service in the
stead of <hi>mac LAVGHLIN,</hi> who cou'd not be found, In the
mean time <hi>his GRACE</hi> kept this <hi>matter</hi> as a <hi>secret</hi> from <hi>all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi>
least any <hi>disappointment</hi> shou'd befall such a promised
<hi>discovery,</hi> afterwards Mr. <hi>HAWKINS</hi> came to my <hi>LORD</hi>
LIEUTENANT, and acquainted <hi>him</hi> the parties had mett, and
the person appointed by <hi>his GRACE,</hi> with the other whom <hi>Haw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins</hi>
did employ in the Over hearing of them, came likewise, &amp;
told <hi>his Grace</hi> that they saw <hi>HANVY</hi> &amp; another <hi>man</hi> whom he
call'd <hi>CON mac GENNIS</hi> together, and heard <hi>them</hi> discourse of
such designs as were at first informed, but withal that <hi>they</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
and heard <hi>mac GENNIS</hi> to say at their parting to the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:40595:11"/>
Master of the house, who came towards the end of <hi>their</hi> discourse
to <hi>them,</hi> These words, <hi>take notice I never saw this person</hi> pointing
at <hi>HANVY <hi>before the last night,</hi>
               </hi> upon this Report brought to
my Lord LIEUTENANT He ordered <hi>CON mac GENNIS</hi> to
be sent for, who appeared <hi>and denied his name to be CON mac
GENNIS,</hi> affirming it to be <hi>OWEN DVFFY,</hi> and proved it
to be so by invincible Circumstances; but <hi>he</hi> owned at the same
time <hi>his</hi> having gon under the name of <hi>CON mac GENNIS
to,</hi> and his having had the aforesaid meetting <hi>with HANVT,</hi>
whom withal <hi>he</hi> protested <hi>he</hi> never saw until the night before
<hi>he</hi> had the meeting with <hi>him,</hi> which with <hi>his</hi> other feigned
parts, <hi>he</hi> said <hi>he</hi> was prevailed upon to Act, by the desires of
one <hi>HENRT FARREL,</hi> whose reason for the same <hi>he</hi> knew
not, but referr'd it to <hi>FARRELL</hi> to declare: At this proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my Lord LIEUTENANT (as any one woul'd be) was
strangly surprised, and the more, because His <hi>GRACE</hi> was
satisfied at <hi>his</hi> first sight of the Man, who now is <hi>DVFFT,</hi> and
before <hi>he</hi> named himself to be so, that <hi>he</hi> was <hi>not CON mac
GENNIS</hi> whom <hi>HANVY</hi> had described, for <hi>him</hi> His <hi>GRACE</hi>
had occasions to see and know long before, in the quality
of a Deputy <hi>Pursuvant,</hi> for dispatching of <hi>Irish Witnesses,</hi> sent
for from <hi>hence</hi> into <hi>ENGLAND,</hi> but what <hi>HIS GRACE</hi> most
wonder'd at was, that <hi>HANVY</hi> shou'd have affirmed as he did,
<hi>his</hi> having had a familiar acquaintance for many years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with that <hi>CON mac GENNIS</hi> before, and yet that <hi>he</hi>
shou'd now take this <hi>DVFFY</hi> for <hi>him;</hi> Hereupon my Lord
LIEUTENANT had <hi>HAWKINS</hi> and <hi>HANVY</hi> who were
attending, called in, where <hi>HANVY</hi> upon the question put
to him, declared again such <hi>his long acquaintance with</hi> CON
<hi>mac</hi> GENNIS, and all the other matters touching him,
and confidently affirmed, that <hi>DVFFY</hi> then present before
<hi>him</hi> was the Man, and Mr. <hi>HAWKINS</hi> (although at his
first coming to my Lord LIEUTENANT, and as is before
mentioned, <hi>he</hi> told His <hi>Grace</hi> that <hi>he knew</hi> CON mac GENNIS
<hi>very well,</hi> and consequently, cou'd not but at this time know
that <hi>DVFFY</hi> whom <hi>he saw</hi> thus to personate <hi>him</hi> was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:40595:12"/>
person) yet as if <hi>he</hi> wou'd have had my Lord <hi>Lieutenant</hi>
deceived, did suffer <hi>Duffy</hi> to pass upon <hi>His GRACE for</hi> Con <hi>mac</hi>
GENNIS, without offering any thing to undeceive <hi>him,</hi>
until <hi>my Lord LIEVTENANT</hi> did at last take notice to them,
how <hi>that person</hi> had proved himself to be <hi>OWEN DVFFY,</hi> and
how <hi>his Grace</hi> himself knew that it was not <hi>CON</hi> mac
<hi>GENNIS,</hi> upon which <hi>HANVY</hi> and <hi>HAWKINS</hi> confessed
themselves to be mistaken, and so in great confusion vanished;
After this scene was thus over, which in <hi>the persons</hi> and <hi>the
parts</hi> of it looked the most odd, and was the least intelligible,
that for a great while has been presented, <hi>my Lord</hi> LIEUTE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NANT
conducted the whole matter to the <hi>Council,</hi> where it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
as a perfect <hi>riddle,</hi> and because <hi>FARRELL</hi> appeared
the ablest <hi>to unfold it,</hi> by giving an account how he came to
make <hi>DVFFY</hi> personate <hi>CON mac GENNIS</hi> unto <hi>HANVY,
he</hi> was order'd to be <hi>examined,</hi> who in <hi>his Examinatiom</hi> and
upon <hi>his Oath</hi> declared, that NEAL <hi>mac</hi> LAUGHLIN did some
time before, lodging at <hi>his</hi> house, let fall expressions which
gave <hi>him</hi> suspicion of <hi>HAWKINS his</hi> being upon some <hi>evill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes,</hi>
and that <hi>he</hi> was confirmed therein afterwards, by
lighting upon a letter from <hi>HAWKINS</hi> to <hi>mac LAVGHLYN</hi>
which <hi>FARRELL</hi> produced, and <hi>HAWKINS</hi> confessed, but
pretends to be to an <hi>innocent</hi> end, and which directed <hi>mac
LAVGHLIN</hi> to go to one RAWLINSON in <hi>Dublin</hi> for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
<hi>him</hi> with money, enjoyning him afterwards to repair
to <hi>HAWKINS</hi> into the <hi>North</hi> concerning the <hi>business</hi> which
<hi>mac LAVGHLIN</hi> to do <hi>for him;</hi> That after mac <hi>LAVGH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIN</hi>
(who then went to the <hi>North</hi> accordingly) returned unto
Town, <hi>he</hi> came to <hi>Farrells</hi> house, but told <hi>him</hi> that <hi>he</hi> was to
lodge no longer with <hi>him,</hi> for that <hi>he</hi> had a lodging provided
in another place hard by the said RAWLINSON; which
with FARRELLS observing of <hi>mac</hi> LAUGHL<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>N to be flush
of money, and understanding that <hi>HAWKINS</hi> was come to
Town, put it out of all doubt with <hi>him</hi> that there was some
mischief a <hi>contriving,</hi> which <hi>Farrell</hi> resolved to imploy <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe</hi>
in the finding out and for that purpose remembring that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:40595:12"/>
               <hi>mac LAVGHLIN</hi> had been very inquisitive of <hi>him</hi> for
<hi>CON mac GENNIS,</hi> and perceiving several messengers
to come to <hi>his</hi> house at divers times in a day to inquire for
<hi>CON mac GENNIS,</hi> as from <hi>persons</hi> newly come out of
the <hi>Country, He</hi> dogg'd some of <hi>Them</hi> to a certain House
whither <hi>he</hi> prevailed upon <hi>OWEN DVFFY</hi> to go with
<hi>him,</hi> and if there shou'd be Occasion to take upon <hi>him</hi>
the name of <hi>CON mac GENNIS,</hi> after <hi>whom</hi> this great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
had been, and when <hi>they</hi> came thither and a little after
<hi>they</hi> had talked something loud, on purpose to be heard by <hi>an
obscure man</hi> who they were told was in the next Room, that
man (who proved to be <hi>DANIEL HANVY</hi>) hearing the
name of <hi>CON mac GENNIS,</hi> came in unto <hi>them,</hi> and apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himself to <hi>DVFFY</hi> whome <hi>he</hi> took or pretended to take
for <hi>CON mac GENNIS,</hi> finding <hi>him</hi> to be called so, said to <hi>him</hi>
with much kindness, <hi>you know we have great business to do, to
which</hi> DUFFY <hi>Answered, yes, yes,</hi> and so after having appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to meet together the next day, <hi>they</hi> then parted, which
was the only occasion, as <hi>FARRELL</hi> said, of his thus per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading
<hi>DVFFY</hi> to personate <hi>CON mac GENNIS</hi> unto <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,</hi>
and of such meeting and discourse had betwixt <hi>them,</hi> and
now let any <hi>one</hi> who reads these <hi>true passages</hi> of that affair
<hi>Judge,</hi> whether Mr. <hi>HAWKINS</hi> has aquitted <hi>himself</hi> like
that <hi>man of honour, discretion,</hi> and <hi>ingenuity,</hi> which the
LIBBELLER wou'd blazon <hi>him;</hi> and whether my Lord <hi>DVKE</hi>
of <hi>ORMONDE</hi> be not a more <hi>mercifull person</hi> to the DIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SENTERS,
than the LIBELLER wou'd seem before to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<hi>him,</hi> since notwithstanding Mr. <hi>HAWKINS</hi> be <hi>one</hi> of
the <hi>virulenst</hi> of them, and by such <hi>his</hi> proceedings appeared a
very great <hi>Triffler</hi> with, if not an <hi>affronter</hi> of <hi>GOVERN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENT,</hi>
yet his <hi>GRACE</hi> let <hi>him</hi> go without inflicting
any Punishment upon <hi>him</hi> for it, althÃ´ <hi>he</hi> cou'd not but
take more notice of <hi>him</hi> afterwards, when an <hi>Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
amounting as near to <hi>HIGH-TREASON</hi> as cou'd be
was given in to the <hi>Council</hi> against <hi>him,</hi> and by such a <hi>Person</hi>
too, as Mr. <hi>Florence Weyer</hi> a <hi>Sanctified evidence</hi> in <hi>ENGLAND</hi>

in the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> there, for which reason the LIBELLER ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so much as mentions <hi>WE<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

in <hi>time,</hi> and much inferior in <hi>matter</hi> against <hi>HAWKINS</hi> than
the <hi>other</hi> did, and as to <hi>mac LAVGHLIN</hi> it is observable, that
though the LIBELLER affirms <hi>he</hi> never spoke with <hi>HAW<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>KINS</hi>
but <hi>once,</hi> and <hi>then</hi> only to insinuate into <hi>his</hi> acquaintance,
yet <hi>HAWKINS himself</hi> in <hi>his Exa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

known <hi>him</hi> &amp; to have Employed <hi>him</hi> in <hi>his business</hi> for some
years past; And besides it is manifest by <hi>HAWKINS his</hi> above
mentioned Letter to <hi>Mac LAVGHLIN</hi> (which <hi>FARRELL</hi>
produced upon <hi>his</hi> being <hi>Examined</hi> and <hi>HAWKINS</hi>
Confessed in <hi>his Examination</hi> to be <hi>his</hi> hand,) that there was
a familiar acquaintance betwixt <hi>him</hi> and <hi>Mac LAVGHLIN</hi>
before, which Letter, looking so <hi>suspicious,</hi> and being follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with <hi>WEYERS</hi> and the others <hi>Informations,</hi> which sounded
so <hi>dangerous,</hi> my <hi>Lord</hi> LIEUTENANT and <hi>COVNCIL</hi> cou'd
do no less than as they did, to Commit <hi>HAWKINS</hi> upon them,
and notwithstanding the LIBELLER and <hi>his Party</hi> wou'd
now, because it seems to thwart <hi>their</hi> designes, reflect upon
the <hi>Government</hi> for doing of it, as too much <hi>countenancing of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations,</hi>
yet (as has been found by late experience,) <hi>they</hi>
wou'd be apt at another time (if it might advance their purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses)
more severely to fall upon the <hi>GOVERNMENT</hi> for not
doing of it, as too great <hi>discountenancing</hi> of Evidence, so <hi>partial</hi>
and so <hi>passionate</hi> are the <hi>FACTIOVS.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus, (<hi>Sir,</hi>) have I run through the several Parts of this
LIBELL, which touch upon this <hi>Kingdom,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Government</hi> of
it, &amp; in my answers to them, I have for the most part <hi>mentioned</hi>
and <hi>referr'd</hi> unto such <hi>papers of Estate</hi> &amp; <hi>publick Records,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
all the matters of them prove to fall within the knowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of so many <hi>persons</hi> living, that if I had not a <hi>singular regard</hi>
to truth (which I hope I shall ever follow) and a <hi>particular</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:40595:13"/>
for you (whom I am certain I will never abuse) yet you
may be sure I wou'd not dare, and therefore that I have not
adventur'd to say any thing, but what contains the greatest
veracity, since in doing otherwise (which was a sufficient
Precaution to me from the beginning unto the end of this
work) I knew I shou'd be by <hi>variety</hi> of <hi>Testimonies</hi> disproved,
and render'd not only as <hi>Odious,</hi> but as <hi>Ridiculous</hi> and <hi>Contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible</hi>
to the World, as our LIBELLER has shewn himself,
who though <hi>he</hi> wou'd have it believed, as if he were in his
<hi>principles</hi> the farthest removed from the <hi>Popish Party,</hi> dos yet
expose his LIBELL (by the gross <hi>lies</hi> which are dispersed
through it) to be the nearest allied unto the <hi>Popish Legend.</hi> I
