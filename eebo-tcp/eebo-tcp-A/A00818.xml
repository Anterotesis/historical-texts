            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

tendeth to the ſame cure. If the ſame
croſſe haue not effected the end for
which it was ſent, he ſends it the ſecond
time, as a man doth his ſeruant who
hath not fully done his errand at firſt.
Thus doth he with particular perſons,
thus doth hee with whole Nations,
whoſe good he intendeth. He viſited

to re-aſſume his rods, when we renew our ſins;
and as wee vſe to take from our children their

if the couetous Farmers dry vp theſe, as the enuious

In groſſe, or by ſuch quantities as the poore

excluded the vnworthy gueſts from the great mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
Feaſt; theſe excuſes are worſe. Thou haſt

a Cannon, is more terrible and tearing. Such a
curſe being ſhot from earth, mounteth vp to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen;
and being ſent vp from man, is ſealed by God.
It is true, that the common people doe commonly
erre and offend herein; their curſes, many times
are their fooles-bolts, ſhot without ayme, and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

then they hit ſurely, and wound deepely. In this
caſe the people haue a legatiue power like the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors,
<hi>What they binde on earth, is bound in heauen.</hi>
Here the voyce of the people, eſpecially of the
poore, the people of God, is the voyce of the God
of the people. Therefore wee finde in Scripture,
that the curſe of the people, and a woe from God,
are all one vpon the reckoning. Our Wiſe man

Is he a theefe that takes from a man his owne, and
makes him to be in want? What is hee leſſe, that
will not ſell a poore man his owne when hee is in

a<note n="d" place="margin">Videatur D. Baſilius ſer. 1. in Auaros.</note> Saint) not to giue to thoſe who are ready to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh,

that bleſſed man) What are thoſe things thou cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt
thine owne? Thou anſwereſt, why? my Coine,
my Clothes, my Corne. But how came theſe things
to be thine owne? Didſt thou bring them with
thee into the world? Didſt thou not come naked
out of thy mothers wombe? Shalt thou not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
naked againe? Whence then haſt thou theſe
things? If thou ſayeſt, I got them by chance, or it
is my good fortune that I haue them; thou doeſt
not acknowledge the author and diſpoſer of all
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:15485:21"/>
things, thou art vnthankefull, thou art no better
than an Atheiſt. If thou confeſſeſt thou haſt them
from God, that he gaue them vnto thee; then tell
me, why did God giue them vnto thee rather than
vnto another? For God is not vniuſt, or one that
knoweth not how to diuide his owne gifts in equall
proportions. Why then hath God giuen thee ſo
much, and him ſo little? Why art thou rich, and
hee poore? Certainely for no other cauſe, but that
thy fulneſſe might ſupply his want, and that both
might, doing their duties, obtaine of him a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;
thou of faithfull diſtributing, and hee of
his patient enduring. If all were rich, what praiſe
were there of patience? If all were poore, who
ſhould be able to ſhew charity? If there were, in
this kinde, an equality, two pretious vertues would
be vile or not at all, Charity and Patience. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the moſt prudent diſpoſer of all things, hath
moſt prouidently ordained this inequality, that as
the patience of the poore is exerciſed in wanting,
ſo the charity of the rich may be ſhewed in relee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing.
But thou, griping all in the tallands of thine

that to thy ſelfe which thou haſt receiued of thy

double, treble, yea ſeuen to one of theirs) being
allowed thee? Shall hee who takes away a mans

to want neceſſaries, for lacke of that which the

it is not ſo ſaid, but, <hi>Bleſſing ſhal be on his head,</hi> which

God taketh on him to be the beſtower of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,

will doe it himſelfe to preuent failing. In naming

vpon him plentifully and comfortably. That
which is powred downe vpon the head, muſt needs
proceed from ſomething that is aboue the head.
Now there is none higher than the head of man,

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:15485:30"/>
them, either by giuing, lending, or ſelling. This
makes mens hearts to bee harder than they would

Good men in doing good, doe looke vp
chiefly to the fountaine of goodneſſe, to God and

doe neglect their duty, yet God can as ſoone forget
himſelfe as his mercy. If the people, who are ready
to curſe when they want, be not as ready to bleſſe
when their wants are ſupplied, yet God, who hath
powred charity into your hearts, will powre down
bleſſings vpon your heads, and ſo crowne in you his

Theſe are but bubbles blowne vp by malice

Though the people do ſometimes curſe where they
ſhould bleſſe, yet God will ſurely bleſſe, where he
findeth obedience. As bleſſing ſhall be on the head
of them who ſell their Corne willingly, ſo ſhall it
be on your heads, who cauſe them, or compell them
to ſell, who are vnwilling. The bleſſing that might
haue beene on their heads, if they had ſold willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
ſhall bee taken from theirs,<note place="margin">And to draw on the people by their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</note> and placed on your

doubtleſſe, this bleſſing ſhal be doubled, if you draw
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:15485:31"/>
them on by example, as well as by authority. If
bleſſing ſhall be on the head of the ſeller, how many
bleſſings ſhall bee on the bountifull giuer and relee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
