            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

occaſion their falling off into any ſin; or, which the place e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially

v.</hi> 5. is by Saint <hi>Marke</hi> 9. 41. expreſt to conſiſt in doing them
kindneſſe, <hi>to encourage them</hi> in the wayes of godlineſſe. So
Chriſt crucified is ſaid a Scandall to the Jewes, <hi>i. e.</hi> they that
were otherwiſe not ill opinion'd of him, and ſo <hi>followed</hi> him
with the multitudes, when they ſaw him crucified, were quite
diſcourag'd, and fell away from him, (as they that are ſo <hi>gall'd</hi>
by thoſe <hi>ſtakes</hi> are faine to give over the purſuit, to returne)
and ſo reſolv'd, ſeeing him dye, that he was not the <hi>Meſſias</hi>

he that ſhall not be offended in me, i. e.</hi> ſhall not be <hi>gall'd</hi> and
diſcourag'd, and ſo fall off by ſeeing the ſufferings that befall
me, and await my diſciples or followers. So againe <hi>Mat:</hi> 13. 57.
<hi>Mark.</hi> 6. 3. It is ſaid, that the conſideration of his knowne and
meane birth occaſioned their being <hi>offended in him, i. e.</hi> their
deſerting and not <hi>beleeving of him,</hi> when the miracles which
he had done inclin'd them ſomewhat to a valuing of him. So
<hi>John</hi> 6. 61. When Chriſt talkes of <hi>eating the fleſh of the ſon of
man, they were offended,</hi> (that is) that ſpeech carnally under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood

at leaſt from taking him for the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> So <hi>Gal:</hi> 5. 11. perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is called the <hi>Scandall of the Croſſe,</hi> or that upon which ſo
many are diſcourag'd from profeſſing the crucified Saviour,
according to that in the parable of the ſower, <hi>Mat:</hi> 13. 21.
<hi>Mark:</hi> 4. 17. upon the coming of perſecution <hi>preſently he is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended,

night</hi> (to wit of my attachement) <hi>Ye ſhall all be offended becauſe
of mee. i. e. fall backe, for ſake me:</hi> and ſo in Saint <hi>Peters</hi> anſwer,
<hi>v.</hi> 23. <hi>Although all men ſhould be offended, yet will I never be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended:</hi>

action of mine from the evill colour that it is capable of,
by <hi>rectifying</hi> his judgement whom I diſcerne to be miſtaken in
it, and by declaring (either expreſly, or by ſome ſignificative
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65904:7"/>
character of my intentions faſtened to my action) the cleare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and innocency of my purpoſes to any other that may be
ſo miſtaken; and by ſo doing if I cannot free my ſelfe from his
<hi>uncharitable cenſure,</hi> yet I ſhall be ſure to keepe him from any
danger of <hi>following</hi> me to that ſin; for ſure my very diſclaiming
of that ſin which he ſuſpects me guilty of, will diveſt that ſin
of all authority which it may receive from my committing it,
and not <hi>invite,</hi> but rather deterre and <hi>fortifie</hi> others from falling
into that ſinne, which they ſee diſavowed and diſliked by me.
For if my <hi>authority</hi> be of any force with them, it will perſwade
them to abſteine from that which I diſclaime, and profeſſe my
ſelfe to hate (who certainly know my owne minde beſt) rather
then to do, what they only conceive I do, but I profeſſe I do
not. And therefore the caſe being thus ſet of the commendable
uſefull indifferent, not of the meere frivolous unconſiderable,
when the uſe and gaine of my action to me is <hi>certaine,</hi> and the
danger of being miſtaken by others at moſt <hi>but poſſible,</hi> and that
alſo preventable by theſe other meanes, neither piety nor pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
will adviſe to abſteine from that healthfull food, which
if it be by accident unhealthfull by others, hath yet an antidote
adminiſtred with it. Which will be yet farther heightned al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,
if this laudable indifferent fall out to be ſuch as the <hi>examples</hi>
of <hi>holy</hi> men in <hi>ſcripture,</hi> or the <hi>practiſe</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> in <hi>purer</hi>

the caſuall conſequents that may poſſibly either follow or not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.

that other ſin, which my ſin is apt to produce in another, will be

(though that other man by the grace of God do reſiſt the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

(as before his death it was condemn'd) when he was no longer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

of his particular judgment, <hi>i. e.</hi> imputed the caſuall future actions of

inconveniences that might attend ſuch conceſſions it muſt alſo fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
that every reprinting of that book ſince that time, hath been a

which humanity and charity, and our great obligations to the

and non-proficiency in his Chriſtian courſe, and whether if I
do not ſo abſteine this be not to <hi>ſcandalize</hi> my brother? To which
I breifly anſwer, 1. That this anger or uncharitableneſſe of his, is not
the being ſcandaliz'd in the ſcripture ſence, nor conſequently in
that reſpect my Action a Scandall, though it be the matter of the
anger, or that which he is angry with.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>45</label> Secondly, 'Tis true indeed that his reſolving againſt my preaching
is in him to be <hi>Scandaliz'd, i. e.</hi> to fall and be ſtopt in the ſervice of
God: but this only in a generall ſenſe; as every other ſuch hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted
obdurate reſiſting of Gods grace is, or may be called alſo:
and that which occaſi ons this being <hi>Scandaliz'd,</hi> is not my indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
action, but his anger or uncharitable conceit of me for it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
equivocally, or remotely, as my action is the object of that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
which anger is the Author of that profane reſolution.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>46</label> Yet Thirdly, if I might foreſee that my indifferent action would
occaſion, though unjuſtly, his anger, and his anger produce the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect

from that indifferent action, in charity to him.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>47</label> But that with theſe cautions, 1. Unleſſe my indifferent action be
ordinable to ſome good Chriſtian uſe, and deſigned by me to it; for
then,<note place="margin">Maimov. d: I. col. c. 5.</note> as the Jewes reſolve that a tree ſet for fruit though it chance
to be worſhip't, is not made unlawfull by that meanes, ſo that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
<hi>uſefull</hi> action of mine will not be made unlawfull by the
poſſibility of that ill conſequent: Or ſecondly unleſſe that action
in it ſelfe indifferent, by lawfull authority be commanded, and ſo
ceaſe to be indifferent to me who am under that authority: Or
thirdly, unleſſe my abſteining may as probably prove matter of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to ſome other of contrary perſwaſions. Or fourthly, unleſſe that
my abſteining, or receding, or undoing what before I had done, be
more likely to confirme him in his errour (which otherwiſe in
time being not yeilded to, he may forſake) then to prevent or allay
his cauſleſſe anger and thoſe effects of it. Or fifthly, unleſſe I uſe
ſome meanes in prudence not only ſufficient, but probable to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
this ſin of unjuſt anger in him before, or to reform it afterward.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>48</label> But if my abſteining be like to fall into all or any of theſe incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences,
then ſure I ought not thus to abſteine; becauſe when
theſe conſequences doe attend my abſteining, they are nearer and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:65904:16"/>
more immediate to my abſteining, then his reſolving againſt my
preaching, is to my doing of it.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>49</label> And another conſideration alſo may be taken, that he that will ſo
cauſleſly be angry and reſolve againſt the ordinary meanes of his
ſalvation, will by the ſuggeſtion of the Devill or temptation of his
owne corrupt humour, be likely to find out ſome other matter of
quarrell againſt me &amp; my preaching, <hi>i. e.</hi> againſt his owne ſalvation,
though I by abſteining from that particular action, deprive him of
that.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>50</label> And laſtly, though I ſhall not define, yet I would have it conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
whether he that is ſo diſpoſed in ſoule and affection, that ſo
gives up the reines of his paſſions, as upon every or no occaſion to
breake out into cauſleſſe anger, uncharitableneſſe, and the effects of
it forementioned, be at all the more innocent or leſſe culpable in the
ſight of God by the not committing of ſome one act of that
ſin, only through wanting that or any other one occaſion of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
that act. For as in good things God accepts the will for the
deed (if it be a firme &amp; ratified will, a full actuall intention, &amp; want
nothing but opportunity to ſhew it ſelfe) &amp; againe accepts him that
hath expreſt that will by ten only acts, being by want of opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
deprived of a poſſibility of adding one act more to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
aſwell as him, which having the opportunity that the other
wanted, hath exceeded him in the number of outward acts. So there
may be ſome reaſon to feare, that an unreſiſted unreſtrained propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
or conſent to evill, that wants nothing, but an occaſion to actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
it, will be as criminous in the ſight of God, as if (without
any improvement or change, but only by meeting with that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion)
it break forth into act: or that an habituall inclination to ſin
in one man ten times actuated in the members, having no more oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions
to actuate it, ſhall be as ſadly puniſhed, as the ſame degree
of inclination and intention through preſence of occaſion once
more actuated.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>51</label> The ſame Conſideration will be proper to other particulars inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to the matter of Scandall. As when any thirſty drunkard actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
importunate in the purſuite of his eſpouſed ſin, ſhall by occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of my feaſt fall into an open act of that ſin, (and a hundred the
like.) The queſtion then may be, whether ſuppoſing him bent to
exceſſe, and not only habitually guilty of it, but actually Intent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, &amp; only kept off by want of occaſion, he would have had leſſe
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:65904:17"/>
guilt upon his ſoule, if I had not then invited him. I conceive it hard
to maintaine the affirmative, for though with men, who ſee not the
heart, no ſin is puniſhable but that in the members (unleſſe in caſe
of Treaſon) yet with God the ſin of the heart and the hand ſeems
to be equally great, the act of the mind &amp; the act of the body; And
the minutely preparations of that to ſin as puniſhable, as the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutely
execution of this. As in the Schoolmens reſemblance the
preſſing of the ſtone to the ground is as great when it is withheld

               <label type="milestone">

act, yet the compleate act of the will, wanting nothing but oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of execution, may ſtill be as great,) Or however, becauſe
there are not ſuch demonſtrable grounds of reſolution, as to yeild
cleare conviction to all in this matter, and to aſſure the Chriſtian,
that ſuch an addition of any outward act of ſin ſhall make the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
the heavier to the habituall ſinner, and ſo the abſence of
that outward act alleviate it; therefore, although I ſaid I thinke he
ſhould doe well to abſteine, I dare not yet affirme that he is bound
in charity to do ſo; Nothing but charity binding him to it, and the
man that ſtill hath that propenſion unreſiſted, being (upon this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
which we have made not improbable) like to reape little
profit from that charity.</p>
