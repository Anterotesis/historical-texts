            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>For first, as concernyng fleshe and bloude, we were in felowshippe with Christ, in the loynes of our forefather Adam,<note place="margin">Gene. iii.</note> to whom he was promised im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly after his offence, but opened vnto the worlde, whan he became in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate:<note place="margin">Heb. ii.</note> So that this felowship was entred with vs, in that parte whyche

was properli ours.

               <p>And like as the sonne sayth, that the father should geue vs the breade that came from heauen, that is to saye, his owne sonne (who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he also calleth lyfe, because he is the life it selfe:) Euen so the so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne saith, that the bread which he wold geue,<note place="margin">Iohn. vi.</note> shuld be his flesh which he would geue and offre to the father for the lyfe of the worlde: Namely, that the worlde by his death, myght haue that lyfe, whyche he sayde, the father woulde geue: and that is euen the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry true breade that came downe from heauen.

So that as we cannot consider what the Lord hathe done, doth, or offereth to do for vs, so is it no maruayle, that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne styl vnthankful,</p>
               <p>We should at the ministracion and recept of the Sacrament, haue good natural bread: but in stede thereof, we haue printed waifers, and suche star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched stuffe, as is not pure &amp; perfecte bread, nor lyke vnto that whych was vsed in the eating of the Lordes holy Supper at the first. The Lord biddeth his disciples take the breade: but oure lay people (who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we trust yet to be the Lords disciples) are forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to touch it. The Lord saith: Take ye, &amp; eate ye,
<pb facs="tcp:11540:34"/>
he saith not, take thou it alon, and let no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> els eate with the. He saith, take and eate: he saith not, lift it vp aboue your heades: But nowe the Priestes take and lyft it vp an high. He sayeth: Take and eate, and saieth not hang it vp: But now it is taken &amp; hanged vp by a lyne or cord. He sayth: Take and eate, and saith not, take and worshyp it as God: But now men crouch and kneele vnto it, honour and worship it as theyr maker. The Lord saith. Take &amp; eate: He saith not, put it vp in store. or kepe it in a boxe tyl another tyme: But now it is reserued &amp; caried about in procession, and in the streetes, that the people may fal downe (yea, when they se it not) knocke theyr breastes &amp; worship it. The Lord saith: Do this in remembraunce of me: He sayeth not, do it in remembraunce of others: but now the Priestes do theyr Masse in remembraunce of the quicke &amp; deade, in remembraunce of Angels &amp; saints: they make an oblacion &amp; sacrifice of it for the soules departed, for beasts and Catfel, for syknesses and diseases. &amp;c.
<pb facs="tcp:11540:34"/>
The Lord willeth al the Disciples that were with him, to drinke of the Cup, and the Euangelist saith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they al dranke of it: But now the part of the Sacrament is take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from the lay peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as though Christ had not shed his bloud for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as wel as for others.</p>
               <p>What can we then iustly looke for at the Lordes hand to be partakers of in this worthy Sacrament, when we so vnworthely disdaine &amp; think scorne to minister, receaue and vse it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Lordes most holy institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion: but chop and chaunge, adde and minysh, after the pleasures, imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions and fond fantasies of men, &amp; not after the word of the Lorde, nor after the rightful practise of hys primitiue and most pure Church?</p>
               <p>Because the Corinthians did so vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>worthely behaue them selues aboute thys holy Sacrament, by reason of these and such like abuses as we haue now spoken of, and for that thei made no difference of the Lordes body, that is to say, because thei so litle regarded not only his mistical body the church

and congregacion, but also the death and merites of his natural blessed bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy that suffred and was crucified for them: therfore (saith the Apostle) ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are weake and sicke among you, and many sleepe. And what thing els vnder the Sunne, hathe more prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked the wrath and indignatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of god ouer vs, or is a greater occasion why he withdraweth his grace &amp; holy spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit from vs, and otherwise also se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth his sondrye plages amongst vs: Yea, what hath bene or is at thys daye, a greater cause of his displeasure, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is the most filthy and abhominable ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry and supersticion of theyr masse, the blinde and wylfull abusing of the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, when neither the doctrine of the Lord is trulye taught nor bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, neither those worthye fruites of repentaunce folow, that so godly flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished in the primitiue churche, &amp; that so vertuously shuld appeare in euerie one that receaueth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion?</p>
