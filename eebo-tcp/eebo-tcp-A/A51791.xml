         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>AS concerning the manner of creating the Popes, it hath been different, in divers times; for in the Primitive Church only the Clergy of <hi>Rome</hi> had power to make the Election; but this right afterwards deſcended to the Emperor and the People: In the Year 684, the Emperor <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the IVth. parted with this Power, and the Clergy alone and the People created the Pope: but in the Year 963, Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the VIII. being driven from his Seat by the Roman people, who bore, in thoſe days, ſo little Reſpect to the Popes, that they us'd to Treat 'em very evilly, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times baniſh 'em, and ſometimes even put 'em to death; as they did Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the III. <hi>Benedict</hi> the VI. and Pope <hi>John</hi> the XIV. Then did the Emperor <hi>Otho</hi> the II. reaſſume the Right and Power of Elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Popes, which <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the IV. had ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred to the people, as aforeſaid. The Exarchs of <hi>Ravenna,</hi> Lieutenants for the Emperor in <hi>Italy,</hi> and the Roman people had often great Diſputes together for the Elections, the which cauſed Schiſms; ſuch as was that of <hi>Innocent</hi> the II. againſt <hi>Anaclete</hi> the II. the which obliged <hi>Victor</hi> the IV. to aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a General Council at <hi>Rome,</hi> at St. <hi>John</hi> of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teran's;</hi> where it was ordein'd, That the Clergy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone ſhould give their Suffrages; and Pope <hi>Celeſtine</hi> the XXI. was the firſt that was created after this manner. But a little while after, this Right and Propriety was conferr'd upon the Cardinals only; and in the Council of <hi>Lateran</hi> following, aſſembled by the Pope <hi>Caliſtus</hi> the III. it was then ordein'd, That two thirds of the Suffrages ſhould be requiſite and neceſſary for the Creation of a Pope: And in the end, at the ſecond Council-General held at <hi>Lyons,</hi> under <hi>Gregory</hi> the X. it was concluded upon, amongſt the Rules and Canons that were there and then made touching the Ceremonies of Electing and Creating a Pope, That the Cardinals ſhould be ſhut up in a Conclave; from whence they ſhould not come forth until the Election was ended; which is performed after this manner following.</p>
            <p>He that ought to be choſen is propoſed in the Conclave; upon which propoſition, the Cardinals go to the Scrutiny, and finding the number of Suff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages requiſite, the Maſters of the Ceremonies go to the Cell of the Cardinal that is Elected, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to him the News of his Exaltation; after which they conduct him to the Chapel of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clave; and being there Veſted in his Pontifical Habit, he there receives the Reſpects which the Cardinals are wont to render to the Sovereign High-prieſts: After which, one Cardinal, with one Maſter of the Ceremonies, go to the Houſe of Benediction, and there declare to the people his Exaltation: and thereupon immediately are heard the Acclamations of <hi>Long Live POPE Alexander;</hi> all the Artillery be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcharged, with the Chiming of all the Bells in the City.</p>
            <p>Then the <hi>Pope</hi> being ſet in his Pontifical Chair, is carryed to St. <hi>Peter's</hi> Church, and is there placed upon the Altar of the Apoſtles, whither all the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals go a ſecond time to do him Homage; and from thence his Holineſs is reconducted to his Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, after having given his Benediction to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: and ſome few days after, the Ceremonies of his Exaltation and Coronation are performed in the ſame Church of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> after this manner following.</p>
            <p>Upon the day of his Holineſs's Coronation, all Cardinals, Embaſſadors of Kings, Princes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and

He is preceded by the Cardinals and Embaſſadors; while all the people kneeling, Eccho forth their Acclamations of <hi>Long Live Pope</hi> A. At his coming out of the Sacriſty and his going to the aforeſaid Theatre, is performed the Ceremony of ſetting Fire to Flax, being faſtned to the end of a Stick, and held up as high as his Holineſs's perſon, theſe words being pronounc'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
