            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>SOme conceive (and not without juſt cauſe) that there is a great diviſion in this Kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> divided into two <hi>Parties,</hi> the <hi>Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> and the <hi>Well-affected;</hi> but for my own part, who they be that be <hi>Malignant,</hi> or <hi>well-affected,</hi> I am utterly ignorant; that there be <hi>Malignant,</hi> I doe not much doubt of; but who are, or ought to be the <hi>well-affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> I leave to cenſure: Betwixt theſe two I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent there are halfe as many <hi>Neuters;</hi> men ſe baſely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, and of ſuch timerous natures, that aiming to ſerve God and Mammon, (it being too hard a taske) they reſolve truly to ſerve neither, but write them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the ſervants of the Time: Theſe be they who in times of Action no queſtion will be dangerous, and (as they think) ſecurely miſchievous; becauſe they pronounce a faire and ſubmiſſive friendſhip both to the <hi>right hand and to the left;</hi> &amp; I could wiſh that when they are found out, becauſe we may the better know them again, they may be diſtinguiſhed by ſome queint mark, as a <hi>K.</hi> and a <hi>P.</hi> and the picture of a <hi>Round</hi>-cut head on one ſhoulder, and the forme of a golden Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronet on the other; any thing, ſo it may make a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; that whilſt one party is ſtriking at the Crown, the other may be breaking of the pate: And by this means <hi>John Indifferent</hi> wil be indifferently wel knockt, as (when you ſhall heare their barbarous and inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane plots) you will ſay they are worthy ont; and that it is pity they ſhould live.</p>

               <head>Munday.</head>
               <p>IT was really reported, that laſt Munday was Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, early in the morning, before the valiant <hi>Pren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices</hi> came to exerciſe in the <hi>Artillery-ground</hi> by <hi>Moore-Fields,</hi> that a crew of theſe <hi>Neuters</hi> had planted in the 6. Windmils 6. Peeces of Ordnance charged with white powder, to the end there might be no Report heard from the Peeces, when they intended their monſtrous and bloudy execution, though againſt whom on man can yet directly tell, but being moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with their muzzles towards <hi>Shoreditch,</hi> it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by a very underſtanding man (of a Citizen) that (as ſure as we live) their full intention was to batter down <hi>Bow,</hi> and make pillage of the green Geeſe; and nothing (he ſaid) grieved him ſo much, as that his wife and children would be like to ſuffer in the flock. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Gentleman in ſcarlet (a Soap-boylers man) ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding by, having a little better skill in Military affaires, gave his opinion, that if they had intended ſuch a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, their onely way had been to beat down <hi>Shore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditch,</hi> for after that it was ten to one but <hi>Bow</hi> would yeeld the town up, where they might fortifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt <hi>Black-wall, Limus,</hi> and <hi>Ratcliffe,</hi> &amp; having taken them, they might eaſily purchaſe ſhipping, and with thoſe ſhips take <hi>Greenwich</hi> &amp; the Caſtle. Another Cavalier being next him, with a buffe coat, which he conſtantly wore when he was a brown-baker) gave his opinion that his friend had cenſured weil, and bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out ſufficient judgement, for, ſayes he, (do ye mark me) having taken the Caſtle, they might eaſily ſhoot down Saint <hi>Toolies,</hi> and then it were a thing of nothing to plant Ordnance upon Saint <hi>Mary Overies</hi> Church, againſt the Tower. This Baker for his junhement was

After this they diſcovered themſelves, and as it happened the <hi>Ring-leader</hi> of all this conſpiracie, was a fat ſtradling fellow they cald him Captain <hi>Tripes,</hi> whoſe ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous venture was onely for honour, that he might for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth be ſuddainly advanced from a Serjeant to a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, yet for his good ſervice, he was not abſolutely doomd to perpetuall impriſonment, but confined to live by a priſon all dayes of his life, and to have no mnat alowed him but what he can get by the catch (at which it ſeemes he hath been old dogg at.) Theſe conſpirators thus miraculouſly taken, the 6. Ordnance were diſmounted, and by a dozen choſen ſtrong men carried cloſely back again to Tower wharfe, from whence the night before he brought them. The poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of theſe mens planting Ordnance in the Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mils, was, becauſe their forts ſhould turne according to their Religion, they being <hi>Neuters,</hi> that if there ſhould be any battail betweene <hi>Bow</hi> and <hi>Higate,</hi> they might winde to the ſtronger ſide: but ſince we have by providence eſcaped this great and iminent danger, it ſhall become us to be thankful, make bone-fires, and drinke till with maudlin joy our teares extinguiſh the firebrands.</p>
