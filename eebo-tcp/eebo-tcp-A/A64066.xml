            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

ought, for the direction of his own practice, to examine what may be done with a safe consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and what not. The <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilians</hi> and <hi>Canonists</hi> fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently dispute of the nature of <hi>Vsury,</hi> he knowes not but that any other Laique may doe the like. The Argument was first undertaken for the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the tenderness of the conscience of others, and not to justifie any practice of the Authors, who hath alwaies gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but not taken <hi>Vsury.</hi> This point of <hi>Vsury,</hi> as it is at this day controverted, is a meer po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish question; first broached by the <hi>Schoolemen</hi> and <hi>Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:99137:17"/>
no antient Father or wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that I know of ever defined or disputed it. Since the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formaton <hi>Melancthon</hi> and <hi>Chemnitius</hi> are the only noted men abroad, and here at home Dr. <hi>Downam</hi> now Bishop of <hi>London-derry</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> Dr. <hi>Fenton,</hi> and learned Dr. <hi>Andrewes</hi> late Bishop of <hi>Winchester.</hi> I have made choice of Dr <hi>Fentons</hi> Treatise to examine, because it is the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test, and I find little of any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment but is in him. I desire his book may be first throughly read, for otherwise, what I write will not so easily be understood. To give some brief accompt to
<pb facs="tcp:99137:17"/>
the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eader of the substance of the scattered arguments in this Tractate, he must know; That my scope and intention is to shew that <hi>Vsury</hi> is no where in Scripture forbidden to Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: but that it is as lawfull as any other contract or bargain, unless the lawes of the Land do prohibit or moderate it as a point of state or policy. And that no State or Commonwealth can or ever did stand without it, or that which in contracts is equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent to it, since the valuation of the use of money is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation and rule which govern the valuation of all other sorts of bargains. I further maintain,
<pb facs="tcp:99137:18"/>
that <hi>Vsury</hi> was never forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to the <hi>Iewes;</hi> only by (rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that by a more speciall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of God they dwelt in a land in the midst of many strangers) <hi>Moses</hi> made a poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique Iudiciall law, that the Iewes should take <hi>Vsury</hi> of those strangers, and not of their poor brothers: not much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like as if the King should or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain in <hi>London,</hi> That Citisens should take <hi>Vsury</hi> of men of <hi>Midlesex,</hi> and not of poor tradesmen of the City. More particularly, I undertake to manifest, that the Definitions of <hi>Vsury</hi> (wherein Dr. <hi>Down.</hi> and Dr. <hi>Fenton</hi> mainly differ
<pb facs="tcp:99137:18"/>
between themse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ves) are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther warrantable by the rules of art, nor justifiable by any proof or ground in Scripture, or by any testimony of antiquity either in Councils or Fathers. And that the lawes given by God about <hi>Vsury</hi> are such as by the Coherence of the Texts, and the Conference of other places, do shew that those lawes did only intend a prohibition of taking <hi>Vsury</hi> of such as bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed in case of extreme neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, and were so poor that they were in Charity to be relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. And yet those lawes which did in such case only prohibit <hi>Vsury</hi> to the <hi>Iewes,</hi> were not
<pb facs="tcp:99137:19"/>
moral or perpetual, but Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall and temporary, and no way bind us, but we are left to the lawes and customes of the Kingdome to guide us in our Contracts so long as they bee not contrary to the rules of Charity. I shew that all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of <hi>Letting</hi> do agree to money. And that <hi>Vsury</hi> in it self is neither <hi>unnaturall, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, unjust,</hi> or <hi>uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi> Lastly, I do shew that Dr. <hi>Downam,</hi> Dr. <hi>Fenton,</hi> and all others that do most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn <hi>Vsury,</hi> are forced to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess at last that <hi>Vsury</hi> may be lawfull; they all allow the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Interest, Mortgages,
<pb facs="tcp:99137:19"/>
Annuities and Leases for yeares, all which by their own expositions and confessions are of the same nature with <hi>Vsury,</hi> and doe only differ in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the security or contract: after they have eagerly dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that all Contracts for gain by lending are <hi>Vsurious,</hi> at the end they quietly conclude, that the Contracts are not <hi>U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury,</hi> but onely the secret inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the heart makes it to be <hi>Vsury</hi> or not <hi>Vsury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus in few words they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow at last the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their own doctrine, and play fast and loose by a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude

of their irresolute distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, so that either their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion must be that <hi>Vsury</hi> is lawfull, or els they can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude nothing at all.</p>
            <p>If I wrong either Dr. <hi>Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> or the truth, I desire friendly to be shewed my error. I do not follow him here <hi>Line by Line,</hi> for so I might tire my self, and vex others with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary tautologies: I have onely endeavoured to extract the <hi>quintessence</hi> of his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and to apply my self to the examinatiom of them. His Reasons not his Rhetorique I except against, whether <hi>Justly or Vnjustly</hi> let others judge
<pb facs="tcp:99137:20"/>
to whose Censure I submit these Papers.</p>
            <p>I would fain know of the Ministers of the Gospell who do often reckon up in the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit <hi>Vsury</hi> as one of the Crying sins, what warrant they have in the Gospell for such bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: we find severall sinnes numbred up by our Saviour and the Apostles, but <hi>Vsury</hi> never so much as named for a sin in the whole New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the fift to the <hi>Galathians,</hi> doth with one breath reckon up together se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteen sins which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves, &amp; yet <hi>Vsury</hi> is none of them. But many preachers can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb facs="tcp:99137:21"/>
not Reckon up seven deadly sins except they make <hi>Vsury</hi> one of them.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Let pass his Chapter of names of <hi>Vsury,</hi> because he Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth that by them he hath proved <hi>litle or nothing at all. Page</hi> 12.</p>
               <p>The main point is the Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which he saith must not bee
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:99137:22"/>
                  <hi>omitted, or slightly passed</hi> over, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is a great <hi>and necessary question to resolve the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what that Vsury</hi> is, whereof we dispute, <hi>pag.</hi> 13. And therefore hee doth intitle his first book wholy about the Definition of <hi>Vsury</hi>: although when he comes unto the point, he doth nothing less than define it; As may thus appear. <hi>Actuall Vsury</hi> (saith he) <hi>pag.</hi> 15. is of divers <hi>diversly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, a variety tedious to relate.</hi> First, in stead of all unlawfull U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury, he speakes of a description of part only, to wit of <hi>actuall usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>; whereas he should first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine, and then divide: but inver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Rule of method, he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers <hi>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ntall usury</hi> (which hee saith is a sin) to escape out of his description.</p>
               <p>Neither doth hee so much as describe <hi>actuall usury,</hi> onely hee
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:99137:22"/>
tells us of diversity of descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of others, but never lets us know which he approves. Yet at last hee <hi>contracts</hi> the pith in three words, but resolves not how wee should place them; so leaves us to a thus, or thus, or thus. First, hee puts <hi>Lucre</hi> in the place of the <hi>Genus,</hi> and <hi>Covenant</hi> in the room of a difference. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, he makes <hi>Covenant</hi> the <hi>Genus,</hi> and <hi>Lending</hi> the difference; and lastly he puts <hi>Lending</hi> for a <hi>Genus,</hi> and <hi>Lucre</hi> for difference. Thus by turning the <hi>Genus</hi> into th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> difference, and the difference into the <hi>Genus,</hi> he leaves us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain of his description, yet concludes that within the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass of three words we may finde Vsury</hi>; but who knowes not that three words diversly placed breed many times different, and some times contrary sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:99137:23"/>
Yet this is all the definition you are like to find in him. And thus in few lines he passeth over <hi>sleightly that necessary question</hi> which should resolve our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing <hi>what Vsury is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But let us draw a little closer, and examine the pith of these three descriptions cited by Dr. <hi>Fenton,</hi> and contracted in three words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pactum ex mutuo Lucrum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Usury is

                        <hi>Lucre for Lone upon Covenant,</hi> or</item>

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Whereas he saith <hi>Vsury</hi> is <hi>Lucre,</hi> he seems to make <hi>Lucre</hi> or Gain to be the <hi>Genus</hi> of <hi>Vsury.</hi> This undoubtedly is a false <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>; For certainly <hi>Vsury</hi> is a sin of Commission, and therefore an
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:99137:23"/>
                  <hi>action</hi> or <hi>operation</hi>; so that <hi>Lucre,</hi> or gain which is onely a <hi>passion</hi> or <hi>product</hi> of Lending, cannot be the <hi>Genus</hi> of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2 He maketh <hi>Covenant</hi> to be the <hi>Genus</hi>: Let me ask him but this question; A Father to stir up on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and trie the industry of his Son, doth lend him an hundred pound with a <hi>peirastical</hi> covenant for <hi>Gain,</hi> not intending with himself to take any interest at all of his Son; Doth any man take this to bee <hi>Vsury</hi> in the Father, who never meant to take the least encrease from his Son? Surely then the bare Covenant cannot be the sin of <hi>Vsury</hi> in this case.</p>
               <p n="3">3 He saith, <hi>Vsury is lending up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Covenant for Lucre.</hi> In this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription, as also in the two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, I find a manifest contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his own Principles and Grounds. <hi>To lend for gain is no
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:99137:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
lending at all; for Lending</hi> (saith he, <hi>pag.</hi> 16.) <hi>in its own proper na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is free; Letting is for hire or gain.</hi> So that by this his Doctrine, <hi>Lending</hi> for gain is no lending at all, but letting or hiring out. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if Dr. <hi>Fenton</hi> had been true to his own principles, he should have defined <hi>Vsury</hi> to have been <hi>Letting upon Covenant for Lucre</hi>; or in brief, Letting or hiring of Money. But both Dr. <hi>Fenton,</hi> and all other <hi>Antidaenists</hi> cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to have <hi>Vsury</hi> called Letting or hiring of money.</p>
               <p>Moreover, I find in these three descriptions, that he imagineth the Gain or Lucre is for the <hi>bare act of Lending</hi>; In which hee is much mistaken: It is not for the lending, but for the <hi>using</hi> of the thing lent that men give <hi>Vsury</hi>: and answerable to the time for which Money is let, the increase
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:99137:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
or <hi>Vsury</hi> is more or less, although the simple act of Lending be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like in both. The ordinary word <hi>Vsury</hi> (which Dr. <hi>Fenton</hi> derives from <hi>usus rei,</hi> the use of the thing) teacheth, even children, that <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury</hi> is given for the Use of the thing, and not for the bare Lend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>Again, in these his three de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions the word <hi>Covenant</hi> is perpetually found; without any warrant of Scripture: Yet hee pretends by <hi>deduction</hi> to fetch it out of the Text in <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.25. <hi>Thou shalt not be as an Vsurer unto him, thou shalt not oppress with V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury.</hi> In the Original it is, <hi>Thou shalt not exact,</hi> and, <hi>thou shalt not impose Vsury.</hi> From whence Dr. <hi>Fenton</hi> concludes, that there can be no exaction or imposition up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a free person, but by way of <hi>Covenant. pag.</hi> 26. Under favour,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:99137:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
this his inference is false; for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action may be of things neither covenanted for, nor due. In the construction of our Common Law, and of our vulgar phrase, <hi>Extortion</hi> and <hi>Exaction</hi> are thus distinguished, <hi>Extortion</hi> is a wrong in taking more than is due, <hi>Exaction</hi> is the taking of that which is <hi>not due at all</hi>: Which distinction were false, if that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action must be by precedent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract. The poor Jews did ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily borrow victuals, money, and other necessaries upon Pawns, as may appear by many Texts. The Lender, who did take the pledge as a caution for his Principall, might detain it from the poor Borower untill hee would allow some gain above the Principal, and by such unjust means <hi>exact</hi> or <hi>impose</hi> an unconscionable increase without any precedent Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:99137:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>There is small reason to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that such indigent people (as are described by <hi>Moses</hi>) who borrowed onely to supply a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent want, should have credit sufficient to take up so large a sum for so long a time as might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve an Obligation or Covenant for the payment of encrease. A man who could not have his Bond taken, might yet have his Garment received for a Pledge; and Pledges were ordinarily gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with intention of speedy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, because raiment is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most as necessary as food. The borrowing in this kind being of things of so small value (that the use of them for a small season was hardly valuable) might be a great reason of the prohibition of <hi>Vsury</hi> by <hi>Moses</hi> in such cases. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is a man that lends upon Pawns in the like hazard vvith
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:99137:26"/>
him that takes Bonds, or such se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie.</p>
               <p>It is the confession of Dr. <hi>Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> that <hi>When the Law against V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury was given, there was none that borrowed but only the poor for need, and upon necessity.</hi> Therefore, without better warrant by direct and literal proof from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it cannot be evinced that this word (<hi>Covenant</hi>) must neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily be required in the definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or description of Usury, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Dr. <hi>Fenton</hi> conclude, <hi>it is no Vsury except it be by Covenant,</hi> or by some dumb Contract at the least.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Downam</hi> omits this word Covenant in his definition of <hi>Vsury.</hi> I am strongly perswaded by a place in <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> to think that <hi>Vsury</hi> doth not consist in <hi>contracting</hi> for gain. I find in the sixt Chapter, a grievous oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:99137:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
described; <hi>A great cry of the people against their Brethren the Iews, they were forced to take up Corn for themselves, their sons and daughters, upon mortgage of their lands, vineyards, and houses, they sold their children for bond-slaves.</hi> These were men opprest by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts, and were to pay twelve in the hundred, as appeareth by the eleventh verse. And yet for all this, there are such passages and circumstances of the text as move me to think that this Oppression was not properly Usury.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>Nehemiah</hi> never calls it <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury,</hi> but only a <hi>Burthen</hi>; neither the word <hi>Neshec,</hi> nor <hi>Tarbith,</hi> nor <hi>Marbith</hi> is to bee found in this Chapter, and yet these are the only words in the Law to express <hi>Vsury.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hemiah</hi> never tels the Nobles and the Rulers, that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:99137:27"/>
they had broken the Law against Usury. Any man would think, that to rebuke and reclaim men from their sin, the way had been to have named it in particular, or the Law by which it was prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: but <hi>Nehemiah</hi> doth neither of these, he only tels them, <hi>it was not good what they did,</hi> and askes them <hi>if they ought not to walk in the fear of their God because of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the heathen their enemie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi>; not because of a particular Law against <hi>Vsury,</hi> but for that the name of God should not be blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed by the heathens, when they saw how miserably the Jews did oppress one another.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Nehemiah</hi> tels the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, <hi>that he and his servants might have exacted as well as the other No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles:</hi> Whereas if this exacting had been <hi>Vsury,</hi> he could not just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly say, that <hi>he might have exacted,</hi>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:99137:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for it had been against the Law.</p>
               <p>Lastly, <hi>Nehemiah</hi> doth not threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to punish them as he was a Magistrate, but entreateth them by his <hi>charitable</hi> example to leave off their exacting that <hi>Burthen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So then <hi>Nehemiah</hi> never naming <hi>Vsury,</hi> nor mentioning the Law against it, but supposing the act of the Nobles to be lawfull, but not expedient, doth encline my belief to think, that this Oppression was not properly <hi>Vsury,</hi> although it had a Covenant for gain.</p>
               <p>And one reason why this was not <hi>Vsury</hi> might be, because the people were not primarily such poor necessitated brethren as are described in the first Lawes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Vsury</hi>: For though these fell into want, yet at the first they had <hi>lands, houses, vineyards,</hi> and <hi>olive-grounds,</hi> for which they were to pay unto the King a yearly Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:99137:28"/>Another reason that avails with me to perswade that all contracts for gain are not prohited as <hi>usuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> is the testimony of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.23. who mentions a Bank of <hi>Vsury</hi> in the Jewish Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, out of which a man by delivering in his mony, might at length receive his own with <hi>Vsury.</hi> Although our Saviour do neither shew dislike nor appro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bation of such a Bank, yet for it to bee within any City of the Commonwealth of <hi>Israel,</hi> without the ordinance, or at least allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Prince or Magistrate, is a thing most improbable. And almost as unlikely that the State should tolerate such a Bank if all <hi>Vsury</hi> were of it self unlawfull, and also so pernicious to the Commonwealth by the oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it as Dr. <hi>Fenton</hi> pretends.</p>
               <p>I find many reproofs in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:99137:28"/>
of the false glosses and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations of the Scribes and Pharisees, whereby they perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Law in many things; but I find not any rebuke of the Magistrates for this of <hi>Vsury,</hi> if it had been such a publique vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Law, it could not have been forgotten by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Christ and all his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles.</p>
               <p>But to what purpose is it to dispute about the terms of the description of <hi>Vsury</hi>? or what sort of Contract it is? when it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears plainly in Dr. <hi>Fenton,</hi> that not onely the Covenant of lend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but also (in his opinion) <hi>buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, selling, letting, exchanging,</hi> and the rest, may be all Contracts of <hi>Vsury.</hi> To give an instance, these are his words, <hi>pag.</hi> 21. <hi>With a hundred pound I purchase an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity of twenty pound</hi> per annum
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:99137:29"/>
                  <hi>for ten years: This is Bargain and Sale, differing in the manner of the Covenant, yet is it the same thing in truth with Vsury.</hi> And so in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place (<hi>pag.</hi> 129.) he saith the like. I must say this is an express contradiction, to affirm that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chasing is <hi>buying, and another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Covenant differing from Len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</hi> and yet to say <hi>in truth it is the same with Vsury,</hi> which he saith is <hi>Lending,</hi> this is to make buying and lending all one, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found all Contracts.</p>
               <p>As the term of <hi>Covenant</hi> is not to be found within the Texts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Vsury,</hi> so in the Fathers of the Church there is no mention of it; they abuse us therefore, who pretend the consent of the Primitive Church for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning of all <hi>Contracts</hi> of gain for the use of money. The truth is, the <hi>Canonists</hi> and <hi>School-men</hi>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:99137:29"/>
were the first broachers of these descriptions of <hi>Vsury</hi> which are now pressed upon us by some few Modern Divines. Antiquity was more modest and observant of the phrase of <hi>Scripture,</hi> which doth deliver the Laws against <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury</hi> in such restrained terms as are by a just construction applia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble properly to the Rules of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Equity, for the relief of the poor onely.</p>
               <p>From the Canon-Lawyers (who are the Popes learned Counsell in the Law) hath Dr. <hi>Fenton</hi> borrowed not only his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions, but also his arguments and distinctions at the second or third hand: For he takes all from Dr. <hi>Downam,</hi> Dr. <hi>Downam</hi> from <hi>Melancthon</hi> and <hi>Chemnitius,</hi> and these two fetch it from <hi>Canonists, Casuists,</hi> and <hi>School-men.</hi> And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Dr. <hi>Fenton</hi> bee free from
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:99137:30"/>
the sin of <hi>Vsury</hi> by borrowing freely his whole Treatise from Dr. <hi>Downam</hi> without paying the interest of one new Argument or Reason: Yet if Dr. <hi>Fenton</hi> did not Contract with Dr. <hi>Downam</hi> for the borrowing of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, he is little less than a Plagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, and if we take this word in as large signification as they doe the word <hi>Vsury,</hi> it will follow, that though Dr. <hi>Fenton</hi> bee not guilty of paying Usury, yet he hath offended against another Law in <hi>Exod.</hi> 21.16. <hi>Deut.</hi> 24.7. which is the greater sin; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Law of God appoints no punishment for an <hi>Vsurer,</hi> yet a <hi>Plagiary</hi> was to be punished by death.</p>

               <p>I should have proceeded now to examine the properties of <hi>len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:99137:30"/>
and <hi>letting,</hi> and how they differ; but because I find menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them in severall places of my Authour, I will reserve them a while, and first handle the texts of <hi>Scripture</hi> that are most mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall in this controversie.</p>
               <p>Three texts onely are to bee found in the law of <hi>Moses</hi> about <hi>Vsury.</hi> In the two first the poor is most expresly named, and in the third necessarily implied. <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.25. <hi>If thou lend to my people the poor with thee, thou shalt not be as an Vsurer unto him. Thou shalt not oppress with Vsury,</hi> Levit. 25.35. <hi>If thy brother bee impoverished or fallen into decay with thee, thou shalt relieve him — take thou no Vsury of him or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease — thou shalt not give him thy money upon Vsury, nor lend him thy victualls for increase.</hi> By these two texts we have an exact
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:99137:31"/>

The third text though it doth not expresly name the poor; yet that it hath reference onely to such is most probable. First, because as in the former text in <hi>Levit.</hi> where the poor are described, and one of their properties mentioned to be borrowing of <hi>Victuall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Secondly, the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:99137:31"/>
law here doth only use the word of <hi>biting</hi> or <hi>Nescher,</hi> which word is also only used in the first text, where the poor is named. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if we will allow (as all men do, and as we needs must) this law in <hi>Deut.</hi> to be the same with that in <hi>Exod.</hi> &amp; <hi>Levit.</hi> then it must have the same <hi>object</hi> the poor, and the same <hi>end,</hi> which is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the same poor, for we find no other reason or end alleged in Scripture for the prohibition of <hi>Vsury,</hi> but that the <hi>poor brother may live with thee and have suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for his need.</hi> God where he tyes men to lend, he provides &amp; binds them to lend freely.

sufficient for his need in which hee wanteth. Deut.</hi> 15.7, 8. For the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of this law God was carefull that this lending should be without <hi>Vsury</hi>: Hee makes no law to bind men to lend unto the Rich, and therefore there is no law to restrain taking <hi>Vsury</hi> of them: The lending to the poor was to be so free that it must bee in the next degree to giving, and wee finde that to this law that commanded <hi>Lending,</hi> is added in the very next ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:99137:32"/>
Therefore he that shall make the Rich also the object of this law in <hi>Deut.</hi> he must of necessity invent some new <hi>End</hi> and <hi>Reason</hi> of it more than the Scripture doth afford, and also make the lawes themselves to differ; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as a true reason why the law in <hi>Deut.</hi> is in so short termes, may be, for that the law having been twice before more particularly set down, <hi>Moses</hi> doth in <hi>Deut.</hi> onely repeat it in brief and few words, as being sufficient to call it to their remembrance, now they were ready to enter into the land of promise. If wee consider also the unmercifulness of the Jewes amongst themselves, it was high time to make provision for the poor, they would not stick it seemes to strip a poor man stark naked for a debt, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares by the law concerning the

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:99137:34"/>
first expresly named the poor, and described them, and in the third cleerly intimated them, By what Reason, Conscience, and Charity, can any man extend those lawes to all men in general, which the Holy Ghost hath so carefully restrained to the poor? And since the Law first given a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Vsury</hi> doth mention op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of the poor, I wonder <hi>Dr <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And for this cause I doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture <hi>Calvin</hi> did say, <hi>that unto <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:99137:34"/>
of Scripture that all Vsury is altogether condemned,</hi> and it is conceived that one reason why the law of <hi>Moses</hi> doth appoint no kind of <hi>Iudiciall</hi> punishment for <hi>Vsury,</hi> might be, because the sinne is determinable only by the judgement of a mans own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science and not by any precedent contract for gain.</p>
               <p>As for those texts in the <hi>Psalms, Proverbs,</hi> and <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral words cannot make any new law, but their rebukes and exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations relate to the breach or observance of the law formerly given by <hi>Moses</hi>: And even <hi>Ezekiel</hi> who most declames against <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury, Eze.</hi> 18.17. joines it with making the poor <hi>Sorrowfull, not giving bread to the hungry, and not Cloathing the naked.</hi> Nor can these texts be any exposition of the lawes of <hi>Moses</hi> against <hi>Vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:99137:35"/>
because the lawes themselves are expressed and explaned in more particular significant terms by <hi>Moses</hi> than by <hi>David, Solomon,</hi> or <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> who give but a touch.</p>

               <p>I know the adversaries to all <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury</hi> do much triumph in their Origination of the Hebrew term for <hi>Vsury</hi>; because it is derived from a root that signifies to bite, they conclude it is like the sting of a Serpent, and in that regard to be esteemed as an abominable sin. <hi>Answ</hi>: First wee must remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that <hi>Dr. Fenton</hi> doth confesse that <hi>names have be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uality in <hi>Vsury,</hi> and I conceive
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:99137:35"/>
a true reason of it might be, for that the first kind of borrowing which was in the world, or at the time when the law against <hi>Vsury</hi> was given, was in Case only of necessity, and to ask an overplus in such Cases was a sin that well deserved the worst name. We all know that Riches of mony and many other goods were brought into the world by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, as arts &amp; trades were mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied by the industrie and wit of man. Stately buildings, rich furniture, gorgeous apparell, and dainty feasts were not prepared against the Creation of Adam; It was a long time before so much silver was digged up and Coined as would fill mens Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers that they might spare or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy large sums by the negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and traffique of others; men first looked after things
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:99137:36"/>
necessary only, and the want of such things taught them to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of one another.</p>
               <p>Also when the law was given, the <hi>People of God</hi> (saith <hi>D. Fenton p.</hi> 10.) <hi>were travelling in the desert, and afterwards being troubled with wars in the Land of</hi> Canaan, <hi>there was little borrowing of mony, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the Poor for the Supply of their want, and of them to take Vsury was more sensible biting, &amp; oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, in that they borrowed not to lay out for Commodities, but to spen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> for necessity. Therefore</hi> David <hi>in his troublesome dayes used the word Neshee only for Vsury, as best filting those times where the poorest w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>re most bitten by this sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In these passages of <hi>Dr. Fenton,</hi> we may note, what manner of borrowing Caused the first name of <hi>Vsury,</hi> which name afterwards for the similitude only of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:99137:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>
might be applied to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sorts of borrowing, although they were not of the same un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable nature. The like ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of a good name used for a bad thing <hi>Dr. Fenton</hi> produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth in the Latin name of <hi>Vsury.</hi> Usura (saith he) <hi>was originally a a good honest word untill Vsury did marre it. For</hi> Usura <hi>intruth is nothing but</hi> usus rei, <hi>primitively taken for the use of other things as well as money.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In Conclusion, although the uncharitable gain that was practised upon necessitated bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowers did justly deserve a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitting name of <hi>biting,</hi> yet a gain that is taken from such as bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row where necessity constrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not, is but an <hi>equivocal bite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> Because properly there can bee no biting but where there is <hi>oppression,</hi> and oppression is
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:99137:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>
onely of the poor. A man may deceive a Rich man, but oppress him he Cannot, the reason is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, <hi>oppression is a Violent acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Injustice,</hi> necessity compels a poor man to borrow, and the lender forceth him to pay an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, in this is a violence which a rich man cannot be subject un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, because no necessity forcing him to borrow, it is not necessary but arbitrary whether he will borrow upon encrease: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there be a morall necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that if he will borrow he must pay an overplus, yet that he must borrow is not absolutely neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary: so then it is the necessity of the borrower that must concur to make a violent action in the lender.</p>
               <p>If a rich man be forced to pay the whole forfeiture of a bond, it was his own folly to enter into
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:99137:37"/>
such an obligation without neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, whereby he doth enable the lender to deceive him by a legall meanes, who in extremity makes benefit of all that which the law did provide only for a caution of his indemnity: This deceit of the lender is injustice, but it is not the violent sin of oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which is properly found in <hi>Biting Vsury.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A second word there is found in Scripture which they say is an <hi>Exegeticall</hi> addition, which signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth <hi>any increase at all.</hi> If what were said were true, it neither hurts nor helps the question if the text be understood of the poor only, for although all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease from the poor, yet what is that to the taking <hi>Vsury</hi> of the Rich? But let us see a little how they strain this word [<hi>tarbith</hi>] for <hi>increase,</hi> first if <hi>tarbith</hi> do sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie

all, they neither name mony nor <hi>victualls</hi>; I can find them but once applied in the whole Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and that is by <hi>Moses</hi> in <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit.</hi> 25.36, there <hi>Dr. Fenton</hi> might have found them both named together, and then applied, <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shee</hi> to mony, and <hi>tarbith</hi> to <hi>victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

tarbith</hi> is never used alone, but is joined with <hi>Neshec</hi> in <hi>Levit. Prov.</hi> and <hi>Ezek</hi>: so then the first is used in all texts, the latter but in some. Now the question is, whether a particular word which is alwaies used shall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound a generall which is used but sometimes; or on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry as <hi>Dr. Fenton</hi> thinks, for he tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth us, <hi>p.</hi> 39. it is the manner of <hi>Scripture after a law is given and a sin forbidden in a sensible term, by the addition of a more generall to express Gods meaning more fully, lest men should seek liberty in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straining the former termes more narrowly</hi>; thus he, but what sense is there in his words <hi>to express a sensible by a generall</hi>? he should have said <hi>a particular</hi> by a <hi>general,</hi> or a <hi>sensible</hi> by an <hi>insensible,</hi> and then his error would have been more sensible; for I trust it is the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:99137:40"/>
nature of things sensible to <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press</hi> things insensible, and of <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars</hi> to expound <hi>generalls,</hi> as may manifestly appear by the instance alleged by <hi>Dr. Fenton,</hi> and which makes somewhat strongly against himself. <hi>Theft</hi> saith he <hi>is set down in the Sensible term of stealing, the Holy Ghost <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h dealing falsely or Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting, teaching thereby over-rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching in bargaining by Cunning to be theft.</hi> Here I ask if <hi>Stealing</hi> be a sensible term, whether <hi>dealing falsely or circumventing by cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> be a <hi>Generall,</hi> surely <hi>Dr. Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> must not say it, for deceit in contracts is but a particular kind of theft or stealing, and therefore not a more but a less generall term then <hi>stealing</hi>: so that quite contrary to <hi>Dr. Fenton</hi> his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine the generall sin of stealing is explained and expressed by
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:99137:41"/>
the particular sin of deceit in dealing, therefore it is more reasonable that the particular term <hi>of biteing</hi> should expound the meaning of the generall word <hi>encrease,</hi> since nothing is more usuall then when a matter hath been particularly expressed, to mention it afterwards in more generall term.</p>
               <p>Besides this shift of expressing the <hi>Sensible</hi> by the more generall term, is to imagine the wisdom of God <hi>subject</hi> to humane infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, as if God had not been able to perfect his law <hi>till the cavills of men, and their Seeking liberty to restrain the termes</hi> taught him how to mend it. No doubt if the law of God had intended the prohibition of all increase, it could have done it in plain and short termes (as it doth in <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Theft,</hi> &amp; <hi>Adultery</hi>) by saying
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:99137:41"/>
thou shalt take <hi>no increase by len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding or letting mony,</hi> but instead of increase the law saith <hi>biling or oppressing of the poor</hi>; if Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and <hi>Vsury</hi> were prohibited &amp; permitted alike, why doth not the Commandement say <hi>thou shalt not murther thy poor brother but a stranger thou maiest murth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r</hi>? Surely God doth not use these qualifications for nought. It is demanded by <hi>Dr. Fenton</hi> upon the law <hi>thou shalt not trouble any widow or fatherless Child,</hi> whether it follow that I may trouble a married woman or a child that hath a father? <hi>Ans.</hi> I may not. But yet the reason is not for that I am prohibited by this speciall law for Widowes and Orphans, but for that by a generall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of <hi>not stealing</hi> I am forbidden to oppress or trouble any man: The like may be said of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:99137:42"/>
the words of <hi>Solomon, thou shalt not rob the poor,</hi> yet I may not rob the rich: though these words forbid me not, but because of the former general Commandement. But the like cannot he said of <hi>Vsury,</hi> there being no former generall law that forbids taking <hi>increase of the rich.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Dr. Fenton</hi> saith that <hi>Vsury</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> bites the rich as well as the poor, and doth promise to prove it, but it seemes he forgot it, I am in doubt he is never able to doe it. Indeed he would perswade us that to lend to the Rich is to enable him to oppress the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth and so consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the poor: But he doth not shew how the Common-wealth can be wronged by <hi>Vsury,</hi> and yet no particular person be first op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed; sure I am the text speaks not of oppressing the Common-wealth,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:99137:42"/>
but expresly names par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly thy poor brother to whom thou lendest that he be not oppressed. So that the law points at an apparent and sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble person whom <hi>Vsury</hi> bites.</p>
               <p>But <hi>D. Fenton</hi> comes and tells us <hi>p.</hi> 36. <hi>Alas good simple widowes! can they tell when, or whom, or how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny their Vsury doth bite? nay can the wisest Vsurer of them all tell</hi>? Thus <hi>Dr. Fenton</hi> because he sees that in some cases he cannot shew how any particular person is oppressed by <hi>Vsury,</hi> therefore he flies for Sanctuary to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, to hide himself in the croud, whilest he must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess he cannot tell who is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, but yet the Common-wealth or some body in it (God knowes who) is oppressed.</p>
               <p>But let us see how he knowes in general that the Common-wealth
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:99137:43"/>
is oppressed by <hi>Vsury,</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth he saith, it maks <hi>things dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer &amp; enhaunces</hi> the prices of the <hi>Mercat. p.</hi> 36. <hi>Ans.</hi> the dearness of things is caused either by the scarcity of the things themselves, or by the plenty of mony. As for the scarcity of Commodities it cannot be caused by <hi>Vsury,</hi> for it neither eats up corn nor cattle, nor weares out apparell, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyes the native commoditie of any Country. But Contrarily merchants and others (who by <hi>Vsury</hi> are enabled to trade) do export such things as are cheaper and plentifuller here than in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Countries, that so they may gain <hi>there</hi>: and doe bring back such things as are dearest and of most necessity at home, that so also they may gain <hi>here.</hi> So that <hi>Vsury</hi> doth not only not cause a scarcity; but it is the meanes of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:99137:43"/>
plenty in a kingdome, for as it Consumes not that we have, so it procures us that we want. As for dearness by reason of plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of mony, it is no misery but the happiness of any Realm to know such a dearth: those places are not the Richest where things are cheapest, for then <hi>Scotland</hi> would excell <hi>England,</hi> but it is the want of mony which makes things cheap in such Countries: Nor let any man thinke that if <hi>Vsury</hi> were not, things would be one whit cheaper, for by <hi>Dr. Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi> confession, <hi>p.</hi> 38. if <hi>Vsury were not, men would tenter their witts either in trading themselves or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying others,</hi> so that the same gain would be raised an other way; for in the point of <hi>Vsury</hi> the question is not whether gaines may be made of mony, but who shall have the gaines.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:99137:44"/>As for raising the mercat it is not caused by <hi>Vsury,</hi> the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and Rulers of the Rates and prices of all things are the owners of mony and the masters of stocks, for the <hi>Lenders</hi> rule the <hi>Borrowers,</hi> and the richer govern the meaner, The monyed men proportion the valuation of goods, &amp; by practice &amp; custome agree in a common gain to bee raised by the Contracts of bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaining, selling, letting and the like. For instance, the masters of mony of this kingdome by their trading raise so much gaines as ordinarily amounts to 20. or 30. in the 100 at the yeares end; which being considered by the meaner sort of people, they rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon with themselves, that if they can borrow at 10 in the hundred that then by such trading their gaines may both pay the use and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:99137:44"/>
leave them 20. or 10 l. gainers: so that the borrowers do trade by buying &amp; selling in the mercat at the same prices that the ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of mony do, &amp; it is the rates of the mercat that rules their u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, and not their <hi>Vsury</hi> the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat: The difference is onely that the owners prove the greater gainers and grow richer than the borrowers who keep but part of their gettings, because that their stocks are not their own: And questionless the Common esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of men would not valew at 8. or 10 in the 100 if it did not ordinarily produce a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent increase both for borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and lender. If any man object that the prime gain which comes by buying and selling, and leads the rate of <hi>Vsury,</hi> is too great, I know no other answer but this, if Common Custome may not
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:99137:45"/>
determine reasonable gaines, I know not how it will be resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, since there is no rule in Scripture for it: but that men may grow rich by gain I find both practised and warranted by <hi>Scripture,</hi> neither are men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained from gaining more by trade than is simply necessary for life and being.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Dr. Fenton</hi> and those that condemn all <hi>Vsury</hi> had been so observant of the letter or literall sense of the Law as they do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, they would never have troubled themselves so much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Contracts which are not named in the Law: but would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have Concluded that the very <hi>taking of Vsury or increase</hi> (though it be not contracted for) is utterly <hi>unlawfull</hi> by the law in <hi>Levit.</hi> 25.36. where it is said, <hi>Take thou no Vsury of him.</hi> How then

For my part I do glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hear all exhortations to <hi>Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and think them more than needfull; and if any man be so great an <hi>Vsurer</hi> as that he make himself thereby unable to be mercifull to the poor, such a man may be justly condemned, and I shall never defend him: But to conclude, because a man must give to the poor, therefore he may not let to the rich, is no good consequence. The text <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But let us admit that both in the Old and New testament the lawes against <hi>Vsury</hi> had been <hi>Morall</hi> and delivered in as gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall termes as can be devised: Be there not many lawes and texts which must of necessity be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded otherwise than the bare letter sounds, and according to such a sense as may stand with naturall reason, so that it contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict not any other plain or neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary doctrine, nor overthrow the <hi>

If the allowing of <hi>Vsury</hi> to strangers be no Law at all but onely an Exception or <hi>proviso</hi> annexed to a former law, then it can be no Judiciall; all lawes do Command or Forbid something, but this if it be an exception doth neither, because it leaves the thing indifferent as it is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of all such provisoes in sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes. But if they will have it to be a Law, then it must bind af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmatively, and not only that one <hi>May,</hi> but that one <hi>Must</hi> take <hi>Vsury</hi> of a stranger, for in the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall it is <hi>thou shalt lend upon Vsury or shalt cause to bite</hi>; And

We allow those things only which we suppose to be good, or at least indifferent: But we permit only such things as are esteemed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill.

(saith the law) <hi>her first husband may not take her again.

And if it be a Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand, we must needs understand it as <hi>an order only how and after what manner the divorce should be,</hi> to wit <hi>by bill in writing:</hi> but not as an order that did Command men simply to be divorced. It is very little less than blasphemy to say that <hi>Moses</hi> law should allow any

thing that was evill. It is the power of the lawgiver to make both the <hi>Rule</hi> &amp; the <hi>Exception</hi> to it. It is an over-bould speech of <hi>Dr. Fenton</hi> to say, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing <hi>Moses law</hi> had given liberty to the Jews to take <hi>Vsury</hi> of strangers, yet it was a sin to do it, and that they <hi>Could not be absolved in the Court of Conscience,</hi> although they might be <hi>absolved in the externall Court,</hi> pag. 45.</p>
               <p>Whereas Dr. <hi>Fenton</hi> doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that a <hi>Reason</hi> that moved God to permit this sin of <hi>Vsury</hi> to strangers, was to <hi>prevent the greater oppression of his own Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> and that the <hi>hardness of the Iewish hearts</hi> was such <hi>that if they might not have taken Vsury of Strangers they would have made a Prey of their own Brethren.</hi> ib. <hi>Ans</hi>: How much doth this derogate from the lawes of God? as if they

were not able to bridle one sin but by the toleration of some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and if the hardness of mens hearts must be born with, since mens hearts are as much harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in other sins as in <hi>Vsury,</hi> why are not some other sins tolerated as well as <hi>Vsury</hi>? surely the <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi> of the Jews was as great as their <hi>Vsury,</hi> &amp; <hi>their hearts went a whoring after strange Gods,</hi> yet <hi>Dr F.</hi> cannot shew that any <hi>Idolatry</hi> was permitted them in any kind.</p>
               <p>I find some <hi>Criticism</hi> used by <hi>Dr. Downam,</hi> upon the Hebrew names in Scripture which signifie a <hi>Stranger, pag</hi>: 208. but I cannot find that <hi>Dr Fenton</hi> doth make any use: the three sorts of <hi>Ger, Toshab, and Nocre</hi> (which he tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slates to be <hi>Advena, Inquilinus,</hi> and <hi>Hostis</hi>) are insisted upon by him.

               <p>If all the Leviticall lawes be read over, it cannot be found that ever any Judiciall was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered with such restrictions, qualifications, and diminishing termes, as the law of <hi>Vsury: thy brother, thy poor brother, thy poor brother that is with thee</hi>; the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall name of neighbour is not so much as used about it: it is no where said <hi>thou shalt take no Vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of thy neighbour.</hi> Besides this law hath an allowance which no other Judiciall hath. And lastly, this law of <hi>Vsury</hi> taken in the sense of our adversaries (for all increase from the rich also) can be no breach of <hi>Charity</hi> in
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:99137:58"/>
some Cases, and then there will be no Equity in it, which is found even in all <hi>Iudicialls.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I find <hi>Dr. Downam</hi> brought to such straights as to maintain that there be other <hi>respects which make Vsury unlawfull besides the hurt of the neighbour, pag.</hi> 295. But if it be forbidden by the Morall law, and that law be a branch of the second table (as <hi>Dr. Fenton</hi> affirmes) how it can be a sin without breach of <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> to the neighbour, passeth my understanding, since Charity is the fulfilling of the <hi>law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereas Dr. <hi>Downam</hi> doth compare <hi>Vsury to an officious lye,</hi> which is a sin, though it hurt not but help the neighbour, <hi>pag.</hi> 277. It is true an officious lye is a sin: but a sin against the first Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of the first Table as it is repugnant to <hi>Truth</hi> which
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:99137:59"/>
is an essential Attribute of God: Every one that lyeth doth ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by deny and forsake the true God. Let Dr. <hi>Downam</hi> tell us, which Commandement of the first Table is by <hi>Vsury</hi> violated. It is not sufficient to say, that all <hi>Vsury</hi> is a breach of our allegiance to God, this is but begging of the question, unless this disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience can bee referr'd to some particular precept of the Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, as the officious lye is to the first; as for general disobedience, it is a sin that goeth through all the Commandements, and is to bee referred to each particular precept according to the several objects of it.</p>
               <p>It is further insisted on, that the prohibition of <hi>Vsury</hi> is cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled in <hi>Ezechiel</hi> 18, with sinnes against the Moral Law, from thence an inference is made, that
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:99137:59"/>
it self must be Moral.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. If we look upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Scriptures we shall find Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicials and Morals mingled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the giving of the Law: We may see in <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.9, the prohibition of <hi>Reaping</hi> the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the field, and gleaning the Vineyards, which were Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cials, set immediately before the forbidding of Stealing, Lying, and Swearing, which are parcels of the Moral Law. In the 13 verse of the same Chapter it is said, <hi>Thou shalt not defraud thy neighbour, nor rob him: The w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

And also in the 16 verse, the prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Enchantment,</hi> or Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft, is set between the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding of <hi>eating bloud,</hi> and
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:99137:60"/>
                  <hi>rounding the corners of the head,</hi> and <hi>marring the corners of the beard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, whereas Dr. <hi>Downam</hi> saith <hi>pag.</hi> 219. <hi>The Holy Ghost de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciphers a wicked man, that should dye the death if he did any of these things.</hi> Wee find first that the words in the Original are, <hi>if he do like to any one of these things</hi>; or as our new Translation hath it in the Margent, <hi>or that doth to his brother besides any of these.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, whereas Dr. <hi>Downam</hi> conjoyns these sins by the disjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive <hi>Or,</hi> our new Translators use the Copulative <hi>And.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly, to confound Dr. <hi>Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam</hi>'s opinion, the Text in the 13 verse saith, <hi>He hath done All these abominations he shall surely dye.</hi> And good reason; for some of the crimes were capital by the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> as <hi>Idolatry</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery,</hi>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:99137:60"/>
but <hi>Vsury,</hi> or the taking and keeping of a pledge hath no kind of punishment appointed by <hi>Moses,</hi> neither hath any man denied, but that the law of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing the pledge was Judicial, and not Moral.</p>
               <p>But let it bee granted to Dr. <hi>Downam</hi> (that which he can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver prove) that death is threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by <hi>Ezekiel</hi> to Usury; May it not stil be a Judicial Law for all that? Was not the Law in <hi>Exod.</hi> 21.1. a Judicial, whereby it is ordered <hi>that an Hebrew bond-ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant should at seven yeares end be free and at liberty</hi>? Yet God doth threaten the people for breaking this Law, by reassuming their servants <hi>with a liberty to the Sword, to the Pestilence, and to the Famin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:99137:61"/>
stoned by Gods appointment,</hi> and yet the Law was but Judicial, and not Moral.</p>
               <p>Before I conclude this questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on about the nature of the Law against <hi>Vsury,</hi> it is not imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to remove a scruple that is objected. It may be asked of me that maintain there is no Law in Scripture now in force against <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury,</hi> what Text can be shewed that it is lawful?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> There needeth none; for if the Law of God doe not now forbid it, it is sufficient that the Law of <hi>Nature, Reason,</hi> and <hi>Custom</hi> doth make it lawful. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout things easie and manifest</hi> (saith Mr. <hi>Hooker) by common sense, there needeth no higher consultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on— the meanes of some things is such, that to search the Scripture of God for the ordering of them, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Dr. <hi>Fenton</hi> and Dr. <hi>Downam</hi> cannot endure to hear that <hi>Vsury should be called Letting of money.</hi> Many are the properties that are (as they think) <hi>inseparable</hi> from <hi>Letting,</hi> and cannot be found in the putting out of money. <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring or Letting</hi> (say they) <hi>is of such things as are not spent in the use, But have a fruitfull use in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves naturally; which use may be valued a part and be let, the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty remaining in the letter, and the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:99137:63"/>
thing if it miscarry without the fault of the hirer belongeth to the letter only.</hi> If we ask from whence they collect these distinctions and properties of Letting, or whether they have any rule for them in Scripture; They answer, though there bee no Text for them, yet the Law of Nature and Reason which ordereth and regulateth all humane contracts, doth teach them. Let it be so: And let us have leave a little to examine by the same Law of Reason and common sense these properties of Letting, and see whether any or all of them may be applyed to money.</p>
               <p>I confess things hired are not to be spent in their use. Neither is money properly said to bee spent in the use, it is not to speak like a Grammarian, to say any thing is spent in the use, for
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:99137:64"/>
                  <hi>spending</hi> and <hi>using</hi> are in propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of speech distinct actions, howsoever by reason of some si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude between them they be used promiscuously by the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar phrase. A thing used doth remain the same after the use to be used again; but a thing spent perisheth or is consumed in the spending, so that no further use can be made of it. Money is not thus spent, at the most it is but said to be spent to him that hath made no profitable use of it, in it self it remains <hi>unspent</hi> and <hi>use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi> to others. Thus much Dr. <hi>Fenton</hi> saw very wel, &amp; therfore he doth not urge this property as Dr. <hi>Downame</hi> doth, but seems to yeeld, and say <hi>pag.</hi> 65. <hi>That also of spending money in the first use, as if the use and property were inseparable, so much stood upon by School Divines</hi> (he might also
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:99137:64"/>
have said <hi>Canonists) is much sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to cavill, for there is sensible di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between spending a loaf of bread, and disbursing mony for gain — a loaf once eaten hath no second use to him that eat it, or to any other: mony laid out remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth still the same to be used by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; and the same in the Equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent to him that laid it out: and the same individuall peeces which once delivered shall never happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly return again to the same per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; there may be some difference in a Philosophers brain, but not in a merchants purse, it is all one whether it be the same shilling or another as good.</hi>

                  <hi>Things let</hi> (say they) <hi>must have a fruitfull use naturally in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</hi> If this property were true I would confess mony might not be Let. But Common sense doth Confute this asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

               </p>
               <p>Mony having thus <hi>an Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall use</hi> distinct from the spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of it, this use of it is <hi>valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> a part, and to be guided by the same rule which serves for the true valuation of any other Lettable thing: we see by dayly experience that the valuation of the use of mony is more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain than of other things. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines then, <hi>that mony hath an artificiall use which is valuable, and in that respect may be let as other artificiall things are.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To proceed. Another proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (say they <hi>pag.</hi> 16.) of <hi>Letting is, that the use only is passed over,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:99137:66" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the property resting in the Lender. Whereas Lending passeth over the property with the use for the time it is Lent.</hi> Is this true? Then a man had need take heed of Lending, If when he lends he loseth the property of the thing lent? Surely I should think that <hi>the use</hi> and <hi>possession</hi> only (and not the property) is passed away in Lending and Letting also. He that hath Lent his mony during the time that it is Lent and out of possession, hath power in law and a right to give or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queath at his pleasure, which he could not dispose of, if he had no property in it. A pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty in the sum Lent, or to the equivalent, which is all one as Dr. <hi>Fenton</hi> hath ingenuously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed. It is a frivolous excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to say he hath not a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty in that <hi>Individual</hi> shilling
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:99137:66"/>
which he lent, since art hath so ordered it that all shillings are the self same in use, and as one shilling. If all other naturall and artificiall things, which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed to be Lettable, were of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall value and use; if all hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and sheep were alike in all things without any reall diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in their goodness and use, it would be all one to him that had let his horse, to receive his own horse or another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We must understand</hi> (saith Dr. <hi>Fenton) a speciall kind of Lending which for penury of wordes, and narrowness of our English wanteth a proper term. In Latine it is called [Mutuum] or mutuatio</hi> — which is saith he <hi>the free passing over both of use and property for a time, at the time ended to receive the like again</hi>; thus he. If it be pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed over but for a time, then at

the time ended the same again must be restored; why then doth he name only the like <hi>again</hi>? if onely <hi>the like be restored</hi> then the thing it self is passed over for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Wilson</hi> the <hi>Civilian</hi> in his booke of <hi>Vsury</hi> puts the Case how hiring of mony may bee lawfull; if a man borrow a 100l onely to make shew of, either at some bank, or otherwise to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade the world that he hath a 100l of his own, and if he <hi>never</hi> spend it but presently restoreth the self same 100. pound which he borrowed, in this Case the Lender may lawfully take and Contract for hire or use of his mony because it is not spent in the use.

folly of man, and not from the God of Nature. But if it be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that the Text understands all goods, then indeed it comes home to the point of <hi>Vsury</hi>; but it makes for it and not against it: for the law is for <hi>things <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Indeed when a thing is hired for some particular end wherewith the Letter is made acquainted, then he may stand by and see how it perisheth, and of such a lending the Text is best understood. It is plain that the Letter (though he had the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty) did not alwaies stand unto the hazard but onely when he stood by, <hi>that it might appear</hi>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:99137:69"/>
(saith Dr. <hi>Fenton pag.</hi> 17.) <hi>not to be the Borrowers default.</hi> The Rabbines exposition of this text may give some light to the understanding of it, and it is thus; <hi>The words are, if it be hurt or dy: that is, hurt in the use, or dye in the work for which it was hired: If a man</hi> (say they) <hi>hire a tool for some particular, if it be hurt in doing the work it must not be made good: so if I hire a horse to plow with, and the horse whilest he is in ploughing dy, then I am free. But if I borrow goods or beasts, and they be lost or stoln, or hurt, or taken away by violence, or dy, I am bound to pay all, if such violence do not befall it in the time of the work. If I borrow a horse to plow with, and he dy ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before or after the ploughing I must make him good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To apply this Text to mony,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:99137:70"/>
the most that can be gathered is, <hi>that if mony be hurt in the using of it</hi> without the Borrowe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The ground of the equity of this Law is, <hi>if the thing hired be not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:99137:70" rendition="simple:additions"/>
externall accident mony peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth, the Law provides no reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in such Cases. It is one of the singular benefits and the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege of mony in traffique that it is not of a perishable nature. The ends why policy found out the use of mony were many: <hi>the Chief</hi> are, that it might be <hi>Dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Portable,</hi> and <hi>Partible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to grant them that he that stands to the hazard should have all the gaines: Is there not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard to be found in the Letter as well as in the Borrower of mony? many that have Contra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cted for <hi>Vsury</hi> by bonds and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther security have lost both Principal and Use, and have been thereby undone; surely such people find hazard in it.

It is fit therefore in equity, <hi>that since</hi> the Lender stands in hazard there should be a gain due to him also.</p>
               <p>But this gain they allow, <hi>So it may be conditional, if the borrower gain.</hi> And this conditionall gain can only be by <hi>Partnership.</hi> As for let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of mony upon Condition of the Borrowers gain, it is a course as mischievous and impossible as the letting of land upon like Condition; without experience no man can sufficiently describe it. It would make all bargaines to be nothing but sute in law, no debts should be due but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on proof and witnesses exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; nay there is no possibility of knowing mens gaines or los<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s without racking their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, and opening a gap to perjury for every unthrift in his own Cause. Or if loss and gain
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:99137:71"/>
could be discovered, how shall it appear, whether it be by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault of the party or by the act of God? many times they both concur, and are so twisted that no eye of reason can distinguish them. In effect, hereby every man is tied to have an eye to watch the disbursing of every penny which he lends, which is a thing impossible, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the law of reason and of all nations doth think it fitter to tolerate sometimes a mischief which may happen by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate bargain upon an <hi>abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute contract,</hi> than to allow of a perpetuall inconvenience which would follow a <hi>Conditionall Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> and overthrow the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts of all Common-wealthes. In all letting there is a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration had of the casualties, and because there may be a possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of extraordinary gaines it
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:99137:72" rendition="simple:additions"/>
must countervalue the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary loss if any happen, both which being contingent, and sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom happening, they are set one against the other, and a middle indifferent rate between them, which doth ordinarily happen, belongs to the Lender, who is not to partake in the extremes: Because it is rarely to be shewed that any loss can befall a man in liveless goods meerly by the act of God, without the concurrence of some fault of man, either of negligence, ignorance, indiscre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wilfulness, or the like. To conclude, the rule that guides the valuation in all Contracts, is not what <hi>Casually is or may be,</hi> but what <hi>ordinarily</hi> is like to happen.</p>
               <p>As for Partnership (which is a project much magnified by the adversaries of <hi>Vsury</hi>) let it be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined

what it is. Those are truly <hi>Partners</hi> who in a <hi>Ioint stock</hi> communicate their <hi>paines</hi> and <hi>travel</hi>: so that an equal industry and privity goes along with the imployment of the stock. There the Trust being reciprocal, the covenants may be equal, and the Laws do relieve men upon their Covenants and mutual agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in such <hi>Partnership:</hi> But in this their pretended Partner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, where there is but a trust of one side, no equality of pains, no privity in trade, no partner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship in the matter of stock, nor in the form or consent of <hi>negoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,</hi> but onely a Partnership in the gains, this cannot truly be called a Partnership, but it is only the office of Master and Servant under another name, or false title, and differs only in the manner of the wages, which in
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:99137:73" rendition="simple:additions"/>
this their case of Partnership is contingent, and in the other ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute. Besides, in this their counterfeit Partnership, a man may make no covenants that can be good in Law, nor so much as take a Bond for his Principal, but hee must onely trust to the honesty of his friend, since no articles can be made that shall be legal except they bee <hi>Vsurious</hi>: nor can be drawn so reasonable as an honest man will be bound by them, or so firm that a disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest man cannot safely break them.</p>
               <p>It seems to me, that after all the stir about <hi>Vsury,</hi> Dr. <hi>Fenton,</hi> and all his fellows doe allow of <hi>Vsury</hi> under another name, <hi>Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest</hi>; they all agree a man may lawfully take so it be against his will; that is, when a man detains his money from him against his
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:99137:73" rendition="simple:additions"/>
will; but if a man be so courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as to consent that another shall keep his money, hee must then stand to the curtesie of the Borower.</p>
               <p>Now that which they doe call <hi>Interest,</hi> they doe allow in two cases; Either where there is, first <hi>Damnum contingens,</hi> a loss arising; or secondly, where there is <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crum cessans,</hi> gain ceasing: so that if either a man receive <hi>damage,</hi> or that his <hi>gain</hi> be but <hi>hindered,</hi> he may take interest. Now in all lending a mans gain is hindered, because he hath not his mony to employ when occasion serveth, or shall be offered: Nor is it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite that <hi>ceasing gain</hi> must be certainly proved; for that is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, being a thing contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, but a probable estimation of it may bee allowed (by Dr. <hi>Downams</hi> confession <hi>pag.</hi> 166.) &amp;
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:99137:74"/>
in all probability <hi>gain ceaseth,</hi> or is hindered, wheresoever there is Lending. Therefore by this their own Scholastical distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on there is Interest due for all Lending. Only <hi>successive</hi> or <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usury</hi> which is before delay of <hi>Payment</hi> they would fain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude. But if <hi>Interest</hi> be (as their own <hi>Melancthon</hi> saith) <hi>a debt which hee oweth by the Law of Nature, who hath been to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an effectuall cause of da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, or hath hindered his gain,</hi> because <hi>Nature teacheth that no man must be enriched by the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring of another,</hi> according to the Rule of St. <hi>Paul</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.13. <hi>That one be not eased, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother may be burdened:</hi> Then it will follow, that delay of <hi>Payment doth naturally begin</hi> from the first <hi>minute</hi> of Lending; if any will abridge himself of the privilege
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:99137:74"/>
of <hi>Nature</hi> by the <hi>giving</hi> day for payment, yet if it be by a <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant conditional</hi> to pay so much interest at the day appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, then such a Contract is but the ratifying of a naturall debt, with a <hi>dilatory</hi> payment for the benefit of the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower.</p>
               <p>Thus after all their pretended impediments of Letting money, they are forced to confess at last, that an <hi>interest</hi> may be justly due and taken; which is nothing else but a hire, a recompense, or an <hi>increase of it.</hi> The sole doubt they make is about the <hi>contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> for <hi>interusury.</hi> Neither is Dr. <hi>Fenton</hi> nor Dr. <hi>Downam,</hi> so stif a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst contracts when they come to the point<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as at first they made shew of. Dr. <hi>Fenton</hi> saith, <hi>pag.</hi> 64. <hi>It is great reason that the deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor should trust the creditors chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:99137:75"/>
&amp; not the creditor rely upon the fidelity of the debtor; and Bonds may in some cases be lawfully made, which cannot so lawfully be exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> This he speaks of contracts without any condition of hazard expressed.</p>
               <p>Also Dr. <hi>Downam</hi> doth adde, <hi>That if there be a covenant of the one side</hi> in eventum lucri, <hi>to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the gain, and on the other side but a purpose of bearing part of the loss — I would not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther condemn such a contract,</hi> pag. 163.</p>
               <p>Thus both these Divines doe consent that a contract may bee made for interest, if there be but a purpose in the Lender not to exact or oppress thereby. Yet like men uncertain and doubtful what to conclude, they some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times allow a man to take inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest so he doe not contract for it,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:99137:75"/>
at other times to contract for it, so he do not take it, (<hi>pag.</hi> 27.) <hi>One while a Bond may be lawfully made, so it be not exacted; another while it is lawfull to take where it is not lawfull to covenant or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract.</hi> Again, Dr. <hi>Fenton</hi> saith, <hi>pag.</hi> 129. <hi>That the poyson of Vsury is in some contracts so closely and cunningly conveyed, as the very turn of the intention of the minde may alter the case to make it just or unjust; the contract remaining one and the same.</hi> If one and the same contract may be just and unjust, then all contracts are not unjust by his own confession. In another place (<hi>pag.</hi> 125.) he tells us, <hi>We may puzzle him with some cases so cunnin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Vsury—If it appear just and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, it shall not appear usurious, it may perhaps border or coast upon Vsury. Yet our conclusion shall still remain entire,</hi> That Usury pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly so called is simply unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. A trim Conclusion. But what are we the wiser for know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that all <hi>Vsury</hi> is unlawfull, unless he teach us what is <hi>proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called Vsury?</hi> This is the main doubt, <hi>what is Vsury, and what is not; whether all increase, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease onely from the poor; whether all contracts for gain by mony be V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury.</hi> If Dr. <hi>Fenton</hi> may be puzled, and not be able to tell us what Contracts differ from Justice and Charity, and what not; If one and the same contract may bee just and unjust; if that <hi>usurious</hi> contracts, <hi>as they do approach un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to equity so far forth do decline the nature of Vsury,</hi> then are we still igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:99137:76"/>
what <hi>properly is Vsury,</hi> onely we may know that it is <hi>unlawfull</hi> if we knew what it were. This is the last and safest retreat that Dr. <hi>Fenton</hi> findeth.</p>

is, that <hi>all Vsury</hi> is of it self a sin, and so nothing indifferent.

And if Dr. <hi>Fenton</hi> allow Usury

to be doubtfull, it cannot but ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue rashness peremptorily to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine there is no doubt of it, thereby to ensnare the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of the simple.</p>
               <p>Besides the doubting spoken of by the Apostle, though it were of things indifferent, yet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly before the comming of Christ they were things necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily prescribed by the Law, but, after, taken away by the Gospel, so that to doubt of them was consequently to condemn the Gospell, and deny the faith in Christ.

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> This is no argument of Divinity from Scripture, but of Philosophy from <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, if it were of force, it serves onely against <hi>Vsury</hi> of money, but not of all other things.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is confessed, that money considered as it is a <hi>metal,</hi> is not perhaps by nature apt to generation and increase; and yet even that may bee doubted of: But money considered as it is money, which Art not Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath produced, may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed an artificial increase or gain, as well as houses, ships, and many other things not natural. Policy hath ordained the value of Metals to bee the common rule and measure for the worth of all things vendible, and by common estimation it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:99137:82"/>
in the place and stead of such things; so that in opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and use mony is both land, house, horse, corn, or any thing that is valued by it; even man himself, who in worth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds all other creatures, is by Gods own valuation prized at a certain sum of money, and fifty Shekels of Silver vvere ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted by God in the place and stead of a man who by vow be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed unto him. <hi>Leviticus</hi> 27.3.</p>
               <p>It being then so apparent, that Money is by Art taken, and used for all things valua<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble, both by man and God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self (vvho had his peculiar Coin, the Shekel of the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, for all sacred uses, <hi>Exodus</hi> 30.13.) It follows in all reason, that since the nature of most things that are valued and sold
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:99137:83"/>
is to bring forth an increase, that money it self also which is esteemed for them should doe the like, or else Art is frustrated of her intention, who found out the use of money onely for the ease and benefit of Trade, which proves to be a discommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity if the benefit of increase be lost by the conversion into mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</p>

                  </hi> Flood hath been unjustly taken: For it will hardly appear that any Acre of land is worse now than in his dayes; since many Acres are bettered by tillage and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuring, which by lying waste are hurt; and houses also decay most for want of inhabiting. The true rule of Letting is not onely the Lenders loss in the impairing of the thing lent, but the Borrowers gain by the use of it. And we must consider, as well what the owner is the worse by the want of that use, as what the thing lent is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired. If another use my land, though it be not the worse, yet
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:99137:84"/>
he is the better by having the crop of it, and I am the worse by vvanting that benefit of it which hee made; therefore I justly challenge Rent for it. The like case is for money, the Borrower hath the use of it, and though the money bee not the worse for using, yet the Lender is the worse by missing the commodity which the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther makes of it, and the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower is bettered by the employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it.</p>
               <p>Also it is objected (<hi>pag.</hi> 148.) <hi>That money is voyd of all immediate use in it self to the possessor while hee doth enjoy it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> So it is with Land, which immediately neither clothes nor feeds any man, but by the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of tillage and pasturage both are effected, and though no
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:99137:84"/>
man immediately eats or wears money, yet by the meanes of it food and raiment are procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
               <p>Another objection is, <hi>That money the more it doth increase the more it may, which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall, and contrary to other en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> It is so in other sorts of increase; for one Sheep brings forth a Lamb, and that Sheep and Lamb in time bring forth a double increase, which multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies to a third, and so forward: so one hundred pound brings forth ten pound<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in time increase to produce eleven pound.

               <p>Secondly, the <hi>Vsurers</hi> security is to arm himself against the <hi>

If by the hand of God an extraordinary loss do happen, by the like means also an extraordinary gaine may be raised sometimes, both which belong to the borrower, except the mercy of the lender, to whom he is to trust, relieve him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:99137:85"/>
And surely the <hi>Vsurer</hi> hath great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er cause, and seems also to trust God more than any other man, and is least armed against him. He had need pray against foul-weather, tempest, wind, and wrack; for although hee be no Husbandman, Merchant, Trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, nor Labourer, yet by the thriving of all these he must live, if all or any of these miscarry, it is not his bonds many times which help him. Neither against the hand of God onely is he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed, but against the fraudes of men many times his security cannot defend him. How many have been defrauded of their principall debts by fraudulent deeds of gift, by concealing of goods, and divers other waies? It is true some few in a City may sometimes attain to a noted wealth by Usury; but these are
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:99137:86"/>
but as ciphers in comparison of hundreds, who living by the like employment of money do scarce attain to a moderate gain where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to maintain themselves in their first condition; and many tim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s as skilfull Usurers as the best, what by the loss sometimes of interest, sometimes of princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal, and other whiles of both, and many times by the lying still of their mony for want of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable security, have proved in the end perfect Beggers by this trade. And what greater argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can there be of the hazard and danger of mony that is lent, than the common opinion of the world, which esteems a small re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venew in land of Fee simple, more safe and certain than al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most a double encrease in mony with perpetual hazard? and for this cause land is dearer than mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</p>

                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:99137:86"/>As for taking of Bonds for payment, it is no more injurious to the Providence of God than to have a bond or covenant of a Tenant for the payment of his rent; for although some yeares by the unseasonablness of the year, or by some other act of God, the land yeelds not the rent contracted for, yet the Tenant is absolutely bound to pay it without any condition of gaining so much by the land: And the reason is grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on great equity, and is all one both for contracts of land and money to be <hi>abs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Dr. <hi>Fenton</hi> can shew no reason why money may <hi>not be let, as well as len<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  </hi>; as well as a house or a horse which may be both: I ought in great necessity to lend freely to the poor, yet this work of Charity doth not hinder me from letting the same thing where there is not the like necessity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If the use of money for a time be worth mony in buying and selling,</hi> as Dr. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. confesseth (<hi>pag.</hi> 99.) The rule may better hold in Letting, which is no work of Charity, though both in Letting and Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Charity is to guide us. It doth not follow that because I must lend a shilling for a day,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:99137:88"/>
therfore I may not lend a pound for a year. Besides, <hi>even in letting for hire,</hi> there is often both <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> and <hi>friendship</hi> shewed: As, if I let a thing for half the value the use of it is worth to one whom others dare not trust with their goods. If some things which are spent in the first use may be sold for increase, why may not other things that are u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed be let in the same sort since <hi>letting</hi> is but a <hi>temporary</hi> kind of selling, and selling in effect a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall kind of letting. If such things as are bought this day for ten pound may be sold to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for eleven pound, may not the same ten pound which by buying and selling may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease in one day to thus eleven pound, may it not by letting en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease in a whole year to as much?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:99137:88"/>Nor can there be any reason shewed, since mony hath a gainfull use in it self (and as <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, <hi>answereth all things</hi>) why I may not as well let a hundred pound in mony, as a hundred-pounds worth of Cattell, houses or lands, which I buy with my mony: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they often tell us <hi>that he that beares the hazard must have the gain,</hi> I must ask what they will say to a lease for life wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in both parties hazard, yet but one gaines.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Andrews Bishop of Winche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> hath an argument against <hi>Vsury</hi> taken from the Rule of our <hi>Saviour, Luke</hi> 6.31. <hi>as ye would that men should do to you, do yee also to them likewise. Nemo</hi> (saith he) <hi>sibi vellet Vsuras infligi, cum fratre sic agat igitur.</hi> No man is willing to have <hi>Vsury</hi> taken of
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:99137:89"/>
him, therefore he must not take himself; every man desires to borrow <hi>freely,</hi> therefore he must lend freely.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> The Rule of our <hi>Saviour</hi> must necessarily be thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, <hi>Whatsoever yee will,</hi> that is, <hi>Whatsoever you will according to right reason or commom Iustice</hi>; for if any man be so unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable or so frantick as to will that others should kill him, yet my Lord of <hi>Winche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> will not say that therefore that man may kill another. So he that desires to borrow freely, breaks the Rule of common equity and rectified reason, by coveting his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours goods; for he that desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to benefit himself by the use of another mans goods, doth therein uncharitably desire the hinderance of his neighbour.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:99137:89"/>Also it is objected, that the <hi>greatness of gain which is made by Vsury is unlawfull. pag.</hi> 100</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans:</hi> 1. This is no proof a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all increase of mony; but onely against excessive gaines: whereas it should bee proved that <hi>Vsury</hi> of a penny in the hundred is a sinne, as well as of ten pounds.</p>
               <p>Secondly, By this Rule all gain of merchandising is condemned, which is ordinarily far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than that of tenne in the hundred.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The greatness of gain by Lending must be esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by the common opinion of the Country: otherwise how can any mans Conscience war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant him to purchase any inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance? Men buy land to them and to their heires for ever, that is till Doomesday; which
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:99137:90"/>
when it will come no man knowes, and yet as if every purchaser knew the hour, he bargaineth for land at fifteen or sixteen yeares purchace. But the last day may come within a year, or within fifteen, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps not within fifteen hundred yeares: howsoever it bee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, yet the publique valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation doth esteem it Certain; And no man buyes land at 15. yeares purchace, upon Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that Doomes-day come not before, because perhaps then he may have a dear penny worth: Nor upon Condition that if the world last longer then fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen yeares that thence forward the purchaser should pay a further sum. No, but Custome thinks fit to make an absolute bargain, though by the meer act of God it may bee made a dear purchace.</p>

                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:99137:90"/>As the argument of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of <hi>gain in Vsury</hi> makes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst trading or merchandising, so thereby also bargaining for leases for term of yeares will be made unjust; And this may the better appear if we exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine one of Dr. <hi>Fentons</hi> exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of <hi>Vsury</hi> in this kind: <hi>If</hi> saith he (<hi>pag</hi> 21.) <hi>purposely to avoid the Statute I will purchase an annuity of twenty pound</hi> per annum <hi>with an hundred pound for ten yeares, this is bargain and sale, yet the very same with Vsury, differing onely in parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and manner of Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, subject to the same iniquity and in quality; poisoned with purpose of avoiding the Statute and penalty of Vsury.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. If onely the purpose to avoid the Statute makes his Case to bee <hi>Vsury,</hi> then before the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:99137:91"/>
it was no <hi>Vsury,</hi> for there could bee no purpose to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void a penalty that was not, and this is to make <hi>Vsury</hi> a breach only of Mans Law and not of Gods. Let us ask Dr. <hi>Fenton</hi> whether a lease for yeares and annuity bought with mony bee <hi>Vsury</hi> simply in it self; he dares not say it, his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer is, <hi>pag</hi>: 129 <hi>We cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem it for Vsury,</hi> and yet he seeth most apparently it is of the very self same nature with <hi>Lending</hi> upon bonds, and differs onely in the security: upon bond a man ties himself, upon a lease a man ties his land, in both these there is the like increase by mony, and both pay alike at the end.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this Case I find put of a lease that brings in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove tenne in the hundred,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:99137:91"/>
thereby to make it more odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: but give us leave to put it in other termes, and then ask his opinion, If with a hundred pound I purchase an anuity of tenne pounds <hi>per annum</hi> and twenty shillings over yearly for tenne yeares, Is this <hi>Vsury</hi> because it is an increase above the principall? It is the very self-same bargain in nature with his, it differs only in the quantity of the increase. Now both by his definition and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, as well the increase of a penny is Usury as of tenne pounds in the hundred, so then by his doctrine a man may not buy a lease worth one penny more than his principall. If it bee pretended that bargain and sale of leases be lawfull if it be reasonable, otherwise not; then if the unreasonableness onely
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:99137:92"/>
of the bargain make it a sinne of <hi>Vsury,</hi> then the former do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which saith <hi>all increase is Vsury, is thereby denied,</hi> And I confess that an unreasonable bargain is a sinne, but of theft in generall not of <hi>Vsury.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, The principall pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose in buying an <hi>annuity</hi> or lease for yeares is to gain by a hundred pound, which since it could not safely bee done by bonds, therefore by a second intention men labour to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the Statute, so that to gain and in gaining to avoid the Statute is the purpose of such Contracts, and not chiefly to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the Statute, which might best be avoided by not purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing at all.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, It is no sinne to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void a statute by lawfull meanes; if the Contract of bargain and
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:99137:92"/>
sale bee in it self lawfull, why should it be a vice and not a vertue thereby to avoid the penalty of the Law, since lawes are purposely made to force men to avoid them by lawfull meanes.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, Whereas Dr. <hi>Fenton (pag.</hi> 129.) concludeth, that if <hi>simply without any pretence such annuity of rent bee bought or sold, wee cannot condemn it for Vsury.</hi> It followes that the pretence or intention of the heart, and not the Contract makes it <hi>Vsury</hi>: and that (as he himself confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth <hi>pag.</hi> 128) <hi>if the intention be right, that which formally is Vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, upon the matter may i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> justice bee equivalent to a lawfull Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract.</hi> If formall <hi>Vsury</hi> may bee no <hi>Vsury,</hi> wee must look for a new definition of <hi>Vsury</hi> in the Consciences of men, and not
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:99137:93"/>
in Dr. <hi>Fentons</hi> treatise; And if <hi>Vsury</hi> bee committed in Buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Selling, what Contract will bee found in the world without <hi>Vsury</hi>?</p>
               <p>To Instance in some other Contracts, let us consider of the absolute buying and selling of land, or of purchasing an annuity for life; because these two Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts are esteemed by most men to be the lawfullest of all others, yet in both these, the just and ordinary valuation both of fee simple land and of leases for lives is grounded and guided by <hi>Vsury</hi> onely, and as the use of money goeth higher or lower, so the prices of these rise and fall, so that in very truth he that purchaseth land is the greatest <hi>Vsurer</hi> in the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because he maketh the greatest and certainest gain by
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:99137:93"/>
his bargain, for example; Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit land is bought and sold for sixteen yeares purchase, and let the inheritance of the land bee made away for so little a summe as the land will bring home in sixteen yeares; what Conscience is there to keep that for ever, which in so short a time payeth the purchaser his principal? There can be no other reason yielded for this great disproportion but this, that both the Purchaser and Seller do equally value the use of the money, and do make the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain accordingly. The purchase-mony considered with the Use of it would last about a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand yeares in paying yearely so much as the Rent of the land is, therefore the Purchaser ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects to enjoy, and the Seller in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to part with the land for
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:99137:94"/>
ever, because the inheritance of the land after a thousand yeares is not valuable, for that ordinarily within four or five hundred yeares the possessions of the antientest families come to a period, or decay. In like manner, an annuity for life is bought for nine yeares purchase, not because a mans life is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily taken to last but nine yeares, but because the mony with the use will last almost twice nine yeares in paying the annuity: so that if the Purchaser of the annuity dye within eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen yeares, the Grantor may be a gainer, or at the least a saver, by the bargain; but if he live above eighteen yeares the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor must be at loss. This Casu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality of a lease for life, wherein the Buyer hopes by his own life to be a gainer, and the Seller
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:99137:94"/>
hopes by the death of the Buyer to bee a gainer, hath made some men (if wee will believe <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi>) to think that a lease for life is the worst kind or dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Vsury,</hi> because there is an <hi>Vsurious</hi> intention on both sides, as well in the Grantor as in the Grantee to gain.</p>
               <p>If many men who are fit for Callings live idlely on Usury, they sinne, but no otherwise than those that let their lands: they may and ought to serve God and their Country in some Calling, if they do not, it is no fault of <hi>Vsury,</hi> but an abuse of it. Neither let any man fear that <hi>Vsury</hi> will bring idleness in the world for if all men be idle there can be no <hi>Vsury.</hi> It is the usury-imployment of men by their trading that makes the use of money to be at so high a
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:99137:95"/>
value, and many must bee idle if they borrow not a stock to set them on work.</p>

               <head>Of the Vncharitableness of Vsury</head>
               <p>In the last Chapter of Dr. <hi>Fenton</hi> his second book, I did expect some extraordinary ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument against <hi>Vsury,</hi> because it treats of the breach of <hi>Charity</hi> by <hi>Vsury,</hi> and the opposition between them: I did long to see it proved; but now I am come to it, I find it the shortest Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in his book, both in quantity, and proof, the little that he saith is in effect, <hi>that Vsurers are commonly uncharitable. pag.</hi> 106.</p>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> that all <hi>Vsurers</hi> are so: It is the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:99137:95"/>
fault of the men, and not of the thing. Thrift which of it self is a vertue, being abused is the hinderance of Charity, and yet Thrift is no breach of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: A thrifty man and an <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer</hi> may bee mercifull to the poor, because they are many times better able than others. If <hi>Vsury</hi> of it self were a breach of Charity: then not to lend to <hi>Vsury</hi> were an act of Charity; which is but a meer Privation and no Act at all. The reason why <hi>Vsurers</hi> bee commonly found merciless, is for that in many men Covetousness makes them <hi>Vsurers,</hi> and not <hi>Vsury</hi> brings them to be Covetous. Many <hi>Vsurers</hi> are found wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposed to Charity, and give twice as much to <hi>Charitable</hi> u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses as those that have twice their estate in Lands and are no

                  <hi>Vsurers.</hi> Since then all <hi>Vsurers</hi> are not uncharitable, and those that be, are found, and not made such by <hi>Vsury,</hi> it is but small Charity to say that <hi>Vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> of it self is the breach of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
