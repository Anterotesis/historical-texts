            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>UPon Friday the ninth of this inſtant, being the day appointed for the Execution of the ſentence of Death upon the Earl of <hi>Cambridg,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Capel,</hi> about ten of the Clock that morning L.Col. <hi>Beecher</hi> came with his Order to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Priſoners at St <hi>James</hi>'s, requiring them to come away; According to which Order they were carried in Sedans, with a Guard, to Sir <hi>Thomas Cottons</hi> houſe at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> where they continued about the ſpace of two hours, paſſing away moſt of that time in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious and ſeaſonable Conferences with the Miniſters there preſent with them. After which, being called a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to the Scaffold, it was deſired, that before they went they might have the opportunity of commending their Souls to God by prayer, which being readily granted, and the room voyded, Mr <hi>Bolton</hi> was deſired by the Lord of <hi>Holland</hi> to take that pains with them, which was accordingly done with great appearance of ſolemn Affections among them. Prayer being conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and hearty Thanks returned by them all to the Miniſter who performed, as alſo to the reſt who were their Aſſiſtants in this ſad time of trouble; the Earl of <hi>Cambridge</hi> prepared firſt to go towards the place of Execution; and after mutual embraces, and ſome ſhort ejaculatory expreſſions, to and for his fellow-ſufferers, he took his leave of them all, and went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:114941:3"/>with the Officers, attended upon by Dr <hi>Sibbald,</hi> whom he had choſen for his Comforter in this his ſad condition.</p>
            <p>The Scaffold being erected in the new Palace-yard at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> over againſt the great Hal-Gate, in the ſight of the place where the High Court of Juſtice formerly ſate (the Hal-doors being open,) there was his Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies Regiment of Horſe commanded by Capt. <hi>Diſher,</hi> and ſeveral Companies of Col. <hi>Hewſons</hi> and Col. <hi>Prides</hi> Regiments of Foot drawn up in the place: When the Earl came from <hi>Westminſter</hi> Hall neer the Scaffold, he was met by the Underſheriff of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> and a Guard of his men, who took the charge of him from Lieut. Col. <hi>Beecher</hi> and the Partizans that were his Guard; The Sheriff of <hi>London</hi> being alſo, according to Command from the High Court of Juſtice, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, to ſee the Execution performed.</p>
            <p>The Earl of <hi>Cambridg</hi> being come upon the Scaffold, and two of his own ſervants waiting upon him, he firſt ſpake to the Doctor as followeth:</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Earl of Cambridg.</speaker>
               <p>Whether ſhall I pray firſt?</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Earl of Cambridg.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord of <hi>Denbigh</hi> has ſent to ſpeak with me.</p>
               <p>I know not the faſhion, I may ask you Sir; Do theſe Gentlemen expect I ſhould ſay any thing to them, or no, they cannot hear?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr <hi>Sibbald.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>There will be a greater ſilence by and by. It will

            <sp>
               <speaker>Cambridg.</speaker>
               <p>There is ſomething in it. He was with the Houſe.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr <hi>Sibbald.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>I ſuppoſe he would give no interruption to Your Lordſhip, at this time, were there not ſomething of concernment in it.</p>

               <p>He is my Brother, and has been a very faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to this State, and he was in great eſteem and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation with them.</p>
               <p>He is in the Hall, and ſent to ſpeak with a Servant of mine to ſend ſomething to me.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr <hi>Sibbald.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>It will not lengthen the time much if you ſtay while you have a Return from him. My Lord, you ſhould do well to beſtow your time now in meditating upon, and imploring of the free mercy of God in Chriſt for your eternal Salvation, and look upon that ever-ſtream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fountain of his precious Blood, that purgeth us from all our ſins, even the ſins of the deepeſt dye; the Blood of Ieſus Chriſt waſhes away all our ſins, and that Blood of Chriſt is poured forth upon all ſuch as by a lively Faith lay hold upon him: God ſo loved the World that he gave his only begotten Son, to the end, that whoſoever beleeved in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life; that is now, my Lord, the Rock upon which you muſt chiefly reſt, and labor to fix your ſelf in the free mercy of God through Chriſt Ieſus, whoſe mercies are from everlaſting to everlaſting, unto
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:114941:4"/>all ſuch as with the eye of Faith behold him; behold Ieſus the Author and Finiſher of your Salvation, who hath ſatisfied the Iuſtice of God by that Al-ſufficiency of his Sacrifice, which once for all he offered upon the Croſs for the ſins of the whole world, ſo that the ſting of death is taken away from all Beleevers, and he hath ſanctified it as a paſſage to everlaſting bleſſedneſs: It is true, the waters of <hi>Jordan</hi> run ſomewhat rough and ſurly, betwixt the Wilderneſs and our paſſage into <hi>Canaan;</hi> but let us reſt upon the Ark (my Lord) the Ark Chriſt Ieſus, that will carry us through, and above all thoſe waves to that Rock of ages, which no flood nor waves can reach unto, and to him who is yeſterday, to day, and the ſame for ever, againſt whom the Powers and Principalities, the gates of Hell, ſhall never be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to prevail; lift up and faſten your eyes now upon Chriſt crucified; and labor to behold Ieſus ſtanding at the right hand of his Father, (as the Protomartyr <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen</hi>) ready to receive your ſoul, when it ſhall be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from this frail and mortal body: Alaſs, no man would deſire life, if he knew beforehand what it were to live, it is nothing but ſorrow, vexation and trouble, grief and diſcontent that waits upon every condition, whether publique or private; in every ſtation and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling there are ſeveral miſeries and troubles that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable from them; therefore what a bleſſed thing it is to have a ſpeedy and comfortable paſſage out of this raging Sea, into the Port of everlaſting Happineſs; We muſt paſs through a Sea, but it is the Sea of Chriſts Blood, in which never ſoul ſuffered ſhipwrack, in which we muſt be blown with winds and tempeſts,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:114941:4"/>but they are the Gales of Gods Spirit upon us, which blow away all contrary winds of diffidence in his Mercy.</p>
               <p>Here one acquainting the Earl, his ſervant was coming, he anſwered, So Sir; And turning to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Sheriffs ſon, ſaid.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cambridg.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, have you your Warrant here?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sheriff.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, my Lord, we have a Command.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cambridg.</speaker>
               <p>A Command.</p>
               <p>I take this time, Sir, of ſtaying, in regard of the Earl of <hi>Denbighs</hi> ſending to ſpeak with me, I know not for what it is he deſires me to ſtay.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr <hi>Sibbald.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>I preſume Mr Sheriff will not grudg your Lordſhip a few minutes time, when ſo great a work as this is in hand.</p>
               <p>His Lordſhips ſervant being returned, and having delivered his Meſſage to the Earl of <hi>Cambridg</hi> privately, he ſaid. So, it is done now; and then turning to the front of the Scaffold, before which (as in all the reſt of the pallace) there was a great concourſe of people, he ſaid;</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Earl of Cambridg.</speaker>
               <p>I think it is truly not very neceſſary for me to ſpeak much, there are many Gentlemen and Souldiers there that ſees me, but my voyce truly is ſo weak, ſo low, that they cannot hear me, neither truly was <hi>I</hi> ever at any time ſo much in love with ſpeaking, or with any thing <hi>I</hi> had to expreſs, that I took delight in it; yet this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p>(But to that which I was ſaying Sir.) It pleaſed God ſo to diſpoſe that Army under my Command, as it was ruined; and <hi>I,</hi> as their General, clothed with a Commiſſion, ſtand here, now ready to dye; I ſhall not trouble you with repeating of my Plea, what I ſaid in my own Defence at the Court of <hi>JUSTICE,</hi> my ſelf being ſatisfied with
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:114941:6"/>the commands that is laid upon me, and they ſatisfied with the Juſtneſſe of their procedure, according to the Laws of this Land. God is juſt, and howſoever <hi>I</hi> ſhall not ſay any thing as to the matter of the ſentence, but that <hi>I</hi> do willingly ſubmit to his divine Providence, and acknowledge that very many wayes <hi>I</hi> deſerve e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a worldly puniſhment, as well as hereafter, for we are all ſinfull, Sir, and <hi>I</hi> a great one; yet for my comfort <hi>I</hi> know there is a God in heaven that is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding mercifull; <hi>I</hi> know my Redeemer ſits at his right hand, and am confident, (clapping his hand to his breaſt) is mediating for me at this inſtant, <hi>I</hi> am hopefull through his free grace and al-ſufficient me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, to be pardoned of my ſins, and to be received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his mercy, upon that <hi>I</hi> rely, truſting to nothing but the free grace of God through Ieſus Chriſt, <hi>I</hi> have not been tainted with my Religion <hi>I</hi> thank God for it, ſince my infancy it hath been ſuch as hath been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt in the Land, and eſtabliſhed, and now tis not this Religion or that Religion, nor this or that fancie of men that is to be built upon, tis but one that's right, one that's ſure, and that comes from God. Sir, and in the free grace of our Saviour. Sir, there is truly ſomething that
<note n="*" place="margin">Obſerving the Writers.</note> (had <hi>I</hi> thought my ſpeech would have been thus taken,) <hi>I</hi> would have digeſted it into ſome better method then now <hi>I</hi> can, and ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire theſe Gentlemen that does write it, that they will not wrong me in it, and that it may not in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner be publiſhed to my diſadvantage, for truly <hi>I</hi> did not intend to have ſpoken thus when <hi>I</hi> came here.</p>
               <p>There is, ſirs, terrible aſperſions has been laid upon my ſelf; truly ſuch as, I thank God, I am very free
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:114941:7"/>from; as if my actions and intentions had not been ſuch as they were pretended for; but that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding what I pretended it was for the King, there was nothing leſſe intended then to ſerve him in it. <hi>I</hi> was bred with him for many years, <hi>I</hi> was his dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtique ſervant, and there was nothing declar'd by the Parliament that was not really intended by me; and truly in it <hi>I</hi> ventured my life one way, and now <hi>I</hi> loſe it another way: and that was one of the ends, as to the King; <hi>I</hi> ſpeak only of that, becauſe the reſt has many particulars; and to clear my ſelfe from ſo hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid an aſperſion as is laid upon me: neither was there any other deſign known to me by the incoming of that Army, then what is really in the Declaration publiſhed. His perſon, I do profeſſe, <hi>I</hi> had reaſon to love, as he was my King, and as he had been my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter: it has pleaſed God now to diſpoſe of him, ſo as it cannot be thought flatery to have ſaid this, or any end in me for the ſaying of it, but to free my ſelfe from that calumnie which lay upon me: I cannot gain by it; yet Truth is that which we ſhall gain by for ever.</p>
               <p>There hath been much ſpoken, Sir, of an invitation into this Kingdome: it's mentioned in that <hi>Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> and truly to that I did and do remit my ſelf: and I have been very much laboured for diſcoveries of theſe inviters. 'Tis no time to diſſemble. How willing I was to have ſerved this Nation in any thing that was in my power, is known to very many honeſt, pious and religious men; and how ready <hi>I</hi> would have been to have done what <hi>I</hi> could to have ſerved them, if it had pleaſed them to have preſerved my life, in whoſe hands there was a power: They have
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:114941:7"/>not thought it fit, and ſo <hi>I</hi> am become unuſefull in that which willingly I would have done. As <hi>I</hi> ſaid at firſt (Sir) ſo <hi>I</hi> ſay now concerning that point; <hi>I</hi> wiſh the Kingdoms happineſſe, I wiſh its peace; and truly Sir, <hi>I</hi> wiſh that this blood of mine may be the laſt that is drawn: and howſoever I may perhaps have ſome reluctancie with my ſelf as to the matter of my ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for my fact, yet I freely forgive all; Sir, <hi>I</hi> carry no rancour along with me to my grave: His will be done that has created both heaven and earth, and me a poor miſerable ſinfull creature now ſpeaking before him. For me to ſpeak, Sir, to you of State-buſineſſe, and the Government of the Kingdom, or my opinion in that, or for any thing in that nature, Truly it is to no end, it contributes nothing: My own inclination hath been to Peace, from the beginning; and it is known to many, that I never was an ill inſtrument be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the King and his people; <hi>I</hi> never acted to the prejudice of the Parliament; <hi>I</hi> bore no Arms, I medled not with it; I was not wanting by my pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to God almighty for the happineſſe of the King; and truly I ſhall pray ſtill, that God may ſo direct him as that may be done which ſhall tend to his glory, and the peace and happineſſe of the kingdom.</p>
               <p>I have not much more to ſay, that I remember of; I think I have ſpoken of my Religion.</p>

            <p>This execution being done, the Sheriffes Guard went immediately to meet the Earl of <hi>Holland,</hi> which they did in the mid way between the Scaffold and Weſtminſter-Hall, and the Under-Sheriffes ſonne having received him into his charge, conducted him to the Scaffold, he taking M. <hi>Boulton</hi> all the way in his hand, paſſed all along to the Scaffold diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing together; upon which being come, obſerving his voice would not reach to the people, in regard the Guard compaſſed the Scaffold, he ſaid;</p>

               <p>It is to no purpoſe (I think) to ſpeak any thing here. Which way muſt I ſpeak? And
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:114941:11"/>then being directed to the front of the Scaffold, he (leaning over the railes) ſaid, I think it is fit to ſay ſomething, ſince God hath called me to this place. The firſt thing which I muſt profeſſe, is, what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes my Religion, and my breeding, which hath been in a good Family, that hath ever been faithfull to the true Proteſtant Religion, in the which I have been bred, in the which I have lived, and in the which by Gods grace and mercy I ſhall die. I have not lived according to that education I had in that Family where I was born and bred: I hope God wil forgive me my ſins, ſince I conceive that it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much his pleaſure to bring me to this place for the ſins that I have committed. The cauſe that hath brought me hither, I believe by many hath been much miſtaken. They have conceived that I have had ill deſignes to the State, and to the Kingdome: Truly I look upon it as a Judgement, and a juſt Judgement of God; not but I have offended ſo much the State, and the Kingdome, and the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as that I have had an extream vanity in ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them very extraordinarily. For thoſe actions that I have done, I think it is known they have been ever very faithfull to the publique, and very parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly to Parliaments. My affections have been e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver expreſt truly and clearly to them. The diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of affairs now have put things in another po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture then they were when I was ingaged with the Parliament. I have never gone off from thoſe Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples that ever I have profeſſed: I have lived in them, and by Gods grace will die in them. There may be alterations and changes that may carry them further
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:114941:11"/>then I thought reaſonable, and truly there I left them: but there hath been nothing that I have ſaid, or done, or profeſſed, either by Covenant, or Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which hath not been very conſtant, and very clear upon the principles that I ever have gone upon, which was to ſerve the King, the Parliament, Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (I ſhould have ſaid in the firſt place) the Common-Wealth, and to ſeek the Peace of the Kingdome. That made me think it no improper time, being preſt out by accidents and circumſtances, to ſeek the Peace of the Kingdome, which I thought was proper, ſince there was ſomthing then in agitation, but nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed on for ſeeding Propoſitions to the King; that was the furtheſt aim that I had, and truly beyond that I had no intention, none at all. And God be praiſed, although my bloud comes to be ſhed here, there was I think ſcarcely a drop of bloud ſhed in that action that I was ingaged in. For the preſent affairs as they are, I cannot tell how to judge of them: and truly they are in ſuch a condition, as (I conceive) no body can make a judgement of them: and therefore I muſt make uſe of my Prayers, rather then of my opinion, which are, that God would bleſſe this Kingdome, this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, this State; that he would ſettle it in a way agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to what this Kingdome hath been happily gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned under; by a King, by the Lords, by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons: a Government that (I conceive) it hath flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed much under, and I pray God the change of it bring not rather a prejudice, a diſorder, and a confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then the contrary. I look upon the Poſterity of the King, and truly my Conſcience directs me to it, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, that if God be pleaſed that theſe people may look
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:114941:12"/>upon them with that affection that they owe, that they may be called in again, and they may be, not through bloud, nor through diſorder, admitted again into that power, and to that glory that God in their birth intended to them. I ſhall pray with all my ſoule for the happineſſe of this State, of this Nation, that the bloud which is here ſpilt, may be even the laſt which may fall among us and truly I ſhould lay down mylife with as much chearfulneſs as ever perſon did, if I conceived that there would no more bloud fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low us: for a State, or Affairs that are built upon bloud, is a foundation for the moſt part that doth not proſper.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>After the bleſſing that I give to the Nation, to the Kingdom, and truly to the Parliament, I do wiſh with all my heart, happineſſe, and a bleſſing to all thoſe that have been authors in this buſineſſe; and truly that have been authors in this very work that bringeth us hither: I do not onely forgive them, but I pray heartily and really for them, as God will forgive my ſins, ſo I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire God may forgive them.</p>
            <p>I have a particular relation, as I am Chancellour of Cambridge, and truly I muſt here, ſince it is the laſt of my prayers, pray to God that that Univerſity may go on in that happy way which it is in, that God may make it a Nurſery to plant thoſe perſons that may be diſtributed to the Kingdome, that the ſouls of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may receive a great benefit, and a great advantage by them, and (I hope) God will reward them for their kindneſſe, and their affections that I have found from them.
<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Looking towards M.</hi> Bolton.</note> I have ſaid what Religion I have been bred in, what Religion I have been borne in, what Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I have practiſed; I began with it, and I muſt end
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:114941:12"/>with it. I told you that my actions and my life have not been agreeable to my breeding, I have told you likewiſe that the family where I was bred hath been an exemplary family (I may ſay ſo I hope, without vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) of much affection to Religion, and of much faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe to this Kingdome, and to this State. I have indeavoured to do thoſe actions that have become an honeſt man, and which became a good Engliſhman, and which became a good Chriſtian. I have been wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to oblige thoſe that have been in trouble, thoſe that have been in perſecution, and truly I find a great reward of it; for I have found their prayers and their kindneſſe now in this diſtreſſe, and in this condition I am in, and I thinke it a great reward, and I pray God reward them for it.</p>
            <p>I am a great ſinner, and I hope God will be pleaſed to heare my prayers, to give me faith to truſt in him, that as he hath called me to death at this place, he will make it but a paſſage to an eternall life through Jeſus Chriſt, which I truſt to, which I rely upon, and which I expect by the mercy of God. And ſo I pray God bleſſe you all, and ſend that you may ſee this to be the laſt execution, and the laſt bloud that is likely to bee ſpilt among you. And then turning to the ſide-raile, he prayed for a good ſpace of time; after which M. <hi>Bolton</hi> ſaid:</p>
            <p>My Lord, Now look upon him whom you have truſted.</p>
            <p>My Lord, I hope that here is your laſt prayer: there will no more praiers remain, but praiſes: And I hope that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this day is over, there will a day begin that ſhall never have end: And I look upon this (my Lord) the morning of it, the morning of that day. My Lord, you know where your fulneſſe lies, where your riches lie,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:114941:13"/>where is your onely rocke to anchor on. You know there is fulneſſe in Chriſt: If the Lord comes not in with fulneſſe of comfort to you, yet reſolve to wait upon him while you live, and to truſt in him when you die; and then ſay, I will die here, I will pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh at thy feet, I will be found dead at the feet of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. Certainly, he that came to ſeek and ſave loſt ſinners, will not reject loſt ſinners when they come to ſeek him: Hee that intreateth us to come, will not ſleight us when we come to intreat him. My Lord, there is enough there, and fix your heart there, and fix your eyes there, that eye of Faith, and that eye of hope, exerciſe theſe graces now, there will be no exerciſe hereafter. As your Lordſhip ſaid, here take an end of Faith, and take an end of Hope, and take a fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well of Repentance: and all theſe, and welcome God, and welcome Chriſt, and welcome Glory and welcome Happineſſe to all Eternity; and ſo it will be a happy paſſage then, if it bee a paſſage here from miſery to happineſſe. And though it be but a ſad way, yet if it will bring you into the preſence of joy, although it be a valley of tears, although it be a ſhadow of death, yet if God will pleaſe to bring you, and make it a paſſage to that happineſſe, welcome Lord. And I doubt not but God will give you a heart to taſte ſome ſweetneſſe and love in this bitter potion, and to ſee ſomthing of mercy and goodneſſe to you, and ſhew you ſome ſigne and token of good, ſo that your ſoule may ſee that which we have had already experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of (bleſſed be God for it) many experiences, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny expreſſions, not onely in words, but tears; God hath not left us without much comfort nor evidence, and I hope (my Lord) you that have given ſo many
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:114941:13"/>evidences to us, I hope you want none your ſelfe: but that the Lord will be pleaſed to uphold and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port you, and bear up your ſpirit, and if there want e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, there is reliance; my ſecurity lies not in my knowing that I ſhall come to heaven, and come to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but in my reſting and relying upon him: When the Anchor of Faith is throwne out, there may be ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings and toſſings, but there is ſafety; nothing ſhall interrupt ſafety, although ſomthing may interrupt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, my ſafety is ſure, although I apprehend it not: and what if I go to God in the dark? what if I come to him, as <hi>Nicodemus</hi> did, ſtaggering in the night? It is a night of trouble, a night of darkneſſe, though I come trembling and ſtaggering in this night, yet I ſhall be ſure to find comfort &amp; fixedneſſe in him. And the Lord of heaven be the ſtrength, ſtay, and the ſupport of your ſoul, and the Lord furniſh you with all thoſe graces which may carry you into the boſome of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, that when you expire this life, you may be able to expire it into him, in whom you may begin to live to all eternity; and that is my humble prayer.—</p>

               <p>M. <hi>Bolton,</hi> God hath given me long time in this world; he hath carried me through many great accidents of Fortune; he hath at laſt brought me down into a condition, where I find my ſelf brought to an end, for a diſaffection to this State, to this Parliament, that (as I ſaid before) I did believe no body in the world more unlikely to have expected to ſuffer for that Cauſe: I look upon it as a great judgment of God for my ſins. And truly Sir, ſince that the death is violent, I am the leſſe troubled with it, becauſe of thoſe violent deaths that I have ſeen before; principally my Saviour that hath ſhewed us the way, how and in what manner he
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:114941:14"/>hath done it, and for what cauſe, I am the more comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, I am the more rejoyced. It is not long ſince the King my Maſter paſſed in the ſame manner; and truly I hope that his purpoſes &amp; intentions were ſuch, as a man may not be aſhamed, not only to follow him, in the way that was taken with him, but likewiſe not aſhamed of his purpoſes, if God had given him life. I have often diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with him concerning many things of this kind, &amp; I conceive his ſufferings, &amp; his better knowledg &amp; better underſtanding (if God had ſpared him life) might have made him a Prince very happy towards himſelf, &amp; very happy towards this Kingdom. I have ſeen and known, that thoſe bleſſed Soules in heaven have paſſed thither by the gate of ſorrow, &amp; many by the gate of violence: and ſince it is Gods pleaſure to diſpoſe me this way, I ſubmit my ſoul to him, with all comfort, and with all hope, that he hath made this my end, and this my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, that though I be low in death, yet nevertheleſſe this lowneſs ſhal raiſe me to the higheſt glory for ever.</p>
               <p>Truly, I have not ſaid much in publique to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, concerning the particular actions that I conceive I have done by my counſells in this Kingdom; I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive they are well known; it were ſomthing of vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (me thinks) to take notice of them here; He rather die with them, with the comfort of them in my own boſome; and that I never intended in this action, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny action that ever I did in my life, either malice, or bloodſhed, or prejudice to any creature that lives. For that which concernes my Religion, I made my profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion before of it, how I was bred, and in what manner I was bred, in a Family that was looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be no little notorious, in oppoſition to ſome liberties, that they conceived then to bee taken;
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:114941:14"/>and truly, there was ſome marke upon mee, as if I had ſome taint of it, even throughout my whole wayes, that I have taken: every body knowes what my affections have beene, to many that have ſuffered, to many that have beene in troubles in this Kingdome, I endeavoured to relieve them, I endeavoured to oblige them, I thought I was tied ſo by my Conſcience, I thought it by my charity, and truly very much by my breeding; God hath now brought me to the laſt inſtant of my time, all that I can ſay, and all that I can adhere unto is this; That as I am a great ſinner, ſo I have a great Saviour, that as hee hath given mee heere a fortune, to come publiquely in a ſhew of ſhame in the way of this ſuffering (truly I underſtand it not to bee ſo) I underſtand it to bee a glorie, a glorie when I conſider who hath gone before mee, and a glory when I conſider I had no end in it, but what I conceive to bee the ſervice of God, the King, and the Kingdome, and therefore my Heart is not charged much with any thing in that particular, ſince I conceive God will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the intention, whatſoever the action ſeeme to bee. I am going to die, and the Lord receive my Soule: I have no reliance but upon Chriſt, for my ſelfe I doe acknowledge that I am the unworthieſt of ſinners; my life hath beene a vanity, and a continued ſinne, and God may juſtly bring mee to this end, for the finnes I have committed againſt him, and were there nothing elſe, but the iniquities, that I have
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:114941:15"/>committed in the way of my Life, I looke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this as a great juſtice of God to bring me to this ſuffering, and to bring mee to this pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, and thoſe Hands that have beene moſt Active in it, if any ſuch there hath beene, I pray God forgive them, I pray God that there may not bee many ſuch Trophees of their Victories, but that this may bee as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the laſt ſhew, that this people ſhall ſee, of the bloud of perſons of Condition, of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Honor; I might ſay ſomething of the way of our Triall, which certainely hath beene as extraordinary, as any thing I thinke hath ever beene ſeene in this Kingdome; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that I would not ſeem as if I made ſome complaint I will not ſo much, as mention it, becauſe no body ſhall believe I repine at their actions, that I repine at my fortune: It is the Will of God, it is the Hand of God under whom I fall, I take it intirely from him I ſubmit my ſelfe to Him, I ſhall deſire to roule my ſelfe into the Armes of my bleſſed Saviour, and when I come to this
<note n="*" place="margin">Pointing to the Block.</note> place, when I bow downe my ſelfe there, I hope God will raiſe mee up, and when I bid fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, as I muſt now to Hope and to Faith, that love will abide, I know nothing to accompany the ſoule out of this World but love, and I hope that love will bring me to the fountaine of glory in Heaven, through the Armes, Mediation, and the Mercy of my Saviour <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> in whom I believe, O Lord help my unbeliefe.</p>

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:114941:16"/>his Councels, and infinite wiſedome, and mercy, and goodneſſe, beyond which there was a <hi>Non ultra,</hi> in Gods thoughts, when this was the great deſigne, and great end, the ſalvation of ſinners, that poor ſooles ſhould come over to him and live; certainely when ſinners come, hee will not reject, bee will not refuſe. And my Lord, doe but think of this, the greateſt work that ever was done in the World, was the blood of Chriſt that was ſhed, never any thing like it: and this blood of Chriſt that was ſhed, was ſhed for them that come, if not for them, for none, it was in vaine elſe: you ſee the Divells they are out of capacity of good by it, the Angels they have no need of it, wicked men will not come, and there are but a few that come over, and ſhould hee denie them, there were no end nor fruit of the blood and ſufferings of the Lord Jeſus; and had your Lordſhip beene with Chriſt in that bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy agony, when hee was in that bloody ſweat, ſweating drops of blood, if you had asked him. Lord what art thou now a doing, art thou not now reconciling an angry God and me together? art thou not pacifying the wrath of God? art thou not interpoſing thy ſelfe betweene the Juſtice of God and my ſoule? Would hee not have ſaid, yea: and ſurely then hee will not deny it now. My Lord his paſſions are over, his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſions ſtill remaine, and the larger and greater, becauſe hee is gone up into a higher place, that <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ee may throw downe more abundance of his mercy and grace upon you; and my Lord, think
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:114941:16"/>of that infinite love, that abundance of riches in Chriſt: I am loſt, I am empty, I have nothing, I am poore, I am ſinfull: be it ſo, as bad as God will make me, and as vile as I poſſibly can conceive my ſelf, I am willing to be: but when I have ſaid all, the more I advance that riches, and honor that grace of God. And why ſhould I doubt when by this he puts me into a capacity into a diſpoſition for him to ſhew me mercy, that by this I may the better advance the riches of his grace, &amp; ſay grace, grace, to the Lord, to all eternity, that God ſhould owne ſuch a Creature, that deſerves nothing; and the leſſe I deſerve, the more conſpicuous is his Grace: and this is certaine, the riches of his Grace hee throweth amongſt men, that the glory of his Grace might be given to himſelfe, If wee can give him but the glory of his Grace, wee ſhall never doubt to partake of the riches of it, and that fulneſſe, My Lord, that fulneſſe bee your comfort, that fulneſſe of mercy, that fulneſſe of love, that fulneſſe of righteouſneſſe and power bee now your riches, and your only ſtay, and the Lord interpoſe himſelfe between God and you, as your Faith bath endeavored to interpoſe him between God and your ſoule; ſo I doubt not but there he ſtands (my Lord) to plead for you, and when you are not able to do any thing your ſelfe, yet lie downe at the feet of him that is a mercifull Saviour and knowes what you would deſire, and wait upon him while you live, truſt in him when you die, there is riches enough and mercy enough, if hee open not, yet die at his

               <p>THe concluſion that I made with thoſe that ſent me hither, and are the cauſe of this vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent death of mine, ſhall be the beginning of what I ſhall ſay to you: When I made an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to them (which was the laſt) I told them with much ſincerity, That I would pray to the God of all mercies, that they might be partakers of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable and boundleſs mercies in Jeſus Chriſt, and truly, I ſtill pray that Prayer; and I beſeech the God of Heaven, forgive any injury they have done to me, from my ſoul I wiſh it. And truly, this I tell you, as a Chriſtian, to let you ſee I am a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian; but it is neceſſary I ſhould tell you ſomewhat more, That I am a Proteſtant: And truly, I am a Proteſtant, and very much in love with the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it, after the maner as it was eſtabliſhed in <hi>England</hi> by the Thirty nine Articles; a bleſſed way of profeſſion, and ſuch a one, as truly, I never knew none ſo good: I am ſo far from being a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt, which ſome body have (truly) very unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily at ſome time charged me withal, that truly, I profeſs to you, that though I love good works, and commend good works, yet I hold, They have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all to do in the matter of Salvation; my Anchor-hold is this, <hi>That Chriſt loved me, and gave himſelf for me,</hi> that is that that I reſt upon. And truly, ſomething I ſhall ſay to you as a Citizen of the whole world, and in that conſideration I am here condemned to dye: Truly, contrary to the Law that governs all the world; that is, The Law of the Sword: I had the protection of that for my
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:114941:21"/>life, and the honor of it; but truly, I will not trouble you much with that, becauſe in another place I have ſpoken very largely and liberally about it, I believe you will hear by other means, what Arguments I uſed in that caſe: But truly, that that is ſtranger, you that are Engliſh men, behold here an Engliſh man now before you, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged a Peer, not condemned to dye by any Law of <hi>England,</hi> not by any Law of <hi>England;</hi> Nay, ſhall I tell you more (which is ſtrangeſt of all) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all the Laws of <hi>England</hi> that I know of. And truly, I will tell you, in the matter of the Civil part of my death, and the cauſe that I have main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, I dye (I take it) for maintaining the fifth Commandment, injoyned by God himſelf, which injoyns reverence and obedience to Parents: All Divines on all hands, though they contradict one another in many ſeveral Opinions, yet all Divines on all hands, do acknowledge, that here is intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Magiſtracy and Order; and certainly I have obeyed that Magiſtracy and that Order under which I have lived, which I was bound to obey; and truly, I do ſay very confidently, that I do dye here for keeping, for obeying that fifth Commandment given by God himſelf, and written with his own finger. And now Gentlemen, I will take this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to tell you, That I cannot imitate a better nor a greater ingenuity then his, that ſaid of himſelf, <hi>For ſuffering an unjuſt judgement upon another, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was brought to ſuffer by an unjuſt judgement.</hi> Truly Gentlemen, that God may be glorified, that all men that are concerned in it may take the occaſion of it, of humble repentance to God Almighty for it, I do
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:114941:21"/>here profeſs to you, that truly I did give my Vote to that Bill of the E. of <hi>Strafford,</hi> I doubt not but God Almighty hath waſhed that away with a more preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous blood, &amp; that is, with the blood of his own Son, and my dear Savior Jeſus Chriſt, and I hope he will waſh it away from all thoſe that are guilty of it; truly, this I may ſay, I had not the leaſt part nor the leaſt degree of malice in the doing of it; but I muſt confeſs again to Gods glory, and the accuſation of mine own frailty, and the frailty of my Nature, that truly it was an unworthy Cowardize, not to reſiſt ſo great a torrent as carried that buſineſs at that time. And truly, this I think I am moſt guilty of, of not courage enough in it, but malice I had none; but whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it was, God I am ſure hath pardoned it, hath given me the aſſurance of it, that Chriſt Jeſus his blood hath waſhed it away; and truly, I do from my ſoul wiſh, That all men that have any ſtain by it, may ſeriouſly repent, and receive a remiſſion and pardon from God for it. And now Gentlemen, we have had an occaſion by this intimation to remember his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, our King that laſt was; and I cannot ſpeak of him, nor think of it, but truly, I muſt needs ſay, That in my Opinion, that have had time to conſider all the Images of all the greateſt and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſeſt Princes in the world; and truly, in my O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, there was not a more vertuous, and more ſufficient Prince known in the world, then our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious King <hi>Charls</hi> that dyed laſt: God Almighty preſerve our King that now is, his Son; God ſend him more fortunate and longer days; God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty ſo aſſiſt him, that he may exceed both the vertues and ſufficiencies of his Father: For certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:114941:22"/>I that have been a Counſellor to him, and have lived long with him, and in a time when diſcovery is eaſily enough made, for he was yong (he was about thirteen, fourteen, fifteen or ſixteen years of age) thoſe years I was with him, truly, I never ſaw greater hopes of vertue in any yong perſon then in him; great Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, great Underſtanding, great Apprehenſion, much Honor in his Nature, and truly, a very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Engliſh man in his inclination; and I pray God reſtore him to this Kingdom, and Unite the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms one unto another, and ſend a great happineſs both to you and to him, that he may long live and Reign among you, and that that Family may Raign till thy Kingdom come, that is, while all Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Power is conſummated: I beſeech God of his mercy, give much happineſs to this your King, and to you that in it ſhall be his Subjects, by the grace of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Truly, I like my beginning ſo well, that I will make my concluſion with it, that is, That God Almighty would confer of his infinite and ineſtimable grace and mercy, to thoſe that are the cauſers of my coming hither, I pray God give them as much mercy as their own hearts can wiſh; and truly, for my part, I will not accuſe any one of them of malice, truly I will not, nay, I will not think there was any malice in them; what other ends there is, I know not, nor I will not examine, but let it be what it will, from my very ſoul I forgive them every one: And ſo, the Lord of Heaven bleſs you all, God Almighty be infinite in goodneſs and mercy to you, and direct you in thoſe ways of obedience to his commands to his Majeſty, that this Kingdom may be a happy and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:114941:22"/>glorious Nation again, and that your King may be a happy King in ſo good and ſo obedient people; God Almighty keep you all, God Almighty preſerve this Kingdom, God Almighty preſerve you all.</p>
               <p>Then turning about, and looking for the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner (who was gone off the Scaffold) ſaid, Which is the Gentleman? which is the man?

And then turning to one of his Servants, ſaid, <hi>Baldwin,</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee any thing that belongs to my wife; but I muſt deſire thee to beſeech her to reſt wholly upon Jeſus Chriſt, and be contented and fully ſatisfied: and then ſpeaking to his Servants, he ſaid, God keep you; and Gentlemen, let me now do a buſineſs quickly, privately, and pray let me have your Prayers at the moment of death, that God would receive my ſoul.</p>
