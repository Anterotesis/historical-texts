         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE UNDECEIVING
OF THE PEOPLE
In the point of
TITHES.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mongſt thoſe <hi>popular</hi> deceits which have been ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
of late to abuſe the people, there is not any
one which hath been cheriſhed with more endeer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
then a perſwaſion put into them of not
paying <hi>Tithes:</hi> partly, becauſe it carrieth no ſmall
ſhew of <hi>profit</hi> with it, but principally as it ſeemes a conducible
means to make the <hi>Clergy</hi> more obnoxious to them, and to ſtand
more at their devotion then they have done formerly. Upon
theſe hopes, it hath been the endeavours of ſome leading men
to repreſent it to the reſt as a <hi>publick grievance,</hi> that the <hi>Clergy</hi>
being but an handfull of men in compariſon of all the reſt of the
kingdome, ſhould goe away with the <hi>tenth</hi> (or as ſome ſay, the
<hi>ſixth</hi> part) of the fruits of the earth; and that the <hi>Miniſter</hi> ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
ſtill in his contemplations, ſhould live upon the ſweat of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mens brows, and taking pains amongſt the people but one
day in ſeven, ſhould have the <hi>tenth part of their eſtates</hi> allotted
to them for their maintenance. And 'tis no marvel if ſome few,
on theſe miſ-perſwaſions, have importuned the high Court of
<hi>Parliament</hi> from time to time with troubleſome and clamorous
<hi>Petitions</hi> to redreſſe this wrong; and put them up alſo in the
name of whole <hi>Counties</hi> (although the generality of thoſe <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
had no hand therein) to adde the greater credit and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to them. In which deſigne, although they have prevailed no
further on the two houſes of <hi>Parliament,</hi> then to be ſent away
with this generall promiſe, <hi>that in due time their</hi> Petitions
<hi>ſhould be taken into conſideration;</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">As in the anſwer to thoſe of Hartford, Kent, &amp;c.</note> and that it was the pleaſure
of the ſeveral and reſpective Houſes, that in the mean ſeaſon they
ſhould <hi>take care that</hi> Tithes <hi>be duly paid according to Law:</hi> yet
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:116283:3"/>
they which have eſpouſed the quarrell, will not ſo be ſatisfied.
For when it pleaſed the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> to ſet out an <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance</hi>
bearing date <hi>Novemb. 8. 1644. for the true payment of</hi>
Tithes <hi>and other duties according to the Laws and Cuſtomes of this
Realm;</hi> there came out preſently a pamphlet entituled, <hi>The Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting
of the Ordinance for Tithes;</hi> followed &amp; backed by many
a ſcandalous paper of the ſelf-ſame ſtrain. And when it ſeemed
good to the ſaid <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons,</hi> on the precipitancy of
ſome of the <hi>Clergy</hi> under ſequeſtration, to ſet out their <hi>additio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Ordinance</hi> of the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Auguſt, anno</hi> 1647. it was encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
preſently with a ſcurrilous pamphlet, entituled, <hi>A Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for a day of thanksgiving to the</hi> Parliament <hi>for their late Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
for</hi> Tithes, <hi>newly mounted and well charged with treble da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages,
for the peoples not giving the</hi> tenth part of their eſtates
<hi>to the Clergy or Impropriators.</hi> And this, according to the ſtyle
of thoſe <hi>Petitions,</hi> is ſaid to bee the <hi>reſult of the Parliaments
friends in Hartfordſhire;</hi> though I am verily perſwaded that
few, if any of the Gentry and men of quality in the County,
were acquainted with it. But be it the <hi>reſult</hi> of few or many of
the <hi>Parliaments</hi> friends (though I conceive they are but back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friends
to the <hi>Parliament,</hi> who ſet ſo ſleight a value on their
Conſtitutions) the Title doth afford two things worthy conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration:
Firſt, that the maintenance of the <hi>Clergy</hi> here by
Law eſtabliſhed, is ſaid to bee by giving to them the tenth
part of every mans eſtate: and ſecondly, that the blow goes
higher then before it did, and aims not onely at the deveſting
of the <hi>Church</hi> of her ancient <hi>Patrimony,</hi> but at the depriving of
the <hi>Gentry</hi> of their <hi>Impropriations,</hi> which many of them hold by
leaſe, many by inheritance, all by as good a title as the Law
can make them. I know there hath been great pains taken by
ſome learned men, to ſtate the <hi>Inſtitution</hi> and <hi>Right</hi> of <hi>Tithes,</hi>
and ſeverall judicious Tractates have been writ about it: which
notwithſtanding have not found ſuch entertainment as they did
deſerve: partly, becauſe being written in an <hi>Argumentative</hi> way,
they were above the reach of the vulgar Reader; but princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally,
becauſe written by men ingaged in the cauſe, and ſuch as
might be by aſſed with their own intereſſe in it. For my part, I
am free from all thoſe ingagements which may incline mee to
write any thing for my private ends, being one that payeth <hi>Tithes</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:116283:3"/>
and ſuch other duties as the <hi>Lawes</hi> and <hi>Ordinances</hi> doe injoyn.
And though I ſit far off from the fountain of buſineſſe, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
poſſibly ſee at ſo great a diſtance, what might beſt ſatisfie the
doubts and clamours of unquiet men: yet I ſhall venture to
ſay ſomewhat in a modeſt way towards the <hi>Vndeceiving of the
People</hi> in this point of <hi>Tithes,</hi> whoſe judgements have been cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated
by thoſe miſ-perſwaſions, which cunningly have been
communicated and infuſed into them. And I ſhall doe it in a
way, (if I gueſſe aright) which hath not yet been travelled in
this preſent point; ſuch as I hope will ſatisfie all them of the
adverſe party, but thoſe who are reſolved before-hand, that they
will not be ſatisfied. For whereas the whole controverſie turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
on theſe three hinges: firſt, that the maintenance allowed
the <hi>Clergy</hi> is too great for their calling, eſpecially conſidering
the ſmall number of them: ſecondly, that it is made up out of
<hi>the tenth part of each mans eſtate;</hi> and thirdly, that the changing
of this way by the payment of <hi>Tithes</hi> into that of <hi>Stipends,</hi>
would be more gratefull to the <hi>Countrey,</hi> and more eaſe to the
<hi>Clergy:</hi> I ſhall accordingly reduce this ſmall diſcourſe unto
theſe three heads. Firſt, I will ſhew, that never any <hi>Clergy</hi> in
the Church of God hath been, or is maintained with leſſe charge
to the Subject, then the eſtabliſhed <hi>Clergy</hi> of the Church of
<hi>England.</hi> Secondly, that there is no man in the Realm of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
who payeth any thing of his own towards the maintenance
of his Pariſh-Miniſter, but his Eaſter Offering. And thirdly, that
the changing of <hi>Tithes</hi> into <hi>Stipends,</hi> would bring greater trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the <hi>Clergy,</hi> then is yet conſidered, and far leſſe profit to
the <hi>Countrey,</hi> then is now pretended. Theſe <hi>Propoſitions</hi> being
proved, (which I doubt not of) I hope I ſhall receive no check
for my undertaking, conſidering that I doe it of a good intent
to free the <hi>Parliament</hi> from the trouble of the like Petitions,
and that the common people being diſabuſed, may quietly and
chearfully diſcharge their <hi>duties</hi> according to the Laws eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and live together with that unity and godly love which
ought to be between a <hi>Miniſter</hi> and his <hi>Congregation.</hi> This is the
ſum of my deſigne, which if I can effect, it is all I aim at: And
with this <hi>Declaration</hi> of my minde and meaning, I truſt this
ſhort diſcourſe of mine will be, if not applauded, yet at leaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed.
Firſt then I am to prove this point:</p>

or is maintained with leſſe charge to the Subject, then

               <p>For proof of this, we muſt behold the Church of God, as it
ſtood under the <hi>Law</hi> in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and as it now ſtands

<hi>males</hi> of the <hi>Tribes</hi> of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> were to appear thrice yearly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lord, and none of them came empty-handed: and that
if any had detained any thing in part or in whole, which was
due by law, he was to bring a <hi>Ramme</hi> for an offering, to make
good that which was detained, and to adde a fift part to it in
the way of recompenſe. Beſides, theſe duties were brought in to
the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Levites</hi> without charge or trouble. And if any
for their own eaſe deſired not to pay in kinde, but to redeem the
ſame for a ſumme of money; the eſtimation of the due was to be
made by the <hi>Prieſt</hi>
                  <note n="e" place="margin">Lev. 27. 12, 13.</note>; and a fifth part added, as before, for full
ſatisfaction. In a word, ſuch and ſo many allowances had the
<hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Levites,</hi> that ſetting by the <hi>Tithes</hi> of their corn and
cattell and of all manner of increaſe; their maintenance had
far exceeded that of the <hi>Engliſh Clergy;</hi> and adding unto theſe
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:116283:4"/>
the <hi>Tithes</hi> of all creatures tithable, it doth more then double it.
For in the payment of their <hi>Tithes</hi> by the Lords appointment,
there was not only a full <hi>tenth</hi> of all kinds of increaſe, but ſuch an
impoſition laid on all kinds of grain, as came to more then a <hi>ſixt</hi>
part of the crop it ſelf: inſomuch that of 6000 buſhels, 1121 ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crued
unto the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Levites;</hi> 4779. remaining only to the
Husbandman. For firſt, out of 6000 buſhels (and ſo according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in all after that proportion) a <hi>ſixtieth</hi> part at leaſt, (and that
they tearmed the <hi>Therumah</hi> of the <hi>evill eye,</hi> or the niggards <hi>firſt-fruits</hi>)
was to bee ſet apart for the firſt-fruits of the threſhing
floor; which was one hundred in the totall. Out of the reſidue,
being 5900 buſhels, the firſt <hi>Tithe</hi> payable to the <hi>Levites,</hi> which
lived diſperſed and intermingled in the reſt of the Tribes, came
to 590 buſhels; and of the reſidue being 5310 buſhels, 531 were
paid for the <hi>ſecond</hi> Tithe unto the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> which miniſtred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lord in his holy Temple; yet ſo, that ſuch as would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
the trouble of carrying it in kinde unto <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> might
pay the price thereof in money according to the eſtimate which
the <hi>Prieſts</hi> made of it. To which a fift part being added (as in
other caſes) did ſo improve this Tithe to the <hi>Prieſts</hi> advantage;
as that which being paid in kind, was but tenne in the hundred,
being thus altered into money, made no leſſe then threeſcore.
Now lay theſe ſeverall ſums together, and of 6000 buſhels, as
before was ſaid, there will accrew 1121 to the <hi>Prieſt</hi> and <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite,</hi>
and but 4779 to the Lord or Tenant. By which accompt
the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Levites</hi> in the tithing of 6000 buſhels, received
twice as much within a little, as is poſſeſſed or claimed by the
<hi>Engliſh Clergy,</hi> even where the <hi>Tithes</hi> are beſt paid, without any
exemptions, which are ſo frequent in this Kingdome.</p>
               <p>But then perhaps it will be ſaid, that the <hi>Levites</hi> made up
one of the twelve <hi>Tribes</hi> of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and having no inheritance
amongſt the reſt but the <hi>Tithes</hi> and <hi>Offerings,</hi> beſides the 48
Cities before mentioned, were to bee ſettled in way of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
correſpondent unto that proportion. But ſo it is not in
the caſe of the <hi>Engliſh Clergy,</hi> who are ſo far from being one in
twelve or thirteen at moſt, that they are hardly one for an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred;
or as a late pamphlet doth infer, not one for five hundred;
<note n="f" place="margin">Tithe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatherers no Goſpel-Miniſters.</note> who on this ſuppoſition, that there are 500 men and women
in a Countrey pariſh, the lands whereof are worth 2000 l. <hi>per
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:116283:5"/>
annum,</hi> and that the <hi>Miniſter</hi> goeth away with 400 l. a year of
the ſaid two thouſand: concludeth, that hee hath as much for
his own particular, as any ſixſcore of the pariſh, ſuppoſing them
to be all poor or all rich alike: and then cries out againſt it as
the <hi>greateſt cheat and robberie</hi> that was ever practiſed. But the
anſwer unto this is eaſie, I would there were no greater dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
to perplexe the Church. Firſt, for the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> it is
plain and evident, that though it paſſe commonly by the name of
a <hi>Tribe,</hi> yet was it none of the <hi>twelve</hi> Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the houſe
of <hi>Joſeph</hi> being ſub-divided into two whole Tribes, thoſe name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> which made up the twelve. And
ſecondly, it is as evident, that it fell ſo ſhort of the proportion of
the other tribes, as not to make a ſixtieth part of the houſe of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob.</hi>
For in the general muſter which was made of the other tribes,
of men of 20 years and upwards, ſuch onely as were fit for arms
and ſuch publick ſervices, the number of them came unto 63550
fighting men; to which if we ſhould adde all thoſe which were
under 20 years and unfit for ſervice, the number would at leaſt
be doubled. But the <hi>Levites</hi> being all reckoned from a month
old and above, their number was but 22000 in all, (of which
ſee <hi>Num. 1. 46. &amp;</hi> 3. 39.) which came not to ſo many by 273
as the onely <hi>firſt-born</hi> of the other <hi>Tribes:</hi> and therefore when
the Lord took the <hi>Levites</hi> for the <hi>firſt-born</hi> of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the odde
273 were redeemed according to the Law, at five <hi>ſhekels</hi> a man,
and the money which amounted to 1365 <hi>ſhekels</hi> was given to
<hi>Aaron</hi> and his ſons, <hi>Num.</hi> 7. 47, 48. Which ground ſo laid accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the holy Scriptures, let us next take a view of the <hi>Engliſh
Clergy,</hi> and allowing but one for every pariſh, there muſt bee
9725, according to the number of the pariſh Churches; or ſay
ten thouſand in the totall, the reſidue being made up of <hi>Curates</hi>
officiating in the Chappels of Eaſe throughout the Kingdome:
and reckoning in all their male children from a month old and
upwards, the number muſt be more then trebled. For although
many of the dignified and beneficed <hi>Clergy</hi> doe lead ſingle lives,
yet that defect is liberally ſupplied by ſuch married <hi>Curates,</hi> as
do officiate under them in their ſeverall Churches. And then, as
to the diſproportion which is ſaid to be between the <hi>Clergy</hi> and
the reſt of the people, one to five hundred at the leaſt: the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
is ill grounded, the collection worſe. For firſt, the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:116283:5"/>
computation ought not to be made between the <hi>Miniſter</hi> and all
the reſt of the pariſh, men, women, and children, Maſters, and
Dames, men-ſervants, &amp; maid-ſervants, and the ſtranger which is
within the gates; but between him and ſuch whoſe eſtates are
<hi>Titheable,</hi> and they in moſt pariſhes are the ſmalleſt number.
For ſetting by all children which live under their parents, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
apprentices, artificers, day-labourers, and poor indigent
people: none of all which have any intereſt in the <hi>Titheable</hi>
lands: the number of the reſidue will be found ſo ſmall, that
probably the <hi>Miniſter</hi> may make one of the ten, and ſo poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe
no more then his own ſhare comes to. And then how mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably
weak is the <hi>Collection</hi> w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is made from thence, that this
one man ſhould have as much as any ſixſcore of the reſt of the
pariſh, (ſuppoſing that the pariſh did contain 500 perſons) or
that his having of ſo much were a <hi>cheat and robbery?</hi> And as for
that objection which I find much ſtood on, that the <hi>Levites</hi> had
no other inheritance but the <hi>Tithes</hi> and offerings, <hi>Numb.</hi> 18. 23.
whereas the <hi>Engliſh Clergy</hi> are permitted to purchaſe lands, and
to inherit ſuch as deſcend unto them; the anſwer is ſo eaſie, it
will make it ſelfe. For let the <hi>Tithes</hi> enjoyed by the <hi>Engliſh
Clergy</hi> deſcend from them to their poſterity, from one generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to another, as did the <hi>Tithes</hi> and <hi>Offerings</hi> on the <hi>Tribe</hi> of
<hi>Levi:</hi> and I perſwade my ſelf, that none of them will be buſied
about purchaſing lands, or be an eye-ſore to the people in having
more to live on then their <hi>Tithes</hi> and <hi>Offerings.</hi> Til that be done,
excuſe them if they doe provide for their wives and children, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Lawes both of God and Nature. And ſo much
for the <hi>parallel</hi> in point of maintenance, between the <hi>Clergy</hi> of
this Church and the Tribe of <hi>Levi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Proceed we next unto the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> at the firſt
plantation, during the lives of the Apoſtles, and the times next
following; and we ſhall finde, that though they did not actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
receive <hi>Tithes</hi> of the people, yet they ſtill kept on foot
their right; and in the mean time, till they could enjoy them in
a peaceable way, were ſo provided for of all kind of neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
that there was nothing wanting to their contentation.
Firſt, that they kept on foot their <hi>Right,</hi> and thought that <hi>Tithes</hi>
belonged as properly to the <hi>Evangelicall Prieſthood,</hi> as unto the
<hi>Legall:</hi> ſeems evident unto me by S. <hi>Pauls</hi> diſcourſe: who
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:116283:6"/>
proves <hi>Melchiſedeks Prieſthood</hi> by theſe two arguments: firſt,
that he <hi>bleſſed Abraham;</hi> and ſecondly, that he <hi>tithed</hi> him, or
received <hi>Tithes</hi> of him. For though in our <hi>Engliſh</hi> tranſlation
it be onely ſaid, that he <hi>received Tithes of Abraham,</hi> which might
imply that <hi>Abraham</hi> gave them as a gift, or a free-will-offering,
and that <hi>Melchiſedek</hi> received them in no other ſenſe: yet
in the <hi>Greek</hi> it is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which in plain <hi>Engliſh</hi>
is, that he <hi>tithed Abraham,</hi> and took them of him as his due,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 6. If then our Saviour be a <hi>Prieſt after the order of Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedek,</hi>
as no doubt he is, hee muſt have power to <hi>tithe</hi> the
people as well as to <hi>bleſſe</hi> them, or elſe he comes not home to
the <hi>type</hi> or figure: which power of <hi>Tithing</hi> of the people, or
receiving <hi>Tithes</hi> of them, ſince he exerciſeth not in perſon; it
ſeems to me to follow upon very good conſequence, that hee
hath devolved this part of his power on thoſe whom he hath
called and authoriſed for to <hi>bleſſe</hi> the people. Certain I am, the
Fathers of the Primitive times, though they enjoyed not <hi>Tithes</hi>
in <hi>ſpecie,</hi> by reaſon that the Church was then unſettled, and as
it were in motion to the land of reſt, (in which condition thoſe
of <hi>Iſrael</hi> paid no <hi>Tithes</hi> to <hi>Levi</hi>) yet they ſtill kept their claim
unto them, as appears clearly out of <hi>Origen,</hi> and ſome other
Ancients. And of this truth I think no queſtion need be made
amongſt knowing men. The only queſtion will be this, Whether
the maintenance which they had till the <hi>Tithes</hi> were paid, were
not as chargeable to the people as the <hi>Tithes</hi> now are (ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
that the <hi>Tithes</hi> were the ſubjects own). For my part I
conceive it was, the people of thoſe plous times not thinking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing too much to beſtow on God, for the encouragement
of his <hi>Miniſters,</hi> and the reward of his Prophets. They had not
elſe <hi>ſold off their lands and houſes, and brought the prices of the
things which were ſold, and laid them at the Apoſtles feet,</hi> as we
know they did, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 34, 35. but that they meant that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
ſhould ſupply their own wants out of thoſe oblations,
as well as the neceſſities of their poorer brethren. I trow, the
ſelling of all, and truſting it to the diſpenſing of their <hi>Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi>
was matter of more charge to ſuch as had <hi>lands and houſes,</hi>
then paying the <hi>tenth</hi> part of their houſe-rent, or the <hi>Tithe</hi> of
their lands. And when this cuſtome was laid by, (as poſſibly it
might end with the Apoſtles themſelves) the <hi>offerings</hi> which
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:116283:6"/>
ſucceeded in the place thereof, and are required or enjoyned by
the <hi>Apoſtolicall Canons,</hi> were ſo great and manifold, that there
was nothing neceſſary to the life of man, as honey, milke, fowl,
fleſh, grapes, corn, oyl, frankincenſe, fruits of the ſeaſon, yea
ſtrong drink, and ſweet mears, which was not liberally offered
on the Altars, or oblation-Tables: inſomuch as the Authour
of the Book called the <hi>Holy Table, name, and thing, &amp;c.</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his ſcornfull manner, ſaith of them, that they were ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Panteries, Larders, or Store-houſes, then ſo many conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Altars. And though he make thoſe <hi>Canons</hi> but as ſo <hi>many
Pot-guns,</hi> yet as great <hi>Criticks</hi> as himſelfe eſteeme otherwiſe
of them, as his <hi>Antagoniſt</hi> in that quarrell proves ſufficiently. And
as for that particular <hi>Canon</hi> which requires theſe <hi>offerings,</hi> it is
but an exemplification or particularizing of that which is more
generally preſcribed by S. <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 6. 6. where he enjoyneth
him that is <hi>taught to communicate to him that teacheth him,</hi> in
omnibus bonis, <hi>in all his goods,</hi> as the <hi>Rhemiſts</hi> read it very
rightly, &amp; not in <hi>all good things,</hi> as our late tranſlation. Now this
<hi>Injunction</hi> reacheth to all ſorts of people, to the poor as well as
to the rich, as appears plainly by a paſſage in S. <hi>Cyprians</hi> works,
where he upbraids a wealthy widow for coming empty-handed,
and without her offering to the Altar of God, and eating of
that part of the ſacrifice which the poor had offered<note n="g" place="margin">Locuples &amp; dives in dominicum ſine ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficio venis, &amp; partem ſacrificii quod pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per obtulit ſumis. Cyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de piet. &amp; Eleemoſ.</note>. To the
improvement of the maintenance of him that teacheth, not
only the rich men were to offer out of <hi>their abundance,</hi> but the
poor woman alſo was to bring her <hi>Mite.</hi> They had not elſe
come home to Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> commandment, which reacheth unto
all ſorts of people without any exception; to every one accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to that meaſure of fortune which <hi>God</hi> hath given him:
Which clearly ſheweth, that though the payment of <hi>Tithes</hi> fall
heavier upon landed men, then poſſibly it might doe in the
<hi>Primitive times,</hi> before the Church was in a condition to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
her rights: yet ſpeaking generally of the people of a
Church or pariſh, the charge was greater to them then, then
it hath been ſince; the greateſt numbers of the people being freed
from <hi>Tithes,</hi> (becauſe they have no lands from whence <hi>Tithes</hi>
are payable) who could not be diſcharged from the communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their goods and ſubſtance without a manifeſt neglect of
Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Injunction. More then this yet, beſides what was
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:116283:7"/>
communicated in a private way, for the incouragement and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of him that <hi>taught;</hi> which we may well conceive to be no
ſmall matter: the publick offerings of the people were of ſo
great conſequence, as did not onely ſerve to maintain the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop,</hi>
according to his place and calling, and to provide alſo for
the <hi>Prieſts</hi> or <hi>Miniſters</hi> which ſerved under him; but alſo to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the poor and repair their Churches<note n="h" place="margin">Beda in hiſtor Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſ. l. 1.</note>. And therefore cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
the faithfull of thoſe times were generally at more charge
to maintain their <hi>Miniſtery,</hi> then the Subject is with us in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
the greateſt part of which by far pay no <hi>Tithes</hi> at all to
the <hi>Pariſh-Miniſter,</hi> and no man any thing at all towards the
maintenance of the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> as in former days.</p>
               <p>Follow we our deſigne through ſeverall Countries, and we
ſhall finde the <hi>Clergy</hi> of moſt parts in <hi>Chriſtendome,</hi> either
more plentifully endowed, or elſe maintained with greater
charge unto the Subject, then the <hi>Clergy</hi> of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
In <hi>France,</hi> the Authour of the <hi>Cabinet</hi> computes the <hi>Tithes</hi>
and temporall <hi>Revenues</hi> of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> beſides proviſions of all
ſorts, to 80 millions of Crowns; but his accompt is diſallowed
by all knowing men. <hi>Bodin</hi> reporteth from the mouth of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieur
d' Alemant,</hi> one of the Preſidents of Accompts in <hi>Paris,</hi> that
they amount to 12 millions, and 300000 of their <hi>Livres,</hi> which
is 1230000 l. of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> mony; and he himſelf conceives
that they poſſeſſe ſeven parts of twelve of the whole Revenues
of that kingdome. The book inſcribed <hi>Comment d' Eſtat</hi> gives
a lower eſtimate, and reckoning that there are in <hi>France</hi> 200
millions of <hi>Arpens,</hi> which is a meaſure ſomewhat bigger then
our Acre, aſſigneth 47 millions, which is neer a fourth part
of the whole, to the <hi>Gallican</hi> Clergy. But which of theſe ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it be we think fit to ſtand to, it is reſolved by them all that
the <hi>Baiſe manie,</hi> which conſiſts of offerings, Churchings, Burials,
Diriges, and ſuch other caſualties, amounteth to as much <hi>per
annum,</hi> as their ſtanding rents: upon which ground, Sir <hi>Edwin
Sandys</hi> computeth their Revenue at ſix millions yearly. In <hi>Italy,</hi>
beſides the temporall eſtate of the Popes of <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>Clergy</hi>
are conceived to have in ſome places a third part of the whole;
but in moſt a moyetie. In <hi>Spain,</hi> the certain rents of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhoprick
of <hi>Toledo,</hi> are ſaid to be no leſſe then 300000 Crowns
<hi>per annum;</hi> which is far more then all the Biſhops, Deans, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:116283:7"/>
Prebendaries, do poſſeſſe in <hi>England.</hi> In <hi>Germany,</hi> the Biſhops
for the moſt part are powerfull Princes; and the <hi>Canons</hi> of
ſome Churches of ſo fair an <hi>Intrado,</hi> and of ſuch eſtimation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the people, that the Emperours have thought it no
diſparagement to them, to have a <hi>Canons</hi> place in ſome of their
churches. And as for the <hi>Parochial</hi> Clergy in theſe three laſt coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
eſpecially in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> where the people are more
ſuperſtitious then they be in <hi>Germany,</hi> there is no queſtion but
that the <hi>Vailes</hi> and <hi>Caſualties</hi> are as beneficiall to them, as
the <hi>Baiſe manie</hi> to the <hi>French.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But here perhaps it will be ſaid that this is nothing unto us
of the Realm of <hi>England,</hi> who have ſhook off the ſuperſtitions
of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that our pains is ſpent but to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
purpoſe, unleſſe we can make good our <hi>Theſis</hi> in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
<hi>Proteſtant.</hi> We muſt therefore caſt about again: and firſt,
beginning with <hi>France,</hi> as before we did, we ſhall finde that
thoſe of the <hi>Reformed</hi> party there, not onely pay their <hi>Tithes</hi>
to the <hi>Beneficiary,</hi> who is preſented by the Patron to the Cure
or title; or to the Church or Monaſtery to, which the <hi>Tithes</hi>
are ſettled by <hi>Appropriations;</hi> but over and above do raiſe an
yearly maintenance for thoſe that miniſter amongſt them. Juſt
as the <hi>Iriſh Papiſts</hi> pay their <hi>Tithes</hi> and duties unto the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant</hi>
Incumbent, and yet maintain their own Prieſts too by their
gifts &amp; offerings; or as the people in ſome places with us in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
doe pay their <hi>Tithes</hi> unto the Parſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or Vicar whom the
Law ſets over them, and raiſe a contribution alſo for their <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturer,</hi>
whom they ſet over themſelves. In other Countries where
the ſupream Governours are <hi>Reformed</hi> or <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> the caſe is
ſomewhat better with the common people, although not gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
ſo eaſie as with us in <hi>England.</hi> For there the <hi>Tithes</hi> are
taken up by the Prince or State, and yearly penſions aſſigned
out of them to maintain the <hi>Miniſters;</hi> which for the moſt part
are ſo ſmall, and ſo far ſhort of a <hi>competency</hi> (though by that
name they love to call it) that the Subject having paid his <hi>Tithes</hi>
to the Prince or State, is fain to adde ſomething out of his purſe,
towards the mending of the Stipend. Beſides, there being for
the moſt part in every Church two diſtinct ſorts of <hi>Miniſters,</hi>
that is to ſay, a <hi>Paſtor</hi> who hath Cure of ſouls, and performs
all <hi>Miniſteriall</hi> offices in his congregation; and a <hi>Doctor</hi> (like
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:116283:8"/>
our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lectures, which took hint from hence) who onely
medleth with the Word. The <hi>Paſtor</hi> onely hath his Stipend
from the publick Treaſurer, the <hi>Doctor</hi> being maintained whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
(as I am credibly informed) at the charge of the people: and
that not onely by the bounty or benevolence of landed men, but
in the way of <hi>Contribution,</hi> from which no ſort of people of
what rank ſoever, but ſuch as live on alms or the poore mans
box, is to be exempted. But this is onely in the churches of <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vins</hi>
platform, thoſe of the <hi>Lutheran</hi> party in <hi>Denmark, Sweth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and high <hi>Germany,</hi> having their <hi>Tithes</hi> and Glebe they
had before; and ſo much more in <hi>offerings</hi> then with us in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
by how much they come neerer to the church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
both in their practiſe and opinions, (eſpecially in the point of
the holy Sacrament) then the <hi>Engliſh</hi> doe. And as for our dear
brethren of the <hi>Kirk</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who cannot be ſo ſoon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
by a true born <hi>Engliſh</hi> man, the <hi>Tithes</hi> being ſettled
for the moſt part on <hi>Religious</hi> houſes, came in their fall, unto
the Crown, and out of them a third was granted to maintain
their <hi>Miniſter:</hi> but ſo ill paid while the <hi>Tithes</hi> remained in the
Crown, and worſe when alienated to the uſe of private Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
that the greateſt part of the burden for ſupport of the
<hi>Miniſtery,</hi> lay in the way of contribution, on the backs of the
people. And as one ill example doth beget another, ſuch
Lords and Gentlemen as had right to preſent to churches,
following the ſteps of thoſe who held the <hi>Tithes</hi> from the
Crown, ſoon made lay-fees of all the Tithes of their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſnes,
and left the preſentee ſuch a ſorry pittance, as made
him burthenſome to his neighbours for his better maintenance.
How it ſtands with them now ſince theſe late alterations, thoſe
who have took the <hi>Nationall covenant,</hi> and I preſume are well
acquainted with the <hi>Diſcipline</hi> and eſtate of the <hi>Scottiſh Kirk</hi>
(which they have bound themſelves to defend and keep) are
better able to reſolve us. And ſo much for the proof of the
firſt propoſition, namely, That never any <hi>Clergy</hi> in the church
of God, hath been, or is maintained with leſſe charge of the
<hi>Subject,</hi> then the eſtabliſhed <hi>Clergy</hi> of the church of <hi>England.</hi>
And yet the proof hereof will be more convincing, if we can
bring good evidence for the ſecond alſo: which is,</p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="part">
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:116283:8"/>
               <head>II. That there is no man in the Kingdome of England,
who payeth any thing of his own towards the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
and ſupport of his Pariſh-Miniſter, but his Eaſter-offering.</head>
               <p>And that is a <hi>Paradox</hi> indeed, will the Reader ſay. Is it not
viſible to the eye, that the <hi>Clergy</hi> have the tenth part of our
corn and cattell, and of others the increaſe and fruits of the
earth? Doe not the people <hi>give them the tenth part of their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates,</hi>
ſaith one of my pamphlets? have they not all their
<hi>livelihoods out of our purſes,</hi> ſaith another of them? Aſſuredly
neither ſo, nor ſo. All that the <hi>Clergy</hi> doth receive from the
purſe of the Subject, for all the pains he takes amongſt them,
is two pence at Eaſter. He claims no more then this as due,
unleſſe the cuſtome of the place, (as I think in ſome parts it is)
bring it up to ſixe pence. If any thing be given him over
this by ſome bountifull hand, he takes it for a favour, and
is thankfull for it. Such profits as come in by <hi>marriages, chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings,</hi>
and <hi>funerall</hi> Sermons, as they are generally ſmall, and
but accidentall: ſo hee is bound unto ſome ſpeciall ſervice and
attendance for it. His conſtant ſtanding fee, which properly
may be ſaid to come out of the Subjects purſe for the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration
of the Word and Sacraments, is nothing but the <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-offering.</hi>
The <hi>Tithes</hi> are legally his own, not <hi>given</hi> unto
him by the Subject, as is now pretended, but <hi>paid</hi> unto him
as a rent-charge laid upon the land; and that before the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
either Lord or Tenant, had any thing to do in the land at all.
For as I am informed by Sir <hi>Edw: Coke</hi> in his Comment upon
<hi>Littletons Tenures,</hi> li. 1. cap. 9. Sect. 73. fo. 58. <hi>It appeareth by
the Laws and Ordinances of ancient Kings, and ſpecially of King</hi>
Alfred, <hi>that the firſt King of this Realm had all the lands of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
<hi>in</hi> Demeſne <hi>and</hi> les grands manours &amp; royalties, <hi>they reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to themſelves, and with the remnant they for the defence of
the Realm enfeoffed the</hi> Barons <hi>of the Realm with ſuch juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
as the court</hi> Baron <hi>now hath.</hi> So he, the profeſſed Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion
of the Common laws. And at this time it was, when
all the lands in <hi>England</hi> were the Kings <hi>Demeſne,</hi> that <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelwolph,</hi>
the ſecond Monarch of the <hi>Saxon race</hi> (his father
<hi>Egbert</hi> being the firſt which brought the former <hi>Heptarchie</hi>

upon the Church, by his royall Charter. Of which, thus <hi>Ingulph</hi>

as in ſome other of the former paſſages, as there is ſomewhat
ſavouring of the errour of thoſe darker times, touching the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of good works; yet the authorities are ſtrong and moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
for confirmation of the point which we have in hand.</p>
               <p>Now that the King charged all the <hi>lands</hi> of the Kingdome
with the payment of <hi>tithes,</hi> and not that onely which he held
in his own poſſeſſion, is evident both by that which was ſaid
before from Sir <hi>Edw: Coke,</hi> and by the ſeverall paſſages of the
former Authours. For if all the lands in the kingdome were
the Kings <hi>Demeſnes,</hi> and the King conferred the <hi>tithes</hi> of all
his lands on the church of God, it muſt follow thereupon
that all the lands of the Realm were charged with <hi>tithes</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they were diſtributed amongſt the <hi>Barons</hi> for defence of
the kingdome. And that the lands of the whole Realm were
thus charged with <hi>tithes,</hi> as well that which was parted in the
hands of tenants, as that which was in the occupancy of the King
himſelf; the words before alledged doe moſt plainly evidence;
where it is ſaid that he gave the <hi>tenth of all his lands,</hi> as <hi>Ingulph;</hi>
the tithe of his whole land, as <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Huntingdon;</hi> the <hi>tenth
part</hi> of his whole kingdome, as in <hi>Florence</hi> of <hi>Worceſter;</hi> the
<hi>tenth part</hi> of the lands throughout the kingdome, in the <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
it ſelf. And finally, in the book of <hi>Abingdon,</hi> the Charter is
uſhered in with this following title; <hi>viz. Quomodo Ethelwol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus
Rex dedit</hi> decimam <hi>partem</hi> regni ſui <hi>Eccleſiis,</hi> that is to ſay,
how <hi>Ethelwolf</hi> gave unto the church the <hi>tenth part of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi>
This makes it evident, that the King did not only give
<hi>de facto,</hi> the <hi>tithe</hi> or tenth part of his <hi>whole Realm</hi> to the uſe
of the Clergy; but that he had a right and a power to doe it;
as being not onely the <hi>Lord Paramount,</hi> but the <hi>Proprietary</hi> of
the whole lands; the Lords and great men of the Realm not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
then a property or eſtates of permanency, but as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comptants
to the King, whoſe the whole land was. And
though it ſeems by <hi>Ingulph</hi> their conſents were asked, and that
they gave a free conſent to the Kings Donation; yet was this
but a matter of form, and not ſimply neceſſary: their <hi>approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
&amp; conſent being only asked, either becauſe the King was not
willing to doe any thing to the diſheriſon of his Crown, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the liking and conſent of his Peers; or that having their
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:116283:10"/>
conſent and approbation, they ſhould bee barred from
pleading any <hi>Tenant-right,</hi> and be obliged to ſtand in mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
and defence thereof againſt all pretenders. And this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
yet further by a Law of King <hi>Athelſtanes,</hi> made in the year
930, about which time not only the Prelates of the church, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly,
but the great men of the Realm, began to be ſettled in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates
of permanency, and to claim a <hi>property</hi> in thoſe lands
which they held of the Crown; and claiming, to make bold to
ſubduct their <hi>tithes.</hi> For remedy whereof, the King made this
Law, commanding all his Miniſters throughout the kingdome,
that in the firſt place they <hi>ſhould pay the</hi> tithes<note n="o" place="margin">Vt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>primis de meo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prio red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant Deo decimas; &amp; Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi mei ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liter faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant de ſuo proprio, &amp; Alderman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni mei &amp; Praepofiti mei.</note> 
                  <hi>of his own eſtate,</hi>
(that is to ſay, that which he held in his own hands, and had not
eſtated out to his Lords and Barons) <hi>and that the</hi> Biſhops <hi>did the
like of that which they held in right of their churches; &amp; his</hi> Nobles
<hi>and</hi> Officers <hi>of that which they held in</hi> property, <hi>as their own poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions
or inheritance.</hi> By which we finde that <hi>tithes</hi> were gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the <hi>Clergy</hi> out of all the lands in the kingdome, and
the perpetuall payment of them laid as a <hi>rent-charge</hi> on the
fame, by the bounty and munificence of the firſt <hi>Monarchs</hi> of this
Realm, before any part thereof was demiſed to others. And if
perhaps ſome of the <hi>great men</hi> of the Realm had eſtates in <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty</hi>
(as certainly there were but few, if any, which had any
ſuch eſtates in the times we ſpeak of) they charged the ſame
with <hi>tithes</hi> by their own conſent, before they did tranſmit
them to the hands of the Gentry, or any who now claim to
lay hold under them.</p>
               <p>So then, the land being charged thus with the payment of
<hi>tithes,</hi> came with this clog unto the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>great men</hi> of the
Realm; and being ſo charged with <hi>tithes</hi> by the Kings and
Nobles, have been tranſmitted and paſſed over from one hand
to another, untill they came to the poſſeſſion of the preſent
owners. Who whatſoever right they have to the other nine
parts, either of fee-ſimple, leaſe, or copy, have certainly none
at all in the <hi>tithe</hi> or <hi>tenth,</hi> which is no more theirs, or to be
thought of, then the other nine parts are the <hi>Clergies.</hi> For
whether they hold their lands at an yearly rent, or have them
in fee, or for tearm of life, or in any other tenure whatſoever
it be they hold them, and they purchaſed them on this tacite
condition, that beſides the <hi>rents</hi> and <hi>ſervices</hi> which they pay to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:116283:10"/>
the Lord, they are to pay unto the <hi>Clergy,</hi> or unto them who
do ſucceed in the <hi>Clergies</hi> right, a <hi>tenth</hi> of all the fruits of the
earth, and of the fruits of their cattell, and all creatures <hi>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thable,</hi>
unleſſe ſome ancient cuſtome or preſcription doe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
them of it. And more then ſo, whether they hold by
yearly rent, or by right of purchaſe, they held it at leſſe rent by
far, and buy it at far cheaper rates, becauſe the land it ſelf
and the ſtock upon it is chargeable with <hi>tithes,</hi> as before was
ſaid, then they would doe, or could in reaſon think to do, were
the land free from <hi>tithes,</hi> as in ſome places of this Realm it is.
To make this clearer by example of an houſe in <hi>London,</hi> where,
according to the rent which the houſe is ſet at, the <hi>Miniſter</hi>
hath 2 s. 9 d. out of every pound in the name of a <hi>tithe.</hi> Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
we that the rent of the houſe be 50 l. the <hi>Miniſters</hi> due ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
unto that proportion, comes to 6 l. 17 s. 6 d. yearly;
which were it not paid, and to be paid by law to the <hi>Pariſh-Miniſter,</hi>
there is no queſtion to be made, but that the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord
of the houſe would have raiſed his rent, and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
himſelf with the 50 l. but look for 56 l. 17 s. 6 d. which is
the whole rent paid, though to divers hands. And if this houſe
were to be ſold at 16 years purchaſe, the <hi>Grantee</hi> could expect
no more then 800 l. becauſe there is a rent of 6 l. 17 s. 6 d.
reſerved to the <hi>Miniſter</hi> by Law, which is to be conſidered in
the ſale thereof; whereas if no ſuch <hi>rent</hi> or <hi>tithe</hi> were to iſſue
out of it, he would have as many years purchaſe for the ſum
remaining, which would inhaunce the price 110 l. higher then
before it was. Now by this ſtandard we may judge of the caſe
of lands, though by reaſon of the difference of the ſoil, the
well or ill husbanding of grounds, and the greatneſſe or ſmalneſs
of the ſtock, which is kept upon them, it cannot be reduced to ſo
clear a certainty. But whatſoever the full tithe of all be worth to
the <hi>Miniſter,</hi> we may undoubtedly conclude, that if ſo much as
the <hi>tithe</hi> comes to yearly, were not paid to him, the <hi>Landlord</hi>
would gain it in his rent, and the <hi>Grantee</hi> get it in the ſale: no
benefit at all redounding to the <hi>Tenant</hi> by it, nor any unto him
that buyeth it. Or if we will ſuppoſe with one of my pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets,
and let it be ſuppoſed this once for our better procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
that he who officiates in a pariſh where <hi>tithes</hi> are paid
in kind without any ſubſtractions, hath the fift part of every
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:116283:11"/>
landed mans eſtate, that is to ſay, four pounds in every 20 l.
<hi>per annum:</hi> the <hi>Purchaſer</hi> or <hi>Tenant,</hi> be he which he will, may po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively
build on this in his better thoughts, that if four pounds in
twenty were not paid to the <hi>Miniſter,</hi> the <hi>Tenant</hi> muſt pay to his
<hi>Landlord,</hi> and the <hi>Purchaſer</hi> muſt buy it at the ſame rates, as he
did the reſt of the land. But being that neither the <hi>Tenant</hi> pays
rent for it, nor the <hi>Purchaſer</hi> hath it in his grant for him that
ſelleth the land unto him, the <hi>tithe</hi> of the increaſe of their land
and ſtock, and other creatures <hi>tithable</hi> in their poſſeſſion can be
none of their own, but muſt be his, and onely his, whom the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence
of Kings and Princes, confirmed by ſo many Laws and
Statutes, have conferred it on. His part indeed it is, not ours, (not
the <hi>tenth part of our eſtates,</hi> as my pamphlet ſaith) &amp; he receives it
of us as a rent or duty, tranſmitted to us with the land from one
hand to another; not as a matter of gift, or an act of courteſie.</p>
               <p>If then we pay not any thing of our own to the <hi>Pariſh-Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter,</hi>
which ariſeth to him from the increaſe of corn and cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell,
and other creatures <hi>tithable</hi> by the law of the Land; I think
it cannot be affirmed by diſcerning men, who are not led aſide
by prejudice and prepoſſeſſions, that we give any thing at all of
<hi>our own</hi> unto them, more then our <hi>Eaſter-offering,</hi> be it more or
leſſe. 'Tis true, ſome Statutes have been made about the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>perſonall tithes,</hi> out of the gains ariſing in the way of
<hi>trade:</hi> and I remember D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Burgeſſe</hi> writ a book about it, for which
he ſtands as highly cenſured by the <hi>Independent</hi>
                  <note n="p" place="margin">As in the Book cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Tithe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatherers no Goſpel-officers.</note>, as for other
things by thoſe of the <hi>Prelaticall</hi> party. But then I think it is as
true, that either thoſe Statutes were drawn up with ſuch <hi>reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations,</hi>
or men of <hi>trades</hi> have been ſo backward to conform un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them; that little or no benefit hath redounded by them to
the <hi>Pariſh-Miniſter,</hi> more then to ſhew the good affections
which the <hi>Parliaments</hi> of thoſe times had unto the <hi>Clergy.</hi> And
if we pay nothing of our <hi>own</hi> towards the maintenance of the
<hi>Clergy</hi> out of the increaſe of our grounds and ſtock, as I have
plainly proved we doe not; and that no benefit come unto them
from the gains of <hi>trading,</hi> as I think there comes not: if thoſe
ſmall <hi>vailes</hi> and <hi>caſualties</hi> which redound unto him from Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages,
Churchings, and the like occaſions, be given unto him for
ſome ſpeciall ſervice which he doth perform, and not for his
adminiſtration of the Word and Sacraments; I hope my ſecond
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:116283:11"/>
                  <hi>Propoſition</hi> hath been proved ſufficiently, namely, that there is
no man in the kingdome of <hi>England</hi> who payeth any thing
of his own towards the maintenance of his <hi>Pariſh-Miniſter,</hi> but
his <hi>Eaſter-offering;</hi> if ſo, as ſo it is for certain, there hath been
little ground for ſo great a clamour as hath been lately raiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
this particular: leſſe reaſon to ſubduct or to change that
maintenance which the piety of our Kings have given, and the
indulgence of ſucceeding Princes have confirmed in Parliament,
without any charge unto the ſubject. Which change, though
poſſibly ſome ſpecious colors may be put unto it, will neither be
really beneficiall to the <hi>Clergy</hi> or <hi>Laity.</hi> And that conducts me
on to my laſt <hi>Propoſition, viz.</hi>
               </p>
            </div>
            <div n="3" type="part">
               <head>III. That the change of Tithes into Stipends will bring
greater trouble to the Clergy, then is yet conſidered; and
far leſſe profit to the Country, then is now pretended.</head>
               <p>This is a double <hi>Propoſition,</hi> and therefore muſt be looked on
in its ſeverall parts: firſt, in relation to the <hi>Clergy,</hi> whoſe eaſe
is very much pretended, and next in reference to the <hi>Occupant,</hi>
whoſe profit onely is intended in the change deſired. It is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
for the <hi>Clergy</hi>
                  <note n="q" place="margin">As in the Kentish Petition and other projects of that kind.</note> to be a very <hi>difficult thing to know the</hi>
dues <hi>demandable in their ſeverall</hi> pariſhes, that it <hi>maketh them
too much given unto worldly things, by looking after the inning and
threſhing out of their corn; and doth occaſion many ſcandalous and
vexatious ſuits betwixt them and their neighbours:</hi> all which,
they think will be avoided, in caſe the <hi>Miniſters</hi> were reduced to
ſome <hi>annuall ſtipend.</hi> And to this end it is propounded by the
Army in their late <hi>Propoſals,</hi> that the <hi>unequall, troubleſome, and
contentious way of</hi> Miniſters <hi>maintenance by</hi> Tithes, <hi>may be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
of, (in Parliament) and a remedy applied unto it.</hi> But under
favor of the <hi>Army,</hi> and of all thoſe who have contrived the late
<hi>Petitions</hi> to that purpoſe; I cannot ſee but that the way of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
by <hi>annuall ſtipends</hi> will be as troubleſome, unequall,
and contentious too, as that of <hi>Tithes</hi> by Law eſtabliſhed; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
if thoſe annuall ſtipends be raiſed according to the
platform which is now in hand. For, as far as I am able to judge
by that which I have ſeen and heard from the chief contrivers, the
deſign is this. A valuation to be made of every benefice over
all the kingdome, according to the worth thereof one year with
another; a yearly ſumme according to that valuation to be
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:116283:12"/>
raiſed upon the lands of every pariſh, which now ſtand
chargeable with <hi>Tithes;</hi> the mony ſo aſſeſſed and levied, to
be brought into one common treaſury in each ſeverall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and committed to the hands of ſpeciall <hi>Truſtees</hi> hereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
appointed; and finally, that thoſe <hi>Truſtees</hi> doe iſſue out
each halfe year ſuch allowances to the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<hi>pariſhes,</hi> reſpect being had unto the deſerts of the perſon
and the charge of his family: yet ſo, that the <hi>Impropriatours</hi> be
firſt fully ſatisfied according to the eſtimate of their <hi>Tithes</hi> and
Glebe. This is the ſubſtance of the project. And if the moneys
be aſſeſſed in the way propoſed, onely upon the <hi>landed men,</hi>
whether Lords or Tenants, and not upon <hi>Artificers</hi> handicrafts,
and men of myſterious trades, who receive equall benefit by
the <hi>Miniſters</hi> labours; the way of maintenance by <hi>ſtipends</hi> will
be as <hi>unequall</hi> altogether, as by that of <hi>tithes.</hi> And if it be but
as unequall, I am ſure it will be far more troubleſome. For now
the <hi>Miniſter</hi> or <hi>Incumbent</hi> hath no more to doe, but to ſee his
corn brought in and houſed (being to be cut and cocked to his
hand both by law and cuſtome) and being brought in, either
to ſpend it in his houſe, or ſell the reſidue thereof to buy o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
proviſions. Which if hee think too great an avocation
from his ſtudies, he may put over to his wife, or ſome truſty
ſervant, as Gentlemen of greater fortunes doe unto their <hi>Bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifs.</hi>
And I my ſelf know divers <hi>Clergy men</hi> of good note and
quality, to whom the taking up of <hi>Tithes</hi> brings no greater
trouble, then once a month to look over the accompts of their
ſervants: beſides, that many of them, keeping no more in their
hands, then what will ſerve for the neceſſary expence of houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
let out the reſt unto ſome neighbour at an yearly rent.
But when the <hi>Tithes</hi> are turned to money, and that the <hi>Miniſter</hi>
hath neither corn nor hay, nor any other proviſion for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of houſhold, but what hee buyeth by the penny:
what an <hi>unreaſonable trouble</hi> muſt it needs prove to him to
trudge from one market to another, for every bit of bread he
eats, &amp; every handfull of malt which he is to ſpend? And if corn
happen to be dear, (as it is at this preſent) one quarter of a
years proviſions bought at the price of the market, may eat out
his whole years allowance. Beſides, I would fain learn, for I know
not yet, whether the valuation be to be made yearly, and to hold
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:116283:12"/>
no longer then that year, or being once agreed on to endure
for ever. If it be made from year to yeare, either the <hi>Miniſter</hi>
muſt be at a certain <hi>trouble</hi> in driving a new bargain every year,
with each ſeverall and reſpective <hi>Occupant</hi> within the pariſhes;
or at a greater <hi>trouble</hi> in attending the <hi>Truſtees</hi> of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
till they have liſt and leiſure to conclude it for him. But if the
valuation once made be to hold for ever, which is I think, the true
intent of the deſigne; I would fain know, in caſe the price of
all commodities ſhould riſe as much by the end of the next hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
years, as it hath done in the laſt, and ſo the next hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds
after that; how ſcant a pittance the poor Miniſter will
have in time for the ſubſiſtence of himſelf and his family-charge.
For ſince the 26 of King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> when a ſurvay was taken
of all the ſpirituall promotions in this kingdome, and the clear
yearly value of each returned into the Court of the <hi>Exchequer,</hi>
the prices of commodities have been ſo inhaunced, that had not
Benefices been improved proportionably, but held unto the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luation
which is there recorded, the <hi>Miniſtery</hi> in generall had
been ſo poor, ſo utterly unable to have gone to the price of the
markets, that many muſt have digged or begged for an hungry
livelihood.</p>
               <p>And yet we doe not ſee an end of the miſchief neither; for
when the <hi>Tithes</hi> are changed to a ſum of money, and the mony
brought into a common bank or <hi>Treaſury,</hi> hee will bee ſure to
undergoe a certain loſſe, and be vexed with more uncertain <hi>trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</hi>
For when this <hi>Clergy-office</hi> is once erected and ſettled in a
conſtant courſe or method, as all offices be; there muſt be <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurers,
Receivers, Tellers, Auditours,</hi> beſides under-offices, in
each ſeverall County: every of which will look to have ſome
benefit by his place and office, if not his whole ſubſiſtence by it.
And I would fain know of theſe grand <hi>Projectors,</hi> by that time
every one of theſe Cooks hath licked his fingers, and each <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berus</hi>
hath had his mouth full; how pitifully ſhort the <hi>Commons</hi>
muſt needs prove to the hungry <hi>Clergy,</hi> who are to live on the
remainder. Now as the loſſe is more then certain, ſo will the
<hi>trouble</hi> be as great as the loſſe, and no leſſe certain too, though
it be uncertain. For when the poor <hi>Clergy-man</hi> hackneyeth to
receive his <hi>Stipend,</hi> how many put-offs ſhall he finde, ere he ſpeed
of his buſineſs. For either M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Treaſurer is not at leiſure,</hi> or <hi>the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:116283:13"/>
money is not yet come in,</hi> or <hi>better men then he muſt be ſped before
him:</hi> and having danced a fortnight in this attendance, may
poſſibly be forced to a <hi>compoſition,</hi> and take egs for his money, or
elſe pay very dearly for his expedition. Such courſes have been
formerly complained of in the Kings <hi>Exchequer; Committees</hi> in
the Countrey are not free from the like complaints: and much
I fear, leſt this new <hi>Office</hi> prove as full of delaies and trouble (for
the beſt of us are but men, and ſubject to corrupt affections) as
either of the others have been found to be. But then, if M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer</hi>
have a further power either of augmentation or of dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution,
according as he judgeth of the <hi>Miniſters</hi> diligence, or
looks upon him in reſpect of his charge and family: what a
baſe vaſsallage and thraldome muſt the poor <hi>Clergy-man</hi> bee
brought to, in having ſuch a <hi>Super-Intendent</hi> to judge of his
parts and diligence, or to aſſigne him an allowance for his wife
and children? How punctually muſt M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Treaſurer</hi> be attended
and crouched unto, gifted, and bribed from time to time, either
in hope to have the yearly <hi>Stipend</hi> mended, or elſe for fear to
have it leſsned? The <hi>Chancellors</hi> were thought to Lord it with
too high an inſolency, when the poor Country-<hi>Miniſter</hi> did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
before them. But theſe who are to <hi>bear the bag,</hi> and upon
whom the <hi>Clergy</hi> muſt depend for a poor ſubſiſtence, will bee
ſure to Lord it over them with contempt enough; more then
the <hi>Chancellour</hi> or <hi>Biſhop</hi> in the worſt times of their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
in caſe at laſt they doe not think all waſt which is given
to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> under pretence of keeping it for more pious uſes. And
what a trouble and vexation to ingenuous mindes this muſt
needs be thought, let the Reader judge.</p>
               <p>So then, the way of <hi>Miniſters</hi> maintenance by yearly <hi>Stipends</hi>
being as <hi>unequall,</hi> and more <hi>troubleſome</hi> then that of <hi>Tithes;</hi> let
us next ſee whether it may not prove as <hi>contentious</hi> alſo. Tis
true indeed, there have been many ſuits in the Courts of <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi>
between ſome <hi>Incumbents</hi> and their neighbours about
matter of <hi>Tithes;</hi> but if it be examined where the fault lieth
moſt, I doubt it will be rather found to proceed out of cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs
in ſome pariſhioners, then any difficulty in diſcovering
the demandable dues, or any contentiouſneſs in the <hi>Miniſters.</hi>
For many Countrey people reckoning all good gains of which
they can defraud the <hi>Parſon,</hi> are apt enough on all occaſions
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:116283:13"/>
to ſubduct their <hi>Tithes,</hi> and either to pretend <hi>cuſtomes,</hi> or
plead <hi>preſcriptions,</hi> to decline the payment. And though they
commonly attempt it firſt in ſuch trifling matters, as are not
conſiderable in themſelves, and would bring a ſcandall on the
<hi>Miniſter,</hi> ſhould he be too ſtrict, and trouble them for matters
of ſo ſleight a nature: yet when he looks upon the conſequent,
and that the withholding or ſubducting of thoſe <hi>petit Tithes,</hi>
is but to make a way for the reſt to follow; hee findes more
reaſon to inſiſt on a punctuall payment, then otherwiſe the
nature of the thing would bear. And if a ſuit enſue upon it,
I ſee not why it ſhould be charged upon the <hi>Miniſter,</hi> who is
accomptable to God, the Church, and his whole ſucceſſion, from
any diminution of the <hi>Churches</hi> rights, by his remiſneſſe or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivence.
But whereſoever the fault lies, <hi>contentious ſuits</hi> doe
ſometimes happen, there is no queſtion of it. And can wee
think <hi>contentions</hi> will not alſo riſe about the payment of the
<hi>Stipends?</hi> Some men conceive themſelves to be over-rated, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
are apt enough to think that the <hi>Tradeſma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> who gets more
by his <hi>ſhop,</hi> then they doe by the <hi>Plough,</hi> ſhould be as liable as
themſelves to this common burden; and ſome beleeving that no
<hi>Tithes</hi> are due at all, will neither pay in kinde or money. Some
courſe muſt then be taken to inforce a payment, where pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is denied upon theſe pretentions: and there is no <hi>compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive</hi>
courſe without ſome contention. And then ſuppoſing that
ſome courſe muſt be taken to inforce a payment, (as I can
ſee no hope how it will be avoided) I would next know by
whom this courſe muſt be purſued. If by the <hi>Truſtees</hi> for the
County, they will be like to prove but ill <hi>ſolicitors</hi> in another
mans buſineſs, as being to get nothing but their pains for their
labour; beſides that, ſpending, as they muſt, on the common
ſtock (and men we know, are very apt to cut large thongs out of
another mans leather) the bill of charges for one ſuit, may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
devour the fruits of the whole Benefice. If by the <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi>
himſelf, as it is moſt likely, we are but where we were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and by avoiding one <hi>contention</hi> for <hi>Tithes</hi> in kind, the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter</hi>
muſt be ingaged in another for <hi>Tithes</hi> in money, which
comes all to one. For that ſuch ſuits will follow on this alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
I look on as a matter unavoidable; conſidering eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
how infinitely the Countrey-man, who aims at nothing in
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:116283:14"/>
the change but his gain or profit, will finde himſelf deceived of
his expectation, and conſequently will be more ſtubborn and
untractable when he ſeeth his errour.</p>
               <p>For that the change of <hi>Tithes</hi> into <hi>annuall Stipends,</hi> will not be
ſo much unto his profit as he doth expect, &amp; hath been intimated
to him by ſome leading men, who have the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mering of the plot,
will be no hard matter to demonſtrate. I know that nothing
is pretended openly in the alteration, but that the <hi>Occupant</hi> may
have his <hi>Tithes</hi> at a certain rent; and not be troubled to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
till the <hi>Parſon</hi> comes to ſet out his dues. But I know too,
that generally they have been fed with a ſecret hope, that if the
<hi>Parliament</hi> prevailed in the preſent war, they then ſhould pay
no <hi>Tithes</hi> at all, but every man of what eſtate or trade ſoever,
ſhould be contributory to the charge of the <hi>Miniſters</hi> mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.
Iuſt ſo the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> dealt with the <hi>Boors</hi> of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi>
aſſuring them, that if they proſpered in the war againſt
the King of <hi>Spain</hi> (which was then in hand) they ſhould <hi>pay
no Tithes unto their Miniſters;</hi> and in the mean time that the
<hi>Tithes</hi> ſhould be taken up towards the maintenance of the war
for the common liberty. But when the war was brought to ſo
fair an iſſue, that the <hi>Boor</hi> thought to be exempted from the
payment of <hi>Tithes:</hi> Anſwer was made, that they ſhould <hi>pay none
to the Miniſter</hi> as they had done formerly, whereby their <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi>
in effect were become their Maſters, but that the <hi>Tithes</hi> were
ſo conſiderable a Revenue, that the <hi>State</hi> could not poſſibly
ſubſiſt without them; that therefore they muſt be content to
pay them to the <hi>States Commiſſioners,</hi> as they had done hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
and that the <hi>State</hi> would take due care to maintain a <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery.</hi>
By means whereof they doe not onely pay their <hi>Tithes,</hi>
as in former times: but ſeeing how ſhort the publick allowance
made their <hi>Miniſters,</hi> doth come of that which ſome are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to call a <hi>competency,</hi> they are conſtrained (as it were) out
of common charity, if not compelled thereto by Order, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
over and above, with the reſt of the people, for the
improvement and increaſe of the <hi>Miniſters</hi> penſion. And ſo it
was in <hi>Scotland</hi> alſo, after the <hi>Lords of new erection</hi> had ingroſsed
the <hi>Tithes.</hi> I cannot ſay that there is any ſuch deſigne as to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex
the <hi>Tithes</hi> to the Crown, (though if they be taken from
the <hi>Clergy</hi> they ought of common right to return again unto
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:116283:14"/>
the Crown, from whence they came.) But I dare ſay the <hi>Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder</hi>
will conceive himſelf as much defrauded of his expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as if there was: and when he findes, that in ſtead of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no <hi>Tithes</hi> at all, he is to pay a valuable conſideration in
money for them, will think himſelf ſo far from being beholding
to the <hi>Vndertakers</hi> of this project, that he will think the old
way better, and more eaſie to him. His <hi>money</hi> he accompts his
<hi>own,</hi> and parts as ſadly from it as from ſo much of his bloud.
The <hi>Tithes</hi> he looks upon as another mans, which never were
in his poſſeſſion, or to be reckoned of as a part of himſelf; and
therefore lets them goe without grief and trouble. And I have
marked it commonly amongſt my neighbours (who I beleeve are
of the ſame temper with other <hi>Occupants</hi>) that the ſame men who
took no thought for parting with their <hi>Tithes</hi> in kinds, having
compounded for them at a rate in money, invented more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays,
&amp; made more excuſes to put the payment off for a week or
two, and ſo from one day to another, then for the payment of
their <hi>Tithes</hi> in all their life time. So dear a thing is money to
us Country people, that he who ſhall perſwade us to redeem a
ſuppoſed inconvenience with a reall and a conſtant expence of
treaſure, will be counted but an evill Counſellor. A viſible e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
whereof we have now amongſt us. For though the
<hi>quartering of Soldiers</hi> be the heavieſt bondage that ever a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
people did languiſh under, and ſuch as men of means and
quality would buy out upon any tearms: yet generally the
Country man had rather make himſelf a ſlave, and his wife a
drudge, and let them ſpend upon his victuals, then part with
mony to remove them to ſome other place. My inference here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
is this; either the valuation of each ſeverall Benefice
will be true and reall to the worth, or not. If not, it may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound
indeed to the Ploughmans profit, but then it comes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with a <hi>publick fraud,</hi> which I beleeve no <hi>Chriſtian</hi>
State will be guilty of. And on the other ſide, if the rates be
made according to the full worth of the Benefice, it will be
little to the profit of the Husbandman; who might have far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
his <hi>tithes</hi> as cheap of the Parſon or Vicar; beſides the hearts-grief
it will be unto many of them to part with ready money
for a thing of convenience, without which they might live as
happily as their fathers did.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:116283:15"/>
And if it be not to the <hi>profit</hi> of the Ploughman this way, I
am ſure that in another way it will not be to his <hi>content,</hi> or his
<hi>profit</hi> either. For taking it for granted, as I think I may, that I
have hit on the deſigne which is now on foot, that is to ſay, that
the yearly profits of each Benefice in every County be brought
into one common bank or treaſury within the County, and then
diſpoſed of by <hi>Truſtees,</hi> according as they judge of the deſerts of
the perſon, and take into conſideration his family-charge: it
may ſo happen, (and will doubtleſſe) that in a pariſh where the
tax or ſeſſement cometh to 400 l. <hi>per annum,</hi> the <hi>Miniſter</hi> may
not be allowed above an hundred. The reſidue will be wholly
in M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Treaſurers</hi> power, either to feaſt it with his friends, or
lay up for his children; or at the beſt to ſettle it on ſuch who
relate unto him, or can make means and friends to enlarge
their penſions, though ſuch perhaps as were never ſeen nor heard
of by the <hi>pariſh,</hi> whence the money comes. And if men think it,
as it is, an ill peece of husbandry, to have the ſoil carried off
their own land, and laid on anothers, to the impoveriſhing of
their own, and enriching of his, I cannot ſee but that it will
be thought a worſe peece of husbandry, and prove of very ill
digeſtion to moſt Country ſtomacks; to have the fat of their
livings carried to another place, and given unto a man whom
they never ſaw, and who is never like to feed their ſouls with
the bread of life, or their bodies with the life of bread: their
own poor <hi>Miniſter</hi> mean while, from whom they have reaſon
to expect it, being ſo diſcouraged and impoveriſhed that he can
doe neither. For whereas thoſe who were poſſeſſed of the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
benefices, did uſe to keep good hoſpitality, to entertain their
neighbours, and relieve their poor, and doe many other good
offices amongſt them as occaſion ſerved, both to the benefit
and comfort of all ſorts of <hi>pariſhioners;</hi> it may ſo happen, and
it will (as before I ſaid) that the <hi>Miniſter</hi> may be ſo ill befrien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Treaſurer,</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>Truſtees</hi> for the County,
that in ſtead of being either a benefit or a comfort to them, in the
way propoſed, he may prove a burden, &amp; a charge. And though I
doubt not but as great care will be taken, as can be deſired in
the choice of thoſe who are to have the diſpoſing of the publick
monies: yet to ſuppoſe that men once ſettled in an office of
ſuch truſt and power, may not be ſubject unto partialities and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:116283:15"/>
corrupt affections, were an imagination fitter for the Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celour
<hi>Verulams</hi> new <hi>Atlantis,</hi> or S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Thomas More</hi> his predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors
old <hi>Vtopia,</hi> or a <hi>Platonick</hi> Common-wealth, then the beſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempered
government in the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> world. For my part, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
into the deſigne with the beſt eyes I have, and judging of
it by the cleareſt light of underſtanding, which God hath given
me, I am not able to diſcern but that the change of <hi>Tithes</hi> into
<hi>Stipends</hi> (in the way propounded) will bring greater <hi>trouble</hi> to
the <hi>Clergy</hi> then is yet conſidered; and far leſſe <hi>profit</hi> to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
then is now pretended: which is the third and laſt of my
<hi>Propoſitions;</hi> and is, I hope, ſufficiently and fully proved, or at
the leaſt made probable, if not demonſtrative.</p>
               <p>I have ſaid nothing in this Tract of the right of <hi>Tithes,</hi> or on
what motive or conſiderations of preceding claim, the Kings
of <hi>England</hi> did confer them upon the <hi>Clergy:</hi> contenting my
ſelf at this time with the matter of fact, as namely, that they
were ſettled on the <hi>Church</hi> by the Kings of this Realm, before
they granted out eſtates to the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Gentry,</hi> and that the
land thus charged with the payment of <hi>Tithes,</hi> they paſſed from
one man to another, untill it came unto the hands of the preſent
<hi>Occupant;</hi> which cuts off all that claim or title which the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſwaded
ſubject can pretend unto them. I know it cannot bee
denied, but that notwithſtanding the ſaid Grants and Charters
of thoſe ancient Kings, many of the great men of the Realm, and
ſome alſo of the inferiour Gentry poſſeſſed of Manours, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Lateran</hi> Councell,<note n="r" place="margin">Ante Concilium Lateranen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, bene po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terant Lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci decimas ſibi in feu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere, vel aliis qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſcunque Eccleſiis dare.

own hands, or make <hi>infeodations</hi> of them to <hi>Religious</hi> houſes, or
give them to ſuch <hi>Prieſts</hi> or <hi>Pariſhes,</hi> as they beſt affected. But
after the decree of Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, (which you may find at
large in S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Edw: Cokes</hi> Comment upon <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and other
old Statutes of this Realm, in the Chapter of <hi>Tithes</hi>) had been
confirmed in that Councel, (<hi>Anno</hi> 1215) and incorporated into
the Canons and concluſions of it, the payment of them to the
<hi>Miniſter</hi> or <hi>Parochiall</hi> Prieſt, came to be ſettled univerſally over
all the kingdome: ſave that the <hi>Templars,</hi> the <hi>Hoſpitalers,</hi> and
<hi>Monkes of Ciſteaux</hi> held their ancient priviledges of being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
for thoſe lands which they held in occupancy from this
generall rule. Nor have I ſaid any thing of <hi>Impropriations;</hi> part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
becauſe I am perſwaded that the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Gentry,</hi> who
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:116283:16"/>
have either <hi>Votes</hi> or <hi>Friends</hi> in <hi>Parliament,</hi> will look well enough
to the ſaving of their own ſtakes; but principally, becauſe coming
from the ſame original grant from the King to the Subjects, &amp; by
them ſettled upon <hi>Monaſteries</hi> and <hi>Religious</hi> houſes, they fell in
the ruine of thoſe houſes to the <hi>Crown</hi> again, (as of due right the
<hi>Tithes</hi> ſhould doe, if they be taken from the Clergy;) and by the
<hi>Crown</hi> were alienated in due form of law, and came by many
mean conveyances to the preſent Owners. Onely I ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
that the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> would take a ſpeciall care of
the <hi>Churches Patrimony,</hi> for fear leſt that the prevalency of this
evill humour which gapes ſo greedily after the <hi>Clergies Tithes,</hi>
doe in the end devour theirs alſo. And it concerns them alſo in
relation to their right of Patronage, which if this plot goe on,
will be utterly loſt: and Churches will no longer be <hi>preſentative</hi>
at the choice of the <hi>Patron;</hi> but either made <hi>Elective</hi> at the will
of the <hi>People,</hi> or elſe <hi>Collated</hi> by the <hi>Truſtees</hi> of the ſeverall
Counties (ſucceeding as they doe in the power of Biſhops) as
now <hi>Committee-men</hi> diſpoſe of the preferments of the <hi>ſequeſtred
Clergy.</hi> If either by their power and wiſdome, or by the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Reaſons which are here produced, the peoples eyes
are opened to diſcern the truth, and that they be deceived no
longer by this popular errour, it is all I am at: who have no
other ends herein but onely to <hi>undeceive them in this point of
Tithes;</hi> which hath been repreſented to them as a publick grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
conducing manifeſtly to the diminution of their gain and
profit. If notwithſtanding all this care for their information,
they will run headlong in the ways of ſpoil and ſacriledge, and

brightly: let them take heed they fall not into that infatuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
