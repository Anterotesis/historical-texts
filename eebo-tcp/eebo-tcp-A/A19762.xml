            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

reduce this confuſed manner of practice to ſome regular form; whereby the Teacher might be exonerated a great part of his burden, the Learner encouraged with more faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and expedition to proceed, we, in generall, induced to repoſe more confidence and delight in our owne Tongue, and the ſtranger allured to the knowledge of it.</p>
            <p>Now therefore, ſince the perfection of all Arts (whereto the knowledge of Tongues ought to be reduced) conſiſts as well in the Theory, as the Practice: (the one whereof makes a knowing man, the other a ready) and this Theory in the reſolutive mood, or knowledge of Univerſals; wee are, as well in this, as all other Tongues or Languages, to have recourſe to Grammar, as the generall fountain. This the Greeks call <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or the knowledg of Letters. But according to the acception of the term, it is uſually (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Latins eſpecially) divided into foure parts, <hi>viz.</hi> Orthoepie &amp; Orthography (w <hi>
                  <hi rend="sup">ch</hi>
               </hi> only differ in this, that the one hath reſpect to right ſpeaking, the other to right wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting) Etymology (which teacheth the knowledg of the parts of ſpeech, and how to order and propoſe them truly) Syntax (which treateth of the conſtruction of the parts) and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſody (which chiefly belongs to Poets) that expoſtulateth the accent, rythme, quantity, and meaſure of feet in every word or verſe. The two former integrall Parts, to wit, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoepie and Etymologie (as moſt neceſſary and only abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely requiſite in our Engliſh Tongue) I have for our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſufficiently diſcuſſed, and reduced into a claſsicall
<pb facs="tcp:9747:2"/>
method: The latter two I remit to Practice in reading ſuch Oratours and Poets as our Tongue affords, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with every Stationers ſhop is amply replete.</p>
            <p>But for the preſent I have only ſet forth the firſt part, (as he that would not ſpend all his ſhot at once, or the mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that firſt rigs out his Pinnace to certifie whatſeas) eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſince it is more chiefly conducing to all ſorts, it being indeed dreſſed to ſympathize with every palate. The Ety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mologicall part being onely intended for ſuch as are to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in higher Claſſes, ſhall (God willing) ſpeedily follow, accompanying the Latin Introduction, the better to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the difference between both Tongues. The benefit that may hereby redound to the Learner, I will not here ſtand to expostulate, after the cuſtome of every idle Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phleter, that is enforced to be the blazer of his own praiſe to make his book ſell the better. Let thoſe that ſhall make triall ſpeak for me what they find: only this I dare preſume, that this little Treatiſe, rightly taught, will be enough to inform any ordinary capacity the knowledg of our Engliſh Tongue, ſo far as concerns Orthoepie and Orthography: whereby he that is to proceed further, ſhall not need to waſte ſo much time in Engliſh, and yet be ſufficiently instructed.</p>
            <p>The manner of teaching it I refer to the judgement of the Teacher, accounting it too much to ſet up a light, and hold the candleſticke too. The variety of Impreſsions, (or Prints as we call them) will ſerve as an inſtance to my

purpoſe. For the child in <hi>A. B. C.</hi> (as it is termed) that I may begin with the babe, I have cauſed a new Alphabet, or order of Letters, to be imprinted in the three ſeverall ſorts of Characters moſt uſuall in our Engliſh, &amp; moſt Tongues of Europe. When he is perfect in them, and able to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the Vowels and Conſonants aſunder, then let him en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this, going preſently to the Dipthongs, to be informed by his Maſter their number and uſe: thence immediately to the Syllables mixt.

            <p>This (as I ſaid) I propoſe as a ſervant to all: for not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding my whole ſcope herein be onely to aſsist the ſtranger and ignorant, and not to bring in captivity them whoſe more happy Intellects may of themſelves produce more cleare conception; yet if any ſcholler of our own ſhall vouchſafe the reading of ſo poor a Pamphlet, he perhaps in ſomewhat may find the Proverb true, that ſaies, <hi>No tree is ſo barren but may yeeld ſome fruit,</hi> be it never ſo little. At leaſt I deſire his cenſure of this <hi>Opuſculum,</hi> but newly hatched, may be but as milde, as my intentions reall for the more certain and ſpeedy advancement of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; leſt the bloſſome be blaſted ere it comes to perfection.</p>

                  <hi>Of Letters</hi> in genere.</head>
               <p>A Letter (according to <hi>Sealiger)</hi> is an individuall part of a word, or the leaſt part whereinto any word can be reſolved. But in reſpect of certain Monograms, or words of one Letter, Maſter <hi>Danes</hi> in his <hi>Paralipomena</hi> hath defined it, <hi>An individuall articulate voice,</hi> or ſound: by articulate, meaning that which is proper to men, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh it from that of beaſts.</p>
               <p>What concernes the derivation of the word, the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines call it <hi>Litera</hi> (whence our term Letter came) <hi>quaſi li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura,</hi> ſaith <hi>Calepine:</hi> So that, according to the Etymologie, or ſtrict ſenſe of the terme, Letters are but certaine Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, or notes, whereby any word is expreſſed in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: and for this cauſe were they by the antient Latiniſts diſtinguiſhed into Letters, as they be Charactericall notes; and Elements, as the firſt grounds or Principles of fpeech. But this nicety is confounded in the generall acception, which promiſcuouſly termes them Letters; and this we ſhall follow.</p>
               <p>In theſe therefore are wee to conſider their force and figure. As for their name and order, ſo farre as concernes our Engliſh Tongue, wee referre you to the Alphabet.</p>
               <p>The force or power of a Letter (ſaith <hi>Scaliger)</hi> is the ſound whereby it is produced in pronunciation, &amp;c. To whom we remit, for further ſatisfaction, the Teacher and learned Reader.</p>
               <p>Their figure is divers, according to their ſeverall Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, and that likewiſe varying in the diverſity of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, wherein they be either imprinted or written, in reſpect of their ſeverall uſe, and the relation they have to ſeverall Tongues or Languages.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:9747:9"/>
Their number (as I ſaid) in our Engliſh Tongue be 24. But the Latin, nor few Languages or Tongues whatſoever, at leaſt Scholaſticall, admit ſo many.</p>
               <p>Theſe Characters or Letters, in difference of quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, be either capitall or ſmall, as appeares by the formes expreſſed in our Alphabet.</p>
               <p>The Capitall or great Letters (though in ſome diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie of figure) were chiefly in uſe with our Predeceſſors the Saxons, and the moſt antient Latines.</p>
               <p>Of theſe, ſome be called Numerals; to wit, when they be uſed to expreſſe ſome certain Arithmeticall number; as I, for one; V, for five; X, for ten; L, for fiftie;C, for an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, D, or D, for five hundred; M, or M, for a thouſand; ↁ, five thouſand; ↂ, ten thouſand; &amp;c. Where note, that when a leſſer number precedes a greater, it takes from the greater number ſo much as the leſſer in it ſelfe contains; as IV, ſtands but for foure; IX, for nine; XL, for forty; XC, ninety; CD, for foure hundred; &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Sometime Abbreviatives, viz. when either alone, or with ſome abbreviated Character, they ſtand for ſome Proper name, or other peculiar word beginning with the ſame letter; as F. for Francis, M. for Martha, Ri. for Richard, Tho. for Thomas, &amp;c. which is uſuall with us in Prenomens (which we call Chriſtian names) eſpecially where the Surname is expreſſed at large, and oftentimes where both name &amp; Surname is ſpecified by two capitall letters, as R.

               <p>A Vowel is a Letter, which of it ſelfe yeelds a perfect ſound, or hath power to produce a ſyllable. <hi>Cale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine</hi> hath it, <hi>Vocaliseſt, quae per ſeipſam, vel ſuaipſius poteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te pronunciari queat.</hi> Our terme <hi>Vowell</hi> ſprings to us from the Latine diction <hi>Vocalis,</hi> which they derive from the Verb <hi>Voco,</hi> or rather <hi>Voce</hi> the Ablative caſe of <hi>Vox: Quia ſine vocali non datur vox articulata a perfecta:</hi> Becauſe no ſyllable, or articulate ſound, can bee propoſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the help of ſome Vowell.</p>
               <p>The number of the Vowels with us be ſix, viz. <hi>A, E, I, O, U, Y.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereof A, E, and O, are alwayes proper and invariable, the other three doe many times degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate into Conſonants, to wit, when in the beginning of a word or ſyllable they be joyned before themſelves, or any other Vowel or Dipthong: Onely Y never precedes it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Some have introduced W for a ſeaventh, in regard we ſometime improperly uſe it in ſtead of V. But by reaſon it is in it ſelfe a Conſonant properly, and onely by cuſtome abuſively prevailing in the nature of a Vowel, I thought it not ſo fit to bee inſerted in the number of Vowels, for theſe reaſons:</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe it is a combination compact of two Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and therefore had it the force of a vowel, it would be
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:9747:10"/>
rather a Dipthong then a Vowel.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe without another Vowel it is not apt to be pronounced, or make a ſyllable; therefore no Vowel.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, by reaſon it exacts more then one Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or ſyllable in its pronunciation, which a Vowel doth not.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, in regard of its generall uſe, which hath it onely a Conſonant, except ſometime after one of theſe three Vowels, A, E, and O; and that chiefly in Monoſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lables, and the ends of words, for the fuller ſound ſake, when it may be ſaid to make a Tripthong for the former reaſons; but this Tradition hath impoſed and made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed onely peculiar to us.</p>
               <p>Let this therefore ſuffice for the number of Vowels, and now proceed we to their ſeverall pronunciations in our Engliſh Tongue.</p>

               <head>The pronunciation of the Vowels ſeverally.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>A,</hi> in it ſelfe ought to be ſounded moderately full, and broad; but, joyned with other Letters, wee ought to reſpect the ſeverall natures of the Conſonants whereto it adheres, or the ſyllable wherein it is included, and ſo ſound it more or leſſe full according to the generall cuſtome of the Pronunciation of ſuch ſyllables, which we ſhall more amply demonſtrate in our Treatiſe of ſyllables. But ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving relation to its originall propriety and generall uſe in all countries, it is farre more tolerable to incline rather to too full a ſound after the manner of a Forreigne Calfe, then with ſome that nicely mince it, to make it reſemble the bleat of an Engliſh Lamb; eſpecially ſince it often beares the ſame force with <hi>Au</hi> Dipthong.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:9747:11"/>
                  <hi>E</hi> we uſually pronounce not much unlike the Greek γ, or <hi>Eta,</hi> whence, I conceive, we derive the uſe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation of <hi>Ee</hi> double, whoſe faculty we notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for the moſt part uſurp in the pronunciation of the ſingle <hi>E,</hi> ſounding it almoſt after the manner of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin <hi>I,</hi> (as it is truely uttered by the Italians, French, Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards, and moſt nations of Europe) but not altogether with the tongue ſo much reſtrained. And what they call <hi>E,</hi> we write with <hi>Ea,</hi> as in <hi>Bread, Sea,</hi> and the like.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I,</hi> according to our moderne and moſt commendable Orthoepiiſts, ſomewhat imitates the ſound of the Latin <hi>Ei</hi> dipthong (though not altogether ſo full) as it is uſually pronounced; or rather, indeed, the Greek <hi>Iota,</hi> whoſe force it truly retains with us, though much differing in it among our ſelves: for many of our Northerns eſpecially abuſe it with too broad a ſound both ſingle and joyned with other letters, like the Dipthong <hi>Ai,</hi> making no difference in pronunciation betweene <hi>fire</hi> and <hi>faire.</hi> Others againe on the contrary ſide, with an affected imitation of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond-ſea pronunciation, ſtriving to Latinize it, would make a traveller, if not a Forreigner, of it. But I for my part, as I eſteeme that manner of pronunciation moſt to be practiſed, which beſt ſuits the nature of the Tongue or Language whatſoever, as moſt proper to it, and which hath beene moſt generally received among the learned; ſo hold I it the greateſt property and praiſe of a Linguiſt to attribute to each ſeverall Tongue its native faculty: So that I moſt approve in the Engliſh Tongue the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh tone, accepted and delivered by ſuch of our Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors as were able to judge, no leſſe deteſting barbariſms, then novelty and affectation. This I conceive a <hi>medium</hi> betweene the other two extremes, wherein we differ from the Latin, and moſt Tongues of Europe, as much as they
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:9747:11"/>
from the antient Greeks; as every Language hath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what peculiar.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O</hi> for the moſt part differs little from that of <hi>Latium,</hi> whence we tooke it: Onely ſometimes in proper names eſpecially we <hi>abuſivè</hi> ſound it <hi>U,</hi> as in <hi>Edmond</hi> and <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund, Paighton, Paitun,</hi> ſhort, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>U</hi> in like ſort makes little other difference betweene us and the Latines, but onely in point of ſtate; as when it concludes any word as a ſingle vowell, it exacts with us, by way of Orthographie, to be alwaies, or for the moſt part, attended with <hi>E;</hi> as in <hi>due, true, enſue,</hi> &amp;c. where (as in many places elſe) <hi>E</hi> ſerves but as an unneceſſary Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, as ſhall hereafter be ſhewed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Y,</hi> which as a ſingle Letter we call <hi>Wi,</hi> hath in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the ſame force with the Vowell <hi>I,</hi> and in the end of a word may indifferently be written in lieu of <hi>I,</hi> or rather <hi>Ie,</hi> (for indeed we with the Dutch have learned to make a ſhadow of the ſubſtance of many Letters) as in <hi>merry,</hi> or <hi>merrie; mercie,</hi> or <hi>mercy,</hi> and the like: and is moſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally uſed in Monoſyllables, or words of one ſyllable, where it ſounds <hi>I</hi> long, as in <hi>my, thy, by, why,</hi> which are alwayes written with <hi>Y;</hi> the reſt be indifferent, as <hi>ty,</hi> or <hi>tie,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But in the beginning or middle of a word it is ſeldome, and that leſſe properly, inſerted as a Vowell, unleſſe in ſome few words derived from the Greeke, expreſſed by <hi>ypſilon;</hi> or proper names, which in all Tongues be irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular.</p>
               <p>For the derivation of it, the word <hi>Symptome</hi> can teſtifie ſufficiently from whence we had it. Notwithſtanding, I know there are who would deduce it from <hi>II</hi> double, whoſe ſound (they ſay) it beares <hi>contractivè,</hi> as, <hi>Yet,</hi> quaſi <hi>II et,</hi> &amp;c. But this I referre to the judgment of the Reader.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:9747:12"/>
As a Conſonant it hath a peculiar power; which expect in its proper place. In the meane time let this ſuffice for Vowels in particular.</p>

                     <hi>Ai,</hi> we pronounce according to the Latin, as in <hi>faire,</hi> &amp;c. excepting <hi>haire,</hi> which we ſound as if it were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <hi>hare,</hi> but a little brisker, or rather like <hi>heare;</hi> and the verb <hi>ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> which we for brevity ſake call <hi>ſa;</hi> and <hi>ſaiſt,</hi> as <hi>ſeſt; ſaith,</hi> as <hi>ſath; ſaid,</hi> as <hi>ſed</hi> the Latin Conjunction, &amp;c. though irregularly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Au,</hi> the Dipthong we uſually ſound after the manner of the Latine <hi>au,</hi> except in <hi>baume</hi> the herb, where it ſounds <hi>A</hi> (as the French pronounce it) full.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ea</hi> we ſound like the Latin <hi>E,</hi> and it is alwaies proper, or invariable; onely in <hi>Phleagme</hi> (which we borrow of the Greeke <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) it is for the moſt part ſounded with <hi>E</hi> ſhort, and <hi>G</hi> omitted, as in <hi>Phleme.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ee,</hi> is alwaies the ſame in pronunciation with the Greek γ and the Latin <hi>I,</hi> as I ſaid in the Vowels.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ei,</hi> we generally pronounce like the Latin <hi>Ai,</hi> with lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle difference of ſound; as in <hi>receive, ſtreight,</hi> &amp;c. And what force the Latines give to their <hi>Ei</hi> Dipthong<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wee attribute the ſame in effect to our ſingle <hi>I,</hi> as in the Vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els is ſaid: where note, wee abuſively ſound the word <hi>Heire,</hi> or Inh ritour, like <hi>Aire,</hi> unaſpirate and full, as if there were no difference of Letters. But where <hi>Gh</hi> ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds, the Dipthong is ſounded ſhorter, and <hi>Gh</hi> loſeth all its faculty, as <hi>weight,</hi> quaſi <hi>wait,</hi> &amp;c. Some pronounce <hi>Ei</hi> like <hi>Ea</hi> in many words, and for the ſame purpoſe write it ſo too, but altogether againſt rule or authority; as <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceave,</hi> for <hi>receive; conceave,</hi> for <hi>conceive,</hi> &amp;c. eſpecially where it precedeth <hi>V.</hi>

Only in <hi>Geography</hi> this Dipthong is proper, and in it ſelfe complete: but we make little uſe
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:9747:13"/>
of it, other then in the foure words here recited.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eu,</hi> beares the ſame force with the Latin <hi>Eu,</hi> in words from thence derived, or proper names, as in <hi>Euſtace;</hi> but in words originally Engliſh, we for the moſt part ſound it like <hi>u</hi> ſingle, without the <hi>E,</hi> as in <hi>Rheume,</hi> quaſi <hi>Rume, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ie,</hi> differs little in ſound from the Latin <hi>I,</hi> and our <hi>Ee</hi> Dipthong, as in <hi>field chiefe, Shrieve</hi> (which is truly written <hi>Sheriffe) ſiege,</hi> &amp;c. where we pronounce <hi>E</hi> long without any <hi>I</hi> at all, and <hi>friend</hi> where <hi>E</hi> ſhort, &amp;c. But you muſt obſerve by the way, that this Dipthong never happens in the beginning of a word or ſyllable, for then is <hi>J</hi> alwaies a Conſonant, and never a Vowell, whereby it cannot compoſe a Dipthong, which is the combination of two Vowels.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Oa,</hi> ſounds generally after the Greeke <hi>Omega,</hi> with the loſſe of <hi>A;</hi> as in <hi>boat, coale,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Goale,</hi> or priſon, is thus truely written, but pronounced like <hi>Jaile.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Oe,</hi> in the end of a word (as for the moſt part it ſeldome happens elſe in words meerely Engliſh, though uſuall in the Latine, and ſuch as wee immediately derive from thence) is the ſame in pronunciation with <hi>O</hi> ſingle, as in <hi>Toe,</hi> &amp;c. except <hi>ſhoe,</hi> which ſounds <hi>ſhoo,</hi> as ſome pronounce the Greeke Dipthong <hi>Ov;</hi> and <hi>Phoenix, foelicity,</hi> &amp;c. where it followes the Latine, bearing chiefly the force of <hi>E.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Oi,</hi> is originally derived from the Greek, whoſe facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in pronunciation it truely retaines with us, as in <hi>void, deſtroid, joine,</hi> &amp;c. But in many words which wee take from the French it imitates more their pronunciation, which a little differs, and but a little, as in <hi>purloine,</hi> &amp;c. where it inclines more to our <hi>I,</hi> though with ſomewhat a flatter or more dull ſound.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ou,</hi> differs much in pronunciation. In <hi>bound, boule,</hi> (as to trundle a boule) <hi>croud</hi> (or throng) &amp;c. it is properly in its
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:9747:14"/>
native ſound, deduced from the Greckes, as it is by their beſt Linguiſts truely pronounced. But with <hi>Gh</hi> ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, it ſounds farre more aſpirate, as in <hi>bought,</hi> which we pronounce <hi>bowt,</hi> after the manner of the ſubſtantive <hi>bow,</hi> (or that which men uſe to ſhoot with) <hi>Gh</hi> having no other force in themſelves. And thus it is in all Participles of the Preter tenſe ending in <hi>ought</hi> as <hi>bought, ſought, thought,</hi> and the Adjective <hi>nought;</hi> except <hi>fought</hi> the Preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>participle of <hi>fight,</hi> which ſounds <hi>fou't,</hi> after the manner of <hi>ſtout, bout,</hi> proper. In like ſort <hi>bough</hi> (or arme of a tree,) <hi>plough, through;</hi> except <hi>tough,</hi> which ſounds with a brisk aſpiration, and <hi>enough,</hi> which many of us call <hi>enuff, (ſed perperam.) U</hi> going before <hi>R</hi> in the end or laſt ſyllable of certaine words, loſeth its force, as in <hi>honour, neighbour;</hi> except <hi>our, your,</hi> and all Monoſyllables: Where note, that what words we borrow of the Latin, ending in <hi>or,</hi> we write with <hi>our;</hi> as in <hi>labor</hi> the Latin word, and <hi>labour</hi> the Engliſh: and ſome we take from the French, as <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramour.</hi> In the word <hi>bloud</hi> it is ſounded without <hi>o, u</hi> ſhort; in <hi>gourd,</hi> without <hi>u, o</hi> long. In <hi>would, could, ſhould,</hi> it is uſually pronounced like <hi>Oo</hi> double.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Oo</hi> in <hi>Poore</hi> imitates in ſound the Greek <hi>Omega,</hi> but in other words we uſually pronounce almoſt as the French and Waloones doe their Ο in <hi>Tilmont, Paramont,</hi> &amp;c. and as ſome would have the Greeke ο, though falſely. It varies little in pronunciation; as in theſe words appeares, <hi>ſoone, boone, loome, moone, crooke, tooth, ſooth</hi> (which ſome call <hi>ſuth) good, food;</hi> except <hi>wood,</hi> and <hi>ſtood,</hi> the Preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect tenſe of the Verb <hi>ſtand,</hi> which we pronounce as they were <hi>wud,</hi> and <hi>ſtud,</hi> and <hi>wool,</hi> quaſi <hi>wul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ua</hi> is alwaies proper when it followes <hi>q,</hi> as in <hi>quake;</hi> but after <hi>g, u</hi> is of little force: where you may take notice, that all theſe Dipthongs which begin with <hi>u,</hi> ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:9747:14"/>
or never follow any other Conſonant but <hi>g,</hi> and <hi>q,</hi> whereof the two laſt can onely follow <hi>q,</hi> except <hi>ui</hi> in <hi>build</hi> and <hi>juice;</hi> the other two indifferent. But when <hi>q</hi> precedes any of them, <hi>u</hi> retaines its ſound, which after <hi>g</hi> it loſeth; as in <hi>guard,</hi> &amp;c. except <hi>Language,</hi> as is inſtanced in the Table of Dipthongs.</p>
                  <p>Theſe three, <hi>Au, Ei, Ou,</hi> be many times ſounded with a kind of aſpiration, by reaſon of <hi>Gh</hi> often inſerted in the ſame ſyllable ſucceeding, and ſerving there to no other uſe but to aſpirate the Dipthong, as I ſaid before in <hi>Ei</hi> and <hi>Ou. Ei</hi> in the word <hi>Forreigner</hi> hath <hi>G,</hi> in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Greek γ, but ſhort, and in a manner altogether vaniſhing away.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Au</hi> with <hi>Gh</hi> in the middle of a word ſounds like <hi>Af</hi> for the moſt part, as in theſe ſubſtantives, <hi>daughter, laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> which moſt of us pronounce <hi>dafter, lafter;</hi> except <hi>ſlaughter,</hi> which is <hi>ſlater,</hi> with <hi>A</hi> broad and full, after the manner of the French tone. The reſt goe according to the tenure of the precedent rules, as <hi>caught, taught,</hi> &amp;c. And thus terminates very many of our Participles in the Preter tenſe.</p>
                  <p>There are (and thoſe diligent Inquiſitours in the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh tongue) who would inhance our number of Dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thongs to one and thirty, by the ſeverall connexions of <hi>W</hi> and <hi>Y</hi> with the other Vowels, as if they were alwayes Vowels. But I have rejected them for theſe reaſons: Firſt, <hi>Y</hi> before any other Vowel alwayes degenerates into a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant (as will by provingit plainly appeare;) and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined in the ſame ſyllable after any other Vowell, it hath the ſame force in pronunciation with <hi>I,</hi> or in the end of a word with <hi>Ie,</hi> which is all one in effect, and therefore frivolous to put them as different Dipthongs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>W</hi> hath by cuſtome ſo farre prevailed, as to claime the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:9747:15"/>
title of a Vowell in <hi>perſwade,</hi> becauſe it is to us trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred from the Latin Verb <hi>Perſuadeo,</hi> and ſo written with a <hi>W</hi> for difference ſake; but in Proper names, and moſt other words taken from the Latin, we uſually keep <hi>U</hi> in its owne place, as in <hi>Suetonius,</hi> which we write <hi>Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton; Suevia, Sueveland,</hi> &amp;c. In words originally Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, <hi>W,</hi> preceding any other Vowell, is improperly ſaid to make a Dipthong, having there onely the force of a Conſonant, and not a Vowell; as in <hi>wary, wet, with, work, weary, ſweare, ſwagger, ſweet,</hi> &amp;c. but may be combined after any of theſe three Vowels, <hi>A, E,</hi> or <hi>O.</hi> But then is it more properly termed a Tripthong then Dipthong, (as its Character and denomination implies:) whereupon I thought good to inſert it among the Tripthongs, where you may further ſee the difference between <hi>U</hi> ſingle, and <hi>U</hi> double. Notwithſtanding, I acknowledge it altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther irregular, and peculiar onely to us and our Competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, and thereupon hard to be reduced to any certaine rule. Wherefore concerning this, being a thing not much materiall, let every man take his owne opinion, if he can induce better motives.</p>

                  <hi>downe, gowne, renowne, vowell, towell, trowell,</hi> hath the ſame pronunciation with <hi>Ou</hi> the Dipthong.

What concernes their uſe, you may here take notice, that when any word is to terminate or end in <hi>Au, Eu,</hi> or <hi>Ou,</hi> we write it with <hi>U</hi> double: in the two firſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, in the laſt generally, except in theſe two words, <hi>thou, you,</hi> Pronounes; and ſuch as have <hi>Gh</hi> after; as <hi>plough, through, tough, bough, rough,</hi> and <hi>cough,</hi> which ſounds <hi>quaſi coffe,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>youth,</hi> quaſi <hi>yuth.</hi> The reſt you have enough in the Dipthongs.</p>
               <p>This therefore ſhall ſuffice for the Vowels ſingle and combined. Now proceed we to Conſonants.</p>

            <div type="section">
               <head>Of the Conſonants.</head>
               <p>A Conſonant is a letter of it ſelfe not apt to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced without the helpe of ſome Vowell; or, which hath not power in its own nature or being to make a ſyllable, or any articulate ſound; as the Etymologie of the word it ſelfe implies: as, <hi>Conſonans quaſi ſimul ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nans. Calepine</hi> hath it thus, <hi>Conſonantes ſunt dictae, quia cum Vocalibus ſonent, non autem per ſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And theſe be ſpecifically divided into Mutes and Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowels; names, who rightly underſtands, ſhall need no further definition of them. For a Mute is that which the Latins call <hi>Muta, quaſi Liter a muta;</hi> and is as ſignificant in our Engliſh Tongue, that is, mute or dumb; becauſe in it ſelfe it hath no faculty of pronunciation at all, without ſome pittance of a Vowell.</p>
               <p>Of theſe there be in number eight<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to wit, <hi>B, C, D, G, K, P, Q, T,</hi> which in their pronunciation, beginning in
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:9747:16"/>
themſelves, are forced to borrow of the Vowell <hi>E</hi> to help them out; as <hi>Be, Ce,</hi> &amp;c. excepting onely <hi>K,</hi> which ends in <hi>A,</hi> and <hi>Q</hi> in <hi>U.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Semi-vowell taketh its denomination, as having in it ſelfe halfe the power or vigour of a Vowell: and theſe be likewiſe eight, viz. <hi>F, L, M, N, R, S, X, Z;</hi> all which begin their ſound with <hi>E,</hi> and end in themſelves; (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſo many <hi>Infantuli</hi> produce <hi>R, quaſi Ar)</hi> where you may obſerve the difference betweene a Mute and a Semi-vowell, in that the former begins its pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation <hi>(à quo)</hi> in it ſelfe, and terminates in a Vowell <hi>(ad quem;)</hi> the latter begins with a Vowell, and ends in it ſelfe, and thereupon is ſaid to be endued in its nature or eſſence with a further faculty. Though <hi>F</hi> (I know) is ſtrongly among the Latin Grammarians diſputed, and by <hi>Priſcian</hi> convinced for a Mute; yet neither his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, nor the reaſons quoted by his diligent Inquiſitour Maſter <hi>Deanes,</hi> be of efficacy ſufficient (at leaſt ſince they hold not good in our Engliſh Tongue) to lett us from ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him in the forefront of our Semi-vowels, and by that meanes to adde one to the number of the Latin: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in let <hi>Scaliger</hi> ſpeake, and end the controverſie.</p>
               <p>The diſciſſion of them into Liquids, &amp;c. is too nice a diſtinction for us to deale with. For if from the coaſts of Italy any ſeed thereof was tranſplanted into our Engliſh Tongue, it was onely to grow in ſome Ladies mouth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>H</hi> and <hi>W</hi> are irregular, and have their particular pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; which ſhall be further exemplified in their places. The force of theſe Conſonants will appeare in the Sylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles mixt: Their denominations you have in the Alpha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet; onely here we have thought good to introduce a word or two concerning theſe foure, viz. <hi>H, W, X, Z.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>H</hi> (which <hi>Scaliger, Alvarus,</hi> and moſt Latin Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marians
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:9747:17"/>
call <hi>Ha)</hi> we for the moſt part, as well in what concernes our owne Tongue, as the Latin, pronounce it as a ſingle letter, like <hi>Ach,</hi> or <hi>Hach,</hi> taken after the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh pronunciation; who indeed come neereſt us of any Nation in Europe, concerning the uſe and pronunciation of this Letter: but to the French it is very difficult to produce, eſpecially as we doe. The Latins onely give it the Character, but not the force of a Letter, and from the Greekes (who onely make it a note of aſpiration, exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it their Alphabet) produce ſufficient reaſons for it. But we cannot doe ſo; for without it our Tongue is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether imperfect: Whereupon with us it hath the prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative of being ranked and eſteemed as a Letter.</p>
               <p>For the uſe, it is often propoſed for difference ſake (as hath beene well obſerved in the Latin) for inſtance theſe two, <hi>All,</hi> and <hi>Hall,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>It may precede or be ſet before any of the Vowels, but no Conſonant, except <hi>N</hi> in <hi>John</hi> (which is meerely a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of the Latin word <hi>Johannes)</hi> or where it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted in the middle betweene two Conſonants, as in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. But is apt to ſucceed in the ſame ſyllable any of theſe ſix Conſonants, <hi>C, P, T, R, S, G,</hi> as in <hi>Charity, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip, Theorie, Rhetorique, Shame, Ghoſt.</hi> The placing it after the firſt three we learned of the Greeks, notwithſtanding (eſpecially after <hi>T)</hi> wee uſe it in many words meerely Engliſh.

               <p>
                  <hi>W</hi> and <hi>Z</hi> differ from the other Conſonants, in that they require more then one element or ſyllable in their deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, or pronunciation as ſingle letters. The one we derive from the Greeke Letter <hi>Zeta,</hi> whoſe force it retaines: the other few Nations beſides our owne are
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:9747:17"/>
acquainted with, eſpecially to make the uſe we doe of it.</p>
               <p>Further, <hi>X</hi> and <hi>Z</hi> are ſaid to be a combination of two Conſonants, and therefore are not termed ſingle, but double Conſonants, as implying the force of two: For example, we call <hi>X quaſi Ecs,</hi> or (as ſome would have it) <hi>Ics;</hi> and <hi>Z</hi> (which the Latins call <hi>Eds)</hi> we term <hi>Ezard,</hi> or <hi>Edſard,</hi> and beares the force of <hi>Ds<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>To theſe we may well adde our Conſonant <hi>W,</hi> as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of two <hi>V</hi> Conſonants contract.</p>
               <p>And this ſhall ſuffice for Conſonants <hi>in ſpecie.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we will immediately proceed to treat of Letters as they be parts of a word, or produce ſyllables; where the particular force of the Conſonants will further appeare.</p>

               <head>Of Syllables.</head>
               <p>FRom the conjunction or combination of Letters are generally deduced Syllables, to wit, when one or more Conſonants ſtand united with a Vowell, or Vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, under one accent, which we call Syllables mixt, that is, compoſed of Vowell and Conſonant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Scaliger</hi> therefore hath defined a Syllable, An Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment under one accent; that is, what can be pronounced at once. <hi>Priſcian</hi> hath it more plainely, <hi>Comprehenſio li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terarum, &amp;c.</hi> A comprehenſion of Letters, falling under one accent, and produced by one motion of breathing. But this was rejected among ſome Grammarians, as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, in reſpect of ſome Syllables conſiſting but of one Letter, which are here excluded. Whereupon Maſter <hi>Deanes</hi> hath framed this definition of it, A Syllable is a literall or articulate voice of an individuall ſound: For

every Syllable muſt fall under one and the ſame accent. So that Maſter <hi>Coot</hi> was not well adviſed to make <hi>able, acre,</hi> and the like, to be but one Syllable, as ſhall be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther demonſtrated in its proper place.

                  <hi>E</hi> after <hi>g,</hi> in the ſame Syllable, at the end of any word, <note place="margin">age.</note> makes <hi>g</hi> to be ſounded like <hi>j</hi> Conſonant: Wherefore it is againſt Orthography to write <hi>e</hi> in the end of a word after <hi>g,</hi> where <hi>g</hi> is to retaine its proper ſound.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>G</hi> before <hi>h</hi> in the end of a ſyllable is not ſounded; but <note place="margin">agh.</note> this combination we ſeldome uſe but in the word <hi>ſighes,</hi> where <hi>i</hi> precedes, and is pronounced <hi>quaſi ſithes,</hi> with an aſpiration, <hi>i</hi> long.</p>
               <p>This is ſeldome uſed after any Vowell but <hi>i,</hi> as in <hi>ſight,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">aght.</note> 
                  <hi>night, might, right,</hi> and where <hi>g</hi> is not at all pronounced.</p>
               <p>This ſome have put as a true combination of a Syllable, <note place="margin">agn.</note> by reaſon of theſe words, <hi>benigne, condigne, oppugne,</hi> &amp;c. but the ſame reaſons I bring againſt M. <hi>Coot</hi> in <hi>l</hi> and <hi>r,</hi> ſhall hold in this. And firſt, none of theſe ſyllables are or ought to be written without <hi>e,</hi> for then are they defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, and againſt Orthography. Secondly, any of theſe Conſonants combined with <hi>l, n,</hi> or <hi>r,</hi> may begin a Syllable but not end it; for no Liquid can follow another Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in the end of a Syllable; for then ſhould it be no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger a Liquid, when all the force is drowned in another. Thirdly, <hi>e</hi> never is or ought to be inſerted but for ſome uſe: Now becauſe <hi>e</hi> finall in our Tongue is of ſo little ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect or eſtimation, any of theſe Liquids being in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt nature of a Semi-vowell, may juſtly claime as much faculty in the producing of a Syllable, whereby (the one not giving to the other, but as equall competitours) they
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:9747:20"/>
make the Syllable imperfect, by reaſon neither the one nor the other have the full force, and therefore not properly ſaid to be a perfect Vowell: whereupon I grant theſe kind of Syllables imperfect (as indeed imperfections incident to our Tongue among ſome other which onely time and induſtry can amend) but yet diſtinct; which I prove in that they thus combined, exact more then one motion of reſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration or breathing, which is proper to a Syllable, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares by the ſeverall eſſentiall definitions thereof. And for the manner of dividing them in ſpelling, by the ſame authority the Latin Grammarians command <hi>ſcripſi</hi> to be ſpelled <hi>ſcri-pſi,</hi> by the ſame will I admoniſh the ſpelling of any thoſe words occurring in that nature; for example ſake, <hi>condigne</hi> thus, <hi>con-di-gne,</hi> ſo <hi>notable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> no-ta-ble; mau-gre,</hi> &amp;c. Alſo the like for plurals of Subſtantives oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring in this kind, as <hi>fi-dles, a-cres,</hi> which ſounds like <hi>akers;</hi> and very many the like, ſpecially produced by <hi>l</hi> &amp; <hi>r</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe we never uſe but as Interjections when we mark <note place="margin">ah, oh.</note> them with an exclamation point, and that onely after theſe two Vowels; as <hi>ah! oh!.</hi>

Wherefore it is neceſſary for all that deſire to be Orthographiſts, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to write Engliſh right (which likewiſe holds good in any tongue or language whatſoever) to know per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly and readily the particular force of every letter, or what every letter ſeverally or joyntly implies.</p>

               </head>
               <p>NOtwithſtanding in the diviſion of Conſonants, I merrily ſaid, Liquids were onely made to ſuit a Ladies mouth: yet in reſpect experience finds the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, that enforceth the generall acceptance of them in our Tongue; I have thought good to propoſe this little Treatiſe of them in peculiar: the rather, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard I have, in the ſyllables mixt, as occaſion was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, ſo often had relation hereto.</p>
               <p>Liquids therefore (which the Latines call <hi>Liquidae)</hi> take their denomination from their clearneſſe of ſound; as, of all the conſonants, comming nigheſt the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of a vowell; which we above the Latines or any other Language, by Triall in ſome caſes approve. And this may ſerve for a deſcription of them, to wit, ſuch ſemivowels as can partly of themſelves produce an imperfect ſyllable. Their number foure, <hi>viz. L, M, N, R,</hi> common both to the Latines and us. Their uſe in ſome caſes more with us than them, in ſome leſſe. For in the beginning or middle of a word, we need not their diſtinction; unleſſe it be, becauſe <hi>L</hi> and <hi>R</hi> be moſt incident to combinations, under any other conſonant, wherein there is an aptitude of combining. But in the end of many words their fault is ſuch, that whereas the Latines call them but ſemivowels, or halfe vowels, they deſerve of us to be entituled three-quarter vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els at leaſt, in that the chiefe force of the ſyllable relies upon them. For example, when any Liquid after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Conſonant in the ſame ſyllable terminates a word, as onely joyned with <hi>E</hi> finall, or <hi>Es</hi> plurall, where <hi>E</hi> is
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:9747:37"/>
the ſame. The pronunciation of that ſyllable conſiſts chiefly by vertue of the Liquid, as in <hi>ble, bles; cre, cres; ſme, ſmes; gne, gnes,</hi> &amp;c. which we will more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly inſtance, in words exemplar. Where note <hi>L,</hi> and <hi>R,</hi> are the two Principle, as of moſt uſe in this kinde, and combined with moſt conſonants: The other two leſſe uſefull, and more rarely happening.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>L</hi> therefore may be thus combined under <hi>b, c, d, f, g, k, p, ſ, t, x, z.</hi> as in <hi>fable, uncle, fidle, trifle, ſtruggle, ſickle, apple, miſle, caſtle, axle, drizle,</hi> which ſome write <hi>driſle,</hi> nor do I diſallow it. Theſe taken in the plurall number of ſuch as be ſubſtantives, produce theſe words, <hi>fables, uncles, fidles, trifles, ſickles, apples, caſtles, axles;</hi> and in the third perſon ſingular of ſuch as be Verbs, come <hi>Struggles, miſles, drizles,</hi> &amp;c. and diverſe other of the ſame nature, proceeding from theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonants. Their pronunciation we will ſpecifie under one generall head of them altogether; when we have examined the reſt.</p>

                  <hi>R</hi> generally may be combined under <hi>b, c, d, f, g, p, t, w.</hi> But taken in the ſenſe, is ſeldome put after any but <hi>c, g,</hi> and <hi>w.</hi> In many words with the two former it remaines invariable in this kinde, as in <hi>acre, maugre,</hi> &amp;c. Combined with <hi>w,</hi> in this imperfect manner, may, and often is altered by interpoſing the <hi>E</hi> between <hi>W</hi> and <hi>R,</hi> and ſo made a perfect ſyllable, as in <hi>towre,</hi> or <hi>tower,</hi> both which be according to Orthography. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I moſt commend the latter altogether, as a ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; the former as a verb for diſtinction ſake.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M</hi> in our Engliſh Tongue is onely combined under <hi>S,</hi> as appeares by the table of ſyllables mixt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>N</hi> onely under <hi>G</hi> at the end of a word, and that for the moſt part in ſuch words as we take immediately
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:9747:38"/>
from the Latine, as <hi>condigne,</hi> of <hi>condignus; oppugne,</hi> of <hi>oppugno</hi> the Verb; <hi>benigne,</hi> of <hi>benignus;</hi> &amp;c. <hi>M</hi> we find thus combined, chiefly in words either mediately or immediately comming from the Greeke; as will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by comparing this place with our treatiſe of <hi>aſme,</hi> in the ſyllables mixt.</p>
               <p>The manner of pronouncing them is thus as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes. Frame your voice as if you would ſound all the letters, and withall the <hi>E;</hi> but ſo ſoone as you have pronounced the two conſonants, there ſtop, and omit the <hi>E.</hi> As for example.</p>

Since it would argue a greater imperfection in our Tongue to propoſe a ſyllable without the Character, than the force of a vowell, in that we attribute a further faculty to the Liquids, than to the <hi>E,</hi> taken in this manner: Which ſerves as a Cypher in Arithmetick, to fill up, or ſupply a roome, but onely to add the greater vigour to the precedent Letters. And whereas ſome would have <hi>acres, Tygres,</hi> and diverſe others of this kinde, to be written <hi>akers, tigers,</hi> &amp;c. would cuſtome ſo permit, I for my part ſhould never refuſe the accepting a perfect ſyllable, for an imperfect: by imperfect meaning, ſuch as be produced without the perfect force of a vowell. For further ſatisfaction in any thing hereto concerning, I remit you to my former treatiſes; not loving Tauto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies, more than for neceſſity.</p>

               <head>Certaine briefe Rules of ſpelling reduced to a method.</head>
               <p>BY ſpelling I underſtand the due ordring of ſyllables in a juſt proportion, as they are to be together com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended under their ſeverall accents: or a certain way of attributing to every ſyllable its true quantity or mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the number of letters therto belonging; whether as an integrall part of a word, or conſtituting the whole.</p>
               <p>To this is requiſite firſt to know the number of ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lables in every word, then their diviſion.</p>
               <p>For the number, we will produce a generall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, though not without its exceptions.</p>
               <p>The Latines have it as an infallible and certaine rule in this kind: That ſo many vowels or dipthongs, as are in a word, ſo many ſyllables. But we muſt frame it in the Engliſh Tongue with more circumſtance, which ſhall be thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So many vowels, as occurre in any word, to be produced under diverſe accents, or with ſeverall motions of breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſo many ſyllables.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I put this diſtinction as a reſtraint to the generality of the rule, by reaſon of theſe exceptions.</p>
               <p>Firſt of the dipthongs, where two vowels comming together, are joyntly comprehended under one accent.</p>
               <p>Secondly, of the Tripthongs, where three vowels are together combined in one ſyllable.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, of <hi>E</hi> finall; which (as I ſaid before) ſerves either to make the precedent vowelllong, that goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it in the ſame ſyllable, as in <hi>Alchy<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mie,</hi> where <hi>A</hi> is ſhort, and <hi>ale,</hi> where <hi>A</hi> is made long by <hi>E</hi> ſucceeding <hi>L:</hi> or for a difference in the pronunciation of <hi>G,</hi> as in <hi>rang,</hi> of ring; and <hi>range</hi> or ſtray, &amp;c. Or to add ſome
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:9747:39"/>
life and vigour to a Liquid in the producing a ſyllable, as you lately heard in the liquids.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, of <hi>E</hi> in <hi>es</hi> finall, by me already ſo often men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, to wit, when <hi>S</hi> in the plurall number is added to ſuch words as exact <hi>E</hi> finall in the Orthography of the ſingular: for in this caſe, <hi>E</hi> in <hi>es</hi> hath in it ſelfe no force; unleſſe the conſonant preceding in the ſingular number, be either <hi>C, G,</hi> or <hi>S;</hi> and then <hi>E</hi> in the plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall number before <hi>S</hi> finall, maketh a diſtinct ſyllable, as in <hi>ace, aces; age, ages; noſe, noſes:</hi> as likewiſe after either of theſe combinations <hi>ch,</hi> or <hi>ſh;</hi> as in <hi>Church, Churches; aſh, aſhes,</hi> &amp;c. The ſame rule for <hi>es</hi> plurall in Subſtantives, holds in all reſpects effectuall in <hi>es</hi> fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall in the third perſon ſingular of the preſent tenſe of the Indicative mood. Wherefore I ſhall not need to inſtance any further particulars, concerning that; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe I would be unneceſſarily tedious, which is farre beſides my meaning. As for certaine adverbs and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions which might hitherto be reduced, I referre them to the Readers obſervation; leaſt in ſtriving to be ſo exact, I might produce a mountaine of a mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill.</p>
               <p>Theſe foure exceptions therefore duly pondered, and had reſpect unto, the number of ſyllables will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily occurre, being otherwiſe equall with the number of the vowels. And thus much for the number; now for the diviſion of ſyllables, as they ought to be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed truly one from another.</p>
               <p>This then we will endeavour to illuſtrate in theſe few enſuing rules.</p>
               <p>Firſt therefore when two vowels come together in the middle of a word, not combined, that is, not being a dipthong, but ſeverally to be pronounced, then for
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:9747:40"/>
the diviſion of the ſyllables, you ſhall take the former vowell, as proper to the former ſyllable; the latter to the enſuing. Likewiſe when two conſonants come ſo together, put the one conſonant to the former ſyllable, the other to the latter, as in <hi>tri-vi-all, lar-ger.</hi> Except the two conſonants occurring in the middle of the word be one of the combinations inſtanced in the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of ſyllables mixt, which be theſe, <hi>bl, br, ch, cl, cr, dr, dw, fl, fr, gl, gr, gh, kn, pl, pr, ph, ſc, sk, ſh, ſl, ſm, ſn, ſp, ſq, ſt, ſw, th, tr, tw, wh, wr;</hi> for all thoſe combinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that are apt to begin a word, are likewiſe apt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin a ſyllable, and therefore ought not to be divided in the ſpelling. But whenſoever they happen otherwiſe together, either ſeverall conſonant doubled, they be alwaies diſtinguiſhed in the diviſion of the ſyllables; unleſſe when it happens in the end of a word, that two conſonants be unneceſſarily doubled, as in <hi>be-ginne,</hi> which is no more but <hi>begin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, when any ſingle conſonant thus occurres in the middle of a word of diverſe ſyllables, you ſhall end the precedent ſyllable at the vowell, and let the conſonant fall to that ſucceeds; for no ſyllable in the middle of a word can end in a conſonant, unleſſe the ſyllable following hath another to begin withall, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be in words derivative, or compounded, where every ſyllable exacts the letters appropriate to the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple word, as ſhall anon be further inſtanced.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, when three conſonants ſo happen together, you ſhall divide them in this manner: If the firſt be a ſingle conſonant, and the two latter a combination, take up the ſingle conſonant in the former ſyllable, and let the other two fall to the latter: and ſo <hi>è contra;</hi> for it's requiſite that two of them be a combination, and be
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:9747:40"/>
thus divided, unleſſe perchance it may ſo happen, that <hi>H</hi> interpoſeth the two extreme conſonants (which ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rarely is ſeen but in the beginning of a word) and ſo make a ſemi-double combination; for then all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonants fall to the latter ſyllable, as in <hi>be-ſhrew.</hi> Theſe kinde of combinations be onely in ſome pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar words, and not much uſuall, eſpecially <hi>Chr, Phr, Scr, Sch, Shr, Str, Thr,</hi> more frequently oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre.</p>
               <p n="4">4 If foure Conſonants come together (as more can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not) and make a double combination, they muſt be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually divided. But if the firſt be a ſingle conſonant, and the other combined, take up the ſingle conſonant, and let the other three fall, as in <hi>con-ſtraine, en-thrall:</hi> ſo <hi>è contra.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5 If three vowels come together, not being a Trip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thong, or combined in one ſyllable. If the former be a dipthong, and the other a ſingle vowell, as in <hi>bayard,</hi> take up the dipthong in the firſt ſyllable, and let the vowell fall to the latter: and ſo on the contrary part.</p>
               <p n="6">6 If <hi>X,</hi> as it often doth occurre in the middle of a word, you ſhall alwaies take it up in the former ſylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, though there be no other conſonant follow where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to begin the latter: becauſe it implies the force of <hi>cs,</hi> which is no combination that can begin a ſyllable (in the Engliſh or Latin, but uſuall in the Greeke) end it may, and frequently doth.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, when two complete words are compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, or together united in one, you ſhall in the ſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling have reſpect unto them, as they were both ſimple; as in <hi>ſave-guard,</hi> which hath but two ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lables.

or words derived, which have alwayes relation to their primitives, though ſomtimes by way of mediation, as in <hi>ſtrength-en</hi> of <hi>ſtrength; ſtrength-en-ing</hi> of <hi>ſtrengthen,</hi> &amp;c. where <hi>E</hi> in the middle ſyllable is often cut off by <hi>Syncope,</hi> and made <hi>ſtrength'ning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For a concluſion of this treatiſe, we will onely add a word or two concerning <hi>Ti</hi> in the middle of a word.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ti,</hi> before a vowell that is to begin another ſyllable in the ſame word, is alwayes <hi>ci</hi> or <hi>ſi</hi> in pronunciation, except it followes <hi>X,</hi> or <hi>S;</hi> or that the ſyllable follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be but an addition to a complete word ending in <hi>ti,</hi> happening uſually in adjectives of the comparative and ſuperlative degrees of compariſon; and participles, whoſe verbs had their termination in <hi>ti,</hi> or <hi>ty,</hi> as in <hi>lof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, loftier, loftiest; mighty, mightier, mightieſt. Pitty, pittying, pittied,</hi> &amp;c. which be the uſuall terminations of ſuch words.

               <p>But now it is time that we leave our childiſh di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, and perſiſt with what more directly intends to our Scope. Suppoſing therefore the premiſes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions enough, for the ſpelling, and finding out any Engliſh word; or in what may concerne the letters either ſeverall or combined; it onely remaines, that we ſay ſomwhat of the ſtops, or pauſes, between ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and ſentence, for the more renable (as we call it) and diſtinct reading. Which notwithſtanding it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly belongs to Orthography: yet by reaſon Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphie and Orthoepie be neceſſarily ſo concomitant (as being impoſſible to be perfect in the one without the other) and we have ſo promiſcuouſly uſed them, to ſhew their difference as occaſion ſerved; we have thought fit to inſert this briefe peculiar treatiſe hereof, as a Concluſion to our Engliſh Orthoepie; eſpecially ſince we have made that the chiefe title to this little booke (as chiefly undertaking what thereto apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines) and that the knowledge of theſe ſtops or points is no leſſe conducible, and hypothetically neceſſary to diſtinct and ready reading (the perfection of Orthoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie) than to Orthographie, or right writing: though I will not further inferre, knowing it ſo requiſite to both.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:9747:43"/>
Theſe ſtops therefore are by the Latines termed <hi>Comma; Comma-colon; colon; periodus; Interrogatio; Parentheſis; Exclamatio; Apoſtrophe, ſive contractionis nota, vel ſignum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Their number (you ſee eight) their figure and uſe enſues.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Comma</hi> hath its place at the foot of the line, and is marked with a ſemi-circular forme like an halfe Moone decreſcent thus (,) The uſe onely in long ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, in the moſt convenient places to make a ſmall pauſe for the neceſſity of breathing; or in Rhetoricall ſpeeches (where many words are uſed to one effect) to make a kinde of Emphaſis and deliberation for the greater majeſty or ſtate of the Elocution.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Comma-colon,</hi> as you ſee by the name, partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pates of both the <hi>Comma</hi> and the <hi>Colon;</hi> The one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining his proper place, the other above the figure thus (;) This to the Ancients was not knowne; but now in no leſſe uſe than eſtimation, eſpecially among Rhetori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians. Who in their long winded ſentences, and redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, have it as a conſtant pack-horſe, to make ſome ſhort deliberation as it were of little ſentences, as the <hi>Comma</hi> doth of words; the time of pauſe about double that of the <hi>Comma</hi> generally, which yet is very ſmall.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Colon</hi> (which we vulgarly call two prickes or points) is deciphered in the forme of two periods, the one at the foot, the other at the upper part of the body of the line, thus (:) It is chiefly uſed in the diviſion of ſentences, and exacts halfe the pauſe of a <hi>Period;</hi> and halfe as much againe as a <hi>Comma-Colon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Period</hi> is onely a ſingle point, ſet at the lower part of the body of the line thus (.) This is altogether
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:9747:43"/>
uſed at the end of every ſpeech or ſentence, as the name it ſelfe implies (being derived from the Greek) and ſignifies <hi>concluſion.</hi> The pauſe or diſtance of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hereto appropriate is ſometime more, ſometime leſſe: for (ſetting aſide the Epilogicall diſtinction, as it terminates whole treatiſes) when in the middle of a line it cuts off any integrall part of a complete Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate, which goes not on with the ſame, but begins a new line, it requireth double the time of pauſe, that it doth when the Treatiſe perſiſts in the ſame line: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then foure times as long as a <hi>Colon,</hi> which in the ſame line is but twice.</p>
               <p>I remember my ſinging-Maſter taught me to keep time, by telling from 1, to 4, according to the nature of the time which I was to keep, and I found the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice thereof much eaſe and certainty to me, till I was perfect in it. The ſame courſe I have uſed to my pupils in their reading, to inure them to the diſtinction of their pauſes, and found it no leſſe ſucceſſefull.</p>
               <p>But here you muſt take notice, that many times this point or period marke is many times ſet after great or Capitall Letters ſingle; not for any pauſe or diſtance of time, but onely as a note of abbreviation of ſome propername, or other word beginning with the ſame letter. Which you ſhall thus diſtinguiſh. For if the point ſucceeds ſuch a capitall letter, it argues onely an abbreviation, and no time of pauſe: but if the great letter ſucceeds the point, it argues onely a period pauſe, and no abbreviation. For as in Orthography ſuch ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breviations ought to be marked with ſuch a point; ſo every <hi>Period</hi> ought to have a Capitall Letter immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſucceeding.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:9747:44"/>
The <hi>Interrogation</hi> point is figured thus (?) taking both name and uſe <hi>ab interrogando.</hi> Being onely uſed when any queſtion is asked. The pauſe it requires, is more or leſſe according to the matter and ſeriouſneſſe of the queſtion, but generally the ſame with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Period,</hi> as it ordinarily fals in the middle of any treatiſe.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Parentheſis</hi> hath the figure of two ſemi-circles or halfe Moones creſcent, and decreſcent, either incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to other, thus (). For pauſe it requires as little as may be; exacting rather a diſtinction of <hi>tone,</hi> than diſtance of <hi>time.</hi> By reaſon the uſe of it only is, when any thing is introduced in a ſentence, which might be left out, and yet the other ſentence remaine entire.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Exclamation</hi> point is moſt ſubject to interjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or converſions of the voice. It takes the name <hi>ab exclamando,</hi> the uſe from ſignes of exclamation and wonder. The marke it beares is this (!) The pauſe that belongs to it, is likewiſe to be reduced to that of the Period.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Apoſtrophe</hi> or mark of contraction is variouſly ſubject (according to the place it poſſeſſes) to the three figures, <hi>Aphareſis, Syncope,</hi> and <hi>Apocope:</hi> that is, according as the contraction be in the beginning, middle, or end of a word: as in <hi>'twill, Apoſtrophe eſt Aphaereſis nota,</hi> for <hi>it will:</hi> in <hi>ſtrength'ning, Syncopes:</hi> in <hi>th'intent, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocopes,</hi> &amp;c. The marke, as you ſee, the ſame with the <hi>Comma,</hi> onely the difference is of place, in that this ſtands over the upper part of the line where the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is; almoſt in the ſame manner that the Greeks ſet their note of aſpiration, where they intend to aſpirate any vowell. For pauſe of time, it hath none belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it, and therefore not ſo properly inſerted among
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:9747:44"/>
the points, or ſtops. But onely as I thought it conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, by reaſon of the Character; which is neceſſary to be knowne and diſtinguiſhed.</p>
               <p>Taken in the two firſt kindes, that is, by way of <hi>Aphaereſis</hi> and <hi>Syncope,</hi> it chiefly appertaines to Poets, who uſe it very frequently. By way of <hi>Apocope,</hi> it is incident likewiſe to Lawyers, as chiefly prone to cut off entailes, where, in their writings, two words occurre, whereof the former ends, and the latter beginnes with a vowell, they uſually com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine theſe two words in one, by contracting the laſt vowell of the former, and including it in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (as it often happens in ſuch, as to augment their owne liberties have infringed other mens) eſpecially <hi>E</hi> ſingle, as in <hi>th'intent, th'Archangell,</hi> &amp;c. for <hi>the intent, the Archangell,</hi> &amp;c. where after the common courſe of the world, <hi>the weakeſt goe by the walls,</hi> or rather the worſt, and the great word ingroſſeth in the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, like uſurers and fiſhes. And thus much for <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strophe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This enſuing piece of non-ſenſe I have onely of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe framed and hereto annexed to exemplifie further the uſe of the precedent Points in their ſeverall kinds, <hi>per Erotema.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Are there any certaine hiſtories (I pray you, if I may not too much interrupt you) that might induce a man of judgement to believe, that there are in nature ſuch creatures, as be call'd <hi>Anthropophagi,</hi> or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaters?</p>
               <p>Oh Heavens! that ever any Scholler ſhould argue himſelfe of ſo much ignorance, as to propoſe ſuch a queſtion! Hath not <hi>Plinie?</hi> Hath not <hi>Iſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore?</hi> Hath not <hi>Columbus?</hi> Hath not <hi>Albertus?</hi>

have not the beſt of naturall Hiſtorians and Geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers ſufficiently depicted them? But whether they did it of their owne knowledge, as having ſeen them; or that they had it meerly from the relation of others, that I cannot tell. But they all agree in this: <hi>India</hi> (ſay they) hath certaine Iſlands wherein ſuch creatures be: <hi>America</hi> many; and ſome in <hi>Africa.</hi> Thus <hi>India</hi> is call'd their harbour; <hi>America</hi> their nurſe; <hi>Africa</hi> their home. Travellers, Merchants, Hiſtoriogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, report, aſſure, relate, partly what themſelves have ſeen; partly what approved in their wofull com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, left to be entombed in the bellies of thoſe monſters: while they themſelves with much adoe eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped, onely to be the dolefull narratours of ſo ſad a ſtory. But whereas ſome Philoſophers and Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ſtand to oppoſe, it cannot be in nature, neither that mans fleſh can nouriſh, or yeeld any nutriment: And whereas, on the other ſide, ſome produce argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from experience, of ſavage beaſts, that will eat, devoure, and (had they ſufficient thereof) would live onely by ſuch; which argues they are nouriſhed by it; and thereupon conclude, if it affords nutriment to ſuch ſavage beaſts; why not to thoſe creatures, almoſt as ſavage as the wildeſt bruit (notwithſtanding as men they be potentially endued with reaſon; but that ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained by the organs, and limited to ſenſe, as they may truly in a kinde be termed <hi>Rationis expertes)</hi> 'tis not here my purpoſe to diſpute, having already ſaid more of them than at firſt I intended.</p>

                  <hi>Certaine peculiar Rules of</hi> Orthography.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>ORthography</hi> is the Art of right writing; as the Ety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mologie of the name in the Greeke Tongue im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, and the common acception among Grammarians approves. The difference between it and <hi>Orthoepie,</hi> who ſo underſtands their termes in Greek, may eaſily comprehend: the one appertaining to right ſpeaking, the other to right writing. <hi>Orthography</hi> (according to the preſent uſe) is chiefly verſed in the Letters, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their Quantity; to wit, as they be decyphered in Capitall or leſſer Characters, and the knowledge how to diſpoſe of theſe in writing: <hi>viz.</hi> when to uſe great letters, when ſmall. And on the relation hereto ſhall our enſuing diſcourſe be chiefly grounded. For to inferre here a generall treatiſe of <hi>Orthography,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the latitude of the terme, how it hath reference to the Letters, both ſingle and combined, and that as parts of a word; and ſo proceeding <hi>methodo compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vâ;</hi> to treat of theſe words, as part of a ſentence; and ſentences, as the integrall parts of a complete treatiſe; and how diſtinguiſhed by the points: were in a circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar gyre to bring about a needleſſe repetition of what we have already bent the aime of all precedent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; and for our owne purpoſe ſufficiently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed; and (I thinke) enough to ſatisfie any reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable capacity: If not, ſince it is <hi>facile inventis addere,</hi> let any one enlarge the foundation which we (ſo farre
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:9747:46"/>
forth as our knowledge extends) have firſt laid in our Engliſh Tongue. But now to returne. Concerning the uſe of the Capitall Letters, therefore take theſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with you.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Every Treatiſe, or written ſpeech whatſoever, is to begin with a great letter, that is, to have the firſt letter of the firſt word of the Treatiſe, written or printed, with a Capitall, or great Character, in what hand or impreſſion ſoever the diſcourſe is to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The ſame is to be obſerved in the beginning of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very diſtinct ſentence, or clauſe. For (as I ſaid before) after every period point muſt enſue a great letter.</p>
               <p n="3">3 The pronoune, or word <hi>(I)</hi> muſt alwayes be written with a great letter; ſo muſt every proper name, or peculiar denomination of every individuall: as all the Attributes of God Almighty, the names of Angels, Saints, and evill ſpirits; the titles given by the Heathens to their faigned Gods ard Goddeſſes; the names of men and women of all ſorts whatſoever; the names of moneths, winds, rivers, Cities, townes, Iſlands and Kingdoms: the particular name of any pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar dog, horſe, or beaſt of any kind ſoever: The firſt word of every verſe, at leaſt Heroique: any letter ſet for a number, as you had in the beginning of our Orthoepie: Any letter ſtanding for any ſuch, or the abbreviation as we there mentioned.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, all names or Titles of Magiſtrates, Arts, Offices, and Dignities, in what reſpect ſoever taken. In theſe, I ſay, altogether conſiſts the uſe of Capitall Letters, in all other we uſe onely the ſmaller.</p>
               <p>Where you may take notice, That in the abbrevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:9747:46"/>
I ſpake of to be written with great letters, I included not any ſuch Charactericall abbreviation of a word, as <hi>&amp;</hi> for <hi>and, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                  </hi> for <hi>the, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                  </hi> for <hi>that;</hi> and a thouſand more commonly occurring, beſides what every man hath peculiar to himſelfe, which onely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience and practice muſt make familiar to you: but thoſe which are thus to bee diſtinguiſhed; to wit, when you would abbreviate any word, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proper name, or other word uſuall in ſuch ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breviations, which is to bee expreſſed by the firſt letter of the word, then are ye to uſe a great Letter in all thoſe Abbreviations, otherwiſe not. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, I referre you to our treatiſe of Letters <hi>in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere,</hi> in the firſt part of the <hi>Orthoepie</hi> here ſpecified, in this little book.</p>
               <p>The next caution after the great Letters is for <hi>E</hi> finall, or when it fals in the end of a word, that you never omit it, where it ought to be inſerted: whether for diſtinction ſake, as in <hi>win,</hi> the verbe, and <hi>wine,</hi> the ſubſtantive: or onely to make the precedent vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell long, as in <hi>ſhrine:</hi> or after <hi>v,</hi> to make it a conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, which otherwiſe ſeeming to be combined with the former vowell in the nature of a dipthong, might ſo alter the pronunciation, as in <hi>love,</hi> which without the <hi>E</hi> would be ſounded like <hi>lou,</hi> in <hi>loud,</hi> ſo <hi>move, live,</hi> and a great many more of the like kinde: or for diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of diverſe words ending in <hi>G,</hi> aſwell ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives as verbs, as in <hi>rang,</hi> and <hi>range,</hi> &amp;c. which I inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced before.</p>
               <p>Or laſtly, when in <hi>es,</hi> terminating either verbe or ſubſtantive, it ought of right to bee put for any of the uſes above rehearſed. Becauſe many times as it makes a difference in pronunciation, ſo
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:9747:47"/>
it much varies the ſenſe: as in theſe words, <hi>made, mad, Cage</hi> for a bird, <hi>Cag</hi> of beare, <hi>rid, ride, ſafe, ſaffron. Dame,</hi> or matron of a family, <hi>dam</hi> of a mill, and <hi>damne</hi> the Verb, to condemne. <hi>Sack, ſake</hi> (where note as a generall rule, that when any vowell before <hi>k</hi> ſounds ſhort, we alwayes write <hi>c</hi> before <hi>k;</hi> as in <hi>ſtick,</hi> or <hi>rack;</hi> but when the vowell is to be pronounced long, we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes write it with <hi>k</hi> ſingle, and add <hi>E</hi> finall to it, as in <hi>rake,</hi> &amp;c.) <hi>man, mane</hi> of an horſe: <hi>gap,</hi> or breach, <hi>gape: Ware, warre; tune</hi> of a ſong, <hi>tun</hi> of wine: <hi>hid, hide; mile, mill,</hi> where the vowell before <hi>L</hi> is ſhort, we uſually double <hi>L</hi> in writing. <hi>Pin, pine,</hi> &amp;c. diverſe of this ſort. And here likewiſe take notice of what we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced in Orthoepie, That when any word ſeems to end in <hi>S</hi> proper, the vowell being long, we alwayes write it with <hi>Ce,</hi> as in <hi>race, ſlice, mace, mice,</hi> &amp;c. for (as I ſaid) <hi>S</hi> in this caſe ſounds alwayes <hi>Z,</hi> except where it is written as a difference betweene the Subſtantive and Verb, where both ſound alike, as in <hi>raſe,</hi> or demoliſh, the verb; and <hi>race,</hi> that ſuch an one ran; or <hi>race</hi> of gin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; <hi>race</hi> of wine, &amp;c. where their ſound is all one. But otherwiſe the Rule holds generall without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, diligent obſervation ought to be had in writing of ſuch words; where diverſe words of ſeverall Characters, and that of divers meanings, are alike pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced: for example, <hi>Raine</hi> that fals from the clouds, ought to be written thus as you ſee: the <hi>Raigne</hi> of a Prince thus: the <hi>reine</hi> of a bridle (which we uſually and better ſound <hi>quaſi rean)</hi> ſo as is here demonſtrated. <hi>Their,</hi> the pronoune; and <hi>there</hi> the adverbe, or in that place. <hi>Wait</hi> the verbe, and <hi>weight</hi> the ſubſtantive, or quantity. <hi>Write,</hi> when a verb, to play the Scribe (as we
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:9747:47"/>
call it) and <hi>wright</hi> when a Subſtantive, as in <hi>Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright,</hi> and the like. <hi>Prophet</hi> of the old Law; <hi>profit</hi> or gaine. <hi>Read,</hi> proper in the preſent tenſe: but in the preterperfect tenſe both of verb and participle ſounds <hi>E</hi> ſhort, <hi>quaſi red,</hi> yet ought to be thus in writing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from <hi>red</hi> the adjective, or fiery-colour'd. <hi>Heard</hi> the verb, <hi>hard</hi> the adjective. <hi>Here</hi> in this place, I <hi>heare. Deigne,</hi> or vouchſafe, <hi>ſodeine. Some</hi> men, <hi>ſum</hi> of money. <hi>Neigh</hi> of an horſe, and <hi>nay</hi> a note of deniall.</p>
               <p>Alſo all adjectives derived of the Latines, ending in <hi>us,</hi> we write <hi>ous,</hi> as in <hi>glorious, frivolous, victorious.</hi> But all monoſyllables hold proper, as <hi>thus,</hi> not <hi>thous; us,</hi> not <hi>ous,</hi> &amp;c. And ſubſtantives derived of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, which they terminate in <hi>or,</hi> we write <hi>our;</hi> as in <hi>labour, honour, vigour,</hi> &amp;c. Except our monoſyllables, and verbs, as <hi>or,</hi> ought not to be written <hi>our,</hi> which is another word. <hi>For, nor, abhorre,</hi> of <hi>abhorreo; reper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſe,</hi> of <hi>repercutio,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Truſſe, diſcuſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, the Article <hi>A,</hi> (wherof herafter God willing, we will further inform you in our Etymologicall part) and the pronouns <hi>My,</hi> and <hi>Thy,</hi> being to precede a word beginning with a vowell, uſually aſſumes in writing <hi>N,</hi> in the firſt ſingle; in the two laſt with <hi>E</hi> finall, as <hi>an, thine, mine;</hi> to avoid in reading the great <hi>hiatus,</hi> or kinde of gaping in pronunciation, which otherwiſe it would produce; as <hi>an Aſſe,</hi> not <hi>a Aſſe: thine eare,</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than <hi>thy eare: mine injury,</hi> rather than <hi>my injury;</hi> but the two latter be more indifferent, than the former. So on the other ſide muſt we not ſay or write, <hi>an lamb; thine bullock; mine ſheep:</hi> but <hi>a lamb, thy bullock, my ſheep.</hi> And not like the vulgar ſort, who annex this <hi>N</hi>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:9747:48"/>
to the enſuing word, as <hi>a nox, a naſſe, my nuncle, thy naunt;</hi> for <hi>an oxe, mine uncle, thine aunt,</hi> &amp;c. You muſt therefore be very cautious to ſhun in writing the barbarous cuſtome of the vulgars in their pronuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as <hi>ſhoen,</hi> for <hi>ſhoes,</hi> an ordinary fault in ſome countreyes, to put <hi>N,</hi> for <hi>S,</hi> and <hi>E,</hi> for <hi>I;</hi> as <hi>mell,</hi> for <hi>mill; delited,</hi> for <hi>delighted,</hi> &amp;c. ſetting aſide the abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities uſed among the vulgar in <hi>Sommerſet-ſhire,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther remote places, as not worth the nominating, ſo much as by way of reprehenſion: but follow the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of the learned, and obſerve their uſe among Schollers. The reſt I referre to our precedent rules, and your owne practice, and diligent obſervation in reading Claſſicall Authours.</p>
               <p>For a Concluſion therefore of this our firſt part of the <hi>Engliſh Grammar,</hi> whereas <hi>Quintilian</hi> adviſeth in the Latin Tongue, that <hi>Orthography</hi> ſhould be but as the <hi>Custos,</hi> or Depoſitour of <hi>Orthoepie,</hi> as a carefull ſteward: and ſo by conſequence, that one ſhould main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the other: when he wils them by way of inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſpeak, as they write; and write as they ſpeake, for their further eaſe in avoiding multiplicity of rules: I could wiſh the ſame in our Engliſh Tongue; but muſt have patience to expect, till time and further induſtry have reduced it to a further method and perfection, by refining and purging away thoſe groſſe corruptions which ſo tumifie it with unneceſſary ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feits: Which for my part I ſhould be glad to ſee; that there might be no juſt allegation, why we ſhould not have all the liberall Sciences in our own Tongue, aſwell as <hi>France, Spaine,</hi> and other Countreyes. It would, no queſtion, be a great furtherance to reall
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:9747:48"/>
knowledge. But in that kinde I ſhall not be the firſt to innovate, though I lay this ſtone for others to work upon, to build a larger proſpect for the pleaſure of my Countrey-men, and benefit of ſtrangers.</p>

            <head>Certaine briefe Notes, or Directions, for writing of Letters, or familiar Epiſtles.</head>
            <p>ASwell in regard of my promiſe in the preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption or Title page; as to ſatisfie the requeſt of ſome peculiar friends, finding perhaps the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall defect (aſwell in themſelves as others) of ſome il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrations in this kinde: I have annexed theſe few di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections in generall, for the inditing and writing Letters (as we terme them) or familiar Epiſtles, intended one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the benefit of children, women, and perſons ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther altogether ignorant in this reſpect, or diſcontinued. As for Secretaries, and thoſe who can better help them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, I leave them to their owne practice, and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations. For to undertake to reduce this confuſed qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, faculty, or art, (or whatſoever terme you will at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute unto it) to any certaine method, or claſſicall precept; or to ſeek out a <hi>radix,</hi> conſiſting of ſuch prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, whereon every particular muſt <hi>ex hypotheſi</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend (would I, or any Secretary more commendably verſed in thoſe wayes, attempt it) as we ſhould find it a work no leſſe tedious than difficult, and almoſt impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible (unleſſe it were poſſible to know every private mans occaſion) ſo might we to little purpoſe and effect <hi>fruſtra oleum &amp; operam dare,</hi> ſince <hi>Quot homines, tot ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiae;</hi> and it is connaturall for every one, that is able
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:9747:49"/>
to apprehend, to like his owne imagination beſt. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would ever any of the Latines (who knew too well ſeverall men have their ſeverall occaſions) take ſuch a burden upon them, in a tongue more incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably pure; and times farre more addicted to induſtry and knowledge, in what concerned both ſpeculation and practice. <hi>Macropoedius</hi> (I know) ſhewed a will to do ſomwhat herein, and preſcribed certaine generall rules; but ſuch as would better ſuit an Oration, than a familiar Epiſtle, which delights in brevity and plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. The <hi>Paradigma's</hi> or examples there, be well and commendable; but not conſorting the ſtreame of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Secretaries, more taken with <hi>Seneca's</hi> ſuccincter ſtile. But for examples, I referre you to others, ſince there are every where enough to be had, intending one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to deale by way of Inſtruction.</p>
            <p>In the framing of Letters, we are to have reſpect to our ſelves, and the quality of the Perſon to whom we write. For, as it behoves us not to uſe alwayes, and to all perſons a like phraſe, or manner of writing, ſo ought we to be cautious in the performance of it <hi>reſpectivè,</hi> that is, without prejudice to our ſelves, or derogating from the party to whom it is written. If therefore to our Superiour, or one of rank above us; then are we to frame our ſtile in a lowly and humble manner, yet <hi>(habito ſcriptori reſpectu)</hi> according to the diſtance of degree; the worth of both the objects; and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our Letter. For, it befits not a Gentleman to uſe thoſe ſubmiſſive and incroaching termes to one of higher ſtate, and fortunes; which may well become a Peaſant to one of farre meaner rank. Neither would we indeavour to inſinuate our ſelves ſo farre in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reſpect, as when we have ſome ſuit to preferre, or
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:9747:50"/>
ſome requeſt to make. And in generall, it is more to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable to be argued of too plaine a ſtile, (ſo as I ſaid, it be done with due reſpect) than by any Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall flaſhes of elocution, to incurre the cenſure of a Sycophant, as it is incident and uſuall to ſuch as uſe many words to little purpoſe, to be either rejected as idle and impertinent; or els ſuſpected of ſome farther plot, than perhaps the party himſelfe is guilty of. Let therefore your Letters of what na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſoever, be as ſuccinct as poſſible may be, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out circumlocutions, which be tedious to Perſons of quality, and ſuch as have much buſineſſe. And if it be ſo, as they be replete with matters of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence; come preſently to the buſineſſe of moſt importance, conveniently introduced: then perſiſt in order: for otherwiſe, if your Letter be copious, and carries not (as the Proverbe ſayes) meat in the mouth, or matter at the entrance, it may hazzard (if not well ſollicited) to be caſt by, without ſo much as once reading over, as I have knowne ſome my ſelfe among men of worth, who have been much imployed.</p>
            <p>This I ſpeake not though, utterly to debarre the uſe of civill Complement, which is both requiſite, and no wayes inconvenient, ſo it be uſed with diſcretion, and not (as they ſay) to make a paine of paſtime. Complement therefore is moſt ſeaſonable, when it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies either preſent or viſit, I meane aſwell in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per as in perſon. And that alwayes better introduced in the cloſe of a Letter, than at the beginning; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the whole ſubject be onely by way of comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and nothing concerning any ſerious buſineſſe. A thing ordinary, and many times expected betweene
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:9747:50"/>
friend and friend, upon occaſions of writing offered. And then is afforded liberty of uſing wit, and readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of <hi>Genius,</hi> to ſuch as be indued with pregnant phantaſies; having ſtill a care not to be over-ſhot by ſelfe-opinion; leaſt a flaſh of windy matter produce ſuch bubbles, as carry no other ſubſtance, but onely to vapour into ayre; or perhaps turne worſe than no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
            <p>If it be to be written to one inferiour or ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees beneath you; be plauſible and courteous to win reſpect and love: but not too familiar: ſince too much familiarity breeds contempt, eſpecially among people of the meaneſt ſort, moſt apt in ſuch caſes to forget themſelves.</p>
            <p>If to a ſtranger of equall rank, ſhew courteſie in a full proportion, yet cloathed with a petty kinde of ſtate; aſwell to avoid all ſuſpition of intruſion, as to ſhew a kinde of niceneſſe in intimating too ſodaine fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity. For wiſe men will conſider, things eaſilieſt wun, are moſt eaſily loſt; and he that comes faſteſt on, goes quicklieſt off. Give mee the friendſhip comes ſlowly by degrees, for that is moſt likely to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine perfection, and longeſt to continue, as having the ſurer ground for a foundation of it.</p>
            <p>If to a ſervant, let love and mildneſſe ſo proceed, as may not looſe its diſtance; for, too much ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour looſeth the ſervant, and too much love the Maſter; who may eaſily diſcerne love from a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant tempered with a little awe, is alwayes moſt available to the Maſter; as acts voluntary go beyond enforcements.</p>
            <p>If to a Maiſter, let the ſtile be ſuch as may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate all obſequy and duty. This I ſpeake
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:9747:51"/>
in reſpect of ſervants (as ſervants) in generall: not, but that I know, as there are differences and diverſe degrees of Maſters, ſo ought there ſeverall reſpects to be had to ſervants, according to their place, and manner of ſervice. For it were abſurd to think, that Gentlemen in thoſe places that may befit their rank and fortune, though ſubject to their maſters call, ſhould be tied to the obſequious termes of every pedantique Groome. As firſt, he that waits voluntary, and at his owne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence; then Secretaries in their ſeverall ranks; then ſuch as ſerve in the places of Gentlemen, as Uſhers, and the like. Then Clarks to men eminent, and of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; and Clarks appertaining to Offices, Factors, and Apprentices (eſpecially about <hi>London)</hi> men perhaps (as is uſuall in that kind) better derived than their Maſters. In this reſpect, I ſay, ought the ſervant to conſider the relation, or reſpect to be had, according to his Maſters rank, his own perſon, and the nature of his ſervice. yet generally ſpeaking, all ſervants (as ſervants) of what nature or calling ſoever, ought aſwell in writing as otherwiſe, to ſhew a kinde of reſpect extraordinary. Though (as I ſaid) ſome be tied to termes more incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably ſtrict than others.</p>
            <p>If we write to a Parent, our ſtile and manner of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting muſt be ſuch, as may ſhew all dutifull reſpect and obedience, exacted from a Child to a Parent, by the Lawes of God and Nature.</p>
            <p>If to a father or mother in law, that is by marriage, we will tender our ſelves in ſuch termes, as may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe ſervice and obedience; but not duty: At leaſt, not equall to the former: though I grant, we ought to think our ſelves tied in a firme obligation of civill, and more than common reſpect.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:9747:51"/>
If to a child, love and care: But the paſſionate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of tender affection, better fit a mother, than a father: for men ought to governe their affections by the rule of reaſon, leaſt otherwiſe they chance to ſet a bad example of letting looſe the reines of paſſion, of it ſelf too apt to run out of one errour to another.</p>
            <p>In a word, if to a friend, friendly. If to an adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, harſh, as you think good, according to the nature of the offence, and quality of the perſon offending. But not railing, or too invective; which will argue more paſſion, than judgement or diſcretion, and be a meanes to make other men ſuppoſe a want in you of ſomwhat might make you rightly capable of an injury.</p>
            <p>But if it be to a familiar and intimate friend, you ſhall be reſtrained to no other rule, but onely your own ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, and the beſt liking of your friend, according as you ſhall obſerve his conceits moſt addicted, or incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned this way or that. Onely take it as a generall and infallible rule, let the body of your letter be ſuccinct and pithy, ſuch as may expreſſe much matter in few words: and let that be your greateſt ſtudy by way of inditing: And by the way of writing to have reſpect to Orthography, according to thoſe rules we have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore preſcribed. But to come with a bundle of <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumquaques,</hi> after the manner of the vulgar ſort: whoſe common cuſtome is to begin their Letters thus <hi>(Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving friend, The occaſion of my writing unto you, at this preſent time is, to let you underſtand, that I ſhould be very glad to heare you are in good health, as I am at the writing hereof, God be bleſſed therefore, &amp;c.)</hi> on in a whole bede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roule of ribble-rabble is moſt ridiculous and abſurd, in the ſight of one which knowes the manner of indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. For to be glad to heare of their welfare, is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:9747:52"/>
in the title of friend: and to ſend word of your health, it ſuffices to tell if it be not ſo: if not, the other is eaſily imagined. And ſo many prayers and thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings as ſome put in, were better ſpent in their cloſet, where no ayre might circumvent them, than inſerted in ordinary letters (excepting ſuch as paſſe betweene man and wife; parent and child) which paſſing through ſo many hands, may chance to get infection; or at leaſt expoſed to the wind and open ayre, may chance coole their fervour of devotion. But here we likewiſe exempt Apoſtolicall benedictions, ſent from Miniſters (befitting their function and calling, and anſwerable to the Word of God) who in that rightly imitate the worthy Preſident S. <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtles.</p>
            <p>Having therfore marked or creaſed (as we call it) out the paper (which ought to be <hi>in folio,</hi> or <hi>in quarto,</hi> that is an whole ſheet, or an halfe ſheet doubled) and having in the top, after the uſuall cuſtome (eſpecially writing to perſons of worth and quality) left a ſufficient ſpace for a <hi>vacuum,</hi> and as ample a margent (but that is to be ordered more or leſſe, according to the quantity of your paper, and the ſubject, whereon you are to write) then in the firſt place are you to order the ſuperſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or the title to be attributed as an entrance. For your aſſiſtance wherein, you ſhall (as I ſaid before) have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the quality of the perſon to whom it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and your ſelfe; and that whether as an acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, or ſtranger; intimate, or leſſe familiar; having relation or dependance either of other, or not; friend, or adverſary, &amp;c. and then order your title in this manner.</p>
            <p>If therefore it be a Lord (for higher I will not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend, preſuming any, to whom theſe be directed, to

have little intercourſe with Emperours, Monarchs, Kings, Princes, Dukes, Marqueſtes, Earles, &amp;c. or if they have, let them ſeeke other aſſiſtance, or ſend to us, and we ſhall do our indeavour to ſupply their want) if it be ſo, as he holds his title onely by ſome place, or dignity, by way of Office or Magiſtracy, we ſeldome ſuperſcribe any other title than, <hi>My Lord,</hi> and by the way, ſtill in the body of your Letter, put him in minde of his <hi>Lordſhip,</hi> and now and then his <hi>honour,</hi> &amp;c. If he be a Count, or Baron, by deſcent of noble pedigree, our title is chiefly, <hi>Right Honourable: Right Honourable, and my very good Lord</hi> (this from a retainer, or one that hath dependance on his honour) <hi>Moſt noble and illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Sir, Right Honourable and renowned Sir,</hi> and diverſe others to this effect. And from a Gentleman only, <hi>My Lord,</hi> will ſuffice. But ſtill we ought in addreſſing our ſpeech to him, to do it with the attribute of <hi>His Honour,</hi> and now and then for change we may ſay, <hi>Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> or, <hi>Your good Lordſhip,</hi> from one of meaner rank. To a Baronet, <hi>Honoured Sir,</hi> as the moſt uſuall and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitting title to ſuch a degree: which is likewiſe often attributed to other Knights, and ſomtime to Eſquires, and other Gentlemen, by way of Complement. Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen writing to Knights and Baronets, often give onely the title of <hi>Sir,</hi> and <hi>noble Sir; worthy,</hi> or <hi>moſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Sir;</hi> ſometime <hi>Most Noble,</hi> and the like. But I like the plaineſt beſt, eſpecially when one hath much buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and little leiſure to complement. The uſuall ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſcription from one inferiour, or of meaner rank is, <hi>Right worſhipfull,</hi> &amp;c. ſometime <hi>Right renowned,</hi> or right <hi>worthy Sir,</hi> and this comes ſometimes as a Rarity from a punie Scholler, as tumbling from his <hi>thumping pen.</hi> And under the degree of a Gentleman, or a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemans

mate, it behoves in writing to have <hi>his</hi> or <hi>your Worſhip,</hi> by the end along, ſo often as his ſpeech hath relation to the Baronets or Knights perſon. From a peaſant, <hi>your good Worſhip</hi> will not do amiſſe. But from a Gentleman, ridiculous; as arguing little breeding. One Gentleman or Eſquire writing to another, uſually attribute onely the title of <hi>Sir,</hi> eſpecially if ſtrangers, or leſſe intimate: if better acquainted, many times ſome other addition, of <hi>Noble, Worthy, Courteous, Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, Kinde,</hi> and the like, according to their intimacie, affection, and difference of eminency and fortunes. Somtime, if very intimate, more familiar termes, which they ordinarily uſe in diſcourſe. But from one of a meaner ſort, or not a Gentleman, would be thought a ſawcineſſe, or arrogancy at leaſt, to do ſo; unleſſe from ſuch make-ſports, as Gentlemen make uſe of onely to foole with. From a Tradeſman therefore (of the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſort I meane) writing to an Eſquire, the title of <hi>Worſhipfull Sir,</hi> or <hi>Worthy Sir,</hi> or the like, and now and then to pull <hi>your Worſhip</hi> out of his pocket (eſpecially if to one any wayes eminent or of quality) is no more than beſeeming and requiſite. To leſſe eminent, or of meane fortunes, or younger houſes, <hi>Sir,</hi> will ſuffice. The like ought to be obſerved in farmers, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey-people, of meaner rank. Gentlemen of quality, whether Knights, Eſquires, or other Gentlemen of worth and fortune, writing to Yeomen of the more ſubſtantiall ſort, ſuch as go under juriſdiction of the common attribute <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>,</hi> and whom ſuch men pleaſe to make their companions in table and diſcourſe, if they be any thing intimate, uſually begin their title, <hi>Honeſt Thom. Kinde Ieffrey, Good Will</hi> ſuch an one, &amp;c. if leſſe acquainted, or when they are to be beholding to them
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:9747:53"/>
for any courteſie, then it will not be amiſſe to hang on their noſes, as ſpectacles, at firſt entrance, <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
               </hi> ſuch, or ſuch an one, &amp;c. writing to any kinde of <hi>Scoggin,</hi> or hanger on, or the like, then nothing but <hi>Dick, Thom.</hi> &amp;c. I prethee do ſuch a thing, &amp;c. To an ordinary yeoman or tradeſman, <hi>Goodman,</hi> &amp;c. is a good begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. But alwayes let Schollers and younger Brothers give the higheſt of his attributes to any wealthy man, for 'tis the money, and not the man they are to reſpect and court. But in perſonating a Letter from one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther under the degree, or at leaſt the title of a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, he will be accounted more woodcock than wiſe, that ſhall ſtudy any other complement, than to begin with the ordinary title appropriate to them, and ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt. The ſame kinde of common title appropriate to the Perſon, is to be uſed in civility, when we write to one we hold as an adverſary, as to a Knight of what ſort ſoever, <hi>Sir</hi> ſuch an one, &amp;c. To an Eſquire, if much above our rank, it is decent to ſay <hi>Sir,</hi> if not the ſame that to a Gentleman. If to a Gentleman of what rank or nature ſoever, <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
               </hi> ſuch an one, putting in his ſurname. If under, then <hi>Goodman</hi> thus or thus; or from a Gentleman to one much inferiour, <hi>Iohn, Thomas, Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard,</hi> So and So, &amp;c. And thus much for titles or ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſcriptions. This is uſually placed in the firſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in the margent ſpace, above the body of your Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But I had like to have forgot the Eccleſiaſticall ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of <hi>Reverend Sir,</hi> or <hi>Moſt Reverend,</hi> &amp;c. according to their worth and dignity. Having therefore thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced the ſeverall ſorts of Superſcriptions, we will now come to the Subſcriptions, (for the body of a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter can be reduced to no preciſe or particular rule, without too much needleſſe labour and innovation)
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:9747:54"/>
and in generall, we have already ſaid what we deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</p>
            <p>The ſame generall rule therefore, that ties you, in the ſuperſcription and body of the Letter to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the party to whom you write, and your owne individuall perſon, ties you to the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions in the ſubſcription, and indorſement, or outward ſuperſcription, which wee bee ſtill to treat of.</p>
            <p>To a Baron therefore, or to a Lord, wee u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually ſubſcribe thus. <hi>Your honours moſt humble ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, My Lord, Your eternally devoted Honourer, and thrice humble ſervant. Your Lordſhips moſt faithfull and moſt humble ſervant. Your Lordſhips till death, Your Lordſhips to command, Your Honours moſt obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,</hi> &amp;c. diverſe of this ſort. Subſcriptions indeed as common as Hackney horſes on <hi>Dunſtable</hi> rode, to meaner perſons than Barons, or Knights either, onely leaving out Honour and Lordſhip. But <hi>Your thrice humble ſervant,</hi> and the like, I have often heard from ſuch as (I preſume) underſtood not the word.</p>
            <p>From Gentleman to Gentleman, if equall, and acquainted, then <hi>Your aſſured friend to ſerve you, Your truly reſpective friend,</hi> or the like. But if leſſe acquainted, or different in degree, There is ſo much ſervice profeſſed, as they forget all friendſhip. Nothing then but <hi>Your ſervant, Your humble ſervant, Sir, at your command,</hi> and the like innumerable, which I leave to obſervation and practice. Onely take this by the way, that one of inferiour ranke writing to a perſon eminent in degree above him, by the Lawes of our beſt Secretaries, ſhall commonly write his name
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:9747:54"/>
at the foot of all the Letter, or paper, be it never ſo large, and the contents never ſo ſmall, to ſhew his acknowledgement of diſtance. The other ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption about middle diſtance, betweene the body of the Letter, and the name. And that either double or ſingle, as occaſion is offered of your expreſſion, and the quantity of ſpace, or void paper. Sometime they make it in a treble ſpace, by interpoſing <hi>My Lord,</hi> or <hi>Sir,</hi> or <hi>noble,</hi> or <hi>worthy Sir,</hi> and the like, according to their degree. From an inferiour per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to a Baronet or Knight, <hi>Your Worſhips moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſervant, Your Worſhips to command in all due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,</hi> and the like. The ſame is to bee obſerved in one of meane ranke, to an Eſquire, eſpecially if of worth, or any wiſe eminent. To or between men of ordinary quality, whether under the title of Gentlemen, Citizens and tradeſmen, or the like, the uſuall ſubſcription of <hi>Your loving friend, Your very loving friend, Your aſſured, Your faithfull, Your true,</hi> (and ſometime, <hi>Your reſpective friend,</hi> for change, or where the party written to hath the odds in eſtimation) is moſt commendable. In briefe notes, no more but <hi>Yours, N. N.</hi> To a Gentleman of ordinary quality from an inferiour perſon, <hi>Your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, Yours to command,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>To an adverſary, <hi>Yours as you uſe me. Yours to uſe, but not abuſe. Yours if you pleaſe; if not, mine owne. Yours as I ſee cauſe. Yours when not mine owne,</hi> and the like, as your judgement, and the occaſion offered ſhall ſuggeſt.</p>
            <p>To a ſervant under hire, from a Gentleman of ranke, onely his name. To ſuch as are tyed to leſſe ſervile conditions, or from Maſters which are of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:9747:55"/>
meaner degree, <hi>Your loving Maſter, Your very loving Maſter, Your aſſured</hi> &amp;c. To a retainer only, or volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry waiter, <hi>Your loving friend, N. N.</hi> &amp;c. To a parent, <hi>Your dutifull, Your moſt dutifull,</hi> or, <hi>Moſt dutifull and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective, Dutifull and moſt obedient, till death,</hi> &amp;c. whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſonne or daughter. To a child, <hi>Your loving father, Your affectionate mother: Affectionate</hi> is likewiſe much uſed between friend and friend, eſpecially Lovers. <hi>Your truly carefull,</hi> &amp;c. diverſe in this kinde, which we leave to obſervation. And thus much for ſubſcriptions.</p>
            <p>Having thus written or ſubſcribed your Letter, date it from ſuch or ſuch a place, and ſet down the day of the moneth, and (if much diſtance interpoſeth the writer and the party written to) the yeare, after the uſuall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of dating. The place allotted for the date is in the margent ſpace, juſt under the ſuperſcription, or title, a little beneath the body of the Letter. This done, fold up your Letter after a decent order, and ſeale it. To a perſon of quality we uſually propoſe it in a large fold, kept very faire. To others at your owne diſcretion, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially of equals. Now therefore onely reſteth, that we ſay ſomwhat of indorſements, or outward ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions, and ſo commit them to the Poſt.</p>
            <p>Your title on the indorſement to a Lord ſhall be, <hi>To the right Honourable, Thomas</hi> (or whatſoever other Chriſtian name) <hi>Lord</hi> ſuch or ſuch an one, adding the higheſt of his titles, at ſuch a place, theſe preſent. <hi>To the right honourable and his very good Lord,</hi> of or from one of any dependance. <hi>To the right honourable and moſt noble, Most renowned, Right illuſtrious,</hi> &amp;c. multitudes of Epithetes in this kinde. To a Baronet from a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, <hi>To his moſt honoured friend, Sir N. N.</hi> and <hi>Much honoured and moſt noble friend, Moſt worthy, Very noble,</hi>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:9747:55"/>

               </gap> think fit. The ſame we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly uſe to any other Knight: but eſpecially to a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronet is appropriate the title of <hi>Honoured.</hi> From a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of meaner quality, <hi>To the right worſhipfull, Sir N.

From an inferiour perſon, <hi>To the right worſhipfull and moſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Sir N.

From an inferiour perſon to an Eſquire or Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of worth, <hi>To the worſhipfull:</hi> The reſt he may take out of the precedent Epithetes. From a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman to ſuch an one, <hi>To his loving friend,</hi> &amp;c. To a parent, <hi>To my moſt endeared</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Father,</hi> Or <hi>Mother:</hi> To a child, <hi>To my loving ſonne</hi> or <hi>daughter; To my deare,</hi> or <hi>tenderly reſpected,</hi> or <hi>beloved,</hi> may do well enough from a mothers affection. From one inferiour perſon to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, <hi>To my loving, To my very loving, To my approved friend,</hi> and the like of this ſort beſt befits. To an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary, <hi>For Sir</hi> ſuch an one at ſuch a place, <hi>For M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>,</hi> or <hi>Goodman</hi> ſo or ſo: <hi>For Tho.

Onely ſetting his name with his common attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, the place whither it is directed, with <hi>For,</hi> inſtead of <hi>To his,</hi> or <hi>my</hi> &amp;c. And now I think it will be time to conclude, for the Carrier is in haſt.</p>
            <p>This therefore ſhall ſuffice to ſatisfie our preſent purpoſe concerning this ſubject. Onely take this by way of peroration.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Let your Letter be kept faire, without blots, or

            <p n="2">2 Be cautious, by way of Orthography, to write true Engliſh.</p>
            <p n="3">3 And laſtly, (what I have often inſtanced) let your Letters be ſuccinct and pithie; A quality incommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable eſtimation and practice among our moderne Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretaries; and no leſſe purſued among the ancient La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines.

The reſt I leave to obſervation, eaſily enough to be acquired, ſince many of our Secretaries have a ſingular faculty in that kinde.
