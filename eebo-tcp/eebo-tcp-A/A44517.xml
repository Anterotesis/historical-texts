            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To my Beloved Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shioners,
the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of St. Mary le
Strand, and the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinct
of the SAVOY.</head>
            <p>THough I intend you a larger
Treatise upon the <hi>Sacrament
of the Lords Supper,</hi> by the
Name and Title of <hi>THE CRUCIFIED
JESUS;</hi> Yet I was willing to let
these Directions come forth, to prepare
your Hearts for those larger Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
not but that there are Books enough
already Writ upon this Subject, and by
abler Pens too; but you having for


<pb facs="tcp:107051:3"/>
some years past known my Conversation,
my Temper, my Exhortations, and my
manner of Speaking, and Writing; I
thought something of this nature might
be more useful to you, then other more
elaborate Lucubrations. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
I am more afraid of, then that the
generality of you, both young and old,
either have not, or will not have right
apprehensions of that Christian Religion,
you profess, some being apt to place it in
a careless, customary Belief of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine;
some in leaving a few notorious
Sins; Others in saying their Prayers;
Others in doing no body wrong; Others
again in having good desires, and pious
inlinations; all which Opinions are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
mistakes of the nature and temper
of Christianity, which imports a change
of Nature, Disposition, and Acting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Humours, Passions, Manners,
Customs, and Deportment of the World;
and this is it I must see, and perceive in
you, before I can conclude, that my pains,
and labours among you, have not been in
vain.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:107051:3"/>
               <hi>Brethren,</hi> My Hearts Desire and
Prayer to God for you, is, That you
may be Saved. I will assure you, this is
no Compliment, no form of Speech, no
Words in course, but the ardent wish of
my Soul; and my fervent Prayers day
and night; This is the desire of my soul
in private, and in publick; for this I fill
my Mouth with Arguments to that God,
who heareth Prayers, even then when you
do not think of me; For this I study,
and take pains, and am willing to spend
my self, and to be spent; and your Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
is the great object of my care; for
this end I venture your Anger, and caress
yonr Love; For this end I walk blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
among you, and am tender of your
welfare; For this end I reprove, and
exhort, and intreat you, and run, and
spend my breath, and all, that you may
be saved.</p>
            <p>I am not ignorant of the Divels de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices,
I am sensible of the nature of sin,
how apt it is to deceive you, and though


<pb facs="tcp:107051:4"/>
I am not with you in all places, I see by
the effects, how the enemy of your Souls
deals with you, and what will be the is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
of a careless Life. I consider the
shrieks of the damn'd in Hell, and would
fain keep you from that dangerous gulph.
I see you stand upon the brink of destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and cannot forbear calling to you,
<hi>O do your selves no harm.</hi> The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
kindness you can do me, the greatest
gratitude you can express, the greatest
civility and respect you can shew me, is
to do according to the wholsome Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels,
I do give you, whatever constructions
some of you may put upon these adjurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
The searcher of all hearts knows
this to be true, that I would rejoyce in
nothing so much, as in your obedience to
the Gospel.</p>
            <p>I would fain rejoyce with you in the
great day of the Lord Jesus; I would
fain see you Glorious Saints in the Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Mansions; I would fain see you
shine as Stars in the Firmament of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
I would see you triumph with An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,


<pb facs="tcp:107051:4"/>
sing with <hi>Cherubim,</hi> and joyn the
Celestial Quire in Eternal Praises. Think
what a dismal sight it will be in that day
to see some of your friends in the burning
Lake, that might have feasted with the
Son of God, in his Fathers Kingdom;
We that meet together in the Church-Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant
here, What a happy, What a Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
fight would it be to meet all in the
Church-triumphant, when these Bodies
do drop from us!</p>
            <p>It is no small grief to me, to see some
of you, who have lived for some years un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
my Ministry, given to the same sins,
and inordinate desires, as Drunkenness,
Swearing, Lying, Cheating, Dissembling,
Malice, Wrath, Hatred, Passion, Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesness,
and neglect of the Lords Supper,
Quarrelling, foolish Jesting, filthy Talk,
Frothiness, Pride, Vncleanness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
they were formerly enamoured with;
certainly this must be an argument
against you in that day, when God shall
judge the secrets of Men, by the Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Gospel. O let's not be forced to


<pb facs="tcp:107051:5"/>
complain of you, that we would have
healed you, and you would not be healed
To this end I beseech you,</p>
            <p>1. To make the Rules in the following
Treatise familiar to you. There is nothing
in it, but what you'l find exactly agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to that Word, on which you build
your Faith. By making them familiar
to you, I do not only mean getting them
by Heart, but applying your selves to the
serious practice of them, till you get a
habit of those Virtues. A single act now
and then when you are in a Religious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
will do no good; but you must la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
at them so long, till they come to
be incorporated with your Spirits, and
mingle with your Complexion, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution.</p>
            <p>To oblige your Children, and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
to learn these Rules without Book,
and to admonish them to try, and see,
whether they observe them in their Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
and Conversation; to ask them
often, Whether their Actions are agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble


<pb facs="tcp:107051:5"/>
to these Rules, and whether they are
not afraid of losing Gods favour, by neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting
so great a Salvation.</p>
            <p>But then you must shew them a good
example; for all your Exhortations, will
be but Wind, while you do not express
the possibility of living up to these Rules,
in your own Lives. Your example will
make these Christian Virtues amiable,
and your practice must shew, that you
believe them necessary. And oh! how
comfortable will it be upon your Death-beds,
and what joy will this testimony
of your Conscience Cause, that in Godly
Simplicity and Sincerity, not according
to fleshly Wisdom, but according to the
Grace of God, you have had your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
in the World; God will love
you, even he, whose loving kindness is
better then life it self. His Love will
close your Eyes, His Love will whis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
the glad tidings of Happiness in
your Ears. His Love will be your guide
through the shadow and valley of Death,
and this Love will see you safe within

            <sp>
               <speaker>Christ.</speaker>
               <p>I must frequently look into
my Thoughts, Words, and Actions,
and see whether they are agreeable
to the Rules of the Gospel; every
night, I must take an account of my
self, and consider what I have been
doing in the day time, whether I
have not told a Lye, deceiv'd no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
broke forth into no passion; done
good, resisted temptations, been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
with God in Prayer, taken notice
of Gods providences, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that where
I have done amiss, I may watch against
it the next day, and where I have
done well, I may admire the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of God, and praise him for it,

            <sp>
               <speaker>Christ.</speaker>
               <p>I must Believe</p>
               <p>1. That God is a Spirit Omnipre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
Omniscient, infinitely Good, and
Wise, and Holy, and Just, and will


<pb n="17" facs="tcp:107051:14"/>
be a rewarder to them that diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
seek him; and punish the Disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient,
either here, or hereafter, or
both here and hereafter, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6.
2 <hi>Thess. 1. 6, 7. Ps. 58. 11. Ps.</hi> 50. 21.</p>
               <p>2. That this God is our Supream
Governour, and hath revealed himself
to be Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, or
our Creator, Redeemer, and Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier;
and that there is some resemblance
of these Three in One in the Sun, in
which is the Light and Heat, and Beam,
which Three make but one Sun, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi>
5. 7. <hi>Matth. 28. 19. 2 Cor.</hi> 13. 14.</p>
               <p>3. That all Mankind fell in <hi>Adam,</hi>
the first Man, and by that fall, moved
God to withdraw his Love and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
from them; and that God the Son
in commiseration to our Nature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
Man of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> suffered
and died, and by his death, rendred
God the Father, or rather the whole
Trinity, kind and propitious to us,
and willing to receive us into Favour,
and to give us Pardon and everlasting
Life, upon the conditions of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and unfeigned Obedience, and
therefore justly called Christ Jesus, <hi>i. e.</hi>


                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:107051:15"/>
the Anointed Saviour, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 8, 9,
10. <hi>Gal. 4. 4, 5. Matth.</hi> 1. 21.</p>
               <p>4. That the Scripture where all
this is revealed, is the word of God,
because the Men who revealed this in
Scripture, were inspired by the Holy
Ghost, and in confirmation of it,
wrought true miracles, miracles le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd
against the power of Sin, and
impossible to be done by humane
strength; the truth of which mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
hath been conveyed down to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity,
by multitudes of eye-witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and from them received by all
Christian People, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3, 4.</p>
               <p>5. That the promises and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
of the Gospel, will infallibly be
fulfilled sooner or later, because God
cannot lie, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 2.</p>
               <p>6. That our Soul is not our Breath,
nor our Blood, nor the Spirits of our
Blood, but a Spiritual Substance, able
to live, and act without this gross Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
we carry about us, and will imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
upon leaving this Body, be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to appear before God, and to
him give an account of its good and
evil Works, and according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency


<pb n="19" facs="tcp:107051:15"/>
or predominancy of either,
be made sensible of the Sentence of
Absolution, or Condemnation, which
shall be pronounced at the day
of Judgment, <hi>Luc.</hi> 16. 22, 23.</p>
               <p>7. That at the end of this world,
there will be a solemn day of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
wherein the Bodies of all Men
shall rise, and be re-united to their
Souls, and their Thoughts, Words
and Actions, be brought to light, and
judged, and sentence solemnly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced;
and the Good command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to take possession of Eternal Joys,
and the Bad to go into everlasting
Torments, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 10. Matth.</hi> 25.
31, 46.</p>
               <p>8. That God requires no more of
us, then we do of our Children, and
Servants, and that's <hi>Love,</hi> and that
this Love, if it be true, and hearty,
must necessarily discover it self in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
and sorrow for offending
him, and a sincere endeavour to please
and obey him for the future, <hi>Luc.</hi> 6.
46. <hi>Malach.</hi> 1. 6.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:107051:16"/>
9. That though by nature we are
generally more prone to evil, then to
good, and have a stronger byass to
Sin then Righteousness: yet God the
Holy Ghost, by his power and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
will certainly assist, and help us
to abhor that which is evil, and to
cleave to that which is good; if so
be, that by earnest Prayer, Fasting,
and Meditation, we long, and breathe
for his help, and influences, <hi>Luc.</hi> 11.
13.</p>
               <p>10. That all the service, I offer to
God, must be performed with my
Mind, Will, and Affections, or with
my inward Man, and with my Heart,
and that without my Mind, have the
greatest share in the service; it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>significant,
and rejected by God, <hi>Prov.</hi>
23. 26. <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 37.</p>
               <p>11. That by Believing in Scripture
for the most part, is meant nothing
but obeying, and that he who obeys
not the precepts of the Gospel, doth
not believe that they are either Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,
or necessary to be obey'd, or
that the Gospel is infallibly true, <hi>Acts</hi>


                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:107051:16"/>
6. 7. <hi>Heb. 11. 24, 25, 26. 2 Thess.</hi> 1.
11.</p>
               <p>12. That that frame of Spirit which
fits a Man for Eternal Happiness, is
neither a customary frequenting of
the Ordinances of God, nor shunning
the grosser sins and vices of the age we
live in; nor being Master of a single
Virtue, but a Spiritual temper of
Mind, which puts us upon doing
all that's necessary to be done in
order to Salvation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 5, 6.
9, 10.</p>

               <p>What are the Rules to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served

            <sp>
               <speaker>Christ.</speaker>
               <p>I must frequently, as often
as my strength will bear it, give my
self to Fasting, and Prayer, and on
those Fasts, wrestle with God for
growth in Grace, and strength against
those sins, I am most prone and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
to, and greater courage against
temptations.</p>
               <p>I must give Alms on that day, for
the refreshing of some poor Member
of Christ, and spend the day in Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications,


<pb n="22" facs="tcp:107051:17"/>
and Contemplations of my
sins, and of the wrath of God, I have
deserved, and of Gods mercy to peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
sinners in Christ Jesus, and in
Holy resolutions, to be watchful over
my Heart for the future, that I may
perform those Duties I have formerly
neglected, and imitate Holy Men and
Women in their virtuous practises,
<hi>Es. 58. 6, 7. Matth. 6. 17, 18. 1 Cor.</hi>
7. 5. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 27.</p>

               <p>Wherein doth the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious
use of the Holy Sacraments
consist?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Christ.</speaker>
               <p>In entertaining right and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
notions of the nature of these
Sacraments, and using them to those
ends, and purposes, for which they
are designed, <hi>Matth. 6. 22. 1 Cor.</hi> 10.
31.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Consc.</speaker>
               <p>What Notions must thou
entertain about these Sacraments?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Christ.</speaker>
               <p>1. That these Sacraments
are in the nature of solemn Vows,
and Protestations; that I will be
faithful to God in Christ Jesus, by
the assistance of the Holy Ghost, or
in the nature of Covenants, where


<pb n="23" facs="tcp:107051:17"/>
God and Man do mutually engage
themselves one to another; or in the
nature of outward visible signs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
some Spiritual thing is represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>Rom. 4. 12. Exod. 13. 9. 1 Pet.</hi> 3.
20. 21.</p>
               <p>2. That these Sacraments are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained,
and instituted by the Son of
God, my Saviour; and that Baptism
and the Supper of the Lord, are all
the Sacraments, that are either given
by Christ to the Church, or need to
be receiv'd by the Church of Christ,
<hi>Matth. 28. 19. 1 Cor.</hi> 11. 23.</p>
               <p>3. That Baptism is a significant
Ceremony, whereby Children, Men,
and Women are washed with Water,
which washing imports Gods pardon
of our sins, and our Duty to keep
our selves pure from Sin for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
God promising the one, and
we the other, 1 <hi>Pet. 3. 21. 1 Cor.</hi> 6. 11.</p>
               <p>4. That though Children can make
no such promises, yet it's fit they
should be Baptiz'd, because they are
part of the Nations which Christ
would have Baptiz'd, and are Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples,
and in the Covenant of Grace;


<pb n="24" facs="tcp:107051:18"/>
and it's enough, that other persons
promise for them, as their Guardians,
which promise they are bound to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
when they come to be of age,
<hi>Acts</hi> 2. 38, 39.</p>
               <p>5. That coming to the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
is the strongest engagement to a
Holy Life, because I do there perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
freely, and solemnly remember
the death of Christ, and that my sins
caused his death, and do protest to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
my self no longer in them, but to
imitate <hi>Christ Jesus</hi> in his Meekness,
Patience, Humility, Charity, and
Goodness, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 24, 25.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Consc.</speaker>
               <p>How must these Sacraments
be used, in order to thy present and
everlasting Comfort?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Christ.</speaker>
               <p>1. As to Baptism, I must be
baptized but once, because that ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiates,
and admits me into the fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of Christians, and gives me a Right
and Title to the use of the means of
Grace; and this need to be done but
once: All that is to be done after this,
is to keep a good Conscience towards
God, and towards Man, in the use of
those means, according to the promise


<pb n="25" facs="tcp:107051:18"/>
made for me when I was washed with
water, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 5.</p>
               <p>2. As to the <hi>Supper of the Lord,</hi> that
requires my frequent coming, because
I stand in need of frequent renewing,
not only of my Repentance, and
love to God, and Charity to my
Neighbours, but of the motives and
enforcives to these Graces; whereof
the remembrance of the love of God,
in the death of Christ is the greatest,
and most remarkable, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 26.</p>

O that I had wings like a Dove,
that I might fly away to <hi>Golgotha,</hi>
and behold the dreadful spectacle of
God crucified, for the sins of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of men! A mighty mystery this!
To the <hi>Jews</hi> a stumbling block, and to
the <hi>Greeks</hi> foolishness: What all the
Jewish <hi>Rabbins</hi> could not see,
what the greatest Heathen Sages could
not find out, that hath God reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
O God! thy Ways are not as our
Ways, nor are thy Thoughts as our
Thoughts. We entertain mean appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions
of Thee, such as our narrow
understandings yield; but thou lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest
to do all things contrary to the
measures, we poor mortals take. This
hath been thy method, ever since
thou hast thought fit to plant a Church
in the world! Thou didst send <hi>Lot</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Sodom,</hi> and contrary to Mens ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
didst preserve him from the
infection of that beastly crew. In the

thy Name to the besotted <hi>Israelites</hi>


                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:107051:20"/>
a place, where to own the true God,
was fatal, and to make mention of
thy worship, Heresie; where to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
thy Faith was counted madness,
and not to imitate the Luxury of the
age, a crime unpardonable; among the
wicked Men of <hi>Anat hoth:</hi> thou didst
separate <hi>Jeremiah</hi> for the Prophetick
Office, and in the land of <hi>Vz,</hi> croud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Pagans and Infidels, gavest <hi>Job</hi>
a heart to fear thy Providence. Out
of <hi>Vz,</hi> the Metropolis of <hi>Chaldean</hi>
Superstition, thou didst call the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
<hi>Abraham,</hi> and vouchsafedst to
him the knowledge of thy Will, in a
crooked and perverse Generation;
Thou didst fill the bashful <hi>Moses</hi> with
courage to talk to Kings; and a timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<hi>Aaron</hi> by thy Order, can controul
Atheists, and Idolaters. Thou lovest
to create a World out of nothing, and
to call things that are, out of those
which do not appear; Thou lovest
to do things, which to us seem im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibilities;
and when the Fig-tree
doth not blossom, lovest to produce
most pleasant Fruit; When calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties


<pb n="29" facs="tcp:107051:20"/>
are become dangerous, and past
remedy, thou lovest to shew thy heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hand; and when no probabilities
of help appear, declarest thy Power
and Glory. Thou lovest to bring forth
Grapes from Thorns, and Figs from
Thistles; and out of a barren soil, or
cursed ground, many times lettest the
richest Spices grow; When all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
lay in darkness, and was covered
with the shadow of death; When Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels
plaid about them, and the furies
of the burning Lake laid hold of them;
When the fiery Dragon was ready to

going to swallow up their Souls; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
thy Son appears from Heaven,
frights the powers of darkness, and all

               <p>Ah! My dearest Jesu! Meekest of
Kings, and fairer then all the children
of men! I behold thee Reigning, and
hanging on the Cross! Reigning? for
in despight of all the reproaches of
of thine enemies, thou wast still the

bowed to thee, When thy Body

was torn, bruised, and wounded on
the Tree; Their reproaches could not
dethrone thee, their virulent Tongues
could not make thee less then thou
wert. These impotent wretches might
bark at the Sun, but could not ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipse
its Glory. Thou couldst have
destroyed their Tongues, but wouldst
not, and it was a Royal act, not to
punish them, when thou hadst the
greatest provocations. O my Lord!
I see thee blotting out the Hand-wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
which was against me! How red
were the Characters! How bloody
were the Lines! yet thy Blood makes
them as white as snow.</p>
               <p>O my Lord, I hear thy words sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
then any two edged Sword, and
piercing, to the dividing asunder of
the Bones, and Marrow; I hear thy

not my heart be moved at them?
For Thee, the Son of God, to

even unto death!</hi> Who can hear this?
Who can think of it, and not stand

confounded! For Omnipotence to
sink thus! For infinite Perfection to
faint thus! For him that sate on the
circle of the Earth, and before whom
all Nations were as Grashoppers;
for him thus to Swound, thus to
Weep, thus to Mourn! What could
be the reason? Oh thou Prince of
Peace! For the iniquity of thy Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
thou vast struck, for the sins of
the World thou didst suffer banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and wast used, as if thou hadst
not been anointed with Oyl, or been
guilty of the crimes thy foes accused
thee of. The snares of death did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compass
thee, thy friends forsook thee!
and thy heritage, like a Lion out of
the Wood did roar against thee! O
my Bowels, be ye troubled at this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance!
O my flinty Heart, canst
thou see thy Lord, as it were crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
before thine eyes, and not break

Thou cryest to thy Father, and he

The windows of Heaven seem

to be shut, and a vail to be drawn
over all the Joys, and Comforts, and
Consolations, that formerly water'd
and enrich'd thy Soul! See how dry,

it; the Stars of Heaven with-hold
their influence, and scarce an Angel
will stir to thy assistance. O Thou
who art all Glorious within, and art
thy self the Glory of the Universe!
Were my Sins laid in a ballance, they
would weigh heavier then the Sand
on the Sea-shore, and then, what
need I wonder, that thou cryest so
loud under the heavy load? for the
arrows of the Lord stick in thee, and
his hand presses thee sore.</p>
               <p>O Blessed Nazarite! whiter then
Snow, brighter then the Sky, purer
then the Sun; How is thy Face dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:107051:22"/>
Is this the Face which so many
Prophets and Righteous Men have
desired to see? Is this the Face that
<hi>Abraham</hi> long'd to behold, and the

Angels, and dreaded by Divels? What
is thy Beloved more then another Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,
O thou fairest among Women!
Is this the mighty Bridegroom of the
Church, who was once transfigured
on the Holy Mount, and his Face did
shine as the Sun, and his raiment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
white as the light? Is this he,
whom God anointed with the oil of
gladness above his fellows! whose
garments smell of Myrrhe, Aloes, and
Cassia; and cast such a scent, that the
Daughter of <hi>Tyre</hi> came with a Gift,
and the rich among the People en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
his favour! How is he alter'd?
How is his Countenance chang'd!
How is the Gold become dim, and
the fine Gold changed! Yet still thou
art lovely to a Soul that sees farther
then the outside. Still thou art a
Cordial to fainting Spirits. Still thou

the Light of Heaven, and the Song of

Goodness! Even then when thou
art lifted up to the infamous Tree;
Thou drawest and invitest all Men to
thee. Thou Preachest on the Cross,
and thy very wounds are Sermons to
the Children of Men, and thy Blood
trickling down, is an exhortation to
Repentance. Surely it is good for me
to adhere unto thee, and to count it
death to be separated from thee!</p>
               <p>O whether shall I go but to thee,
who hast words of Eternal Life! Thou
art my Sun, by Thee I shall be enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten'd,
by Thee my Soul shall be
warm'd; O how comfortable are thy
beams! What a progress must that Soul
make, on which thou shinest, and
dartest thy Glorious Rays! Thou


<pb n="35" facs="tcp:107051:23"/>
art that lofty Cedar, whose boughs
over-spread the Believing World!</p>
               <p>Under the shadow of that Tree
will I rest; It is for the healing of the
Nations. I will be glad in the Lord,
and rejoyce in my bleeding Jesus!
While the World despises thee, I will
honour thee; While Great Men pass
by and regard thee not, I that am
poor and needy, will wait to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshed
by thee!</p>
               <p>Go ye fools! be enamoured with your
Trifles, admire your Butterflies, doat
on your sensual Pleasures: Here is one
that looks charming in his Tears, love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in his Blood, amiable in his Wounds,
and is more beautiful in the midst of
all his distresses, then the brightest
Virgins Face, adorned with all the
glittering Treasures of the <hi>East!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O my Strength! by Thee I desire
to be comforted, and supported. O
anoint my Eyes with thy Sovereign
Eye-salve, and I shall see, and live.
O that the Clouds which dwell on my
Understanding were dispersed, that I
might look upon thee sredfastly! Oh!


<pb n="36" facs="tcp:107051:24"/>
then thou wouldst appear more love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to me on the Cross, then <hi>Croesus</hi> in
his Throne, or <hi>Solomon</hi> in all his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
God forbid that I should glory
in any thing, save in the Cross of
Christ. In this lie hid vast treasures
of Sweetness! O my Jesus! make me
conformable to thy death, and give
me leave to carry thy marks in my
Body; Let me be crucified with thee,
and let Christ for ever live in me.</p>
               <p>Canst thou live in a Soul, that hath
abused thy Mercy, slighted thy Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
and so often baffled the stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems
of thy Compassion! I believe
Lord! O help mine unbelief<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thou ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mest
to call not the Righteous, but
Sinners to repentance. Oh! then my
Husband will love me, my Redeemer
will come and live with me, for my
repentings are kindled, I hate the sins
that have defiled my Soul! Away ye
Swine! Here are no Divels to enter
in. I am to receive my Bridegroom
into my Heart. Come Lord Jesu!
Come quickly! Thou art the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comest
Guest I know! How happy


<pb n="37" facs="tcp:107051:24"/>
shall I be, if thou wilt lodge in this
earthly Tabernacle! Happier, then if
all the Angels of Heaven took up
their Habitation here!</p>
               <p>O ye besotted <hi>Jews,</hi> what makes
you run so fast to kill the Lord of
Life? ye cannot live without him,
and what evil spirit doth possess
you to kill and murther him?
Can you think of his miracles, and
do so? Can you reflect upon his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
and attempt such villanies? Can
you remember how he taught you in
the Temple, even to astonishment,
and venture on such proceedings?
Can you call to mind how he hath
purged your Countrey of Divels, and
your Sick of their Diseases, and suffer
the Divel to enter into you!</p>
               <p>O dreadful spectacle! O that my
Head were Water! Who will rise with
me against the wicked! O thou that
art purer then the Lillies, purge me
with Hysop, and I shall be clean;
wash me, and my filthiness shall not
be seen! O bathe me in the Fountain
open'd for the House of <hi>Judah,</hi> and


<pb n="38" facs="tcp:107051:25"/>
                  <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> and I shall look fairer then
the Children, which fed on the Meat
of the King of <hi>Babylon</hi>'s Table.
O my God I thirst for thee, as
dry Land after Water. My Soul flies
and flutters about, like <hi>Noah</hi>'s Dove,
and can find no rest, till it gets into
thy Ark. <hi>Great Gate of Mercy</hi> open
to me, hide me from the wrath of an
offended God, and make a covenant
of Peace with me. Ah! Who would
not love thee, that hears thee pray
for thy greatest enemies. O lovely
Bridegroom of my Soul! wound
my Heart, that it may be sick of
Love. How kind art thou, even to
thy most hard-hearted foes! What
a motive is this to love thee! What
needest thou care what becomes of
stubborn sinners! Why shouldst thou
trouble thy self about wretches, that
will have none of Thee, that will
have their Dirt and Dung, and Trash,
and Husks, and prefer these trifles
before Heaven, and a Sea of Glory?
Thou canst live without the society
of Men, at least, thou needest no


<pb n="39" facs="tcp:107051:25"/>
such company, yet thou longest for
their Pardon and Happiness, as if they
had been thy greatest friends! Was
ever Goodness like this? O that my
Thoughts and Contemplations might
be always busie about this Love!
This is no vulgar Love! the love of
<hi>David</hi> to <hi>Jonathan,</hi> &amp; the love of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>
to <hi>Rachel,</hi> the love of Brethren,
Sisters, Friends, will bear no resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
here! <hi>Moses</hi> his love to the
<hi>Israelites,</hi> for whose sake, and so they
might but continue in Gods favour,
he was content to be blotted out of
Gods Book, and <hi>St. Pauls</hi> wish to be
even accursed of Christ, for his Kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of the Jewish Nation, these de
monstrations of Love come somewhat
nearer; but still thy Love, my dearest
Lord, surpasses all these, as the light
of the Sun doth that of the Moon,
and the lesser Stars. They borrow'd
their love from thine, and lighted
their Candle by thy brighter Fire;
that which was excess of Love in them,
was but a spark of that Charity, which
overspread thy larger Soul.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:107051:26"/>
They did but wish to die for the
People, thou didst actually exspire for
their good; their Love was confined
to a single Nation, thine extended to
the whole World! These Men were
still their friends, that they wish'd
to be miserable for; but those, thou
sufferest for, were thine enemies!
Their Love had great defects mingled
with it, but thine was pure and spot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less;
Theirs had Clouds and Mists to
darken it, Thine was all Light and
Glory; Theirs was a suddain trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
which might not last many days,
but Thine was constant to a miracle,
and those whom thou lovedst, thou
lovedst unto the end!</p>
               <p>Great Emperour of Souls! thou
hangest betwixt Thieves, and not
without reason, for thou stealest the
Heart away! What Heart can see thy
Beauty, and forbear being enamoured
with it! Thou dost ravish my Soul
with thine Eyes of pity. To see thee
cast a favourable look on such a
monster as I am, Who can forbear fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in love with so much clemency?


<pb n="41" facs="tcp:107051:26"/>
I am a Captive in this World. The
Law of my Members makes me cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
to the Law of Sin: O take me
by force from that prison. O set me
as a Seal upon thy Heart, Rule thou
in my Members. Erect a Trophy over
my Head! and rejoyce in conquering
me. O let me be content to undergo
the Cross, and reproach with thee,
that thou mayst remember me, now
thou art in thy Kingdom. O remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
me with the favour, thou bearest
unto thy People!</p>
               <p>O my Jesus! Who can hear thee
cry, I Thirst, and not wish for Rivers
of Tears! What canst thou Thirst for,
but the Salvation of Mankind! Thou
camest for that purpose from Heaven!
Leftst those brighter Mansions, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite
poor sinners to the mighty Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet
there! For this thou didst travel
up and down, and enduredst Cold and
Hunger, and Weariness; for this thou
wroughtest miracles; for this thou
didst Intreat, Rebuke, preach the Word
in season, and out of season; for this
thou couldst be content to want a


<pb n="42" facs="tcp:107051:27"/>
place, where to lay thy Head; for
this thou taughtest daily in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
sometimes on the Mount, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in a Ship, sometimes in a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sart,
for this thy Soul did long; for
this thou sufferedst, for this thou wast
buffeted, beaten, bruised, and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
even because, thou wouldst not
give over calling poor deluded sinners,
to a sense of their Duty! for this
thou Thirstest here! The rude mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
fancies it is either Water, or
some cordial thou wishest for! They
measure thy condition by their own
sensual appetite! but they were purer
desires that glow'd in thy Breast! It is
Water indeed, thou thirstest for, but
such Water, as <hi>David</hi> made his Bed
to swim in. The Tears of a penitent
Soul are the Wine thou longest for;
They are the Drink the Son of God,
thirsts after. Weep, weep mine Eyes,
that the Lord Jesus may Drink and be
satisfied! O Lord, I have given thee
Gall to Drink, I have offered thee the
cup of Trembling, and Astonishment.
Ah bitter, Ah wretched Drink! worse

O it is the Sweat of a grieved Soul;

Grapes, no more Grapes of the Vine

               <p>The Drink-offerings I bring to thee,
are insatiable desires after thee, the
most fervent breathings of my Heart,
after thy Grace and Mercy. O receive
them Graciously, and love me freely.
I bring on Rivers of Oyl, no Rams,
no Bullocks with Horns and Hoofs.
Thou desirest not Sacrifice, else would
I give it thee; thou delightest not in


<pb n="44" facs="tcp:107051:28"/>
Burnt-offerings! Thou wilt take no
Bullock out of my House, nor He-Goats
out of my Folds; for every
Beast of the Forest is thine, and so
is the Cattle upon a thousand Hills.
Thou knowest all the Fowls of the
Mountains, and the wild Beasts of the
Field are thine: if thou wert Hungry
thou wouldst not tell me, for the
World is thine, and the fulness there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
Thou wilt not eat the flesh of
Bulls, nor drink the blood of Goats;
but the offerings thou expectest, are
Thanksgivings, and paying my hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Vows to thy Divine Majesty, and
calling upon thee in the day of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
O my God! my Soul fainteth
for thee! when shall I come to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
before thee! My Soul is cast
down within me! When wilt thou
comfort me! I long for thy Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on!
I hunger and thirst after Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness;
I see Beauty, and splendor,
and excellency in it, and would fain
be cloathed with that Ornament!
Thou deservest my strongest desires,
my most vigorous Breathings, my

most lively Pantings after thee! not
to long after thee, is to be a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger

Riches, and the plenty of thy House!
But what do I talk of desires of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
Heart? would to God, that all
Mankind might offer unto thee their
reasonable service; thou deservest it,
and deservest all the love of Angels
too. But thou desirest nothing so
much, as the Hearts of the Children of
Men The Angels are happy already,
only Mankind lies ingulfed in misery;
and so great is thy Charity, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
taken their Nature upon thee,
thou wouldst willingly make them
equal with Angels.</p>
               <p>Great Darling of the Holy Trinity!
What haste dost thou make to dye?</p>
               <p>How dost thou run to redeem the
Sons of Men! Nothing can hold thee,
nothing can restrain thee, not thine
own Greatness, not thy Majesty, not
thy being the Son of God, not
love to thine own preservation. Thou
didst love me better then thy self. How

No Divels can fright thee, no danger

and sees it, and stands amazed) these
held out longer on the Gibbet, but
thou bidst Death come away, and
seize thy Life! It's a pleasure to thee
to die. Oh surprizing Mercy! Other
Men seek to escape Death as long as
they can; they run away from the sight
of the Monster, if they do but see the
shadow of it, they tremble and to them,
Death is truly a King of Terrors. Thou

must put an end to thy sufferings, and
my misery. It's death to thee not to

Speeches sweeter then Honey, and
the Honey-comb. Death is going to
close them up, yet O vouchsafe me
a look that may refresh my Soul. And
now the Glory is departed from <hi>Israel.</hi>
The Saviour of the World gives up
the Ghost! O let me die with thee!
O draw me after thee, and I shall
live. I wonder not that the Graves
open at thy death, and the Rocks
rend, and the Sun hides his Face;
but I wonder the whole Earth did
not dissolve, and nature it self did
not run into its primitive chaos, and
confusion.</p>
               <p>O my crucified Master! How ill art
thou rewarded for thy kindness? Thou
wert Eyes to the blind, and Feet to
the lame; Thou wert a Father to the
Poor, and a Staff to the Aged. Thou
didst cause the Widows Heart to sing
for joy. Thou didst deliver the Poor,
that cryed the Fatherless, and him,
that had no helper. Unto thee Men
gave ear, and waited, and kept silence
at thy Counsel; after thy words they


<pb n="48" facs="tcp:107051:30"/>
spake not again, and thy Speech dropt
upon them: the naked deck'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with the Wooll of thy Sheep,
and thy Door was open to the weary
Traveller. But now they that are
younger then thou, have thee in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rision,
and they that were Children
of Fools, Children of base Men,
Men viler then the Earth, gape upon
thee. Thou art their Song, and art be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
their By-word; They abhorr
thee, and flee far from thee, and spare
not to spit in thy Face. They marr
thy Path, they set forward thy Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity.
Terrours are turned upon
thee, they pursue thy Soul as the
Wind, and thy welfare passes away
as a Cloud.</p>
               <p>O infinite Patience! Yet these Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
are offered Salvation by him,
whom they abused thus. Salvation?
What do I hear? O then there is
hopes for me, for I have been one of
thy enemies. I have mock'd thee by
by my Sins! I have derided thy suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
by my contempt of thy Laws;
I have scorned thee by preferring


<pb n="49" facs="tcp:107051:30"/>
mine own Will before thine; I have spit
upon thee by my filthy communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
I have abused thee by sheltring
my Sins under thy Cross; I have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured
thee by my Life, disgraced
thee by my carelesness, buffeted thee
by my impatience, affronted thee by
my pride, made light of thy Power
and Goodness by my mistrust of thy
Providence; undervalued thy Love,
by my affection to vanity, and yet
thou stretchest forth thine arm to lay
hold on me, art loath to see me pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,
unwilling to see me undone,
and proclaimest mercy to a forlorn
wretch! Blessed news! O King of
Kings thou cryest, <hi>It is fulfilled;</hi> The
work is done, the vast work of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption;
Now thy Fathers anger is
broke, now the Floodgates of indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
are shut; Now Heaven stands
open; Now thy Fathers bosom is held
out to all that thirst after thee.</p>
               <p>Hear this all ye prisoners! listen
to this message ye guilty Souls! Come
all that are laden with a sense of sin!
Open the door! Throw off your


<pb n="50" facs="tcp:107051:31"/>
Chains! Run to this Rock! Make
haste to this Fountain! Kiss this Sun!
Make much of this Light! Embrace
this Mercy. Do ye dispute the thing?
Do ye question whether ye shall do it
or no? Is it possible you can stand out?
Is it possible you can demur upon it?
Is it possible your Hearts do not turn
within you? Can you refuse your
Cordial? neglect the Medicine that
must recover you? slight the Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
that must fetch you to life again?
O Jesu! Thou hast done all things well;
Thou hast made the Blind to see, and
the Dumb to speak, and the Deaf to
hear. O open thou my Lips and my
Mouth shall shew forth thy Praise.
Open thou mine Ears, and let me hear
thy loving kindness betimes in the
Morning. O open thou mine Eyes,
and I shall see how Sweet and Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
thou art. O my Life! thou di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,
and dying, fulfillest thy Fathers
Will; for indeed it was fit that one
Man should die for the People, and
that the whole Nation perish not.
Ah! What would Mankind have done,


<pb n="51" facs="tcp:107051:31"/>
if thou hadst not paid the Ransom!
Whether must they have fled for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge,
if thou hadst not given thy self
a Sacrifice? They must have wandred
about in Caves, and Dens, destitute,
tormented, afflicted, disconsolate, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in perpetual fear of death, and
the dreadful consequences of it. Death
must have been for ever a King of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
to them, if they had but look'd
upon that Hell, that death would have
open'd into. How could they but have
lived in perpetual horror! There could
have been no hope of Mercy, no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability
of Bliss, their Souls would
have been in Eternal confusion, always
doubting, always afraid, always upon
the Rack. O my Jesus! Thou, through
death hast deliver'd them, who through
fear of Death, were all their life-time
subject unto bondage! Thou hast
knock'd off their shackles! loosed
their Bands! freed their Souls! set
their Spirits at libery! I feel the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of thy death. My Heart takes cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage!
O let me rise with thee to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
life, O let me not lie in the mire, but


<pb n="52" facs="tcp:107051:32"/>
set my Feet upon a Rock, and establish
my goings! I have gone astray like a
lost Sheep; O seek thy servant, that I
may not forget thy Commandements</p>
               <p>Thou art the Bread which came
down from Heaven, and with the
Bread in thy Sacred Supper thou of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferest
me all the benefits of thy death
and passion; such a Feast hast thou pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for me; such a Table hast thou
spread for me; my Soul is invited to
Sup with the Lamb that was slain!
What an honour is this! What a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descention
is it! In this Sacrament
thou erectest a Banner for me, bidst
me sit under thy Vine, and strengh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
my self with the Fruit that drops
from it. Were all the Fishes of the
Sea, and all the Fowls of the Air, and
all the Beasts of the Field, drest for
my entertainment, it would not be so
much, as this plain, but Heavenly Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et
is. Tell not me of <hi>Belshazzer</hi>'s Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet,
nor of <hi>Ahashuerus</hi>'s Feast, nor of
the rich mans curious Dishes; they are
all scraps and Offals to this Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment!
Here my Blessed Redeemer


<pb n="53" facs="tcp:107051:32"/>
courts my Soul; Here he makes love
to a miserable Sinner! Here he presents
me with the Riches of his Merits! No
<hi>African</hi> Gold, no <hi>Eastern</hi> Pearls, no
<hi>Indian</hi> Stones are to be compared with
these. Here the Lord of Glory offers
to marry me, to unite me to him, to
make an everlasting Covenant with
me, to be flesh of his flesh, and bones
of his bones, promises to endow me
with all his Goods, puts a Ring on
my Finger, and bids me lie in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som.
This is Honour, this is Glory,
this is Preferment, which no Royal
Courts can give, no <hi>Solomon</hi> can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,
no Emperour Grant, no Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch
Conferr, no King bestow. This
is the mighty Wedding-Feast, at
which the blessed Angels wait how
should not they be there, when their
Master is President, and Director of
the Banquet? This puts me in mind
of all the admirable things thou hast
done for me; in this Bread are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
all the Dainties and Delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
imaginable. O wonderful Love
that wast not content to be known


<pb n="54" facs="tcp:107051:33"/>
to me, but art willing to give thy
self for Food to me! What pains dost
thou take to melt my stubborn Heart!
Thou art willing to live in me, Thou
art willing to be one with me, that I
may not warp from thee. Thou art
willing to be my Meat and Drink, not
only my King to protect me, not only
my Father to tender me, not only my
Master to take care of me, not only
my Saviour to snatch me out of the
burning Lake, not only my Mediator
to secure me against Heavens ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance,
but my Diet too. Thou seest
my Soul wants Meat proper for her
nature: Alas! the World cannot be
that Meat! That's a Heterogeneous
thing! as well may Angels feed on
Hay, or Grass, as my Soul on things
that profit not. That which my Soul
must feed on, must be something Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual.
Thou O Jesu! art that Great
Spiritual Object, my Soul must fix on,
nothing else will content it; and when
my Thoughts contemplate thee, when
my Soul Meditates of thy Charity,
when my Affections love thee, when


<pb n="55" facs="tcp:107051:33"/>
my Desires long for thee, When my
Will submits to thy easie yoak; When
all my Faculties delight in thee, when
thou appearest lovely, and charming,
and amiable to my mind, Then, then
my Soul hath its proper food, then
it's like to live, then it's in a way
to thrive, then it prospers, then it
grows, then it gets a cheerful look, then
the Angels visit it; the World perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
soures it; Sensual pleasures ruine it,
carnal satisfactions make it meager.
Thou O Lord, thou alone canst make
it flourish like the Palm-tree, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy
it with the Rivers of thy Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures.</p>
               <p>O my Lord, how sweet is it to suck
Honey out of this Rock! Thy Bread
strengthens to a miracle, and thy Blood
makes Souls Drunk. It is as the Dew of
<hi>Hermon,</hi> and as the Dew that descends
on the Mountains of <hi>Zion;</hi> for there
the Lord commanded the Blessing,
even Life for evermore. O my God, I
care not for <hi>Abana,</hi> and <hi>Pharpar</hi> now,
nor for the Rivers of <hi>Damascus.</hi> I will
stand under thy Cross, and open my


<pb n="56" facs="tcp:107051:34"/>
Mouth. O do thou fill it; while others
go to rejoyce in their Corn, and Wine,
and Oyl, I will go to the Supper of
the Lamb. Here Lord, here is my
Heart, ready to receive that Heavenly
Food thou offerest me. Awake thou
Eternal Spirit, awake, blow upon
my Garden, that the Spices may flow
out! O let this <hi>Maenna</hi> satisfy my, taste,
that I may forget the Fleshpots of
<hi>Egypt.</hi> Behold Lord, here I make a
vow, that if thou wilt give me this
Bread to eat, which endures to everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
life, Thou shalt be my God, I
will serve no other Gods but thee.
Thou shalt command my Heart, my
Desires, and my Affections, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
thee no passion shall lift up its
Hand or Foot in all the land of <hi>Goshen,</hi>
I will set thee over all that I have, and
all shall be at thy dispose.</p>

               <speaker>Christ.</speaker>
               <p>I feel my Heart warmed with
this consideration. I will now turn aside
and see this great sight, who it is that
hangs upon the Cross, and bleeds for
my Sins. Oh! it is the Son of God, he
that was in the form of God, and


<pb n="57" facs="tcp:107051:34"/>
thought it no robbery to be equal
with God, but made himself of no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
and took upon him the form
of a Servant, and became obedient
to the death of the Cross, that I
might be made the Righteousness of
God through him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Consc.</speaker>
               <p>But is there nothing else to
be done by way of preparation for
this Blessed Sacrament?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Christ</speaker>
               <p>O Yes! For I must, First, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
sometimes, and celebrate, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
the love of God to me in Christ
Jesus, in some such reflections as these.</p>
               <p>Be <hi>astonish'd</hi> ye Heavens, stand
amazed ye Quires of Angels, at the
condescension of my God. I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd
him to the <hi>Philistines,</hi> yet he
loves the miserable Wretch, and so
loves him, that he gives his Son to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem
him.</p>
               <p>O God what dost thou see in me??
Nothing but misery, nothing but rags,
nothing but poverty, and yet thou
lovest me.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:107051:35"/>
I am but Dust and Ashes, and will
God vouchsafe a Gracious look, to so
mean an object? O Sovereign Being,
Didst thou ever behold a viler crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
then I am! and wilt thou goe out
of the common road of Love, and
spread thy Garments over me, and
offer me thy friendship?</p>
               <p>O Love! which <hi>Cherubim</hi> admire,
and <hi>Seraphim</hi> adore! It passes under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.
It goes beyond my Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance;
It confounds my Reason, I
admire the love of a Prince to a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
but that will bear no resemblance
to this Love!</p>
               <p>God might have triumph'd in my
Groans, Glorified his Justice by my
stripes; but pity abounds in him, it
hath no Banks, it flows at large, its
extended even to the most abject
Creature, as I am.</p>
               <p>O Love! How humble art thou!
How violent art thou! Thou break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
through all the Clouds of Heaven
to come down. Thou forgoest the
Rules of Greatness and Majesty, to
shew thy Glory, That the Eternal


<pb n="59" facs="tcp:107051:35"/>
Son of God should take Flesh upon him,
and dye to give life to the World! Oh
where can I parallel this Love!</p>
               <p>I will sing of Love, I will speak of
Love, I will think of Love, my very
Dreams shall be employ'd about it.
O that I could write Panegyricks of
it! Were not my Tongue confined,
it should do nothing else but talk of
Love.</p>
               <p>Here is Love, to which all natural
sympathies must vail. I see no end
thereof. The farther I go in the search,
the more I lose my self. But how
should a creature find out the end of
that which is infinite?</p>
               <p>Where shall I find out the spring of
this mighty stream? Where shall I
find the beginning of it? Alas! The
line of Reason is too short! There
is no fathoming of this depth. Who
can search into the recesses of Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?
In that vast Abysse, the head of
this great River lies; but who shall
dive into it? It's enough that I am so
happy as to be acquainted with it.
It's enough that the Almighty hath


<pb n="60" facs="tcp:107051:36"/>
revealed it unto Babes. Even so Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it seemed good in thy sight. I
can give no reason of it. Thy Love
Lord, was the cause of this Love;
thy Love was the motive. Nothing
else could be any inforcive. I am sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
thou art merciful, because thou
wilt be merciful.</p>
               <p>O thou Eternal Wisdom, whom
the Lord possessed in the beginning
of his way, before his Works of old,
who wast set up from everlasting,
from the beginning, or ever the Earth
was; when there were no depths thou
wast brought forth, when there were
no Fountains abounding with Water,
before the Mountains were setled; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Hills wast thou brought forth,
while as yet he had not made the
Earth, nor the Fields, nor the highest
part of the Dust of the World, who
wast there when he prepared the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
when he set a compass upon the
face of the depth, when he establish'd
the Clouds above, when he strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the deep, when he gave to the
Sea his Decree, that the Waters


<pb n="61" facs="tcp:107051:36"/>
should not pass his Commandement;
O thou! who wast by him, as one
brought up with him, who wast dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
his delight, rejoycing always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him, enlighten my Mind, that I
may have clearer apprehensions of this
Charity!</p>
               <p>Arise my Thoughts! Awake up my
Glory! See O my Soul how that
Love smiles upon thee! See how
bright, how clear, how charming it
is! See how Divels tremble at it! See
how they grin, and fret to think, they
must have no share in it; See what
Glorious Beams it darts on penitent
sinners! See how it warms their Hearts!
See how it follows them, how loath it
is to leave them! See how it adjures
them, and how importunate it is with
them to suffer themselves to be con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quer'd
by it.</p>
               <p>2. I must examine my self, not only
what, and where, and when, and
how I have (especially of late) been
acting against God, and affronted his
Goodness, Mercy, and Patience; and
what Sorrow, Grief, and Fear these


<pb n="62" facs="tcp:107051:37"/>
particular offences have caused in me;
but whether I am unfeignedly resolved
to part with all these particular sins,
I am most prone, and inclined to;
whether my Heart and purpose be
fix'd to know the Will of God, and
to do it; Whether I do sincerely, and
without reservation, intend for the
future to prefer God's Will before my
Will, and his Favour before the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of Men; and whether I do in
good earnest design to forgoe my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,
gain, or interest in the World,
rather then do any thing, that is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing
to God; Whether I do tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prize the love of God above all
the Riches of this World, and see
greater Beauty in that Holiness, to
which I am invited by this Love, then
in all the gaudes and satisfactions of
of the World. And if I do, and my
Conscience bears me witness of it, I may
chearfully go to the Lords Table, and
expect the benefits that are offered
there.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:107051:37"/>
3. If I have done any signal wrong
to my Neighbour, I must make him
either restitution or satisfaction; I must
either restore to him, what I have
cheated or wronged him in, or have
secretly, and against his Will taken
away from him; or if I am not able
to restore, make confession of the fault,
and beg his forgiveness. I must be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
to him, if I have offended
him, or given him just occasion to be
angry; and if after that attempt, he
will still keep his anger, I have deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
my own Soul.</p>
               <p>I must let my neighbour know, that
I do as truly forgive him, as I hope
to be forgiven of Christ Jesus, and be
as ready to give, as my neighbour to
ask my pardon.</p>
               <p>I must remember how God hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed
his Pardon upon mine, and if I
forgive not from my Heart, neither
will my Heavenly Father forgive my
Trespasses. If I have abused my
neighbour, either in Words or Deeds,
and he either hath receiv'd, or is like
to receive any prejudice by it, I must


<pb n="64" facs="tcp:107051:38"/>
not be ashamed to acknowledge my
error, but prefer a quiet Conscience
before my Reputation in the World.</p>
               <p>4. I must survey the bitter suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of my Blessed Saviour, as they
are laid down and described by the
Evangelists. I must follow him into the
Garden of <hi>Gethsemane,</hi> and go up
with him to the Mount of Olives, and
there behold how his Heart was trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
and how the fears of death fell
upon him; how his Soul was filled
with sorrow, and how his Life drew
near unto the Grave. How he trode
the Wine-press of Gods anger alone,
and humbled himself before his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
How, as <hi>Man,</hi> he begg'd, that
the Cup might pass from him, and yet
as <hi>Mediator,</hi> freely consented to his
Fathers Will. How distress and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
came upon him, and in the midst
of those miseries, the weary Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
fell asleep; how he wept and
mourned, and sweat drops of Blood;
and how Hell open'd her Mouth upon
him; how he bore our Griefs, and
took the chastisement of our Peace up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on


<pb n="65" facs="tcp:107051:38"/>
him. How he drank the bitter
Cup, and his Heart within him became
as melting Wax. How he was led to
<hi>Annas,</hi> and he to whom all the Angels
in Heaven bow'd, stood before a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Man. How from <hi>Annas</hi> he was
dragg'd to <hi>Caiphas,</hi> and like a Lamb
led to the slaughter. How he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused
before <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> and there
bespattered with all the ill language
that Men or Divels could invent. How
he was set at nought by <hi>Herod,</hi> and in
scorn deck'd with a Purple Robe.
How from thence he returned to <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,</hi>
and thereupon was scourged,
and crowned with Thorns. How after
this he bore his Cross, and was actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
crucified. How he was made to
drink Gall and Vinegar, and at last,
bowed the Head and died.</p>
               <p>But then I must not only barely
survey these sufferings, but reflect at
the same time upon my sins that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
them, and accuse not only my
grosser sins, if I have been guilty of
any, but my lesser errours of using
the Son of God so barbarously; I must


<pb n="66" facs="tcp:107051:39"/>
not reflect upon his bloody Sweat,
without thinking of my proud
Thoughts, and Speeches, and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that pulled it on him, nor upon
his wounds, without beating my Breast
for my Envy and Malice, and reveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
desires that caused them; nor up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Crown of Thorns, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testing
my intemperance, and sinister
designs in doing good, and affectation
of vain Glory, that set it on his Head;
nor on the Nails that tore his Flesh,
without taking a view of my pettish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and peevishness, and impatience,
which struck them in; nor upon the
Spear that opened his side, without
entertaining some dismal Thoughts of
my neglect of Meditation, and Prayer,
and fervency of Spirit, and Holy Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses,
and bearing of Injuries, and
Heavenly Thoughts; nor upon his
Tears, without looking stern upon
my slight, and superficial performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
for all these help'd towards his
Death and Agonies.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:107051:39"/>
5. I must shew my willingness to
imitate Christ Jesus, by doing some
good Work, if health and strength do
give me leave. This must be the first
fruits of my future treading in his
steps, and will make my coming to
the Holy Sacrament more comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
I must in this, imitate the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
that poured out the ointment on
Christ's Head, before his sufferings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan;
and Christ himself, who wash'd
his Disciples Feet, before he refresh'd
their Souls with the Holy Sacrament.
I must either <hi>free some prisoner,</hi> to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stify
my resentment of the Mercy,
<hi>Christ</hi> shewed me, in freeing me from
the bondage of the Divel, or <hi>relieve
some poor Family,</hi> to express my sense
of Christ's relieving my Soul in the
greatest strait, or <hi>impart some good
Counsel to a wicked and careless neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,</hi>
to shew how kind Christ was in
visiting me with his Admonitions; or
<hi>visit some sick persons that are under great
distress;</hi> and comfort them, or help
them, or give them, or procure them
some Physick that may do them good;


<pb n="68" facs="tcp:107051:40"/>
if they be needy; to shew how sensible
I am of Christ's being my Physician,
or <hi>forgive some small Debt,</hi> a poor Man
owes me, to shew how I rejoyce at
Christ's forgiving me Ten thousand
Talents; Or <hi>visit a man that hates
me, and behave my self most courteously
to him,</hi> to see whether his Heart will
melt, and come to a better temper,
thereby to express my sense of Christ's
Love to me, that have been his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;
or <hi>give a good Book to one that hath
no Money to buy one;</hi> to shew my sense
of Christ's feeding me with the word
of Life; or <hi>deny my self in a lawful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation,</hi>
or lawful Ornament, or law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Meal, to shew, I am sensible how
Christ hath denied himself for mysake;
or <hi>pray earnestly for the conversion,
of a person I have no acquaintance with,</hi>
and whom I hear to be very vitious
to express my sense of Christ's care of
my Salvation.</p>
               <p>6. I must frequently pray, that God
would give me a Heart to breathe and
pant after him, and particularly, a
Heart to esteem and prize his Love


<pb n="69" facs="tcp:107051:40"/>
manifested in this Sacrament, above
all the pleasures of this World; that
he would give me a Faith active and
vigorous, and which may press through
all impediments, and purify my Heart
and Life, and forget what is behind
it; That he would give me a contrite
Spirit, and Grace to tremble at his
Word, and threatnings; that he would
give me courage to undervalue, and
despise the World, and the Glories and
Vanities of it; that he would give me
a burning Zeal to his Glory, a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendent
love to his Name, and Ways,
and Ordinances; that he would make
me sincere in Devotion, in Prayer,
and in all good Works, and banish
from me all sinister and worldly ends,
and designs in Holy performances;
that he would give me a firm resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to imitate the Saints of old, and
the best examples at this day, and to
stop my ears against all the suggesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Flesh and Blood to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary;
that he would give me a Mind
which may delight in contemplating
the Divine Goodness, and Perfection,


<pb n="70" facs="tcp:107051:41"/>
and would teach me the great Art of
Self-resignation, of trusting him with
my Soul and Body, and of relying in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
upon his providence.</p>
               <p>7. I must resolve, and unfeignedly
upon my bended knees, or in a very
solemn manner resolve to watch and
strive for the future against those par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
sins and errors, and sinful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
I am most inclined to; If I
have neglected such a Self-denial, to
neglect it no more; if I have been guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of such acts of pride, and envy,
and ill nature, to be guilty of them no
more; if I have been careless and slo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
in my Prayers, to be so no more;
if I have pleased my self with vain
Thoughts, to please my self with them
no more; if I have delighted in fine
Cloaths, to delight in them no more; if
I have been false to my Vows and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
to be false to them no more; if
I have made nothing of ill Names, and
ill Language, to dread it like poison
for the future; I must resolve to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
such a habit of sin with rigors,
with being unkind to my flesh, with


<pb n="71" facs="tcp:107051:41"/>
Fasting, and with mulcts of Money;
if I commit but a single act of the sin,
I must resolve to use the proper means
to subdue such a corruption; I must
resolve to avoid that company where
I am, and have been apt to yield to
a certain sin; I must resolve to spend
my time better, and if I have spent
too much of it in Dressing, in Pleasure,
in Carding, and Dice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to do so no
more, whatever disgrace, dis-respect,
or frowns I may meet with from the
World, or from mine Acquaintance;
and if I have been careless of medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
and being serious on the Lords
day, to make a better improvement of
that day. And I must so resolve, as to
think my self concerned to fulfil and
perform my solemn Resolution, unto
which I have call'd God as a witness.</p>
               <p>8. I must watch against all things
that would discompose, and disorder
my mind, put me into a rage or pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and make me peevish and discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented,
and consequently unfit for the
worthy receiving of this Sacrament:
I must labour to preserve a calmness,


<pb n="72" facs="tcp:107051:42"/>
and serenity of Mind; and that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
multitude of worldly business do
distract me, nor injuries past and gone,
discompose me, or put me into impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
Thoughts, and expressions, nor
present disappointments rob me of
my quiet? I must watch against impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments,
that would tempt me to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
my coming to this Table, and take
heed I do not yield to Temptations,
that would make me neglect the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,
put into my hand, of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Peace with God, and mine own
Conscience. I must reject suggestions
of this nature, and regard more, the
necessary concerns of my Soul, then
things, that at the best are but sensual
satisfactions.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:107051:42"/>
O who will give me to drink of the
Water of the Well of <hi>Bethlehem!</hi>
Wherewith shall I come before the
Lord! How shall I bow my self before
the most high! Shall I come before
him with Burnt-offerings, with Calves
of a year old?</p>
               <p>O my Lord! Thou hast shew'd me
what is good, and what dost thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
of me, but to do justly, to shew
mercy, and to walk humbly with my
God! O my God, I bring an humble
Heart, a Soul that desires to lye low
before thee; a Soul that longs to be
clean, and to be washed in the blood
of the Lamb; a Soul weary of Sin, that
sees no comfort, no satisfaction, no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
in things below, but behold's
afar off, the treasures of Consolation,
that lye hid in Christ Jesus!</p>
               <p>These are things to be desired.
These are Mercies worth having. These
enrich banckrupt Souls, with these
Pardon is purchased, and Heaven is
procured. O give me a Title to them,
Thou that art the true Morning Star!
O shine upon me! O enlighten me!


<pb n="74" facs="tcp:107051:43"/>
O enlighten me! O let me feel thy
comfortable beams! These burn not,
These scorch not, but sanctify, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,
and adorn.</p>
               <p>I have seen an end of all perfection,
but thy Merits are exceeding broad.
They enlarge Heaven, subue Death,
conquer Hell, expel Divels, and make
God my friend.</p>
               <p>How have I doted on the vanities
of this World! They are bubbles all;
but thou sweet Jesu art perfect Beauty,
a fountain of Joy, which never wants
Water, never dries up, never fails, and
never dies.</p>
               <p>How much better is it to be here
in the Courts of the Lord, then in the
Tents of the proudest Monarchs! one
day here is better then a thousand else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</p>
               <p>Here God bows to poor sinners.
Here infinite Majesty converses with
Dust and Ashes. Here the King of
Heaven is not ashamed to call such
poor Worms as we are, Brethren!</p>
               <p>How different are the ways of God
from the ways of Men! They shun a


<pb n="75" facs="tcp:107051:43"/>
                  <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and a Beggar; God receives
them, and the Soul that's sensible of
her poverty, and begs to be enrich'd,
is refresh'd by him, and invited into
his bosom.</p>
               <p>How Lovely art thou my Great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer!
How Amiable! How Kind!
How Beautiful! Therefore do the
Virgins love thee.</p>
               <p>Could there be greater Love, then
to spill thy Blood for me! Could there
be greater Charity then to dye for
me! What miracles of Mercy are
these!</p>
               <p>I come to beg an alms at thine
hands; it's too great a gift for
me to ask, but not too great for thee
to give, for it is thy self I beg.</p>
               <p>O warm my Heart! Touch it with a
coal from the Altar! O kindle Holy
Fire in my Breast! Burn up the dross
and Tin there, and let nothing but
pure Gold remain. Let Love prevail.
O change my Heart into fesrvent Love,
and turn all my faculties into Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity!</p>

2. I must joyn with the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

Perfumes into that common Genser,
that the Holy Smoak may go up with
joyned force to the throne of Mercy.</p>
               <p>I must not come behind my fellow-members

               <p>They pray for all distressed Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Christ, that the Consolations
of Christ may abound in them; so

               <p>They prostrate themselves in Holy
Confessions of their Sins, and pray
for Remission and Pardon, and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification;
so must I.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:107051:44"/>
They pray to be made partakers of
the benefits of Christ's Body and
Blood; so must I.</p>
               <p>3. I must shew my compassion to
the Poor, by contributing to their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities,
if I am able.</p>
               <p>I must remember how poor, how
wretched, how naked, how miserable
I was, when the Son of God first took
pity on me, being yet in the Loins of
my Father <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I must consider, that my self at this
instant am lying at the pool of <hi>Bethes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi>
waiting for the Angel of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
to come down, and stir the
Waters that I may be healed.</p>
               <p>I must look upon my self as a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
full of Sores and Sickness, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect,
that I come to be cured for Gods
sake, by the Great Physitian of
Souls.</p>
               <p>From my Self, I must look down on
the Poor, that want my help; and as
I would have my Great Master have
compassion on me, so I must have
compassion on my fellow-Servants.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:107051:45"/>
4. I must at this time resist all
worldly Thoughts, and did my Oxen,
and my Farms, and my Domestique
Affairs stand aloof like Lepers,
that must not come near a place so full
of Majesty, and a Work so big with
wonders.</p>
               <p>I must with <hi>Mary</hi> chuse the better
part, and look upon <hi>Martha</hi>'s serving
as unseasonable.</p>
               <p>I must lay aside contrivances how
to make a bargain with my neighbour,
and know no other Covenant, but
what I am making with God in the
blood of Jesus.</p>
               <p>I must not think of my Trade and
Trafick, but remember, it is for the
Pearl of Price, that I am Trading now,
and laying out my strength, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
               <p>I must not be disturbed with a des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
Debt that's owing me, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
the Debts I owe to God; and
how I do expect that at this time
they should be struck out, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell'd
for ever.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:107051:45"/>
I must not now torment my self
about a livelyhood, when I come to
get a Title to a Life of everlasting
Glory.</p>
               <p>I must not now think how to get
Bread, and make provision for my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
but rather reflect with joy,
what large provision the Almighty
makes for my Soul, and what care he
takes to make me a Son of God, an
Heir of Heaven, and Coheir with
Christ.</p>
               <p>When sensual Thoughts fly through
my Mind at this time, I must continue
to say to them, Arise, and Depart, for
here shall not be your rest.</p>
               <p>5. I must now make some Spiritual
reflexions on the breaking of the Bread,
and upon pouring out of the Holy
Wine.</p>

                        <p>BEhold O my Soul, thus was thy
Blessed Saviour's Body broken;
Thus was his unspotted Flesh torn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunder.
O my Sins, ye did this bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
act. The Jews were but the
External instruments, ye were the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
causes of that torture; had it not
been for you, the Crown of Thorns
had never wounded that Sacred Head.</p>
                        <p>Break my Heart, Break, it is a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
sight! A broken Heart is Sacrifice,
which he that was broke upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of thy sins, will not despise.</p>
                        <p>Nay, he will comfort the humble
Soul, and the contrite Spirit; he will
pour Wine and Oyl into its wounds,
supple it with Balm, heal it with his
Death, and make it whole by his
Agonies.</p>
                        <p>See here, O my Soul, the Bread
which is broke, is it not the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the Body of Christ; see how
many broken pieces are here, which
all make but one Loaf. So thou,


<pb n="81" facs="tcp:107051:46"/>
and thy fellow-Believers, make one
mystical Body, whereof the Crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Jesus is Head, and Governour,
who influences the Body by his Spirit,
and from his fulness dispences Grace
for Grace.</p>
                        <p>Rejoyce, O my Soul! For now the
waves and billows of Gods wrath are
laid, The storm of vengeance is husht,
The thunder is gone, The clouds
cleer up, thy broken Saviour hath
turn'd the sound of the Trumpet of
War into a still small Voice.</p>
                        <p>O break with him no more! O pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
that friendship which was so
dearly bought! A friendship purchased
by Blood, sure must never dye. Thou
art his Friend, O do not become his
Enemy again, for fear he be never

his wounded Body. Thus was the
costly Juyce let out. Thus the rich
Veins emptied themselves of their
Treasure, and all, that thou mightst

Arise, wash thy self in this Jordan, and

the Flesh of a little Child.</p>
                        <p>O my Soul! had not this Blood been
shed, there had been no remission of
Sins. From the shedding of this Blood,
date thy happiness; when God saw
this Blood, the tide turned, and thy

               <p>Whence is it that the King of Kings
and the Lord of Lords, in whose
eyes the very Angels are not pure,
should come to visit such a Wretch as
I? O my Lord,! to whom doest thou
stoop! What is that Creature that


<pb n="90" facs="tcp:107051:51"/>
thou bowest thus low to? A Den of
Thieves, a Habitation of Vipers, a
Vessel of Dishonour! O how often
have I polluted my self, even after

that God will dwell in such a pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
House! Is it possible that God will
come and Feast and Sup with such an
unprofitable Servant! O my Soul! It
is not only possible, but thy Lord hath
done it to day: Thine eyes have seen
the mighty Works of thy Redeemer.
Thou hast seen him converse to day
with a Wretch, that hath undone what
God hath done, hath rendred him evil
for good, and hatred for his good-will.
Thou hast seen thy Lord this day
vouchsafing to sit with one who is full
of Bruises and putrifying Sores, and
those not bound up, nor mollified with
Ointment.</p>
               <p>Alass! my Lord! I have abused the
mighty Creator to please a Murtherer,
affronted the great Preserver of Men
to please a Fiend, and undervalued
him that call'd me to Salvation, to
please a usurping Tyrant. I can give


<pb n="91" facs="tcp:107051:51"/>
no reason why I have offended thee,
except it be thy Goodness and Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
and could fair Weather make
me angry?</p>
               <p>What didst thou see in me, Lord!
that should attract thee, and make
thee leave the highest Heavens to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
into an Abyss of Misery?</p>
               <p>O my Jesus! water my Soul with
the Tears thou hast shed, anoint me

Sorrow, tye me by thy Bonds, let thy

strengthen me, let thy Cross
raise me; Reign over me, do with me
what seems good to thy Power, Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and Goodness. O let me never

Vanity more than Eternity, Misery

thee, yea, I should not be despised.</p>
               <p>O Lord! all my desire is before

to them that fear him, he will ever be

of his hands are Verity and Judgment;
All his Commandments are sure, they
stand fast for ever and ever, and are
done in Truth and Uprightness. He
sent Redemption unto his People. He
hath commanded his Covenant for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
Holy and Reverend is his Name.
He raises the Poor out of the Dust, and

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:107051:53"/>
conditions of the Covenant they have
made or renew'd with God, That they
may indeed fight for the future against
the World, the Flesh, and the Devil,
and be more than Conquerors, through
him that loved them, the Lord Jesus
Christ.</p>
               <p>My love to Christ must constrain
me to wish and beg that every Man
may love him, else he doth not appear
truly lovely to me.</p>
               <p>I must entreat the Father of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
to dispense his Spirit abundantly
at this time, That the love of Christ
prevailing, may pull down in my fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Receivers
all the strong Holds of
Iniquity, and all Imaginations which
exalt themselves against the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of Christ Jesus, That Christ may
Reign victoriously in every one of
them, live in them, act in them, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
them by his Spirit, That they
may indeed bring forth the Fruits of
the Spirit, Love, Joy, Peace, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Faith, Gentleness, Meekness,
Temperance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:107051:53"/>
I must be importunate with God to
make them all Partakers of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
of Christ's Death and Passion,
even of that Pardon, and Peace, and
Salvation he hath purchased, and cause
them to walk worthy of it, like per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
that are sensible of the greatness
of the Favour and the depth and
breadth and length and height of the
Love of God, and consequently may
be fill'd with all the fullness of God.</p>
               <p>3. I must be thankful for the Honor
I have received at such a time. I must
look upon't as more than ordinary
Preferment that God hath vouchsafed
me a place at his Table, admitted me
into the number of his Children, made
me Partaker of the promises of the
Gospel, open'd his Bosom to me, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
me into favour, assisted me with
his Spirit, given me a right to the Tree
of Life, and visited me with his Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <p>Here the Words of <hi>David</hi> may just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be applied, My Soul shall joy in thy
strength, O Lord, and in thy Salvation
how greatly may I rejoice! Thou hast


<pb n="96" facs="tcp:107051:54"/>
given me my hearts desire, and hast
not withholden the request of my
Lips; thou hast prevented me with
the Blessings of Goodness, thou settest
a Crown of Pure Gold on my head.
I asked life of thee, and thou gavest it
me, even length of days for ever and
ever. My glory is great in thy Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Honour and Majesty hast thou
laid upon me, for thou hast made me
Blessed for ever. Thou hast made me
exceeding glad with thy countenance.
Therefore will I trust in the Lord,
and through the Mercy of the most
High I shall not miscarry. Thine hand
shall find out all my spiritual Enemies,
thy right hand shall find out all those
that hate thee. Be thou exalted, Lord,
in thine own strength, so will we sing
and praise thy Power.</p>
               <p>4. I must go home rejoicing, and
praising God. Praise is comely for
the Upright; the poor Cripple did so
when he was Healed, and have not I
far greater reason to do so? Behold I
am healed at this time from mine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity,
and shall not his Praise be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
in my mouth?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:107051:54"/>
I must say in my heart, My Soul
doth magnifie the Lord, and my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
rejoices in God my Salvation. I
will extol thee, O God my King, and
I will Praise thy Name for ever and
ever. Every day will I Bless thee, and
Praise thy Name for ever and ever. O
all ye that fear the Lord, come and I
will tell you what he hath done for
my Soul. His Love hath overcome my
Corruption, his fervent Charity my
Coldness, his Goodness my Sins and
Follies. Except the Lord had been
on my side, now might I say, if the
Lord had not been on my side, when
Temptations and Corruptions rose up
against me, then they had swallow'd
me up quick, when their Wrath was
kindled against me, then the Waters
had overwhelm'd me, the Stream had
gone over my Soul: Blessed be the
Lord, who hath not given me over as
a Prey unto their Teeth. My Soul
is escaped as a Bird out of the Snare
of the Fowlers, the Snare is broken,
and I am escaped. My help is in the
Name of the Lord, who made Heaven
and Earth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:107051:55"/>
5. Being made whole, I must for
the future take heed, and sin wilfully
no more: Having wash'd my Feet, I
must not defile them again.</p>
               <p>I must stand upon my watch, and
shun those occasions, which formerly
led me into Sin.</p>
               <p>I must be cautious and afraid of an
ill Word, as much as of an evil Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and my very Thoughts must be
purged from that filth, that used to
cleave to them.</p>
               <p>I must strangle an evil suggestion in
its birth, and when I find any motion
rising in my mind, that looks like En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,
or Pride, or desire of Vain Glory,
or greediness after the World, I must
check it upon its first appearance.</p>
               <p>I must bid an Eternal farewel to Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief,
and mistrust of Gods Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and shun those sinful compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances
with Men, which heretofore I
was used to be guilty of.</p>
               <p>I must not only watch against grosser
Sins, and such as Jews and Heathens
can avoid, but against the secret dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders
and errors of my Heart, which


<pb n="99" facs="tcp:107051:55"/>
none sees but God, who is over all,
Blessed for evermore.</p>
               <p>6. I must frequently compare my Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Behaviour with the Vow and
Promise, and solemn Resolution I have
made in the Holy Sacrament, whether
my Deportment be agreeable to those
Engagements; Whether I stand in
awe of those Vows and Promises; and
whether they influence my Thoughts
and Words, and Practices; Whether
my hatred of Sin increases, and my
love to Holiness grows steady, and
unmoveable; Whether I check my
self, upon feeling an inclination, or
propensity to a sinful act with such
Thoughts as these. Is this the effect
of my late Vow? Is this to stand to
the Covenant, I lately made with
God? Is it possible, I can be so perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
as to break with God? Hath the
Cross of Christ so little power with
me? Shall it not restrain me from such
a sin as this? Foolish Creature! shall
a little profit or pleasure tempt me to
please the Divel, and wrong my im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
Soul? I am tied by a solemn


<pb n="100" facs="tcp:107051:56"/>
promise made in a most solemn place,
by a promise made to God, by a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
Sealed with the Blood of Jesus, not
to do it; and shall I presume to do it,
or hope for pardon, after this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption?</p>
               <p>I must take notice, Whether the
Thoughts of Christs death, make my
passions weak; Whether they lessen the
heat of them; Whether they repress
their fierceness; Whether they work
in me that contempt of the World,
which was so signal in my dear Lord
and Master.</p>
               <p>I must ever and anon look how my
Graces thrive, Whether no weeds
grow among them, that are like to
choak the wholsome Herbs.</p>
               <p>7. I must now study Self-denial,
even in things lawful, and that seem to
have no harm in them. Self-denial in
Eating and Drinking, in my Cloaths,
in my Recreations, in my Time, in my
Discourses, in my Wit, in my Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
in my Profit, in my Ease, and in
my Sleep.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:107051:56"/>
I must now take heed, I do not Eat
and Drink to satiety, but labour still
to rise from my Meals with an Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite.</p>
               <p>I must now and then humble my
Soul with a Religious Fast, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times forbear eating of that Dish,
I have most mind to, to bring my sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual
Desires into order.</p>
               <p>I must not imitate every vain fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
I see other people use, but must
be very modest and decent in my garb;
and having means and opportunities
to buy me better, reserve that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
I would have laid out upon a
richer Suit, for Pious uses.</p>
               <p>I must not think every recreation
lawful, because it's commonly used by
Men, who are none of the worst. I
must not encourage the vanity of Men
and Women, that are in love with
Stage-Plays by my example, as being
things, I abjured in my Baptisme, but
my recreation must be such, as may fit
me for Spiritual Devotions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:107051:57"/>
I must not spend my time as some lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urious,
and idle People do, in need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
and complemental Visits, in play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at Cards and Dice, but in Words,
and Actions, and Discourses, as may
be useful and profitable: either to the
Souls or Bodies of my Family, and my
Neighbours.</p>
               <p>I must not censure, or judge my
Neighbour rashly in my Speeches and
Discourses, and not be easily drawn
to give a Verdict or Judgment of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
except it be in their Praise and
Commendation, if they do deserve
it.</p>
               <p>I must not give my self too great
liberty in jesting, but forbear blurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out a witty Saying, if it be smut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
or abusive of my neighbours Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
and Reputation.</p>
               <p>I must not give my self to reading
of Romances, and such Books as serve
to render the Mind vain, and the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
loose and regardless of Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
things.</p>
               <p>I must express my gratitude to God,
for the Temporal Gain and Profit his


<pb n="103" facs="tcp:107051:57"/>
Hand sends me, by consecrating some
part of it to good uses; nor must I be
fond of that Profit which arises from
undermining my neighbour.</p>
               <p>I must not study the ease of my Flesh
much, but take opportunities to use
it to some hardships, that it may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
more obedient to my Reason.</p>
               <p>I must not stay at my sport so long
as my sensual desires crave, but use on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
so much of it, as may render me
serviceable to God and Man.</p>

               <p>Yes certainly, for this is the
way, that the Primitive Believers
walked in. They did not think that
Heaven was to be gained at a cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
rate, and why should I? Thus did
the Apostles, thus did their Followers,
and without such Self-denial, they
thought there was no arriving to Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness.
Besides, this is most agreeable
to the Precepts of the Gospel; and
why should I think, that I may be-Saved
another way, then God himself
hath appointed.</p>

upon thy death, there depends Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity?</p>

               <p>O this base, this wicked

a livelyhood, the many crosses
and disappointments I meet with,
hopes of having more time hereafter;
the company I converse with, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
I have to deal with, fear of Want,
and the Calling and Condition I am
in, are such impediments, I know not
how to shake off?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Consc.</speaker>
               <p>Is it not possible to live in
the World, and to keep thy self un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spotted
from it? If it be not, live a
Beggar rather, live despised, live con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible,
live dis-regarded by all
Men, rather then not enter into these
everlasting Joys! Shall a pleasant sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Life hinder thee from the everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing


<pb n="105" facs="tcp:107051:58"/>
enjoyment of God! Shall the
fawnings, or applauses of Men, hinder
thee from the Eternal applause of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels!
Think, if thou wert standing at
the great Tribunal, trembling at the
Eternal horror thou art condemned
too; Think whether thou wouldst not
wish, that thou hadst lived in Caves
and Holes, poor, destitute, afflicted,
for a few years rather, then have come
to this miserable end? Why should
the examples of thy careless neighbors
move thee, when thou knowest there
are but few that will be saved? Canst
not thou get a livelyhood, except
thou art rich and greedy after the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of the World? If thou canst but
get Food and Raiment, content thy
self; and that most certainly thou wilt
get, if thou art industrious in thy
lawful Calling, and darest but trust
God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Crosses, Losses, and Disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
are necessary for thee to drive
thee from Earth to Heaven; and if all
this while thou dost not lose thy Soul,
thou art safe enough. Do but look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thy Soul as worth more then a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand


<pb n="106" facs="tcp:107051:59"/>
Worlds, and none of these things
will deject thee! Thy hopes of having
time to repent hereafter, is a meer
cheat, and if thou trust to that, thou
wilt never be saved. A Spiritual life is a
thing of labour, and pains, and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspection,
and canst thou be so
silly as to think, a few careless Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
at last will plant it in thee? Alas!
These are childish reasonings. The
company thou conversest withal, if
they are thy bane, must be shaken off,
whatever comes on't. There is no dally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in a thing of this consequence; and
if other men will poison themselves,
why shouldst thou? Let the People
thou dealest with, be never so bad,
tha'ts no example for thee to follow.
If they are unreasonable, why shouldst
thou lose thy Wits, and thy Salvation
for their sakes? If they cheat or abuse
thee, they do themselves more wrong
then thee; nor will thy fuming and
fretting at them, convert, or bring
them into a better temper. Why
shouldst thou be afraid of Want, when
thou doest not see a Bird starve, or die


<pb n="107" facs="tcp:107051:59"/>
for want of Food, and can Want be
grievous, when the Author and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of thy Salvation was in want, and
his followers were so too, and yet did
live in Heaven? Either thy Calling is
honest, or dishonest; if dishonest,
and an inevitable occasion of sinning,
away with it, and turn Ploughman, or
Servant rather, then live in it. If ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honest,
do not involve thy self in too
much business, for that will certainly
hinder thee from frequent Prayer and
Meditation: and looking after the
concerns of thy Soul; and as for
necessaries, thy God will not suffer
thee to want them.</p>
               <p>Lift up thine Eyes, look upon this
World. The greatest part of the Men
thou seest, will certainly be Eternally
miserable. Why shouldst thou venture
with them? Doest thou think that
howling with them at last will give
thee any comfort? There is a prize put
in thy hand; Why shouldst thou
slight it, and lament thy contempt for
ever? Neglect not the present time;


<pb n="108" facs="tcp:107051:60"/>
Do not let this opportunity slip. Thy
God waits for thee. Come in, before

to thy Holy, and wholsome
I aws, how unlike the Lives of

been; how can I forbear blush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing!
How can I forbear pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strating
my Self before Thee!
How can I forbear falling into
the humblest postures, my Soul,
and Body is capable of! How
have I abused thy Goodness!
How have I affronted thy Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity!
How have I trespassed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thy Patience! How have I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
thy tender Calls! How
hast thou waited for me while
I have been stubborn! How hast
thou courted me while I have

me while I have been care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less!
How deep ought my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition
to be! How profound
my Sorrow! How profuse my
Tears! I have mourned for a


<pb n="112" facs="tcp:107051:62"/>
dead Corps; I have wept for a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased
Relation; I have griev'd to
see the Body of my Friend left
without a Soul! Yet have not
mourned for God's departing
from me, nor wept for the
deadness of my Heart; nor
griev'd to see my self depriv'd
of thy Grace and Mercy!</p>
               <p>O my Lord, I see my folly,
I perceive I have gone astray, I
am sensible I have dishonour'd
thee! How different do my Sins
appear to me now, from what
they did before! They look more
dismal, more dreadful, more
bloody, then once they did! Now
I would mourn, now I would

deplore them! Oh touch this

O Jesu! Look upon these Eyes

and my Garments of Heaviness

me unto thy Self in Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
The Mercy is too
big for me to ask, but not for

I can plead no desert. Here thou

I have heard thou lovest
to spread thy skirts over those
that are destitute, and afflicted
that are cast abroad, have no

where to address themselves for

               <p>O my Lord! If Misery be a

it in the highest degree! What

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:107051:64"/>
been of broken Cisterns! How
enamoured with muddy puddles!
Ah My Father, how didst thou
pity me! How didst thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail
my blindess! With what
sorrowful Eyes didst thou look
upon my wilfulness! Behold My
Lord! I do return. I return,
that I may look upon thee, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
that thou mayst look upon
me! I return, Oh do thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
over me, Oh! Let there
be joy in the presence of thy
Holy Angels over this sinner,
who repents! I am troubled, I
am exceedingly troubled, that
I have made no answerable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
to thy Love; that thy Grace
hath been bestowed upon me in
vain; that thy Mercy hath been
thrown away on such a wretch:


<pb n="118" facs="tcp:107051:65"/>
Oh the baseness! Oh the ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude!
Oh the disingenuity, that
I have been guilty of! Thou hast
been my greatest Benefactor!
How freely, how lovingly, how
candidly hast thou visited me!
yet I have resisted thy Power,
despised thy Wisdom, underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued
thy Goodness! Thou
wouldst have torn down my
strong holds of iniquity, and I
would not! Thou wouldst have
taught me my Duty to God and
Man, and I refused it; Thou
wouldst have made me Holy, as
thou art Holy, and I scorned it.
Ungrateful Worm! Do I thus
reward the Lord my God!
Could I recompence such Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
with such Sins! Such Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
with such gross neglects!


<pb n="119" facs="tcp:107051:65"/>
thy condescension with Pride,
thy Humiliation with Envy, thy
Love with Anger; thy Bounty
with slight and slovenly perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances;
Thy Bowels with Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience;
thy Charity with
contempt of my Neighbour; Thy
Blessings with Revenge; Thy
Benefits with averseness from
Virtue and Goodness; thy Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence
with Vanity; and the
showers of thy Grace with earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-mindedness!</p>
               <p>Ah! how are my sins multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed!
How like a heavy burthen,
are they become<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> too heavy for
me to bear! But Oh my God! Thy
Mercy is over all thy Works;
Thy Mercy is greater then my
Sins! My Sins have taken hold
upon me! What shall I do?


<pb n="120" facs="tcp:107051:66"/>
I am a burthen to my self! I am
bow'd down with the weight of
my Transgressions! Whether,
O my Lord, should I go, but to
thee, who hast the words of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Life! Thou hast pity on sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
thou conversest with them,
thou eatest with them, Receive
me Graciously, Love me Freely;
Think upon thy Mercy, think
upon thy Blood, think upon thy
Tears; and accept of me! I am
surrounded with dangers, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compassed
with Enemies, encir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cled
with Hellish Monsters, yet
in the midst of these pressures,
I hear thee saying, <hi>Come to me
all ye who are weary and heavy la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</hi>
Shall I hide my self as
<hi>Adam</hi> did in Paradise! Shall this
word fright me away? Shall I


<pb n="121" facs="tcp:107051:66"/>
refuse to come when thou callest
in this still voice? No, No, I
will confess my Transgression,
and thou wilt forgive the iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of my Sin. I will harden my
Heart no more; I will turn a
deaf Ear to thee no more; I will
stand out no longer; I will resist
thy Light no longer; I will
grieve thee no more, I will afflict
and vex thy Holy Spirit no
more.</p>
               <p>O infinite Goodness! O won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
Love! though with the
Publican I dare not lift up my
Eyes to Heaven; yet with the
humble <hi>Magdalen</hi> I will come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
thee weeping, and wash thy
Feet with my Tears, and kiss
them. Oh let me hear the blessed
news of Pardon from thy


<pb n="122" facs="tcp:107051:67"/>
Mouth! Thou camest, Lord,
thou camest not to call the
Righteous, but Sinners to
repentance; and of these I am
chief! If thou wilt converse with
Sinners, here is one that wants
thy help, and that stands in need
of thy cure, full of Diseases, full
of Sores, full of Weakness, full
of Errours, full of Infirmities,
a prodigy of Frailty. Here Lord!
here is work for thy strong Hand,
and for thy mighty Arm. In this
Heart are Divels that must be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
by thy Power. Stretch forth
thy Hand and save me. Here is
an object to exercise thy omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent
hand upon. My Cure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
Miracles. It's no ordinary
Virtue, that will set me to Rights
again. Thou, Thou O Lord,


<pb n="123" facs="tcp:107051:67"/>
must come, and strike thy Hand
over the sore place, and my Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prosie
will be gone.</p>
               <p>Thy Prophet cries by thy or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,<hi>Return
unto the Lord your
God, for he is Gracious and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful,
slow to anger, and repents
him of the evil!</hi> I believe Lord!
I believe; My Heart is wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
within me. I come, I come.
Father, I have sinn'd against
Heaven, and before thee, and
am no more worthy to be
called thy Son; make me as one
of thy hired Servants. But then
I desire no other hire, no other
wages, but thy Self: Thou art
my exceeding great reward.</p>
               <p>Oh! How bitter a thing is it
to forsake thee! What have I got
by offending thee! What have


<pb n="124" facs="tcp:107051:68"/>
I gained by sinning against thee
Nothing but Shame, and Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
and Trembling, and Confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Darkness hath covered me,
the shadow of Death hath fallen
upon me! What fruit had I then
in those things, whereof I am
now asham'd! My Soul hath
been divested of her innocence,
her Joy, her Peace, her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
and her Satisfaction. And
Oh my Jesus, didst not thou stand
my friend now; Great Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
didst not thou stand in the
gap now, and plead for me; O
my Redeemer, Didst not thou
intercede for me; I must be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted,
and exposed to Eternal
laughter and derision! Good
Lord! How pitiful, how wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
how trivial, how imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,


<pb n="125" facs="tcp:107051:68"/>
how inconsiderable was
that pleasure, that profit, that
thing, for which I did did affront,
and dishonour thee! When I
look upon thy Creatures, either
above, or below; I wonder how
they were able to contain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and not vindicate their
Masters Honour, which they
saw abused by me; I wonder,
they did not not fall upon me
and crush me into perdition,
when they saw how bold, how
presumptuous this Caitiff was!</p>
               <p>O my Lord! For this my
Soul shall mourn in secret; even
for this that I have not loved
thee better, that I have not
sought thee, more, that I have
not approach'd thee with greater
veneration! Hence forward Lord


<pb n="126" facs="tcp:107051:69"/>
if all the Pleasures, all the Riches,
all the Honours of this World,
were concentred in this sin, that
formerly I lived in, it should be
no temptation to me. I would
tear the Tyrant out of its seat.
It should usurp thy place no
more. I would pull it out of its
Throne, it should find no har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
in me. Thy Love should
constrain me to part with it. I
will Crucify thee no more. I
have trampled too long upon thy
Mercy. I will make light of it
no more!</p>
               <p>O my Jesus! Remember thy
Agonies, remember thy Pain,
remember thy Sufferings, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
thy Death, and forget
my Sins. Thy Servant <hi>David</hi>
cryed once, <hi>I have sinned,</hi> and


<pb n="127" facs="tcp:107051:69"/>
thou didst presently take away
his Sin. My sighing is not hid
from thee. O do not hide thy
Face from me! <hi>Manasseh</hi> look'd
up to thee, and thou hadst re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
unto his Prayer. O give
ear to my Prayer too, that goes
not out of feigned Lips. The
<hi>Ninivites</hi> humbled themselves,
and thou wast intreated. Oh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
thy self of the evil, thou
hast said, thou wouldst do unto
me, and do it not. <hi>Peter</hi> wept,
and thou gavest him a Gracious
Look. I water my couch with
my tears; Oh smile upon me
too, and say, <hi>I have redeem'd
thee, thou art mine!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I love thee O Lord, and would
have every Creature love thee.
I would have all things that


<pb n="128" facs="tcp:107051:70"/>
have breath praise the Lord. I
would have every creature shew
forth thy Glory! Thou hast lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
me from all Eternity! Was
ever such Love heard of, as thine
was! To come from the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of the Blessed, into a Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley
of Tears, to advance such
a creature from Death to Life
Eternal! Thou hast made my
Death a harmless, nay a gainful
thing. Thy Cross hath sweetned
all; there was Death in the pot,
but thou threwest in Meal, and
didst sweeten all. O blot out
the very footsteps of my Sins,
and set me as a Seal upon thy
Heart, so will I give thee thanks
in the great Congregation, my
Lips shall praise thee.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:107051:70"/>
O my Life! I would prefer
thee above all thy Creatures!
I would look upon all these out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Comforts as a drop in the
Bucket, and on Thee, as the Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an!
On these, as the small dust
in the Ballance; on Thee, as the
Rock of Ages! I would love
Thee with all my heart, I would
love Thee more then my Self!
O that my whole Mind were
united to Thee! O that I might
know nothing save Jesus Christ,
and him Crucified! O that all
the powers of my Soul might
embrace Thee! O that I might
seek thy Glory with stronger
desires, then Worldlings do their
Wealth, or the Covetous the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
of their In-comes! Oh!
that I could adhere unto Thee


<pb n="130" facs="tcp:107051:71"/>
inseparably! O withdraw my
Heart from every evil way. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
my Heart to all Goodness.
Let not my Affections be hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
corrupted with the love of
the Creature; Let me not be
weary of loving Thee! Let no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
overcome my Love! Let
nothing damp it! Oh enable
me to say, <hi>Who shall separate me
from the love of God!</hi> O draw
my Soul with cords of Love,
with this Love wound, and pierce
my Heart, and make it sick, that
it may insatiably long for Thee!
Oh! I would love Thee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ceasing, love Thee without
bounds, love Thee without mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure!
Oh let my Soul melt with
this Fire, and purge away that
filth which doth so easily beset


<pb n="131" facs="tcp:107051:71"/>
me! Take away from me all
that doth displease Thee; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
in me all that pleases Thee!
Be Thou ever present with me!
Live in me thou Fountain of
Life! and let me live in Thee,
and let that Charity live in me,
which suffers long, and is kind,
which envies not, which vaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not it self, which is not puft
up, which doth not behave it
self unseemly, seeks not her own,
is not easily provoked, thinks

all things, believes all things,
hopeth all things, endureth all

               <head>A Prayer for Faith.</head>
               <p>O Thou, from whom every
good and perfect Gift
descends, who givest to all Men
liberally, and upbraidest not;
Thou callest, <hi>Seek ye my Face;</hi>
Thy Face, Lord, will I seek!
Thou hast said, O Lord, Thy
Mouth hath spoken it, if ye had
but Faith as a grain of Mustard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seed,
ye should say unto this
Mountain, Be thou removed,
and cast into the Sea, and it
should obey you. O my Lord!
I have Rocks to be displaced,
Mountains to be removed, vast
loads to be freed from; Rocks of
Unbelief, Mountains of Sin,
loads of Iniquity! Oh lend me


<pb n="133" facs="tcp:107051:72"/>
thy helping Hand. None can give
relief, none can succour, none
can do me any good, but thy
self. How dark, how dull, how
doubtful is my Faith! sometimes
it blazes, then it disappears
again, sometimes it's vigorous,
then slacks, and grows remiss
again. I believe thee in Sun-shine,
and faint in a Storm; sometimes
I get a sight of thy Glory, then
I lose it again. Oh how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>even
is my Faith! When thy
Candle shines over my Head,
and I wash my Feet in Butter,
I believe, but where is my Faith
in the dark, when the Fig-tree
doth not blossom, when there is
no Fruit in the Vine, when the
labour of the Olive doth fail!
Oh how it sinks at such times,


<pb n="134" facs="tcp:107051:73"/>
how weak it grows! Lord, I
believe, help mine unbelief! O
thou Sun of Righteousness, thou
bright Morning-Star; Thou
mighty Star of <hi>Jacob,</hi> shine up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me, shine upon this dark Soul
of mine, press in by thy piercing
beams, scatter the Clouds of my
unbelief; Dispel those mists, as
chaff is driven away by the
Wind, so drive them away, O
thou Holy One of <hi>Israel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I Believe, but my Faith doth
not rouze me from my Spiritual

I believe, but my Faith doth not
put me upon Self-denial; I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,

me to that cautiousness of
offending thee, which is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

to Salvation. I believe, but my
Faith doth not make me labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
doth not make me strive, and
fight, and work, and enter in at
the strait Gate; I do not believe,
as if I saw. My Faith is not the
substance of things unseen. I do
not represent that future Glory
to my mind in such lively Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters,
as if it were present to
my sight. I seem to rejoyce in
thy Promises, but when I am to
apply them, what doubts, what
scruples, what perplexities arise
in my mind! I believe thou
hast overcome Death, yet how
do I tremble at its approaches!
I believe thou art present with
me in affliction, yet how often
do I lose thy Image! I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
my dearest Lord, that thou


<pb n="136" facs="tcp:107051:74"/>
camest from Heaven to reveal to
me thy Fathers Will, yet I do
not so readily obey it, as I
would. I believe, but am too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
overcome by a Passion, too
often by a Temptation, too often
by the World!</p>
               <p>O my Lord! Give me an act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive
Faith, a working Faith, a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous
Faith, a lively Faith, an
effectual Faith! A Faith which
may oblige me to shake off all
dulness, all drousiness, all laziness,
and which may make me awake
to Righteousness; Give me a
Faith, that may surmount all
hardships, may be afraid of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
of no Bear, no Lion in
the way; Give me a Faith which
may make me bold as a Lion,
couragious in Danger, resolute


<pb n="137" facs="tcp:107051:74"/>
in the greatest Trials, and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous
under the greatest bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens;
A Faith I want, which
may make all that is within me
stoop to the yoak of Jesus, which
may cross my Flesh and Blood,
cruicfy my vain Desires, and
dash mine inordinate Affections.
O give me a Faith, which may
make me tender of thy Glory,
loth to do any thing that may
be offensive to thee, unwilling
to displease thee, the Author
of my Being; Give me a Faith
which may oblige me to labour
in thy Vineyard, and work out
my salvation with fear and tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling;
A Faith, that may look
into Eternity, Survey the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Mansions prepared by the
Son of God; live there, and


<pb n="138" facs="tcp:107051:75"/>
converse there, and draw Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
and Consolations from that
perfection of Glory; A Faith
which may live upon thy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
lay hold on them in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spite
of opposition, and claim
them as my Heritage for ever;
A Faith, which may look Death
in the Face, defy its Power,
support it self with Christs vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,
and sing with Triumph
over it; <hi>Oh Death! Where is thy
sting?</hi> A Faith, which may make
Affliction easy, my Burthen
Light, and sweeten all my Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles;
A Faith, which may puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
my Heart, constrain me to
Obedience, and compel me to a

and Order; A Faith, which
may controul all my Lusts, check

Wills, but of thee who shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Mercy. As Flesh and Blood
could not have revealed these

Arise O God, and let thine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies

               <p>O how am I beholding to
thee ! What Thanks, what Prais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es

call'd me to the light of thy
Gospel! That thou hast disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd

world lie involv'd in! That I


<pb n="141" facs="tcp:107051:76"/>
have liberty to read thy Word,
to peruse it, and to know the
things belonging to my Peace!
Thou hast not dealt so with other
Persons, and as for thy judgments,
they have not known them. But
what will this knowledge profit
me, if my practice be not suta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,

How few act, and live, as

Why should the enemy run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way

these poor creatures wander like
Sheep without a Shepherd! O
Gather them! O seek them, that

of God! O my Lord, I believe,
that thou art, and wilt be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder
to them, that diligently
seek thee! I believe, if any man
will do thy Will, he shall know
of thy Doctrine, whether it be
of God or no! I believe, that
not the least tittle of thy Word
shall fail! O encrease my Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief!
Let not my Faith rest upon
thy Doctrine only, but let it


<pb n="143" facs="tcp:107051:77"/>
have regard to all thy Laws! O

               <p>O my Jesus! I believe thou
wast crucified for my sins! How
then should I live in sin! As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure

mock thee! How can I believe
my sin odious, while I embrace
and cherish it! How can I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
it kill'd thee, while I
make much of it! How can I
believe it drew Sweats of Blood
from thee, while I water it, and
keep it warm! Oh! I am wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of this vain Belief! Rid me
of it! Deliver me from it! Let


<pb n="144" facs="tcp:107051:78"/>
all my neighbours see, that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
these things indeed! Let

believe these great things, but
live them over! Come forth
my dearest Lord, and meet me!
No Man can come to thee, but
he whom thou drawest to thee!
Oh let me touch but the hem of
thy Garment, and I shall recover!
Let me so Believe in thee, that

Heart, my Sighs, my Desires,
thou knowest I hope for it! Oh
let this Hope be lively, let it be
a Hope which may purify me,
even as God is pure. Nay my
very flesh shall rest in Hope, and


<pb n="147" facs="tcp:107051:79"/>
thou wilt not suffer my Body to
see everlasting corruption; Thou
wilt raise me from the Dust at
last; All my Bones shall say,
Lord, Who is like unto thee! I
know that my Redeemer lives,
and that he shall stand at the
latter day upon the Earth; and
though after my Skin, Worms
destroy this Body, yet in my
Flesh shall I see God, whom I
shall see for my self, and mine
Eyes shall behold, and not ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and having this Hope, O
assist me, O perswade me, O
prompt me to cleanse my self
from all filthiness both of Flesh
and Spirit, and to perfect Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in the fear of God</p>
               <p>Deck my Soul with Humility
with Patience, with Constancy,


<pb n="148" facs="tcp:107051:80"/>
that no Rods, no Stripes, no Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
no Torment, no Shipwrack,
no perils of Waters, no perils of
Robbers, no perils among my
own Countrey-men, no perils
among Heathens, no perils in the
City, no perils in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
no perils in the Sea, no pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rils
among false Brethren, no
weariness, no painfulness, no
Watchings, no Hunger, no Thirst,
no Cold, no Nakedness, no
Weakness, no Infirmity, no Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
or Dishonour, no good
Report, or evil Report may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
me from trusting in thee!
Though the Lord should kill me,
yet let me hope in him. If in this
Life only I have Hope in Christ,
I am of all Men most miserable.
The Lord is my Light and my


<pb n="149" facs="tcp:107051:80"/>
Salvation, whom shall I fear?
The Lord is the strength of my
Life, of whom shall I be afraid?
Though an Host should encamp
against me, my heart shall not fear,
though War should rise against
me, in this will I be confident,
for in the time of trouble he
shall hide me in his Pavilion, in
the secret of his Tabernacle he
shall hide me, he shall set me up
upon a Rock. Thou art he that
took me out of the Womb, thou
didst make me Hope, when I was
upon my Mothers Breasts; O
let it not be in the power of Men,
or Divels, to shake this Hope;
Let it be my Anchor, sure, and
stedfast, which no Waves no
Billows, no Storms, no Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pests
can move.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:107051:81"/>
Whatever evils befall me, let
me think they come from a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Hand. Let no prosperity,
no Sun-shine, no Calmness, no
smiling Fortune subvert this Hope
in my Soul. Let me look upon
all these outward Comforts, as
Vanity, Vanity of Vanities,
which can give no Ease, no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
no satisfaction to a Soul of
a Spiritual Appetite. Let me
thirst after nothing so much, as
after thy Love, as after Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Blessings, as after the hidden
Manna, as after the white Stone
which no man knows, save he,
who receives it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>I will not hope in any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
I will arise, and depart,
for here is not my rest. Why
art thou cast down, O my Soul,


<pb n="151" facs="tcp:107051:81"/>
and why art thou disquieted
within me? Hope thou in God,
for I shall yet praise him, who is
the health of my Countenance,
and my God. My Soul, wait
thou only upon God, for my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
is from him; He ony
is my Rock, and my Salvation,
he is my Defence, I shall not be
moved. In God is my Salvation,
and my Glory, the Rock of my
Strength, and my Refuge is in
God. Trust in him at all times,
ye People, pour out your Hearts
before him. Thou hast been a
shelter for me, and a strong Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
from the Enemy. From the
end of the Earth will I cry un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thee, when my Heart is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm'd!
O my God, my Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
extends not to thee; The


<pb n="152" facs="tcp:107051:82"/>
Lord is the portion of my Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance,
and of my Cup, thou
maintainest my Lot. Who was
ever confounded that trusted in
thee? Who was ever forsaken
that hoped in thee? Who was
ever despised, that in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
called upon thee? All Hail
my dearest Lord, my Hope, I
love thee, I embrace thee, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
all those lesser Goods,
which are in the World, that I
may make thee my highest, and
my chiefest Good.</p>
               <p>It's true, Lord, I am a sinner,
and have been a very ungrateful
wretch; The least of thy Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
is more then I have deserved,
My very Righteousnesses have
been as filthy Rags, but I will
not trust in my Bow, neither is


<pb n="153" facs="tcp:107051:82"/>
it my Sword that shall save me,
but thy Mercy, O Lord, thy Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and the palmes of thy Hands,
on which thou hast engraven my
Name, shall be my refuge. I have
no merits, no deserts to trust to;
I can claim nothing as my Right;
all I am, and all I have is thy
Charity; What Goodness there
is in me, is entirely owing to thy
Grace, and Compassion; With
this thou crownest me, with this
thou enrichest me, with this thou
anointest my Head, that I may
work in thy Vineyard, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Penny at night; I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide
not in my Works, I depend
not upon my Industry, I rest not
in my own Labours, but in thy
Blood, in thy Sweat, in thy good
pleasure, O Glorious Son of God!


<pb n="154" facs="tcp:107051:83"/>
Cursed is the Man, that trusts in
Man, and makes Flesh his Arm.
I will hope in thy Mercy, my
Heart shall rejoyce in thy Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Evening and Morning, and
at Noon will I Pray, and thou
wilt hear my voice. Thou hast
said, Ask, and ye shall have,
Seek, and ye shall find, Knock,
and it shall be open'd to you;
Who would not Hope after this?
Who would not rely upon thee
after such a Promise! O let me
find Grace in the sight of my
Lord! I desire nothing else; this
is the height of my wishes; this
is it, which engrosses the faculties
of my Soul. Thy Grace is the
Jewel I want, the Pearl I stand
in need of, the Crown my Soul
longs for. Thou art my witness


<pb n="155" facs="tcp:107051:83"/>
O Lord, That my Heart thinks
so; Thou hast Treasures of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
Thy Stores are large, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exhaustible!
Thou bidst me
come, and buy without Money,
and without price, and my Soul
shall live; Thou dost promise me
more then Kings can promise,
and no wonder, for thou art
greater, and richer, then all the
Kings of the Earth. Thou givest
Rest to the weary Soul, and
Strength to the Faint; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
mine Eyes shall be toward
thee! O let thine Eyes be open,
and thine Ears attent unto the
Prayer of thy Servant! Do thou
chuse, and sanctify this House,
that thy Name may be there for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever!
and let thine Eyes, and
thy Heart be here perpetually.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:107051:84"/>
Thy liberality and bounty is
immense, and infinite! I cannot
but hope in thee! Oh my unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
Heart! Couldst thou but
trust him more, what great things
wouldst thou see! His Mercy is
upon thee according, as thou
hopest in him. The more thou
hopest, the greater is his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy!</p>
               <p>O my Lord! What stupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous
Gifts, dost thou present me
with! What amazing Offers dost
thou make to my Soul! Thou
art not only willing to impart
thy Graces to me, but in thy
<hi>Supper</hi> givest me thy Self! and
here thou offerest to carry me
in thy Arms, to be my nursing
Father, and to be Food to my
hungry Soul. May it be unto me


<pb n="157" facs="tcp:107051:84"/>
according to thy Word! Come
Lord! Lodge thou in my Soul,
make it thy dwelling place; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noint
it with the Oil of Mercy;
I will go, and take the Cup of
Salvation, and call upon the
Name of the Lord. Thy loving
kindness shall be before mine
Eyes, and I will walk in thy
Truth; I will not sit with vain
Persons, neither will I go in with
the Dissemblers; I will wash
mine Hands in innocency, so
will I compass thine Altar, O
Lord! That I may publish with
the voice of Thanksgiving, and
tell of all thy wondrous works:
my Heart shall be inditing a
good Matter, and I will speak
of things touching the King of
Saints. Into thy Hands I commit


<pb n="158" facs="tcp:107051:85"/>
my Spirit, thou hast redeemed

               <p>O Thou who hast so loved
the World, as to give
thine only Son, to the end, that
all that Believe in him, should
not perish, but have everlasting
Life! What shall I do to love
thee! What shall I do to be
united to thee! What shall I do
to get a place in thy Bosom! If
I love thee not, I am undone;
If thou dost not look exceeding
lovely in mine Eyes, I am lost;
If my Affections do not fix up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thee, I perish, I cannot be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
without loving thee! My
Soul is destitute of her proper
Good, if thou be not the object
of my delight! I am perfectly


<pb n="160" facs="tcp:107051:86"/>
miserable, if thou be not the
Center of my Spirit. Love is the
greatest Gist that's given to poor
creatures. Love enriches their
Souls; Love makes their Faces
shine; Love must brighten their
Souls, and make them appear
lovely in the Eyes of God! O
my Lord! Thou hast given me
faculties to love thee, Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
to contemplate thy
Beauty and Mercy, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
memory to retain the
lively apprehensions of thy Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and a Will to prompt my
whole Man into sutable Actions!
The more I love thee, the Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
I am! The more I love thee,
the more I am with thee! for
where I love, there is my Soul!
where my Affections are, there


<pb n="161" facs="tcp:107051:86"/>
is my Spirit: where my Treasure
is, there will my Heart be also
Who would look upon a Dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil

Who would hear the

that can hear melodious

taken with the pomp and glory
of the World, which in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison
of thee is a meer Dunghil;
or with the caresses and praises of
mortal Men, which are perfect
howlings compared with the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
thy Love doth make!
Shall I love Honour, and not
love thee, who art the Fountain
of it! Shall I love Pleasure, and
not love thee, in whose Presence
there is fulness of Joy! Who
can be likened unto thee, O


<pb n="162" facs="tcp:107051:87"/>
Lord! And if nothing can be
likened unto thee, I must love
nothing like thee! And if I just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
love that which is good, I
must necessarily love thee more
then all things in this world,
for thou art infinitely better, then
all things in this world! There
is nothing so good, nothing so
precious, nothing so rich, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
so amiable as thou art!</p>
               <p>O my Jesus! How great was
thy condescension! Thou knew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
I could love nothing so well,
as what was like me, and in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance
with my temper (for
thou knewest my frame) thou
becamest like me indeed: The

Eternal became an Infant. If
therefore I love Man, who is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally


<pb n="163" facs="tcp:107051:87"/>
like me, how much more
am I bound to love thee, who
wroughst a miracle to become
Man, that thou mightst be like
me! Love desires the presence
of its delightful object, and can
any thing be more present then
thou art? Thou art in me, and
with me, and without me, thou art
present in all places, at all times, in
all companies; thou art willing to
dwell in me, and to make thine
abode in me; Thou art content
never to depart from me. Thou
art strangely bountiful, who
would not love thee? Who ever
gave greater or larger Gifts, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
more in number, or more

               <p>I will love thee, O Lord! I

to be thy Brother, thy Sister,
and thy Mother, for he that doth
thy Will, shall be all this in thy

thee, as these Relations are to
mortal Men! Thou art my

whether doth thy Love carry

and never was a truer Friend
then thou art, and hast been to

thee, no revolution hath altered

My Sores do not make thee loath

thee to cast me away, my Vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
doth not tempt thee to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise
me! Thou lovest at all
times, if I am wounded, thou


<pb n="167" facs="tcp:107051:89"/>
bindest up my wounds; if I am
broken, thou healest me, if I am
grieved, thou refreshest me, if I
am in danger thou deliverest
me, if under pain, thou givest
me ease, if under trouble, thou
comfortest me; O my Jesus!
Thou art gone up to thy Father,
and to my Father, and hast made
us Friends! Thou hast reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
him to my Soul! Thou hast
loved me before the foundation
of the world! How often hast
thou in Mercy look'd upon
me! How often hast thou
pittied me! I was unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy

me lye in my Blood, thou saidst
<hi>Live, in thy Blood Live.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What shall I say unto thee,
O thou great preserver of Men?


<pb n="168" facs="tcp:107051:90"/>
No Words, no Language will
reach thy Love, or give a tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
description of it; yet still
this increases my obligations to
love thee! And what a mercy
is it that thou wilt give me leave
to love thee! That this Great,
this Glorious, this Immense, this
Incomprehensible God will
vouchsafe to be loved by a
Worm; What a favour is it!
Prize it, O my Soul! and think
thou hearest every Creature,
that's beneficial to thee, calling
upon thee to love him! The
Sun that shines upon thee, calls
to thee, I give thee light, that
thou mayst admire the Father of
Light; so doth the Moon, so do
the Stars, so do all those things,
whereby thou art fed, maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

thou mayst love him, whose Hand

O my God! Shall I have such
monitors to love thee, and be deaf
to the Call! How will all these
rise in judgment against me one
day, if I love thee not! How
justly do I fall a Sacrifice to thy
wrath, if under such exhortations
I despise thy Love!</p>
               <p>How many Souls have pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish'd,
and I am yet alive! How
many have been struck dead in
their Sins, and I am yet called to
pentance! How many do yet walk
in darkness, and I have the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
to see thy marvellous Light!


<pb n="170" facs="tcp:107051:91"/>
Thou hast dealt more kindly by
me, then thou hast done by
others! O how am I bound to
love thee! I see the odiousness
of that sin, which others doat

Vices, which others wallow in!
I see the Beauty of that Virtue,
which others scorn! I see the
charms of that Grace, which
others laugh at! I taste of those
Comforts, which others continue
ignorant of! I see the reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness
of thy Precepts, which
others count an intolerable yoak!
I have some sense of another
world, while thousands live, as
if there were none! I see the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of Holiness, while others
make a mock of Sin! What mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
are these to love thee! Shall

I be afraid, or ashamed after all
this, to love thee! Every Sense
I have, bids me love thee! I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
smell to any thing, but I
smell the fragrancy of thy Love.
I cannot taste any thing, but I
must taste how Sweet, and how
Gracious thou art! I cannot look
upon any thing, but I must see
thy Goodness! The oil of thy
Love swims upon every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
I touch or feel! That Soul
deserves to dye, that doth not
love thee! In loving thee,
I live! Thy Love is better then
Life! My days will have an
end, my Life ere long will pass
from me! My Riches, my Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
my Wealth, my Health, my
Liberty, my Ease, my Friends,
my Acquaintance, they all will


<pb n="172" facs="tcp:107051:92"/>
ere long expire; but if I love
thee, that will remain with me
to Eternity! My love to thee
makes me thine, and makes thee
mine. By loving thee, I shew
that I am not mine own: Thou
hast made me for thy self, and if
I am not thine, I cannot be mine
own; for at that instant that I
would be mine own, I cease to
be thine! Thou art to me all
that heart can wish, or reason can
desire! Thou art my Light, my
Pillow, my Rest, my Sun, my
Meat, my Drink, my Glory,
my Joy; Thou hast given me
thy Son, and in giving him, hast
given me more then Ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
worlds! And if this be not
enough, thou art ready to give
me more; Shew me thy Love,


<pb n="173" facs="tcp:107051:92"/>
and it suffices me. Thou hast
wounded me with thy Love! I
will follow thee! O let me do
thy Will; Let me do that which
thou wilt, and not what I will.
Despise me not, forsake me not;
O do not go far from me! Draw
me after thee, and I shall run!
Wo is me, that I must dwell in
<hi>Mesheck,</hi> and have my habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the Tents of <hi>Kedar.</hi> O
leave me not to my self. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrate
both my Soul, and Body,
to thee; employ them, O Lord,
as it shall please thee best!</p>
               <p>O forget me not, and let me
never forget thee; let me rather
die a thousand deaths, then live
without thee! O let me love thee
so, that I may long to draw others
to thy Love! Let me be griev'd


<pb n="174" facs="tcp:107051:93"/>
when Men do not keep thy Law.
Let it go to my Heart to see thee
dishonour'd and affronted!
Thou threatnest me with Eternal
Flames, if the flames of thy Love
cannot warm me now. I am not
worthy to love thee, yet thou
art most worthy to be loved by
me! O let me sigh, let me pant,
let me breath after thee! O my
Life, let me live to thee! O my
Glory, let me be content to die
for thee! O my refuge, let me
ever run to thee! O thou Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Love, let me be always
mindful of thee! Let me em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
thee, let me resolve not to
let thee go, till thou hast brought
me to that place, where I shall

Withdraw mine heart from

what hurt my love to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

my Heart from thee! it
hath made thy Word a savour of
death unto death to me! It hath

nauseous, and irksom to me! It
hath made thy Laws tedious to

the Life, I am to live for ever.
It hath made me weary of thy

made me ashamed of Christ,

I would have it subordinate

I would not have it rule in me.
I would not have it justle out

I know, my dearest Lord! I

and O thou that hast loved me
so as to die for me, Grant me
that Charity, which is a necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
effect of my love to thee!</p>
               <p>Thou hast loved my neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
as well as my self! My Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus!


<pb n="178" facs="tcp:107051:95"/>
Thou hast died for him, as
well as for my self! Though I
must stand amazed at the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Mercy thou hast shewn to
me, yet the light of thy favour
hath shined upon my fellow-Christians
too! O let me love
them with a pure heart fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently!
Hereby shall all Men
know, that we are thy Disciples
if we love one another! O my
Lord! I am resolved to be thy
Disciple, and therefore will not
only love those that love me, but
even those that hate me! O make
me tender-hearted, and compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionate
to my neighbour! Make
me ready to forgive, ready to
bear with his Infirmities, ready
to relieve him, ready to assist
him, ready to succour him: O


<pb n="179" facs="tcp:107051:95"/>
let all clamour, and malice, and
hatred, and evil-speaking, and
censoriousness be put away from
me! Rid me of all guile and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisy,
and dishonesty! Let it
be known by my meek, and
humble, and charitable temper,
that the same mind is in me,
which was also in Christ Jesus!
In vain do I call my self thy Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower,
if I tread not in thy
steps, or do not render good for
evil, and shew all meekness unto
all men.</p>
               <p>When I am reviled, let me not
revile again! Let there not be
any root of bitterness in me! Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
from me base suspition!
Teach me to put a favourable
construction on other means acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and to overcome Evil with


<pb n="180" facs="tcp:107051:96"/>
Good. Mortify in me, the itch
of contradiction! Make me af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fable,
courteous, kind, gentle,
and let no provocation soure
that disposition in me! Make
me patient, and long-suffering,
peaceable, and easie to be intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
Give me a temper as may
make me rejoyce in the prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of others! Let all Pride, and
Envy die in me! Let me delight
in works of Mercy, in feeding
the Hungry, giving Drink to the
Thirsty, cloathing the Naked,
visiting the Sick, comforting the
Prisoners, counselling the Weak,
supporting the Feeble, directing
the Erroneous, reproving the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary,
guiding the Blind, using
hospitality to Strangers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:107051:96"/>
Make me circumspect in my
Speeches, that I offend not with
my Tongue! Give me presence
of Mind upon all occasions, that
I may not speak, or act rashly to
my neighbours prejudice! O let
thy Love be always before me,
that I may have compassion on
my fellow-servant! O let thy
Blood supple my Heart, that it
may melt at the sight of its
wants, and necessities! O let
that Word sound always in mine
Ears, That <hi>Though</hi> I <hi>speak with
the Tongue of Angels, and have no
Charity, it profits me nothing!</hi> I
shall see thy Charity in the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
of thy <hi>Supper!</hi> I shall see
what thou didst for me, and all
the world! I shall see what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies
thou didst endure


<pb n="182" facs="tcp:107051:97"/>
to procure our happiness! I shall
see how thou didst deny thy self
for our sakes. I shall see how
thou didst not count thine own
Life dear to save ours! I shall
see how gentle thou wast to thy
enemies, how thou pray'dst for
them that persecuted thee; how
thou didst bless them that did
curse thee! I shall see what pains
thou tookest, what anguish thou
enduredst to snatch us from dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
               <p>Oh let that charity prevail
with me! O let that Goodness
produce bowels of Mercy in me,
that as much as in me lies, I may
keep the unity of the Spirit in the
bound of Peace! Make me willing
to decede from mine own Right,
for Concords sake! O root out


<pb n="183" facs="tcp:107051:97"/>
that base selfishness which makes
me so careless of my neighbours
Good. O thou Eternal Truth,
thou hast promised to write thy
Laws in my Heart! O write this
Law of Love there with thine
own Blood, and make the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
so lasting, that nothing
may blot them out. O let me love
my self less, that I may love thee
and my neighbour more! O let
the fire of thy Love put out the
impure fire of my Lusts, and
Corruptions! O let that Fire pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify
my Soul from those inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
passions, and desires, which
too often endanger it. Thou art
the God that answerest by Fire.
Let me feel thy Fire, and the
force of it. Let it go through
my Soul, and scatter heat through


<pb n="184" facs="tcp:107051:98"/>
every part, that I may be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
and changed into Love;
Let me love thee vehemently,
ardently, superlatively, constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and my Neighbour chastely,
modestly, purely, sincerely, and
inviolably. Whatever thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niest
me, deny me not this Love;
Remember thy Word unto thy
Servant, in which thou hast caus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me to hope; Thou hast said
I will give unto him that
is a Thirst, of the water of
Life freely. O give me this
Love, else I faint. O spare me a
little that I may recover strength,
before I go hence and be seen no
more. O thou spirit of Love,
blow upon me, and these dry
bones shall live. O Jesu! Come
and live in me, and if thou, who


<pb n="185" facs="tcp:107051:98"/>
art Love and Charity it self, live
in me, I shall love all that thou
wouldst have me love, and be a

and a Priest for ever! Do I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
this, and scruple fighting

and am I afraid of the worlds
frowns? Do I believe this and
am I ashamed of the severities,

I mistrust thee, when I see thee
use the same mortifications thou

see his King use the same Pains,
Habit, and hard fare, which the

<pb n="197" facs="tcp:107051:104"/>
what courage doth it infuse into

Pleasures, that enmity to

indignation against brutish De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights,
that Sincerity, that Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
thou requirest of me, thou

perform thy self, so that thou

if I die with thee, I shall live

thee! Put thine Arms under me;
and I will not do mine own Will.

guide, and the encourager?
Thou canst not deceive me. Thou
canst not delude me. It must be

are possible to him that believes.
I'll chuse some hardship here, so

glory in any thing, save in the
Cross of Christ, and him Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.
O that the World were
Crucified to me, and I unto the
World! I will rejoice in thy
love, my Dearest Lord! I have
seen thy Power, Wisdom and
Goodness! I see what pains thou
takest with my Soul, to make it
happy, to drive away the night of
ignorance from it, and to make
me know, there is no true bliss,


<pb n="210" facs="tcp:107051:111"/>
no true comfort, but in Thee!
Thou teachest me to overcome
my Spiritual Enemies; Blessed
be the Lord my strength, which
teaches my hands to War, and
my Fingers to fight, my Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and my Fortress, my high
Tower and my Deliverer, my
Shield, and in whom I trust! Thou
preventest me with thy Grace;
Thou givest me the earnest of
Eternal Glory, by thy Spirit I
am sealed unto the day of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption!
Thou art my past,
my present, and my future good!
<hi>Let the People praise thee, O God,
Let all the People praise thee!</hi> O
that all Men might know and
love Thee! O that all Mankind
might feel thy Power, and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry!
O thou who art the chiefest


<pb n="211" facs="tcp:107051:111"/>
among Ten thousand, the Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
love Thee; and among
these, I the unworthiest of thy
Servants presume to love thy
Name! Thou hast made me to
walk upon mine high places, and
in the bitterness of my Soul hast
refresh'd my Spirit; Thou hast
pardoned I hope all my Sins, and
blotted out mine Iniquities as a
thick Cloud. I expect thou
shouldst forgive me much, and
therefore sure I must love Thee
much! Thou hast born my Grief,
and carried my Sorrows, thy
Torments have given me ease,
thy Reproaches have procured
my Glory, and thy Misery is the
cause of all my happiness.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="212" facs="tcp:107051:112"/>
Therefore I will put on the
Lord <hi>Jesus Christ!</hi> Thou shalt
be my Garment, my Crown, my
Diadem. I will sing unto thee
as long as I live. I will sing
praise unto my God, while I
have my being. My Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Thee shall be sweet; I
will be glad in the Lord! O my
Lord! I rejoice to hear that every
knee bows unto Thee! I would
have all the World fall down
before Thee, and worship Thee!
I rejoice in all the good things,
that thou possessest, not that I
expect thou shouldst make me
Partaker of all, but because they
are in Thee, and they are thine,
and thou dost dispense them to
thy Creatures according to thy
pleasure</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="213" facs="tcp:107051:112"/>
I rejoice, O Lord in all the
glorious Gifts thou hast conferred
on the Head of the Church, The
Man <hi>Christ Jesus.</hi> I rejoice in
all the Mercies, thou hast be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
on the blessed Angels, in
that Purity and Innocence, in that
Brightness and Splendor, in that
Bliss and Felicity, they are
crown'd withal, in their care of
thy People, in their Ministerial
Offices to those that shall be
Heirs of Salvation. I rejoice in
all the Graces, Thou hast dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensed
to thy Holy Apostles, in
their Miraculous healing of the
Sick, in their Powerful Preaching,
whereby the World was conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
in their Knowledge, and Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination,
in their Zeal and Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
in their Patience, and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility


<pb n="214" facs="tcp:107051:113"/>
in their Watchfulness
and heavenly mindedness, for in
all these I see thy mighty Arm,
and thy strong Hand, and the
light of thy Countenance, and
all that they have done, and said,
is written for my Learning.</p>
               <p>I rejoice in all the Blessings,
thy Saints enjoy, in thy calling
them to thy marvellous Light,
in thy adorning their Souls with
so many Resplendent Vertues, in
thy honouring of them with the
lofty Titles of Children, and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
and Friends, and Kings,
and Priests, in thy visiting of
them with thy Salvation, in thy
assisting of them with thy Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
thy Spirit, and thy Influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in their Dangers and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities,
in thy Helping their


<pb n="215" facs="tcp:107051:113"/>
Infirmities, in thy Purifying of
their Souls, in thy enlivening
their Spirits, that they may not
be ashamed of the Gospel of
<hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> in thy keeping of
them from all Evil, in thy res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuing
of them from Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
in thy giving them a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
Death, and Promise of a Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Resurrection. I rejoice in
all thy Mercies to Poor Sinners,
in thy calling of them, to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
in thy entreating, admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing,
and beseeching of them to
be reconciled to God, in thy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing
of them in thy Patience,
and Long-suffering toward them,
in thy waiting for their Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
in thy adjuring of them
by Bowels of Mercy, by the
Blood of <hi>Jesus,</hi> by the Wounds


<pb n="216" facs="tcp:107051:114"/>
of a Crucified Redeemer, by the
sweetest Calls, and by the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
motives to Seriousness, and
Holiness, in thy receiving the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent,
in thy forgetting all their
Unkindnesses, and forgiving the
Affronts, they have offered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Thee, in thy remembring their
Sins no more, and drowning
them in the depth of the Sea,
even in the Blood of the Lamb,
which was slain from the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of the World.</p>
               <p>I rejoice in all thy loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
to thy Church, in thy gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
her thy Word, thy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
thy Sacraments, in thy
making her thy Bride, thy Spouse,
and thy Favourite, in thy Ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> to be her
Head, her Husband, and her


<pb n="217" facs="tcp:107051:114"/>
Protector, and Nursing-Father.</p>
               <p>O Jesu! I rejoyce in thy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation,
in the great Mystery
of Godliness, God manifested in
the Flesh, justified in the Spirit,
seen of Angels, Preach'd in the
World, Believ'd on by the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,
receiv'd up into Glory. I
have reason to rejoyce in thy
hypostatick Union, in thy being
the Prince of Men, and Angels,
and in that all the treasures of
Wisdom and Knowledge are in
thee! I rejoyce in thy sending
the Comforter into the world;
in thy Promises, in thy Offers, in
thy Providences, in the Provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thou hast made for our Souls,
and Bodies.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="218" facs="tcp:107051:115"/>
O give me a thankful Heart
for my right shape, for my
Health and Strength, and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
advantages; O what a
mercy is it, that thou hast caused
me to be born in the Light, in
the true Religion, in a Religion
free from notorious Errours, and
Superstitions! How am I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
to thee, that thou hast
kept me from so many opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
of sinning against thee,
from abundance of temptations,
from innumerable occasions of
evil! How many have been
snatcht away by sudden death;
and I am alive yet! How many
have been denyed the grace of
Repentance, which thou still of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferest
to me! That I have a heart
to pray and praise thy Name,


<pb n="219" facs="tcp:107051:115"/>
What a mighty token of thy
Love is this! Let Heaven and
Earth praise the Lord; Let all
the Angels in Heaven praise him.
Let every thing that hath breath
praise the Lord, praise thou the
Lord O my Soul!</p>
               <p>I remember, O Lord, how
when I have gone through the
water, thou hast been with me;
when I have passed through the
Fire, thou hast commanded the
Flames not to kindle upon me!
I remember, when for a small
moment, thou hast hid thy Face
from me; How with everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
kindnesses thou hast visited
me again! O how often hast thou
deliver'd me from the nethermost
Hell! When I have been ready
to sink in the mire, thou hast pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led


<pb n="220" facs="tcp:107051:116"/>
me out of the horrible pit,
cut of the miry Clay, and set my
feet upon a Rock, and establish'd
my goings! When the snares of
death have incompassed me, and
the pains of Hell laid hold on me,
thou hast deliver'd my Soul from
Death, mine Eyes from Tears,
and my Feet from falling. I will
walk before the Lord in the Land
of the Living; what reward shall
I render unto thee for all thy
benefits! How loth hast thou
been to behold my ruine! How
hast thou call'd after me, <hi>Have
mercy on thy self!</hi> With what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions
hast thou follow'd me!
What checks of Conscience hast
thou given me! O my Lord!
Thou shalt have all the Glory.
Thou art worthy to receive


<pb n="221" facs="tcp:107051:116"/>
Blessing, and Honour, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
and Dominion! How pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
are thy Mercies! How rich
thy Loving kindnesses! To do
so much for dust and ashes, for a
Worm, for a Grashopper, for a
Creature that hath abused thee,
and rebell'd against thee; O
what goodness is this! My un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
is not big enough to
comprehend it. I'll acknowledge
thee for my God, I'll own thee
for my Redeemer; Thou shalt
be my King, my Master, my So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign
Lord! I will consecrate
all my Labours, all my Services,
all I have, and all I am to thy
Glory! O what a favour is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness
of Sin, which I trust I
have received this day!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="222" facs="tcp:107051:117"/>
Think O my Soul, what a
bondage thou art deliver'd from!
Think what slavery thou art
freed from! Now thou art at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
now thou mayst serve
God chearfully; now thou mayst
freely go on from Virtue to Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.
This is a day of Thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving;
this is a day of glad ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings;
this is a day which ought
to be remembred; O my Jesus!
Thou hast this day visited the
Earth, and watered it! Thou
hast made it rich with thy show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
thy Grace hath dropp'd upon
me this day, like the Rain on the
mowen Grass! O order my steps
according to thy Word for the
future! Let me see thee in every
Mercy! Teach me to admire
thee in every Blessing! Let no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing


<pb n="223" facs="tcp:107051:117"/>
seduce my Heart from thee!
When any afflictions come upon
me, let me receive them with
Thanks and Submission! When
I stumble, do thou support me;
when I fall, do thou raise me;
when I go astray, do thou seek
me; when I err, do thou direct
me; When I slacken in thy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
do thou strengthen me!
Keep the door of my Senses, that
no impure thing may enter there!
Let my Heart be thy Temple!
Teach me to enquire daily, what
progress I make in thy way; Let
thy Word be a lanthorn to my
Feet, and a Light unto my
paths! Let no evil company dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
me! Let thy Providence
direct me to persons that love


<pb n="224" facs="tcp:107051:118"/>
thy Law, and in these excellent
ones, let all my Delight and
Comfort be!</p>
               <p>O my Lord, my Life is hid in
thee! But when thy Glory shall
appear, I shall be like thee!
Speak Lord, for thy Servant
hears! Let none of thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements
be hence-forward
grievous to me! Open thy hand
and feed my Soul! When I am
tempted, lay no more upon me,
then I am able to bear! Give me
courage to strive to enter in at
the strait Gate! Let me ever
look at the things which are
not seen, for the things which
are seen are Temporal, but the
things which are not seen, are
Eternal! Thy Kingdom, Lord,
is not in Meat and Drink, but


<pb n="225" facs="tcp:107051:118"/>
in Peace, and Joy in the Holy
Ghost; Give me a taste of it!
Let Eternity be always in my
mind! Into thy hands I do
commend my Spirit, my Body,
and all the concerns of my Life!
Let thy Grace come down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me plentifully! Let me not
do thy Will negligently! Let
me live in the thoughts of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
life, and let those Thoughts
encourage me to follow after,
that I may apprehend that,
for which I am also apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of Christ Jesus! O hear me!
O Answer me! O pity me! O
relieve me! O come in! O suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
me, thou that art the God
of my Salvation, and my Tongue
shall talk of thy Righteousness,
all the day long! Let all those,


<pb n="226" facs="tcp:107051:119"/>
that seek thee rejoyce, and be
glad in thee, and let such as
love thy Salvation, say continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
Let God be magnified! I
am poor and needy, make haste
unto me, O God! thou art my
Help, and my Deliverer: O
Lord, make no tarrying, <hi>Amen,
Amen.</hi>
