            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

WAYS and MEANS
OF
Supplying the War.</head>
            <p>IN the courſe of this War, we are
engag'd in with <hi>France,</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſeems more to have hurt
our affairs, than an Opinion,
which from year to year has been
entertain'd among ſome People of
Authority, That the War could not
laſt; which they were brought into,
by the vanity, natural to our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
of over-rating our own ſtrength,
and undervaluing that of our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:51665:4"/>
Whoever reflects upon the <hi>Ways
and Means,</hi> by which we have all
along ſupplied the King, will plainly
ſee how much this Opinion has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd
with the People in general.</p>
            <p>Raiſing Money by Land Taxes,
Fonds of Intereſt, Polls, doubling
the Exciſe, charging Tonnage, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
new Cuſtoms, and anticipating
the old ones, may be proper Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients
to anſwer a ſingle and a ſhort
Neceſſity, but, perhaps, they will
hardly appear to be the proper <hi>Ways
and Means</hi> to carry on a great, and
a long War.</p>
            <p>At the beginning of the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy,
<hi>France</hi> ſeem'd to take in all
its Sails, in expectation of a Storm,
and in a manner ſate ſtill, while we
took <hi>Mentz</hi> and <hi>Bon.</hi> This Succeſs,
and the great Names, and Mighty
Kingdoms and States, that were Liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in this Quarrel, made us flatter
our ſelves with Extravagant hopes;
The moſt Modeſt did believe the King
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51665:4"/>
of <hi>France</hi> might be eaſily reduced to
the ſtate he was left in by the <hi>Pyre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean</hi>
Treaty: But the more general
Opinion was, That he would be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
to our own Terms.</p>
            <p>But ſuch did not conſider, that
there is hardly any inſtance to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in Story of a Mighty Empire
over-run, that was in the full poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
of its Military Virtue. In
ſuch an entire poſſeſſion of the Art
of War were the <hi>Romans</hi> during the
ſecond <hi>Punic</hi> War; the whole Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
were train'd up to Arms, and
continual Action had bred up and
inſtructed many famous Captains, ſo
that they were not to be broken by
the many Victories <hi>Hannibal</hi> obtain'd,
even in the heart of <hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in ſuch a Warlike poſture
was the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, when <hi>Tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain</hi>
came into <hi>Aſia,</hi> who in the
Battel, fought in the Year 1397, took
<hi>Bajazet</hi> Priſoner, and ſlew moſt of
his Army; yet that People, bred to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51665:5"/>
War under three Martial Kings, were
ſo far from being ſubdu'd, that in
fifty three Years after, beſides many
other acquiſitions, they were able to
Conquer all the remains of the <hi>Greek</hi>
Empire.</p>
            <p>Great Dominions are to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
with hopes of ſucceſs then
only, when either their own bulk
makes them unweildy, or when
Wealth has deprav'd their Manners,
or when long Peace has made them
forget their Military Skill and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue;
and at ſuch ſeaſons have the
great Monarchies of the World been
Invaded and Conquer'd, not by Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior
Virtue in others, but for want
of Virtue in themſelves.</p>
            <p>It is not from hence concluded,
that leſſer Nations are not to make
War with ſtrong and Victorious Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
or that we in <hi>England</hi> ſhould
not with the laſt drop of Blood de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
this almoſt only ſpot of ground,
which ſeems remaining in the World
to Public Liberty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:51665:5"/>
But from theſe Inſtances, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
others in Hiſtory, it may be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gu'd,
that we cannot preſently, and
with eaſe, pull down ſo Mighty an
Empire as <hi>France;</hi> and that much
Time, Blood, and Treaſure, muſt,
perhaps, be ſpent, before we can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
it to ſuch Terms of Peace, as
may be Safe and Honourable for the
Confederates.</p>
            <p>And ſince there ſeem very many,
who think the buſineſs of this War
ſo eaſie, and who wonder the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates
have done no more, it may
not be improper to take a ſhort view
of the Affairs of <hi>France,</hi> in order to
make it appear, what a powerful Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
we have to deal with.</p>
            <p>That Kingdom has been growing,
for theſe two hundred and ſeventy
years, by ſlow degrees, to the height
we now ſee it at; and from the time
of <hi>Charles</hi> the Seventh, to the Reign
of <hi>Francis</hi> the Second, there were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
upon the Throne Martial and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51665:6"/>
Active Princes, in perpetual War,
and forming their People to Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.</p>
            <p>And if in the little Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths
of <hi>Greece,</hi> wherever there
happen'd to be an extraordinary
Man, that Man did make his City
ſtrong and powerful for a long time
after; much more muſt a Succeſſion
of ſix Kings, all Men of Counſel and
Action, give ſtrength and power to
ſuch a Kingdom as <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis true, that from the time of
<hi>Francis</hi> the Second, to the Peace of
<hi>Vervins,</hi> which was about forty Years,
the Nation was miſerably torn by a
long and cruel Civil War; but, as
there are certain Diſeaſes, which,
when overcome, diſpoſe the Body to
a better ſtate of health for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
ſo, perhaps, it may be made
appear, that even this Civil War, in
its Conſequences, has contributed to
the preſent Power of that Monarchy,
by pulling down the three chief ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51665:6"/>
that ſtood in the way of its
Greatneſs; which were, the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Intereſt, <hi>Spain,</hi> and the old No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>The Maſſacre of <hi>Paris</hi> gave the
Proteſtant Intereſt in that Nation
ſuch a wound, as it has never ſince
been able to recover.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Philip</hi> the Second, to procure
the Crown of <hi>France</hi> for the Infanta,
did furniſh ſuch vaſt Sums for the
Maintenance of the League, as have
ever ſince kept <hi>Spain</hi> low.</p>
            <p>And the Houſes of <hi>Lorrain, Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morancy,</hi>
and <hi>Chaſtillon,</hi> were in a
manner extinguiſh'd in that War;
and the reſt of the great Families ſo
ruin'd by it, that they are now no
more than the Trappings and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments
of the Tyranny, which
were in times paſt ſo ſtrong a part
of the Conſtitution.</p>
            <p>From the Peace of <hi>Vervins, Harry</hi>
the Fourth employ'd his care in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing
the Calamities of that Civil
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:51665:7"/>
War, and chiefly he ſet himſelf to
bring the Treaſury of his Kingdom
into ſome order; in which he was
aſſiſted by the Duke of <hi>Sully,</hi> a fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
Man, who, by natural Wiſdom
and meer Honeſty, brought the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue
out of infinite Debts into ſuch
a flouriſhing condition, that, when
the <hi>French</hi> were forming their great
deſigns againſt the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi>
in 1610, they had ready four or five
years Proviſion for a War, that was
likely to be the greateſt their Nation
had ever undertaken.</p>
            <p>But the foundations of the preſent
Greatneſs of that Monarchy, were
laid by Cardinal <hi>Richelieu;</hi> he firſt
introduc'd that exact Method which
appears in all their Affairs, that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſie
and ſteadineſs which is in their
Councils, and that intire Obedience
which all ſubordinate degrees pay to
their Superiors; and, by exacting it
ſeverely, he firſt accuſtom'd the
<hi>French</hi> to that Zeal, Diligence, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:51665:7"/>
Honeſty, to their Maſter, which
they ſhow in all Public buſineſs.</p>
            <p>Cardinal <hi>Mazarin</hi> was bred up in
his School; a Man, perhaps, not
quite ſo deep, but of infinite Subtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and very fit for the Intrigues of
the Cabinet, in a Minority, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Regency of a Queen Mother.
What the Duke of <hi>Sully</hi> but began,
<hi>Colbert</hi> brought to perfection in the
Public Revenue; and both he and
<hi>Louvoy,</hi> were mighty Encouragers of
the Trade and Manufactures of the
Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>France,</hi> for a long tract of
time, has had great Princes on the
Throne; or, which is as good, able
Men in the Miniſtry; and all the
while they have been enlarging their
Dominions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Spain,</hi> formerly their Rival King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
they have reduc'd to a low
condition; Arts and Sciences,
Trade and Manufactures, are much
improv'd among them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:51665:8"/>
The Art of War they have
brought to a height and perfection
never known in <hi>Greece,</hi> or among
the <hi>Romans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Long Action has form'd them ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
fit Generals, Experienc'd Officers,
and a number of good Troops.</p>
            <p>They are Skilful in Encampments,
they order a Battel well; and no
People contrive better for the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
of an Army.</p>
            <p>Their Diſcipline is good and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere,
and all Nations muſt yield to
them in the knowledge of Attacking
and Defending places.</p>
            <p>And by Art and Induſtry, they
ſeem to have overcome Nature and
Situation, in making themſelves ſo
powerful at Sea, with but few con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
Ports, and but little Trade,
in proportion to their Neighbours.</p>
            <p>Their preſent King is undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a Perſon of great Abilities, Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and Conduct; he is well ſerv'd
in every part of his Government;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51665:8"/>
his Revenue is skillfully brought in,
and frugally laid out; no Prince has
ſo quick and certain Intelligence;
and he has wrought into his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts
a conſiderable Party in every
State and Kingdom in <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We all know too well, what large
footing he has of late years got
round about him, towards <hi>Spain,</hi> in
<hi>Italy,</hi> near the <hi>Swiſs</hi> Cantons, and in
<hi>Germany,</hi> of both ſides the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and
in the Low Countries. Whoever
carefully weighs theſe things, and
duly conſiders the Strength and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy
of that Kingdom, will hardly
think the Confederates, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
in a condition to give the Law,
or able as yet to drive <hi>France</hi> to ſuch
a Peace, as may be now Honourable,
and Safe hereafter.</p>
            <p>They, who believe a Peace ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
and near, ground their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
upon the Poverty this long War
muſt have brought upon <hi>France:</hi>
And no doubt, the Subjects there

are reduc'd to exceſſive want, by the
Univerſal ſtop that is upon Trade,
by the Dearth two unſeaſonable
years has occaſion'd, and by main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining,
for ſix years, a great Fleet,
and ſuch numerous Land Forces.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>French</hi> ſeem to pay them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
for all their Home Miſeries,
with their Fame abroad, the Majeſty
of their Empire, Splendor of their
Court, Greatneſs of their Monarch,
and the noiſe of his Victories; like a
Beaſt, that goes merrily with a heavy
Burthen, pleas'd with his fine Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and the Bells that jingle about
him.</p>
            <p>For thoſe vain appearances are, to
that People, in the ſtead of Eaſe,
Plenty, and all the other Goods of
Life; tho' they truly tend but to
make their Slavery more laſting.</p>
            <p>Therefore while their King is thus
Succeſsful in his Arms, we have ſmall
reaſon to think the Wants and Cries
of his Country will conſtrain him to
end the War.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:51665:9"/>
But ſuppoſe him in ſuch ſtreights,
as that he willingly will liſten to a
Peace; can we modeſtly believe him
in ſo low a condition, as that the
Confederates may at preſent have
ſuch a one as will be ſecure and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</p>
            <p>Is he yet ſo diſtreſſed by the War,
as to be contented things may be
put upon ſuch a foot of Equality,
that hereafter he may be compell'd
to obſerve his Articles? for without
this, any Peace we can make will be
but unſound and precarious.</p>
            <p>Perhaps he may ſubmit to give up
<hi>Lorrain, Philipsburg,</hi> and <hi>Strasburg,</hi>
and his late Conqueſts in <hi>Savoy, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talonia,</hi>
and <hi>Flanders;</hi> The Pope,
<hi>Venetians,</hi> and the two <hi>Northern</hi>
Crowns, ſhall be Mediators, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Warrantees of the Treaty.
The Confederacy ſhall ſtill ſubſiſt,
and upon ſtricter terms of Union:
But, when we have bound <hi>Sampſon</hi>
with theſe new Ropes, may he not,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:51665:10"/>
when he pleaſes, break them from
off his Arms like a Thread?</p>
            <p>Indeed, we might promiſe our
ſelves that a Peace would be good
and durable, if we were enough Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior
in the War, to make him Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render
thoſe ſtrong places, with
which, on every ſide, he ſeems to
Bridle this part of the World.</p>
            <p>Or, if he were ſo diſtreſs'd, as, for
a Peace, to deprive himſelf of his
Fleet, to which the <hi>Romans</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd
<hi>Carthage,</hi> and, afterwards, King
<hi>Antiochus,</hi> then we in <hi>England</hi> might
promiſe our ſelves future Safety.</p>
            <p>But, while his Naval ſtrength is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broken;
while he has that Chain of
Fortified Towns upon the <hi>Rhine;</hi>
and that formidable Barrier in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;</hi>
while on the ſide of <hi>Spain, Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
and <hi>Switzerland,</hi> he is left in ſuch
a condition to Invade, and ſo forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
againſt Invaſion, we may make
a Peace that ſhall give us preſent eaſe,
and put off the Evil day for a time,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:51665:10"/>
but we cannot pretend to have ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd
our Liberties, or defeated his
deſigns of Univerſal Monarchy.</p>
            <p>Whoever carefully examines thoſe
general Treaties of Peace the <hi>French</hi>
of late years have concluded with
the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and their other
Oppoſites, from that of <hi>Vervin</hi>'s, to
that of <hi>Nimmeghen,</hi> will find they
have had no effect, but to give <hi>France</hi>
a legal Title to what it poſſeſt before
by Conqueſt, or to affort it time to
repair the Calamities of War, and
to gather Strength for new and
greater Undertakings.</p>
            <p>We took this War in hand to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert
the Liberties of <hi>Europe,</hi> and to
encourage us to carry it on, we
have Examples, ancient and modern,
of Nations that have reſiſted great
Monarchies, and who have at laſt
worked out their Freedom by Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
Wiſdom, and Courage.</p>
            <p>In Defence of their Laws and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
the <hi>Low-Countreys</hi> maintained
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:51665:11"/>
a War with <hi>Spain</hi> from 1566 to
1648, which ended in the Peace of
<hi>Munſter,</hi> and in that Struggle they
fixed their Government.</p>
            <p>Great Monarchies do eaſily over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run
and ſwallow up the leſſer Tiran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
and Principalities that are round
about them; but they find much
harder Work, and another ſort of
Oppoſition, when they come to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade
Common-wealths, or mix'd Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments,
where the People have
an Intereſt in the Laws.</p>
            <p>Under Tirannies, where the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
only contend for the Choice of
a <hi>Maſter,</hi> the Diſpute is ſeldom real
and haerty; but, in free Countreys,
where the People fight for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and their own proper Wealth
and Security, they are in earneſt, and
defend themſelves accordingly. The
<hi>Perſians</hi> very eaſily ſubdued the
neighbouring Monarchies that made
up their large Empire; but when they
came to invade the <hi>Grecians,</hi> a free
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:51665:11"/>
People, we ſee how their numerous
Armies, and great Navies were at laſt
defeated.</p>
            <p>That War was carried on by
Confederates, of which the chief
were the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> and the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians;</hi>
one a Kingly Government li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
by Laws, the other a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth;
it laſted two and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
years, reckoning from the Battel
of <hi>Marathon,</hi> to that Victory gain'd
by <hi>Cimon,</hi> which forced the <hi>Perſians</hi>
to ſue for Peace.</p>
            <p>And it may not be amiſs to take
notice, how the <hi>Athenians</hi> laid the
whole ſtreſs of this War upon their
Naval force, purſuant to the <hi>Oracle,</hi>
which told them they ſhould be ſafe
within their Walls of Wood, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<hi>Athens</hi> it ſelf defenceleſs, that
their Fleet might be the ſtronger.</p>
            <p>Many more Inſtances may be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
of great things perform'd in the
defence of Liberty; but then they
have been done, by Men who had
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:51665:12"/>
laid aſide their Luxury, Corruption,
Self-ends, and private Ambition, and
who had devoted themſelves intirely
to the Common Good.</p>
            <p>If therefore we hope to get out of
this War with Honour, and, at laſt,
make a ſafe and durable Peace, we
muſt ſhow more than ordinary Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
and Reſolution; we muſt bear
patiently the Public burthens; but
chiefly, we muſt not give our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
any room to believe, either by
our Actions or Councils, that we
ſhrink and give back, as if we thought
the buſineſs too weighty for us.</p>
            <p>Many things may happen to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
this patience, which would put
us in the Power of treating upon
more equal terms.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>France</hi> is infirm, and
in years; if he ſhould fail, while the
War is on foot, his People, perhaps,
may take that time to ſhake off their
Oppreſſion; and his Son may not be
able to carry on the great Machine
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:51665:12"/>
of that Government, with the ſame
Steadineſs, Conduct, and Authority.
Or, the Dauphin may dye, which
would give the Princes of the Blood
the proſpect of a Minority, always
fatal, and the occaſion of diſorders
in that Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Beſides, notwithſtanding the ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
health and vigour of that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
it has within it dangerous
Diſtempers, of which the ſymptoms
appear not in this Proſperity of their
affairs, but would be ſeen in any
Public calamity; ſuch as the loſs of
a Battel, or a total defeat at Sea,
which in the courſe of the War may
happen.</p>
            <p>If <hi>France</hi> ſhould receive any ſhock
or wound of that kind, the ill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
bred by Oppreſſion, and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary
Power, would break out,
and ſhew themſelves, in every part
of the Conſtitution.</p>
            <p>Theſe, or any other accidents
that might ſtir up Civil Commotions
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:51665:13"/>
in that Kingdom, would render it
uncapable of a Foreign War, and
conſequently, procure us more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous
Conditions of Peace.</p>
            <p>But the moſt proper Seaſon to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
a Peace with the <hi>French,</hi> in all
appearance, will be when they are
Impoveriſh'd, and exhauſted of that
Money by which they have ſo much
prevailed, and when that ſinew of
War begins to ſlacken.</p>
            <p>For there is a degree of Expence,
which no Nation can exceed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
utter ruin, and the Public may
become a Bankrupt as well as a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Perſon.</p>
            <p>And ſince War is grown ſo expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive,
and Trade is become ſo extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and ſince Luxury has ſo much
obtain'd in the World, no Nation
can ſubſiſt of it ſelf without Helps
and Aids from other places; ſo that
the Wealth of a Country now is the
Ballance, which ariſes from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
with other places, of its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
or Artificial Product.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:51665:13"/>
The Natural Product are the
Fruits of the Earth; the Artificial
are the Manufactures.</p>
            <p>That part of Trade which conſiſts
in buying Commodities in one Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and ſelling them in another, is
very little the Commerce of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this Ballance accrues, either
from Money <hi>in ſpecie,</hi> brought home,
or Foreign Commodities, or Credit,
which one Country has upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>The Prince's Revenue, is a due
proportion and ſhare out of this Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance.</p>
            <p>Whatever Nation is at a greater
expence than this Ballance admits of,
will as ſurely be ruin'd in time, as a
private Perſon muſt be, who every
year ſpends more than the Income
of his Eſtate.</p>
            <p>And that Prince, who gathers
more than this Ballance will natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
afford, muſt as certainly bring
ruin upon his Country, becauſe he
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:51665:14"/>
lives upon the quick Stock of his
People.</p>
            <p>The ordinary Publick Revenue of
<hi>France</hi> was, before this War, year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
about one hundred and fifty
Millions of Livres, which reduc'd to
our Money, is about twelve Millions
Sterling.</p>
            <p>We all know how hardly this
great Sum was extorted from the
People, but they were enabled to
pay it by the Ballance that aroſe to
them from the vent of their Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
and Manufactures.</p>
            <p>Their moſt Staple Trade was
Wine, Oyl, Salt, Linnen, and Paper,
their Manufactures are innumerable;
and a vaſt profit they did conſtantly
make by the reſort of ſtrangers to
their Country, and likewiſe by fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing
all <hi>Europe</hi> with their Fineries
and Vanities.</p>
            <p>The ordinary Revenue muſt needs
be much impair'd by the effects of
the War; but this we may ſuppoſe,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51665:14"/>
is made up to the King by extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Means. For we cannot think
he maintains his Goverment, Fleet,
and Armies, at a leſs Expence than
Twelve Millions yearly.</p>
            <p>Now how this Expence can be
long continued by the <hi>French,</hi> is
hardly imaginable, when there is
ſuch an Interruption upon their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce,
and ſo little vent for their
Commodities and Manufactures.</p>
            <p>They are cut off by this War from
almoſt all their profitable Trade, their
Poor are unimploy'd, and the Growth
of their Country ſticks upon their
hands, and their Body Politick, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at a continual Expence of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
without the uſual Supplies and
Reliefs, muſt fall into Faintneſs, and
Decay in all its Members. The
Ballance ariſing from Trade being
wanting, which ſhould maintain
King and People, there muſt inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
follow, at firſt private Want,
and then publick Poverty. And if
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:51665:15"/>
this Interruption of their Commerce
be yet more ſtrictly purſued, it will
bring a Ruin upon them, not to be
avoided by all their Oeconomy, Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and Policy.</p>
            <p>We have maintain'd this War ſix
years, and may hold it out much
longer, if every part of the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy
would exert all its Natural
Force, and apply it uſefully to the
common Buſineſs.</p>
            <p>But then the Emperor muſt not be
contending for Dominion at Home,
while he is fighting for Liberty A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad.
He muſt give the Princes of
the Empire no Jealouſie that he has
any Deſigns upon their Freedoms.
He muſt not let the Prieſts divert his
his Arms upon the <hi>Turks,</hi> of which
the true meaning is only the Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the Proteſtants in <hi>Hungary.</hi>
A good Peace on that ſide would
give new Life to the Confederate Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:51665:15"/>
A little more publick Spirit and
Vigor would be neceſſary in the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi>
Councels, in which Kingdom
there is great Power and Wealth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining,
if it were rightly applied
and well ordered.</p>
            <p>The proper and natural Strength
of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> is at Sea.
The Walls of Wood are our beſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
and the more we rely upon,
and improve that Strength, the more
we ſhall break the Meaſures of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>England</hi> is the main Pillar of
the Confederacy; our Riches ſupply
it; our Fleet and the Goodneſs of
our Troops, are its chief Force and
Reputation; all depend upon the
Councels we take; if we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing,
or unable to ſupport the
War, a Peace will be concluded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the beſt Terms that can be
had.</p>
            <p>So that the whole wil reſult in this,
how far we in <hi>England,</hi> are able to
maintain ſuch a long War with
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:51665:16"/>
               <hi>France,</hi> as may procure us a Peace
that ſhall be equal and laſting.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, a long War is but a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
Proſpect to a Luxurious
People, fearful of Slavery, and yet
unwilling to pay the Price of Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
which no Nation hardly ever
obtained, but at a great Expence of
Blood and Treaſure.</p>
            <p>Whenever this War ceaſes, it will
not be for want of mutual Hatred in
the oppoſite Parties, nor for want of
Men to fight the Quarrel, but that
ſide muſt firſt give out where Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
is firſt failing.</p>
            <p>If we in <hi>England</hi> can put our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
into ſuch a Poſture, as to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to hold out in our Expence lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
than <hi>France,</hi> we ſhall be in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
to give the Peace; but if o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe,
we muſt be contented to
receive it.</p>
            <p>For War is quite changed from
what it was in the time of our Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers;
when, in a haſty Expedition,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:51665:16"/>
and a pitch'd Field, the Matter was
decided by Courage; but now the
whole Art of War is in a manner
reduced to Money; and now adays
that Prince, who can beſt find Money
to feed, cloath, and pay his Army,
not he that has the moſt valiant
Troops, is ſureſt of Succeſs and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt.</p>
            <p>So that the preſent Buſineſs <hi>England</hi>
is engaged in, will chiefly depend
upon the well contriving and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Ways and Means,</hi> by which
the Government is to be maintained,
and making the publick Charge eaſie
and ſupportable.</p>
            <p>By what has been ſaid before, it
may perhaps appear, that the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of Trade has made this War
very heavy upon the People of <hi>France,</hi>
from which naturally follows, that a
careful and vigorous Protection of
our own Trade, will make all pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Burthens lighter and eaſier to
us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:51665:17"/>
Trade, as it is now become the
Strength of the Kingdom, by the
Supply it breeds of Seamen, ſo it is
the living Fountain from whence
we draw all our Nouriſhment; it
diſperſes that Blood and Spirits
through all the Members, by which
the Body Politick ſubſiſts.</p>
            <p>The Price of Land, Value of Rents,
and our Commodities and Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
riſe and fall, as it goes well or
ill with our Foreign Trade.</p>
            <p>'Tis not enough to have great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation,
and great Importation, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
we are Gainers upon the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance;
which the Nation cannot be
at the foot of the Accompt, while
there are very great Loſſes at Sea.</p>
            <p>For the Profit of Trade is not the
Advantage the Merchant makes at
Home, but what the whole Nation
gets clear and Nett, upon the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
in Exchange with other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys
of its Commodities and Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:51665:17"/>
So that if we can protect our
Trade to that degree as to be Gainers
by the General Ballance, the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
and Length of the War will
not ſo much affect us; for Trade,
well ſecured, will bring in that
Wealth by which it may be fed and
maintained.</p>
            <p>To ſupport a long War, the Taxes
ſhould be ſo contriv'd, as that they
may lye equally upon the Nation;
and when they are equally laid, they
will in Conſequence be eaſier, and
longer, and more patiently ſuffered.
For he that is to carry a great Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,
ſhould not reaſonably be put
to bear it upon one Arm, and that
extended at length; but it ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to be placed upon his Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
ſo that every Limb may bear
its due proportion of the Weight.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Ways and Means</hi> to ſupply
the Government, in this War, ſhould
be ſuch, as may not too highly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Trade, upon the Proſperity of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:51665:18"/>
which depends, in ſo great a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
the Welfare of the Nation.</p>
            <p>What we give ſhould be as free
as poſſible from the Load of paying
Intereſt-Money, which eats upon the
Publick, as it ruins any private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
            <p>And, in Taxing the People, we
ſhould have regard not to create
Diſaffection to the Government.</p>
            <p>We ſhould likewiſe ſee that our
preſent Gifts ſhould not, in their
Conſequences, bring Damage to
the ordinary Revenue of the Crown;
for, in ſuch caſes, we give of
one hand, and take away of the
other.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, in our <hi>Ways and Means</hi>
of Supplying the War, we ſhould
take ſome care not to entail upon the
Kingdom too large a Debt of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
Intereſt.</p>
            <p>Taxes, which have all theſe Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies,
that are laid unequally,
that affect Trade, that conſume us
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:51665:18"/>
with Uſury, that diſaffect the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that prejudice the Crown Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue,
and burthen us with perpetual
Intereſt, may be made uſe of now
and then, to piece out, and anſwer
a ſingle and a ſhort neceſſity; but
cannot be repeated often, and made
uſe of, as the conſtant <hi>Ways and
Means</hi> of ſupplying the Government,
in a buſineſs of length, without great
damage and hazard to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>For Taxes of this nature beget
public and private Poverty, make
the People deſperate, render Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
uneaſie to the Rulers, and
may be rather ſaid to fight ſecretly
againſt the Prince, than to give him
any true aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>The Opinion, which from year to
year has prevail'd, That the next
Campagne would end the War, has
made us bear with theſe <hi>Ways and
Means</hi> of Supply, believing every
ſuch charge would be the laſt of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:51665:19"/>
that kind that ſhould be laid upon
the People.</p>
            <p>Perhaps we ſhould have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
other Meaſures, if, at the
beginning of the War, the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
had been throughly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd,
that Peace was at ſuch a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
from us.</p>
            <p>Some are of Opinion, that if
at firſt we had fallen upon Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes,
we had eſtabliſh'd a Fond
of Revenue, which would have
lain equally upon the whole, been
a conſtant and eaſie Supply, and
tending leſs than other Taxes, to
the damage of Foreign Trade, or
ruin of the Gentry; and which,
by this time, might have been
ſo improv'd in the management,
that we ſhould have found it ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of it ſelf, ſufficient for all the
Expences of the War.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:51665:19"/>

indeed, ſomething of the Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences
will come into the Crown as

new Impoſition upon the Tunnage

of two Nine-pences, till they come
to be clear of their former anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

            <p>The Tonnage and Poundage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>The Exciſe on Beer and Ale, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
has been lately under ſo many diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements
of all kinds, as that
Branch will be found to mount very
ſlowly.</p>
            <p>The Hearth Duty is taken off by

yet all the hardſhips and abuſes of it,
might have been corrected by Act
of Parliament, and it would ſtill
have yielded about 200,000 <hi>l. per

and however the Nation
diſguſt it, 'tis hardly ſo odious, if
rightly examin'd, as Poll-Money,

a Badge of Slavery, that they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe

            <p>The preſent Revenue being ſo far
unable to ſupport the War, what
was wanting has been hitherto made
up by other <hi>Ways and Means,</hi> of
which ſome are thought very preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial

            <p>Giving the King Money by Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipating
the Cuſtoms, or by Credit,
upon diſtant Fonds, does apparently
conſume the Public with Uſury:
The new Fonds entail upon us a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
Debt of perpetual Intereſt.</p>
            <p>The Additional Nine-pences upon
Beer and Ale, do manifeſtly hurt
that Branch of the King's Revenue.</p>
            <p>'Tis feared frequent Polls may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affect
the People. The new Cuſtoms
and Impoſitions upon Tunnage, are
thought to prejudice Trade. And
laſtly, the Land Taxes by Monthly
Aſſeſsment ſeem unequally laid; and

               <p>THE Fonds for Intereſt were,
perhaps, good expedients, for
the time, to raiſe Money, but, if
made uſe of frequently, may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
very bad effects in the Nation;
for they divert Money too much
from the Chanel of Trade, where
it is always beſt employed to the
Kingdoms advantage.</p>
               <p>There is already, paid upon theſe
ſort of Fonds, about, 400,000 <hi>l.</hi>
Yearly. 'Tis true, what is out upon
Lives, will by degrees wear off;
but a great part of this Sum will be
a laſting Rent Charge upon the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
and if we ſhould further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
it by new Projects of the
ſame nature, we ſhall quickly be in
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:51665:24"/>
the condition of <hi>Spain,</hi> where they
are undone by paying Taxes to one
another; and where the Public Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue
is ſo clogg'd with perpetual
Intereſt, that apparently there is not
wherewithal to ſupply the preſent
Neceſſities of the Government.</p>
               <p>But the principal Miſchiefs theſe

above the Price, which either our
Foreign or Domeſtick Trade can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
to pay for it, to the great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
of both.</p>
               <p>They who have trac'd the Effects,
which leſſening Intereſt-Money by
Law in this Kingdom has produc'd,
do very well obſerve, that when
Money was brought from Ten to
Eight <hi>per Cent,</hi> our Trade preſently
increas'd upon it, and doubled in
ſome time after it was reduc'd from
Eight to Six <hi>per Cent;</hi> and if the
abatement of Intereſt did bring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with it that good Advantage,
we muſt expect to ſee Trade labour
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:51665:25"/>
under great difficulties, and in a
ſhort time come to Nothing, if, by
the means of theſe Fonds, Money
be reſtor'd to its former Rate of
Eight <hi>per Cent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They are ſo Inviting, and of
ſuch infinite Profit, that few now
are willing to let out their Money
to Traders at Six <hi>per Cent.</hi> as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
ſo that all Merchants, who ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
by Credit, muſt in time give
over, and they being the greateſt
part, and, perhaps, the moſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious,
any Man may judge what
damage this will be to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p>So that theſe Fonds of Intereſt,
are <hi>Ways and Means</hi> of Supplying the
War, which in all appearance are to
be uſed tenderly, and with great

The Houſes in <hi>England,</hi> as appears
by the Books of Hearth-Money, are
about 1,300,000, of which 500,000
are Cottages, inhabited by the Poorer
Sort; ſo that we may reckon there are
not above 800,000 Families liable to
the Payment of Poll-Money; and
though, in the common Computati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the whole People, there may
not be above ſix Perſons to a Houſe,
one with another, yet, in computing
the 800,000 Richer Families, we may
very well allow them to contain, one
with another, ſeven Perſons, which
would be 5,600,000 Heads; and reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
but a third Part of theſe qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
within the Act to pay four Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings

<hi>per</hi> Quarter upon Tradeſmen,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:51665:29"/>
Shopkeepers, and Vintners worth
300 <hi>l.</hi> might have yielded, is diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
to compute; but, perhaps the
Commiſſioners Names in the Act of
Parliament for the Monthly Aſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>Quarto &amp; Quinto Gulielmi &amp;
Mariae</hi> may be no ill Guide in the
Matter. The Commiſſioners then
were about Ten thouſand, and we
may reaſonably ſuppoſe (and any
Gentleman may compute for his own
Country, and he will find) that, one
Country with another, not an Eighth
Part are named Commiſſioners of
thoſe Perſons, who in Eſtate, real or
perſonal, are worth 300 <hi>l.</hi> and if ſo,
we may reckon there are in <hi>England</hi>
80000 Perſons lyable to the Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

               <p>When we reflect upon the great

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:51665:29"/>
to reckon there are 40000

The principal Articles in this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
ſeem very much confirmed
by what the firſt Poll yielded; for if
there had not been in <hi>England</hi> about
1,867,666 Perſons who paid 12 <hi>d. per</hi>
Head, and about Eighty thouſand of
the Sort who paid one Pound <hi>per</hi>

208,330 <hi>l.</hi> 10 <hi>s.</hi> 2 <hi>d.</hi> for Money and
Titles were generally charged in
<hi>London</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Poll now in being, ſuch are
charged who are worth in Eſtate,
real or perſonal, 600 <hi>l.</hi> which may
make ſome difference in the ſecond
Article; but the third Article ſhould
now increaſe, conſidering all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
by this Act, are to pay Ten
Shillings <hi>per</hi> Quarter that are worth
300 <hi>l.</hi> in Eſtate real or perſonal,
which ſeems to take in Stock of all
kinds; whereas in the former Act,
only Tradeſmen, Shopkeepers, and
Vintners were comprehended; ſo
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:51665:30"/>
that if the preſent Poll were ſtrictly
collected, it would produce about
800,000 <hi>l.</hi> and yet, as far as can be
judged by the Accounts hitherto
come up, it is not like to yield ſo
much Money as the former.</p>
               <p>When a Tax yields no more than
half what in reaſon might be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

               <p>SOme People, who contemplate
the greatneſs of <hi>England,</hi> and
the Figure it made in the World
during the former part of Queen <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizabeth</hi>'s
Reign, and ſome time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
are led to think we were
ſtronger without Trade than with
it.</p>
               <p>Perhaps Trade in General may
have been hurtful to Mankind, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it has introduced Luxury and
Avarice, and it might be better with
us if we ſtill liv'd in the Innocence and
plainneſs of our Fore-fathers.</p>
               <p>But the Circumſtance of Time, and
and the Poſture other Nations are in,
may make things abſolutely neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
which are not good in their own
Nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:51665:31"/>
War is the occaſion of Cruelty,
Wickedneſs, and Injuſtice, yet an
unwarlike Nation can enjoy no ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p>Since <hi>France, Spain, Italy,</hi> and <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
have addicted themſelves ſo
much of late years to Trade, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
that Naval Force which Trade
produces, we ſhould be continually
expoſed to the Inſults and Invaſions
of our Neighbours.</p>
               <p>So that 'tis now become indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſably
our Intereſt, to encourage Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Commerce, and inlarge it as
much as poſſible.</p>
               <p>Inſtead of loading that part of our
Strength, we ought to court and
nurſe it up with all imaginable Art
and Care; 'tis a coy and fantaſtical
Lady, hard to win, and quickly
loſt.</p>
               <p>With high Cuſtoms we ſpoil In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry,
diſcourage the Merchant,
and may in time drive Trade to take
ſome other Chanel; and there is
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:51665:32"/>
hardly an Inſtance to be given of a
Nation, may be not of any ſingle
City, that having once loſt Trade,
could ever recover it.</p>
               <p>War, and the Scarcity of Money,
are ſufficient Diſcouragements to
Foreign Commerce, without bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening
it with new Impoſitions.</p>
               <p>And perhaps it may be worth
while to conſider, whither hereafter,
in time of a profound Peace, if part
of the Cuſtoms were taken off, and
ſome Exciſes given in their room,
ſuch an Exchange might not be very
beneficial to the Nation.</p>
               <p>If the Stock of the Merchant were
greater, he would be in a Condition
to have a bigger Trade. If it were
not for the great Duties that muſt be
paid for Cuſtoms, the ſame Stock
would carry on double the Trade.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, that exciſes would have
the appearance of affecting Land
more than Cuſtoms.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:51665:32"/>
But 'tis, becauſe the Views of Men
are ſhort, and generally confined to
their own narrow Intereſt; and they
do not duly conſider how much their
private Concerns depend upon the
publick Welfare of Trade, and how
much the Value of Land is improv'd
ſince our Trade has augmented, even
from Twelve to Twenty four years
Purchaſe; nor how much more of
their Product and Manufactures
would be exported, if Trade wore
free without Clog, and in its full
Proſperity.</p>
               <p>'Tis granted that Exciſes would
ſomething affect the Landed Man,
who is the firſt Seller, but if the
Cuſtoms were leſſened, the Price of
all Foreign Goods would diminiſh to
the Buyer; and conſidering how
great a Part that is of every Man's
Expence, the Country Gentleman
would get in the Shire what he looſes
in the Hundred.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:51665:33"/>
In Nations, where the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
cannot ſubſiſt without charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
every thing, they lay perhaps
great Cuſtoms; but, wherever the
Publick can otherways be maintain'd,
the Cuſtoms are low, for the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
of the Merchant, who
deſerves all Favor, as being the beſt,
and moſt profitable Member of the
Common-Wealth.</p>
               <p>Of all the new Impoſitions, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is thought to lye ſo heavily on
Trade, as the Duties upon the Tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
of Ships. It ſeems to pull
down at once a great part of what
the Nation had been ſo carefully
rearing up by the Act of Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>And that Tax is an Inſtance, how
much Compaſſion for private Caſes
does more prevail in this Country,
than the Senſe of Publick Good.
For it was once deſigned to raiſe the
Money, which was wanting at the
latter end of the Seſſions, by laying a
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:51665:33"/>
new Duty upon Wine; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that was complained of as ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
burthenſome to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and
<hi>Portugal</hi> Merchants, a Charge upon
Tunnage was pitched upon, which in
its Conſequence may prove very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
to the General Trade of all

               <p>It ſeems probable, that for a long

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:51665:34"/>
and that for ſome Ages they had go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
themſelves by the ancient
Books. But the Affairs of that King
requiring then a great Sum of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
the Parliament charged Land
with 12 <hi>d. per</hi> Pound, and perſonal
Eſtates with 6 <hi>d.</hi> and the King had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to name Commiſſioners of his
own. The Aſſeſſors were to be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Oath, and had Power to examine
upon Oath, all Perſons of the true
Value of their Eſtates, real and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal.</p>
               <p>The ſame thing was done 34 and
and 37 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. 2 and 3 <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. and
3 and 4 <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. and 4 and 5 <hi>Philip</hi>
and <hi>Mary.</hi> And, in theſe times, there
was in a manner a new Survey made
of all the Land in the Kingdom, and
thereupon the Subſidies that came af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
raiſed larger Sums than former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
For we find from the Accounts
in the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> that from 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi>
to 29, incluſive, the Subſidies, one
with another, amounted to at leaſt
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:51665:35"/>
100,000 <hi>l.</hi> but from 31 <hi>Eliz.</hi> to
18 <hi>Jac.</hi> 1. in which time we cannot
find there was any regular and ſtrict
Survey made, the Subſidies fell to
70,000 <hi>l.</hi> or thereabouts; for which
no reaſon can be aſſigned (Land im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
all the while) but that, when
there had been no Survey made for
a long while, and the Aſſeſſors were
left at large, the People naturally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to the Rates in the old
Books.</p>
               <p>How ancient the Inequality is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Taxes in the North and
Weſt, and the Home Counties, ſo
much complained of, cannot eaſily
be traced; for in an Aſſeſſment of
400,000 <hi>l.</hi> 17 and 18 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. we find
the Rates upon the Northern and
Weſtern Counties to lye juſt as they
do in our preſent Aſſeſſment; and
tho' there might be ſome reaſon to
eaſe the North in that Tax, becauſe
thoſe Parts had been great Sufferers
by the Scotch Army, yet in 1642,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:51665:35"/>
when that Act paſſed, the Sword of
Civil War was not as yet drawn;
and the Weſt and other Counties
had not yet at all been harraſſed;
ſo that the Favour which the North
and Weſt have met with in Land
Taxes, is a little older than the
Civil War, and may be attributed to
that Care, which the great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Members they ſend up, have
always had of their Concerns in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
               <p>When the Civil War broke out,
the Common-wealth chiefly ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Exciſes, for they could gather
Land-Taxes only where they were
ſtrongeſt.</p>
               <p>In 1647, their Authority was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
own'd over all the Nation,
and then they began to raiſe Land-Taxes
regularly by a Monthly Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſment.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:51665:36"/>
When the War was over, there
was real reaſon to eaſe the North
and Weſt, and accordingly the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
conſidered what Counties
had leaſt felt the War, thoſe in their
Aſſeſſments they rated higheſt, and
they ſpared ſuch Places as had been
moſt harraſed by the Armies of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſide; and this was the Diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
they made (and not as is vulgarly
thought) that of Aſſociated or Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſociated
Counties; for moſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of <hi>England,</hi> during that War,
had been ſome time or other aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated,
and by Ordinance of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>But ſtill perhaps it had not fared
ſo well with the North and Weſt,
notwithſtanding their Sufferings, if
their Cauſe had not been maintained
in the Houſe of Commons by a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
Number of Friends and Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:51665:36"/>
The Places which had been leaſt
ſenſible of thoſe Calamities, or were
ſooneſt rid of them, and that had
been under the Wings of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and their Army, were <hi>London</hi>
and <hi>Middleſex, Surry</hi> and <hi>Southwark,
Hertfordſhire, Bedfordſhire, Cambridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,
Kent, Eſſex, Norfolk, Suffolk,
Berks, Bucks,</hi> and <hi>Oxfordſhire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And they kept to the ſame mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of favouring the diſtant Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and laying the chief Burthen
upon thoſe neareſt <hi>London,</hi> as long
as the Authority of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
laſted.</p>
               <p>When King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second was
reſtored, the Northern and Weſtern
Gentlemen were ſtrong enough in
the Houſe of Commons to get con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
the Method of Aſſeſſment then
in practice, which was ſo favourable
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:51665:37"/>
to them; and in the Act 12 <hi>Car.</hi> 2.
for raiſing 70,000 <hi>l.</hi> for one Month,
'tis particularly provided, that it
ſhall be raiſed in ſuch Proportion as
the laſt 70,000 <hi>l. per</hi> Month was
raiſed by Ordinance of State; ſince
which time till now, the Counties
diſtant from <hi>London,</hi> have continued
in the conſtant Poſſeſſion of being
favourably handled in all Aſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>The firſt Attempt of reducing Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſments
to ſome equality, was made
in the Year 1660.</p>
               <p>The Houſe of Commons, as
may be ſeen from their Journals,
had then in debate the Setling
100,000 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation
of the Court of Wards
and Liveries; and a Committee
was ordered to frame and bring

This Aportionment was many
Months in forming, and made, no
doubt, with great Deliberation and
Judgment, ſince all the moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
Men of thoſe Times were of
that Committee.</p>
               <p>'Tis apparent, that in the Aſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Rates upon each Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and by comparing the Sums, it
may be ſeen, that they chiefly go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
themſelves, by the Proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which had been obſerved in
rating the Ship-Money.</p>
               <p>They had before them the Aſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the 400,000 <hi>l.</hi> 17 and 18
<hi>Car.</hi> 1. which, becauſe it was made
in Parliament, they would, no doubt,
have followed, if they had not judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it Partial.</p>
               <p>But it ſeems they rather choſe to
follow the Rates obſerved in Aſſeſſing
the Ship-Money, as having been laid
by Perſons who had not the ſame
reaſon and Intereſt to favour one
Country more than another.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:51665:39"/>
Ship-Money was an arbitrary and
illegal Tax, therefore it concerned
the Contrivers of it to lay it as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
upon the Nation as poſſible;
for it would have been a double Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
to the People, if it had been
impoſed, both againſt Law, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
with Partiality. On the contrary,
it imported the Miniſters of that time
to give their new Invention all the
fair Colours imaginable, and to make
that, which was unjuſt in its Nature,
at leaſt juſt and equal in its Manner;
and no doubt, in the Rating of it,
they had duly weighed and conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Strength and Weakneſs, Riches
and Poverty, Trade and Fertility,
and every Circumſtance of each par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
County; with ſome regard
alſo to the Proportion it bore in the
ancient Subſidies.</p>
               <p>And, upon theſe Grounds, 'tis
more than probable the Committee
of the Houſe of Commons proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in 1660, when they made the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:51665:40"/>
Ship-Money their Model and Pattern
of a fair and equal Aſſeſſment.</p>
               <p>Since the late War with <hi>France,</hi>
Land has been Tax'd in different
manners, by an Aſſeſsment, and by
a Pound Rate; but both ways, it
will perhaps appear, that the North
and Weſt have not born their due
ſhare and proportion of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Burthen.</p>
               <p>The firſt Aid given to Their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties

               </p>
               <p>The ſecond Aid upon Land was
of 12 <hi>d. per</hi> Pound. In this Act
Their Majeſties had power to No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate

               </p>
               <p>The fourth Aid upon Land was by
a Monthly Aſſeſsment of 137, 641 <hi>l.</hi>
18 <hi>s.</hi> 2 <hi>d. per</hi> Month, 2 <hi>Guil. &amp; Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riae.</hi>

               <p>The fifth Aid upon Land was by
the ſame Monthly Aſſeſsment, 3 <hi>Guil.
&amp; Mariae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſixth Aid upon Land was by
a Pound Rate of 4 <hi>s.</hi> in the Pound.
In this Act the Aſſeſſors are not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

But, all things duly conſider'd,
there ſeem very probable reaſons to

without <hi>London, Middleſex</hi> and
<hi>Weſtminſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For, as to the Exciſe, all who know
that Revenue muſt grant, that in the
North and Weſt, the Country in
many parts is ſo wild, and the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
lye ſo diſpers'd, that the Retailers
cannot be ſo well watch'd as in the
Home Counties, where the Dealers
are in a narrower compaſs, and have
leſs opportunities to deceive the
King's Officers. More private Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
take their Drink of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Brewers, in the Counties near
<hi>London,</hi> than at a diſtance, which
ſwells the Exciſe of the Home Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
Setting that aſide, and if the
Revenue could poſſibly be as well
watch'd in the diſtant parts as it is
near <hi>London,</hi> the Exciſe of the North
and Weſt would, probably, anſwer
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:51665:48"/>
near three fourths of the whole,
without <hi>London,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>As to the Polls, 'tis notoriouſly
known, that the payment for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
and Qualities of Perſons, is by
no means ſo narrowly looked after
and exacted in the North and Weſt,
as in the Home Counties; and if it
were, the Poll-Money in the North
and Weſt, would in all likelihood
anſwer three fourths of the whole,
reckon'd without <hi>London,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>As to the North and Weſt, bearing
no higher a proportion, in the Poor
Rate, than ſcarce two thirds with the
reſt of <hi>England,</hi> there is, perhaps, this
to be ſaid, That, in the diſtant parts,
Proviſions are cheaper; ſo they main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
their Poor at an eaſier rate than
in the Counties near <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the North and Weſt, their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures
afford Employment to
the poorer ſort; and there are not
ſo many there, who live upon the
Charity of others, as near <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:51665:49"/>
where Luxury and Idleneſs
abound.</p>
               <p>As to the proportion each Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
bears in the Ship-Money, and as
to the Rates which would lye upon
each County in an Aſſeſſment of
two Millions, purſuant to the Apor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionment
of 1660, though the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions
are both ways laid with
more equality than in our preſent
Aſſeſſment, yet we are to conſider,
that in thoſe times, when they judg'd
the Eleven Home Counties to be a
third part of the Kingdom, it was,
in reſpect of the Improvements of
Land, earlier known, and made uſe
of, near the Capital City, than at a
diſtance from it.</p>
               <p>The Ship-Money, of which the
Aportionment in 1660 is a Copy,
began to be Levied in 1636; at
which time we may well imagine,
that near <hi>London,</hi> all ſorts of ways
to meliorate Land were found out,
and put in practice, ſuch as Diſpark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:51665:49"/>
Parks, Grubbing Woods, Inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
and Dreining Fenny Ground,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that the Home Counties, which
were ſcarce a ſeventh part in quantity
of Acres, to the reſt of <hi>England,</hi>
might, in the Year 1636, be well
judg'd a third part in the value of
Rents.</p>
               <p>But the various ways of Improving
Land, are now of late Years got in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Northern and Weſtern Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
Clover, Cinqfoin, Trefoin,
Marl, and Lime, are particularly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial
to Countries that have great
ſtore of Barren Ground.</p>
               <p>The North and Weſt of late Years,
have had a greater proportion of Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Trade than the Home Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
               <p>The uſe of Sea-Coal in <hi>London,</hi> has
more than trebled of late Years,
which is a great advantage to the
North.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:51665:50"/>
The Prohibition of <hi>Iriſh</hi> Cattle,
is wholly beneficial to the Northern
and Weſtern Counties, and has im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd
their Land, and is hurtful to
the reſt of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Land ſeems to have been almoſt
at the height of its Improvement, and
near the Rack Rerit, about the Year
1636, in the Eleven Home Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
               <p>And in the North and Weſt, it
has been ever ſince Improving; ſo
that, in all probability, thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
which were formerly rated as
two thirds, may now be eſteem'd
and valued as three fourths of the
Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole Matter, the
Hearth-Money ſeems the beſt Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
to form a Judgment by, of the
Wealth of each County; and, by
conſequence, what proportion it
ought to bear in any Land-Tax.</p>
               <p>For, from the number of Houſes,
we may compute the People.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:51665:50"/>
Where the numbers of People are,
generally ſpeaking, there are the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures,
and Conſumption of
Home Commodities; there is the
Wealth and Trade; and there Land
improves, and Rents are higheſt.</p>
               <p>In the number of Houſes, the
North and Weſt, are about three
fourths of the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>From whence, upon probable
grounds, may be inferr'd, that the
North and Weſt are three fourths
of the Rents and Value of <hi>England,</hi>
ſtill reckoning without <hi>London,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And if ſo, and if the Eleven Home

                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:51665:54"/>
'Tis true likewiſe, that in the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſment
of 400,000 <hi>l.</hi> 17 and 18
<hi>Car.</hi> 1. they are valued at about a
ſeventh Part; but we are to conſider
the Circumſtance of that time; the
Parliament wanting a preſent Sum
to pay off the Debts they were engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in, which no Place could ſo ſoon
raiſe as <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the ſingle Poll they ſeem about
a fourth Part; and in the Quarterly
Poll, much about a Sixth; and the
reaſon of the difference is in the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
Poll, the Payment for Qualities
and Degrees of Perſons was ſtrictly
exacted in <hi>London,</hi> and not in the
Country; which ſwells the Article
of <hi>London.</hi> In the Quarterly Poll it
was neither looked after in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
nor in <hi>London,</hi> which we ſee
paid little more to the Quarterly Poll
than to the Single.</p>
               <p>But in both Polls, and both for
<hi>London</hi> and the Country, if we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
from the whole Sum, what was
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:51665:54"/>
paid on the Account of Degrees and
Qualities, it will be found that <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
Weſtminſter,</hi> and <hi>Middleſex</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
about a Tenth Part of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p>In the Exciſe they appear to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
a fifth Part; but the reaſon for
that is obvious, becauſe in <hi>London,</hi>
almoſt all pay Exciſe for their Drink,
which is not ſo in the Country, but
in the Conſumption of Malt, <hi>London,</hi>
&amp;c. will be found about a Tenth
part of the whole.</p>
               <p>In the Number of Hearths they
ſeem about a ſeventh part; the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of that is alſo apparent, for that
in the Country, to ſave the Duty,
the common People took away ſuch
Hearths, of which they had not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
uſe.</p>
               <p>But in Number of Houſes, <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
Weſtminſter</hi> and <hi>Middleſex</hi> are
not an Eleventh part of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>

                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:51665:55"/>
And by the Monthly Aſſeſſment it
appears, that the Parliament have
judged them about a Tenth part.</p>
               <p>In the Apportionment of 100,000 <hi>l.</hi>
upon the whole Nation in the Year
1660, they are valued and rated at
about a Fourteenth part.</p>
               <p>In the Aſſeſſment of Ship-Money,
at about a Tenth part.</p>
               <p>And in an Aſſeſſment of 30,000 <hi>l.</hi>
given to <hi>Harry</hi> the Seventh, in lieu
for that time of the Aid, <hi>Pur fair ſitz
Chivaleer &amp; pur file Marrier Rot. Parl.</hi>
19 <hi>Har.</hi> 7. N<hi rend="sup">o.</hi> 10. <hi>London, Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi>
and <hi>Middleſex</hi> are rated at but
889 <hi>l.</hi> 10 <hi>s.</hi> 2 <hi>d.</hi> which is about a thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
third part of that Tax.</p>
               <p>And in the Poor Rate, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to be about a Twelfth part of
the Whole.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole Matter, from the
foregoing Inſtances, and many others
that might be given, it ſeems very
probable that <hi>London, Weſtminſter</hi> and
<hi>Middleſex</hi> have been generally eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:51665:55"/>
and are about a Tenth part of
the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>But the Inſtance which relates to
the Number of Houſes, is what we
may reaſonably lay moſt weight up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the preſent Diſpute; becauſe
the 307,140 <hi>l.</hi> which they pay in the
Four Shilling Aid, does moſt of it,
without all contradiction, ariſe from
the Rent of Houſes.</p>
               <p>If indeed Money were ſtrictly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
after, and if the Charge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Perſonal Eſtates made up a great
part of the forementioned Sum, the
Compariſon might not hold; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the great Stocks of Money are
in <hi>London;</hi> but though Money be
charged in the Act, the Law has not
been able, hitherto, to reach it ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually.</p>
               <p>Now, to raiſe the Sum of
307,140 <hi>l.</hi> the general Rental of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
Middleſex</hi> and <hi>VVeſtminſter</hi> muſt
be upwards of a Million and a half
<hi>per Annum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:51665:56"/>
And if the Rental of the Eleventh
(but ſuppoſe them a Tenth part of
the whole) be a Million and a half,
the general Rental of the Kingdom
muſt be Fifteen Millions <hi>per Annum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if the general Rental of the
Kingdom be Fifteen Millions <hi>per
Annum,</hi> the Aid of Four Shillings in
the Pound ought to raiſe three Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions.</p>
               <p>If 111,215 Houſes in and about
<hi>London,</hi> with no more Ground than
what they ſtand upon, are, in Rent,
one Million and a half <hi>per Annum,</hi> it
is hardly poſſible but that the
1,208,000 Houſes in the Country,
with all the Land about them, and all
the Benefits that attend Land, muſt
be in Rent Thirteen Millions and a
half <hi>per Annum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And whoever conſiders this ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly,
will perhaps be inclined to
think, that the Four Shilling Aid
would raiſe at leaſt Three Millions,
if it were levied in other Parts of
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:51665:56"/>
                  <hi>England</hi> with the ſame Care and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs
as it is in <hi>London, VVeſtminſter</hi>
and <hi>Middleſex,</hi> which are under the
Eye and Influence of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>And if the Aid could be brought
to raiſe ſuch a Sum, the War would
almoſt be maintained by the Charge
upon Land only.</p>
               <p>'Tis notoriouſly known that a
great many Perſons, both in the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſment
and Aids, pay a full Fifth
part of their Eſtates; if the reſt did
ſo, all would be upon an equal
foot; which, in Juſtice and Reaſon,
the Subjects of the ſame Prince
ſhould be in every good Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>But this will be very hard to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs
in that long Poſſeſſion many
Countries are in, of being favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
handled in all Taxes.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, in the preſent Aid the
Aſſeſſors are upon Oath, but, in
Matters of Revenue, it has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:51665:57"/>
found that Oaths are very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
regarded.</p>
               <p>If in the Cuſtoms and Exciſe all
Entries were to be made upon Oath
of the Parties, and the King had no
other hold, he might indeed ſave the
Charge of Officers, but he would
ſee very little from thoſe Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues.</p>
               <p>The Officers in the Cuſtoms and
Exciſe are upon Oath; but if there
were no other Checks upon them,
thoſe Branches would turn to ſmall
account.</p>
               <p>And we ſee in the preſent Charge
upon Intereſt-Money, how little
Scruple Men make of Swearing not
to have 100 <hi>l.</hi> who are generally
thought to be worth 20,000 <hi>l.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Taxes can never be equally levied
where the People are left to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
or with no other Check up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, but their own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:51665:57"/>
Therefore it was the ancient Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
of our Kings, to name
their own Commiſſioners for the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying
and Collecting ſuch Aids, Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenths,

gave them: which may be ſeen
by the old Commiſſions, <hi>ad Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendum
&amp; Colligendum,</hi> that were
wont to accompany Grants of that
Nature.</p>
               <p>In that Aid which was granted to
<hi>Harry</hi> the Third, when <hi>Magna Charta</hi>
paſſed, there is the Form of that

have been in the nature of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners,
to ſee that no Wrong be
done in the Diſtribution of 4000 <hi>l.</hi>
which was to be deducted out of the
Aid for decay'd Towns and Places.
<hi>Vid. Rot. Parl.</hi> 11. <hi>H.</hi> 6. <hi>N.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>The firſt time we find Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners
named in Parliament for the
levying Tenths and Fifteenths, was
in <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth's Reign, who
was a Luxurious Prince, and gave
the People reaſon to ſuſpect his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.
<hi>Vid. Rot. Parl.</hi> 12. <hi>Edw.</hi> 4. <hi>N.</hi> 41.
and 14. <hi>Edw.</hi> 4. <hi>N.</hi> 7.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:51665:58"/>
The Records are both dark enough,
but the Parliament ſeems there to
name Commiſſioners, whom the King
ſhall Authorize under the Great Seal,
to Aſſeſs and Levy the Aid, and
that the Money ſo levied, ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
in the Hands of the Collectors,
to be appointed by the King in <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery,</hi>
unto the time that Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſhall be made by the King of his
Muſters.</p>
               <p>The Parliament ſuſpected an Aid
was deſired, and no War intended,
ſo that their Guift ſeems conditional,
and they name Commiſſioners, to
ſee to the due Performance of the
Truſt.</p>
               <p>But afterwards, in the Reign of
<hi>Harry</hi> the Seventh, the occaſion of
naming Commiſſioners in Parliament,
ſeems a great deal more apparent.</p>
               <p>For that covetous Prince was wont
to ask great Aids of his People, on
pretence of Wars, that were never
intended,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:51665:59"/>
Therefore the Aids which were
given him the Twelfth of his Reign
were, upon this Condition, to be
levied upon the People, if the War
proceeded; but not to be levied if
a Peace or Truce enſued before they
came to be due: and it was upon
the ſcore of this Truſt, that in all
probability, the Parliament named
Commiſſioners of the Shires, with
the Juſtices of the Peace to be Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated.
<hi>Vid Rot. Parl.</hi> 12. <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>N.</hi> 12.
and <hi>N.</hi> 13.</p>
               <p>But Commiſſioners have been ſeveral
times ſince named by the King; as
34 and 37 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. 2 and 3 <hi>Edw.</hi> 6.
3 and 4 <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. 4 and 5 <hi>Phil.</hi> and
<hi>Mary,</hi> 15 and 22 <hi>Car.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>But there is a Preſident for this in
the firſt Year of Their preſent Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties
Reign; and if, purſuant to the
Powers given in that Act, the King
had named Commiſſioners of his
own in every County, for levying
the Aid of one Shilling in the Pound,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:51665:59"/>
there might have been a new Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
made of all the Rents in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
and, in all likelihood, ſuch
Sums would have been raiſed upon
Land only, as might have near an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd
all the Neceſſities of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Pound Rate did not
raiſe ſo much in proportion as the
firſt; and there is ground to think
this laſt 4 Shiling Aid will not raiſe
ſo much as the former: And there
is reaſon to believe, the Aids by
Pound Rate will every time grow
leſs and leſs, (like the Subſidies in the
latter end of Queen <hi>Elizabeth's,</hi> and
beginning of King <hi>Iames's</hi> Reign)
unleſs there be a new, and regular
Survey made of Land.</p>
               <p>For let the Dangers from abroad,
and the Wants at home, be never
ſo preſſing; no doubt, moſt Men, if
they are left to themſelves, will be
glad to ſave their Money; and will
rather conſult their private Intereſt
than the Public Good.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:51665:60"/>
But if the King, as was always
practis'd in Ancient Times, had pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to name Commiſſioners; and if
all People were bound under great
Forfeitures, to give in a true Rental
of their Eſtates, or a true Eſtimate of
what they keep in their hands; and
if the Commiſſioners had power to
Examin any perſon (other than the
Party himſelf) upon Oath, of the
true value of each Man's Eſtate, there
is hardly any doubt to be made, but
that an Aid of Four Shillings in the
Pound would raiſe Three Millions.</p>
               <p>And if Land could raiſe that Sum,
the Nation need not be put to ſuch
diſhonorable and dangerous ſhifts of
raiſing Money, as are new Projects,
freſh Impoſitions upon Trade, and
Fonds of Perpetual Intereſt; which,
if they are made uſe of as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
<hi>Ways and Means</hi> of Supplying
the War, muſt in all appearance very
quickly deſtroy our Foreign Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce;
and, by conſequence, bring
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:51665:60"/>
univerſal Weakneſs and Poverty up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the whole Kingdom. But there
is nothing too hard for the Wiſdom
of a Parliament to bring about;
which, perhaps, may find a way to
Levy the Pound Rate juſtly and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
in all Counties, without gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the King Power to Name Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners.</p>
               <p>The Ancient Subſidies did uſually
conſiſt of a charge by Poll, a Pound
Rate upon Land, and a Pound Rate
upon Money, and Perſonal Eſtates;
ſo that all ſorts of people did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
ſomething in the old way of
Taxing, but ſuch as for their Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
were exempted.</p>
               <p>The Uſurers, who are the true
Drones of a Common-wealth, living
upon the Honey without any La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
ſhould, of all People, be
brought in to bear their proportion
of the Common Burthen. As yet,
they could never be effectually
reach'd, but they may be fetch'd in
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:51665:61"/>
by the Wiſdom of a Parliament, if
the Houſe of Commons would pleaſe
reſolutely to ſet themſelves about
it.</p>
               <p>What a Pound Rate of Four Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
in the Pound, upon Money,
might produce, is very hard to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute,
becauſe, in that Matter, there
is ſcarce any Rule or Meaſure to go
by; but ſuppoſing Money at Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
to be a ſixteenth part (as ſome
think) of the annual Value and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of <hi>England,</hi> there is then
twenty Millions of Money at Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt,
(which may be, and yet not a
third part of that Sum, <hi>in ſpecie,</hi> in
the Kingdom) and if there are twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Millions at Intereſt at five <hi>per Cent.</hi>
a Pound Rate of Four Shillings in the
Pound, upon Money, would raiſe
200,000 <hi>l.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That which has made Quarterly
Polls ſo diſtaſtful, is charging the
Poorer ſort; but if they were all
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:51665:61"/>
exempted, a Quarterly Poll well Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied
might raiſe 500,000 <hi>l.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here it may not be amiſs to
take notice, that if, in the Pound
Rate upon Land, one Shilling were
taken off from the Landlord, and
placed upon the Tenant, it would
eaſe thoſe who have born all the
weight; nor can it ſeem oppreſſive
to the Tenants, conſidering how
well they have fared hitherto.</p>
               <p>So that a mix'd Aid, by a Pound
Rate upon Land and Money, and by
a Quarterly Poll, all carefully Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied,
might raiſe

Which, without any new <hi>Ways and
means,</hi> would come very near rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:51665:62"/>
that Sum to which the Expence
of the War has hitherto amounted.</p>
               <p>If in a War that is ſo Expenſive,
and is thought ſo neceſſary for our
Preſervation, all people would agree
to promote Equality, no doubt
great Sums might be raiſed in this
Nation, and the Country, in all
Aids, would be found to anſwer as
well as <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That <hi>London, Weſtminſter</hi> and <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſex,</hi>
pay about a ſixth part in the
Aid, is very plain; and that they
are not above a Tenth part of the
Kingdom's general Rental, is very
probable.</p>
               <p>What Proportion in other Wealth
and Subſtance <hi>London</hi> bears to the
reſt of <hi>England,</hi> is very hard to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine.</p>
               <p>But ſome Landed Man will ſtart
up and ſay, 'Tis true, <hi>London</hi>
bears a ſixth, it ought to bear a
half, it has all the Wealth; and the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:51665:62"/>
immoderate Growth of that City un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does
and ruins all the Country.</p>
               <p>It may therefore be well worth the
Enquiry of thinking Men, what
truth there is in this common and
receiv'd Notion, that the Growth
of <hi>London</hi> is pernicious to <hi>England;</hi>
That the Kingdom is like a Rickety
Body, with a Head too big for the
other Members.</p>
               <p>For ſome people, who have
thought much upon this ſubject, are
inclin'd to believe, that the Growth
of that City is advantageous to the
Nation, and they ſeem to ground
their Opinion upon the following
Reaſons:</p>
               <p>That no Empire was ever great,
without having a great and popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
City.</p>
               <p>That the <hi>Romans</hi> drew all the
conquer'd Cities of <hi>Italy</hi> into <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That the People of <hi>Attica</hi> were no
better than a Crew of rude Herdſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:51665:63"/>
and neither flouriſh'd in War,
nor in Civil Arts, till <hi>Theſeus</hi> perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
them to Inhabit <hi>Athens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That the greatneſs of <hi>London</hi> will
beſt preſerve our Conſtitution, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,
where there is a great and
powerful City, the Prince will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Enterpriſe upon the Liberties of
that People; in the ſame manner, a
Rich and Powerful City ſeldom Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels
upon vain and ſlight occaſions.</p>
               <p>On theſe grounds, and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
ſome people are led to think,
the Growth of <hi>London</hi> not hurtful to
the Nation; but, on the contrary,
to believe that there is not an Acre
of Land in the Country, be it never
ſo diſtant, that is not in ſome degree
better'd by the Growth, Trade, and
Riches of that City.</p>
               <p>Perhaps, if all the Wealth and
Subſtance of <hi>London</hi> could be truly
Rated, in a Tax of four Millions,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:51665:63"/>
that City would pay a fourth part
without any Hardſhip to it.</p>
               <p>But, probably, there is nothing
but Exciſes that will truly and equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Rate all ſort of Wealth, and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
and bring in all ſort of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
chiefly thoſe in great Cities, to
contribute in the Public Burthens.</p>
               <p>We have now gone through the
chief <hi>VVays and Means,</hi> hitherto
made uſe of, for carrying on the
preſent War, in which an Impartial
Land-Tax is chiefly recommended,
as moſt agreeable to the Ancient
Conſtitution of this Kingdom.</p>
               <p>If it ſhall be thought expedient to
go by the way of a Monthly Aſſeſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the Aportionment of 1660,
ſeems a more equal diſtribution of
the Common Burthen, than has been
as yet made uſe of: According to
which, the Home Counties would
pay as they do now; <hi>London, Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter</hi>
and <hi>Middleſex,</hi> may be Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:51665:64"/>
at the Sum they have paid in the
Aid of Four Shillings in the Pound.</p>
               <p>And the Aſſeſſment would run
thus:

               <p>A far larger Sum might indeed be
produced by a Pound Rate, equally
and impartially Levied through the
whole Kingdom.</p>
               <p>But ſome will object, That to Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
a Pound Rate ſtrictly, by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
of the King's Naming,
may occaſion Oppreſſion and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents
in the Country; And that
ſuch a Method of raiſing Taxes,
may create ſo many Officers among
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:51665:64"/>
the beſt of the Gentry dependant up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Court, as may be dangerous
to Liberty.</p>
               <p>Beſides, the Northern and Weſtern
Counties, eſpecially ſuch as lye moſt
diſtant, will affirm, That out of the
ſame value in Eſtates, they are not
able to pay the ſame Pound Rate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
their Rents are not ſo well
Paid; their Returns, and Markets,
are not ſo quick; and they taſte not
that benefit of the Trade, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of <hi>London,</hi> in the ſame degree
as the Home Counties.</p>
               <p>It may be likewiſe objected, That
Land-Taxes in general (and chiefly
if ſtrictly Levied) muſt be very ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to the Gentry, if the War
ſhould continue for any long time.</p>
               <p>And ſince, to a Wiſe and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
Prince, no Sum of Money
can be deſirable, that is Levied with
the Oppreſſion and Diſcontent of his
People, it may not be amiſs to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
what other <hi>Ways</hi> there are of
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:51665:65"/>
Supplying the War, which may be
more caſie to the Nation.</p>
               <p>Exciſes have had an ill repute with
ſuch as have not throughly weighed
and compared them with other Tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es;
but, however, it may not be
improper to examine a little into the
nature of ſuch a Fond of Revenue,
to what degree it would ſupply the
War, and how far it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
with the ſafety of our Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</p>

               <p>EXciſes ſeem the moſt proper
<hi>Ways and Means</hi> to ſupport the

It appears from the Books of
Hearth-Money, that the Families in
<hi>England</hi> are about Thirteen hundred
Thouſand; ſo that, allowing ſix to
a Family, the People of <hi>England</hi>
may be computed at above ſeven
Millions.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>William Petty</hi> reckons the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Maſs of Mankind to ſpend in
their Nouriſhment, and living of all
ſorts, one with another, about ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Pound a Year a-piece; by which
computation, there ſeems Yearly to
be ſpent in <hi>England</hi> about Forty nine
Millions; of which, Land and Rents
in <hi>London,</hi> according to what they
pay in the preſent Aids, appear not
to be above Ten Millions; and
Trade may be now eſteem'd at ſix
Millions; The other Thirty three
Millions are ſpent from Sciences,
Arts, Labour, Induſtry, Manufacture,
Retailing of Foreign Goods, and
Buying and Selling our Home Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:51665:66"/>
Now in Taxing the people, we
have hitherto gone chiefly upon
Land, and Foreign Trade, which
are about one third part of the
ſtrength of <hi>England;</hi> and the other
two thirds of its ſtrength we let
eſcape. So that Uſurers, Lawyers,
Tradeſmen, and Retailers, with all
that Troop that maintain themſelves
by our Vice and Luxury, and who
make the eaſieſt and moſt certain
gain and profit in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
contribute little to its ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port;
all which, by Exciſes, would
be brought to bear their proportion
of the Common Burthen.</p>
               <p>Of the Thirteen hundred thouſand
Houſes that are in <hi>England,</hi> it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
from the Books of Hearth-Money,
that Five hundred thouſand
are Cottages of one Chimney. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
moſt of theſe to be poor Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
and that they contribute little
to any Tax, yet if the other Eight
hundred thouſand Families paid in
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:51665:66"/>
ſeveral Exciſes but ſix pound a Year,
one with another, the whole amount
would be 4,800,000 <hi>l. per Annum;</hi>
which ſhows what great Sums Exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
are capable of producing.</p>
               <p>But the diſproportion, between
what the Rich and what the Poor
conſume, would make this fall eaſily
upon the Poor, and not very heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon the Richer ſort.</p>
               <p>The Duties upon Beer and Ale,
are an Inſtance of the value of Exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
which at 2 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d. per</hi> Barrel up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Strong, and 6 <hi>d. per</hi> Barrel upon
Small-Beer, and 16 <hi>d. per</hi> Gallon up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Brandy, produced, in the Year
ending 24 <hi>June</hi> 1689, clear of all
Charges, 738,696 <hi>l.</hi> And, if one
Branch of our Conſumption would
yield ſuch a Sum, what would an
Exciſe produce, laid upon ſeveral
other Commodities and Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures,
Charging the things of
Luxury high, and the Neceſſaries
of Life but at a low rate?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:51665:67"/>
That kind of Revenue muſt needs
be very great, where ſo large a part
of the people are every Minute pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſomething towards it; and very
eaſie, where every one, in a manner,
Taxes himſelf, making Conſumption
according to his will or ability.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Venice</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> two Jealous
Common-wealths, have not thought
Exciſes dangerous to Liberty. They
are the ſtrength and ſupport of our
Neighbouring Monarchies, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>France;</hi> And if we are to contend
with that King, the Combat will be
with very unequal Weapons, if we
muſt make uſe only of Land-Taxes
and Cuſtoms, againſt his Exciſes, and
all his other ways of raiſing Money.</p>
               <p>But it may be objected, That no
Exciſe can be laid, but the Price of
the Commodity will riſe, which
will hurt our Manufactures, hinder
Conſumption, and ſo prejudice the
Landlords and Farmers of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:51665:67"/>
But that objection would be
quite remov'd by a good Law of
Aſſize; without which, any new
Exciſes may indeed be of evil conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</p>
               <p>The Laws of Aſſize were made to
increaſe Conſumption, and give the
Common people the benefit of Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
As the price of Corn falls, the
weight of Bread ſhould encreaſe;
and if this were ſtrictly look'd after,
it would much augment Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
among the Common people,
who are the great Conſumers of
our Home Commodities; and who
would conſume more, if they might
have more for the ſame Money.
But this is no where regarded, but
a little within the City of <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this Laws not being put in
Execution, Conſumption does not
encreaſe as Plenty encreaſes; neither
the Farmer, nor the Common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
are the better for abundance;
And the benefit of Plenty, in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:51665:68"/>
wholly accrues to Bakers, Corn-Chandlers,
and Corn-Brokers, who
make immoderate Gains by not rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
and lowering their Prices truly,
according to the common Rate of
the Market, which, by Law, they
are bound to do.</p>
               <p>As for Example, if an Exciſe were
laid upon Wheat and Rye, and, at
the ſame time, the Laws of Aſſize
were revived, and inforced with
higher Penalties; the Exciſe would
not be ſo much felt by the Farmer,
becauſe he would find Conſumption
increaſe; nor by the common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
becauſe they would have more
Bread for the ſame Money; ſo that,
in effect, the Exciſe would be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
to the King out of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate
and Unlawful Gain made
by the Baker, Corn-Chandler, and
Corn-Broker.</p>
               <p>So, if an Exciſe were laid upon
Oats, Peaſe and Beans, and an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſize
of the ſaid Commodities were
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:51665:68"/>
made to force the Inn-keepers and
Corn-Chandlers to regulate their
Prices, in a reaſonable manner, by
the Market Price, the Conſumption
would be greater, and the Farmer
thereby recompenced, and the King's
Duty in effect would be paid out of
the immoderate Gain made by the
Inn-keeper, and Corn-Chandler.</p>
               <p>So if an Exciſe were laid upon
Fleſh, Candles, and Leather, and at
the ſame time Proviſion were made
by Law to regulate the Market of
<hi>Smithfield,</hi> and other Markets, all
Cattle would ſell ſo much better;
that the Farmer would not ſo much
feel the Exciſe, which would in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
be paid out of the exceſſive Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
made by the Butcher, in retail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Fleſh, and ſelling his Tallow
and Hides.</p>
               <p>'Tis ſtrange Oeconomy in our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
that Plenty ſhould make
things a greater Drug to the firſt
Seller, and very little cheaper to the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:51665:69"/>
Buyer; but ſo it is in Fact; and this
proceeds from the want of a good
Law of Aſſize, and from the Fraud
and Corruption of thoſe who retail
theſe Commodities; ſuch as Bakers,
Inkeepers, and Butchers. And ſince
there is a neceſſity of Money, can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Tax be more reaſonable, than
ſuch a one as would intercept and
bring to the King, ſome part of that
exceſſive Gain, which theſe People
make upon the Publick?</p>
               <p>And this will hold in almoſt all
Commodities that are the proper
Subjects of an Exciſe.</p>
               <p>Therefore if ever new Exciſes are
thought upon, it will be neceſſary,
at the ſame time to renew the Laws
of Aſſize now in force, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
a new Bill of Aſſize, with higher
Penalties, and better accommodated
to preſent uſe; in which the Juſtices
of Peace may be ſtrictly injoyned to
ſettle the Aſſize every Month, in
their reſpective Diviſions, at their
Monthly Meetings.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:51665:69"/>
The ſame Law may regulate the
Markets of <hi>Smithfield,</hi> in which, it
is ſaid, there are Practices very hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to the Landed Men of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis complained the Butchers of
<hi>London</hi> keep great quantities of rich
feeding Ground in their Hands near
the Town, and are all Engroſſers of
Cattle; and when Beaſts are brought
hither for Sale, they drive theirs up
to glut the Market, and by this
Combination, command the Price,
and ſet it at their own pleaſure; and
ſo make Fleſh dear in the Retail, when
Cattle ſell for nothing in the Market.</p>
               <p>The Remedy for this Evil can be
beſt found out, and apply'd by the
Country Gentlemen that ſit in Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>The ſame Law may alſo regulate
Weights and Meaſures, in which,
'tis ſaid, there are great Coruptions
throughout the whole Kingdom.</p>
               <p>It ſhould be the Care of all Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments
to ſave and protect the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:51665:70"/>
Poor, as much as poſſible, from the
Frauds and Combinations of the
Richer ſort; and if this were ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
provided for, by good and
wholeſome Laws, well executed, all
the Neceſſaries of Life would be
thereby render'd ſo much cheaper
to the Poor, that they might pay
Exciſes, and yet enjoy more Eaſe
and Plenty than they do at preſent.</p>
               <p>The proper Commodities to lay
Exciſes upon, are thoſe, which ſerve
meerly to Luxury; becauſe that way
the Poor would be leaſt affected.</p>
               <p>But things of that nature are of
little bulk, eaſily hid, vended by a
number of different Traders, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
many Officers to inſpect the
Making, Selling, and Retailing of them.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Holland</hi> they eaſily gather the
Duty upon things of Luxury, where
the People are ſhut up within a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
compaſs, and where the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Laws is ſtrict and ſteady;
but it would be otherwiſe in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:51665:70"/>
where the People are diſperſed
about in a large Country, and where
they have been long uſed to a ſlack
and unſteady Execution of the Laws.
Beſides, in <hi>Holland,</hi> the Laws that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
ſuch Exciſes to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
are more ſtrict and penal than
our Conſtitution will bear.</p>
               <p>And yet a Duty upon all the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
and Luxuries of this Kingdom
may be collected, by a far leſs num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Officers, and with leſs Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,
than is commonly imagined.</p>
               <p>The Commodities with us, proper
to charge Exciſes upon, are ſuch as are
Bulky, and not eaſily hid or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd
away, and where as few Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
as poſſible may be peſter'd and
vex'd with the Search and Inſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
on of the Officers, and where the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue
may be ſufficiently ſecured to
the King by mild and gentle Laws.</p>
               <p>Exciſes may be ſo contrived and
laid, as to anſwer a Sum perhaps
large enough for the Wants of the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:51665:71"/>
Government, without ſubjecting any
private Families, which are not Dealers,
to the Officers Search and Inſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or without charging any private
Perſon for ſuch Commodities as are
of his own Growth or Making.</p>
               <p>There may a Sum large enough a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe,
only from a Duty upon ſuch
things as are ſold, made, or retailed
in Market Towns and great Cities,
to be paid only by the Seller, Maker,
or Retailer.</p>
               <p>And the Duties will be with much
leſs Clamor gathered, where the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
lyes only between Officers and
publick Dealers, than where it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the King's Officers and private
Perſons.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, that a Duty upon Malt
cannot be conveniently laid, or
would yield little, without ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
private Perſons to the Inſpection
of the Officer; but, in regard Malt-houſes
are in Out Yards, the Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience
and Trouble would be the leſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:51665:71"/>
And ſuch a Sum as is wanted may
be levy'd, and the things of Luxury
reach'd, for the yearly Charge of
about 100,000 <hi>l.</hi> and by about Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
hundred Officers; caſting <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
into Eight hundred Diſtricts, as
it is laid out for inſpecting the Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allers
in the Duty upon Beer and
Ale; the remaining Six hundred are
ſufficient to take an account of ſuch
Goods as are made, ſold, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail'd
in great Towns and Cities.</p>
               <p>And this is undeniably apparent
to any one that is skill'd in the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Collecting Exciſes, and vers'd
in the Nature of ſuch Revenues.</p>
               <p>Nor is this a number of Officers
that can be reaſonably thought dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
to our Liberties, or able to
influence Elections in the Country,
eſpecially as they may be reſtrain'd
by Law from intermedling in ſuch
Matters, and becauſe the Officers
made uſe of for the Collecting ſuch
Revenues, are generally taken out
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:51665:72"/>
from the Lees of the People, and
are Perſons without Intereſt or Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
               <p>The Exciſe on Beer and Ale has
given ſuch Knowledge and Light in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Revenues of that kind, and has
chalk'd out ſo plain a way of dividing
the Kingdom equally among the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers,
and inſtructed ſo many Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
how to ſurvey the ſeveral Makers,
Sellers, and Retailers, and to obviate
Frauds, that Exciſes will now be
ſooner underſtood, more eaſily col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected,
and with fewer Officers than
is commonly apprehended by ſuch as
have not thought maturely upon this
Subject.</p>
               <p>And the Books of Hearth-Money,
and the late Poles, have likewiſe gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
us ſuch an Inſight into the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the People, and the Abilities
of the reſpective Families, that it
would not be difficult to make ſome
Computation, what the Exciſe upon
any Commodity would produce;
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:51665:72"/>
Political Arithmetick being a good
Guide in theſe Matters; though it
gives not demonſtrative Proofs: So
that the Parliament would not be
quite in the Dark in laying any Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
of that nature.</p>
               <p>As for Example, from the Exciſe
of <hi>London,</hi> a Computation may be
made, what a Duty of 3 <hi>d. per</hi> Buſhel
upon all the Malt of <hi>England</hi> would
produce, in this manner.</p>
               <p>There was brew'd in <hi>London,</hi> the
Year, ending the 24th of <hi>June</hi> 1689,
1,212,550 Barrels of ſtrong Beer and
Ale, and 827,544 Barrels of Small
Beer, ſo, of both ſorts of Drink, there
was brew'd 2,040,094 Barrels. To
the Strong Beer and Ale, there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
three Buſhels to the Barrel, and
to the Small one Buſhel; but much
Small Beer being brew'd after the
Strong, it may be a reaſonable Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium
to allow to both Drinks, one
with another, two Buſhels to the
Barrel; at which Rate, to reckon by
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:51665:73"/>
round Numbers, there is uſed in
<hi>London</hi> 4,000,000 of Buſhels of
Malt.</p>
               <p>The People of <hi>England,</hi> by the
neareſt Computations that can be
made, are reckon'd Seven Millions;
of which <hi>London</hi> is accounted a Tenth
Part; ſo that there may be in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
700,000 People, divide the
4,000,000 by 700,000, and there
will be found to each Man 5 Buſhels
7 Tenths of Buſhel. But the Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of two Buſhels to the Barrel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
rather of the leaſt, we may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably
allow to each Man's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
ſix Buſhels of Malt in a
Year, which would be 4,200,000
Buſhels, that is, about three Barrels a
Year, which to the Maſs of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
blended together, will be about
a Quart a day.</p>
               <p>So that if <hi>London,</hi> which is a Tenth
part of the Peopl, conſume 4,200,000
Buſhels of Malt, the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
which are ſeven Millions, may
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:51665:73"/>
conſume 42,000,000 Buſhels, which,
at 3 <hi>d. per</hi> Buſhel, would produce
525,000 <hi>l. per Annum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where the uſe of any Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is pernicious to the Intereſt of the
Nation, or prejudicial to the Health
of the People, ſuch an Exciſe may
be there laid, as may amount to a
Prohibition of the Commodity.</p>
               <p>Particularly, ſuch Foreign Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
may be highly charged, the
Importation of which hinders the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
our own Poor to work.</p>
               <p>And here it may not be amiſs to
take notice, that if the Duty upon
Brandy and Spirits was ſo high, as
to amount to a Prohibition of them,
their Want in the King's Revenue
would be recompenced to him in his
Cuſtoms upon Wine, and Exciſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
other Liquors, which undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
they hinder.</p>
               <p>How Brandy obtains among the
common People, may be collected
from this, That for a long while the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:51665:74"/>
Importation of it has every year
increaſed conſiderably; ſo that in the
Year 1689, there was as much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
as the Exciſe of it at 16 <hi>d. per</hi>
Gallon amounted to about 140,000 <hi>l.</hi>
beſides the Strong Waters made at
Home. And if, as Phyſcians ſay,
it extinguiſhes natural Heat and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite,
it hinders the Conſumption
of Fleſh and Corn in a degree. 'Tis
a growing Vice among the common
People, and may, in time, prevail as
much as Opium with the Turks, to
which many attribute the Scarci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of People in the Eaſt. There is
no way to ſuppreſs the uſe of it ſo
certain, as to lay ſuch a high Duty,
as it may be worth no Man's while
to make it, but for Medicine.</p>
               <p>Exciſes may be made the Engine
to pull down or repreſs ſeveral Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uries,
of which our Laws could yet
never get the better.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:51665:74"/>
And ſuppoſe theſe Duties ſhould
make many Commodities ſo much
the dearer, as to leſſen their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption,
if thereby Luxury in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
could be kept down, and the
Nation driven more to Thrift,
it would perhaps, tend greatly to
our publick Wealth; and that No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
if truly examined, will proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
be found falſe, that Riot and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence,
in private Perſons, is advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious
to the Publick.</p>
               <p>Unleſs the Nation does unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly
and freely give into Exciſes,
upon a full Conviction that they are
the beſt <hi>Ways and Means</hi> of Supply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Government, it will not be
the Intereſt of any King to deſire
ſuch a Revenue. For if they are
carryed but by a ſmall Majority, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Senſe and Grain of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
part of the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
they will come ſo crampt in
the Act of Parliament, and loaded
with ſo many Difficulties, that they
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:51665:75"/>
will only occaſion great Clamors in
the Kingdom, and not yield much
Money.</p>
               <p>Whenever Revenues of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
are ſet on foot, all poſſible ways
muſt be uſed, that humane Wiſdom
can think of; to give, in other Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
Safety, Eaſe, Wealth, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity
to the Nation.</p>
               <p>But; as the Foundation of all, it
muſt be made apparent, by every
ſtep, that the Liberties of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
are the chiefeſt View, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Care of the Government; for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe can encourage them to
truſt the Court, in a Matter that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
ſo nice and new, as a Home
Exciſe.</p>
               <p>All things muſt be done that may
effectually increaſe the Value of
Rents, and Price of Land, which
will add true Strength to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:51665:75"/>
All Laws that would tend to the
Relief of the Poor, and ſetting them
to work, would make Exciſes, and
indeed all other Taxes, eaſier to the
Kingdom.</p>
               <p>The Poor-Rate, as has been ſaid
before, in the latter end of King
<hi>Charles</hi> the Second's Reign, came to
about 665,362 <hi>l.</hi> And we have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to think 'tis now much higher,
becauſe of the great Decay in our
Foreign Trade, and Home Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture.
Beſides which Sum, there
is yearly given a vaſt deal to their
Relief in voluntary Charity and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions;
ſo, that in time of Peace,
we pay near as much to the Poor,
as to the Maintenance of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and for our Protection.</p>
               <p>But, as this Money is managed in
moſt Places, inſtead of relieving ſuch
as are truly poor and Impotent,
(which the Laws deſign) it ſerves on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to nouriſh and continue Vice and
Sloath in the Nation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:51665:76"/>
If publick Work-houſes were ſet
up in every Town and County, and
if the Works and Manufactures,
proper for ever Place and Country,
were fixed and eſtabliſhed in it, the
Poor would be encouraged, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited
to Labor and Induſtry; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
if the Magiſtrate made uſe of
his coercive Power upon ſuch as are
Vicious and Idle.</p>
               <p>The real and true Objects of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
would coſt the Nation but little
to maintain; and 'tis to be doubted
they have the leaſt Share in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Reliefs.</p>
               <p>The Wiſdom of a Parliament may,
in time, find out a way to make ſuch
Perſons uſeful and profitable to the
Nation, who, at preſent, are a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
Burthen upon it.</p>
               <p>If all the Hands in this Kingdom
that are able, were employ'd in uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Labour, our Manufactures would
ſo increaſe, that the Common-wealth
would be thereby greatly inriched,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:51665:76"/>
and the Poor, inſtead of being a
Charge, would be a Benefit to the
Kingdom.</p>
               <p>If the Poor were always certain of
Work, and Pay for it, they would
be glad to quit that Naſtineſs which
attends a begging and lazy Life.</p>
               <p>And if the Poor were encouraged,
and, where there is occaſion, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd
to maintain themſelves; the
Pound Rate would be much leſs in
every County; and if the Nation
were a little eas'd of that Burthen,
we ſhould be in ſome degree, abler to
ſupport the Expence of the War, and
Land would be eas'd, upon which
the Poor-Rate is a certain Charge.</p>
               <p>Nothing would better enable us
to pay Exciſes, and all other Taxes,
than a publick Regiſtry, a General
Liberty of Conſcience, and indeed
all Laws that would effectually invite
People over to us, and increaſe our
Numbers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:51665:77"/>
People are the real Strength and
Riches of a Country; we ſee how
Impotent <hi>Spain</hi> is for want of Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants,
with their Mines of Gold
and Silver, and the beſt Ports and
Soil in the World; and we ſee how
powerful their Numbers make the
<hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces,</hi> with bad Harbors,
and the worſt Climate upon Earth.
'Tis perhaps better that a People
ſhould want Country, than that a
Country ſhould want People. Where
there are but few Inhabitants, and a
large Territory, there is nothing but
Sloath and Poverty; but when great
Numbers are confin'd to a narrow
Compaſs of Ground, Neceſſity puts
them upon Invention, Frugality and
Induſtry; which, in a Nation, are
always recompenced with Power and
and Riches.</p>
               <p>And this happened to the <hi>Phoeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi>
who were the old Inhabitants
of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and elbowed out by the

were forced upon Trade, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
the firſt Navigators and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants

               <p>

               <p>No Country can be truly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
great and powerful by the
Extent of its Territory, or Fertility
of its Climate, but by the Multitude
of its Inhabitants; and rich Soils not

to all Invaders.</p>
               <p>Where Countries are thinly Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited,

Land and Rents would as certainly
riſe, as Land and Rents ſet better
near a Populous City than at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
from it.</p>
               <p>There are many Laws which
would invite over to us that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement
of Inhabitants which our
Country ſeems to want; and tho'
vve ſhould get at firſt only the
Poorer ſort, yet thoſe Mouths
vvould conſume our Home Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
and thoſe Hands vvould
help us in our Wars; and in Peace,
by their Labour, over-pay the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for their keeping.</p>
               <p>But a Public Regiſtry, and a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Liberty of Conſcience, would
bring among us from abroad the
very Species of Money, real and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſick
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:51665:78"/>
Wealth, Subſtantial Men,
and all ſort of Manufactures.</p>
               <p>Some People are afraid that Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners
may take the Bread from
the Common People, whom Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
by reaſon of their Induſtry and
ſpare Living, are able to under-work
and under-ſell; And that Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners
may have, in time, ſtrength
enough to awe the Natives. And
others believe, That Tolerating all
Religions may be hurtful to the
Church. But theſe Opinions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from a narrowneſs of Mind,
not becoming Religious and Wiſe
Men.</p>
               <p>For God can Protect his own
Cauſe in the middle of a thouſand
Errors, and variety of Hereſies will
but give our Church-Men a more
ample Field of ſhewing their Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Piety.</p>
               <p>The ſame Protection, and the
ſame Laws, will give Foreigners the
ſame Intereſt, with the Natives, and
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:51665:79"/>
in time, probably, the ſame Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
               <p>And the Induſtrious Frugality of
Foreign Handycrafts-Men, will be a
good Correction to the Sloth and
Luxury of our own Common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p>At a time when Tyranny is ſo
much the faſhion round about us, if
our Arms were open to receive all
the afflicted and oppreſſed part of
Mankind, the Goodneſs of our Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
Mildneſs of our Laws, and
the Excellence of our Conſtitution,
would invite over to us ſuch multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes,
as would exceedingly add to
our Power and Strength, and make
us more a Ballance to the greatneſs
of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And with theſe Additions of
Strength, Exciſes would be leſs felt
by any part of the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>But there are many real Lovers of
their Country, and Jealous of its Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties,
who object againſt Exciſes, and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:51665:79"/>
ſay, They will be ſo eaſie and little
felt, that the Miniſters, ſome time
or other, may be tempted, if ſuch a
Revenue were once afoot, to get it
ſettled into a perpetuity, or for a
long term, and ſo make Parliaments
uſeleſs.</p>
               <p>They ſay, Land-Taxes, Polls, and
Cuſtoms, lye ſo heavy upon the
Men of Intereſt and Figure in the
Nation, that by ſuch kind of Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions,
the Gentlemen of <hi>England</hi>
will never enable a King to live
without a Parliament.</p>
               <p>But Exciſes being an eaſie way of
Contributing, inſenſibly paid, and
falling chiefly upon the common
ſort, they apprehend our Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives
may, ſome time or other, by
the Arts and Power of the Court, be
prevailed upon to let them paſs into
a laſting Supply to the Crown; and
they think ſo large a Revenue would
make the Prince abſolutely Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:51665:80"/>
of his People, which would
quite deſtroy our Conſtitution.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, ſome of our former
Princes have had deſigns to Enſlave
this Country, partly led into thoſe
Meaſures by the Gentries Flattery,
and Corruption of their Manners,
who have been all along willing
enough to Traffick the peoples
Rights.</p>
               <p>However, the Nation was never
yet ſo deprav'd, but there was a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
ſtrong enough in the Houſe of
Commons to preſerve the being of
Parliaments, which would ceaſe if
they ſhould make the Crown rich
enough to ſubſiſt without them.</p>
               <p>This Party will ever, with jealous
Eyes, watch the motions of the
Court; ſome, perhaps, only to bring
their Abilities and Repute with the
People to the better Market; others,
to wreak their Diſcontents, and ſome
out of meer Love to their Country;
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:51665:80"/>
though it may be feared, the Public
has but few Friends that are ſo truly
upon the ſcore of Vertue and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty.</p>
               <p>Theſe will always be ready to
make a ſtand in the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
in caſe, hereafter, the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
ſhould have any deſigns to make
Kings Independant on Parliaments.</p>
               <p>But in the preſent poſture of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
and in a long proſpect of the
future, it is not probable any thing
will be Enterpriſed upon Liberty:
For there are thoſe, on the other ſide
the Water, that would ſufficiently
improve, to their advantage, any falſe
ſteps that ſhould be made of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
and, while our fears of <hi>France</hi>
and Popery continue, the ſide that is
for keeping the Government within
its ancient limits, will have always
ſufficient ſtrength and credit in the
Nation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:51665:81"/>
No King, with Deſpotick Power
and an Army, could Levy a third
part of that Money in this Country,
which is now paid in a quiet and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
manner.</p>
               <p>If our Kingdom had been under
Arbitrary Power, when we broke
with <hi>France,</hi> in all probability the
Conqueſt of us had not been the
Work of two Campagnes; For no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but Liberty, our Intereſt in the
Laws, and Property, could have
made us willing to endure ſuch a
heavy War, and able to bear its
Expence.</p>
               <p>The Rights and Liberties of a
Free People, are chiefly what we
have to oppoſe againſt the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
Wealth, Oeconomy, and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
Skill of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that there ſeems the leſs rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to fear any breach upon our
Conſtitution, becauſe it is as much
the Intereſt of the Prince, as our
own, to preſerve it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:51665:81"/>
Nor can a great Tax of any kind
be laid, which will fall ſo eaſie upon
the People, as that the entire Body
of the Nation will not find it ſelf
concern'd to throw it off in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as ſoon as that Neceſſity cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
which firſt brought it on.</p>
               <p>All Taxes whatſoever, are in their
laſt reſort a Charge upon Land;
and though Exciſes will affect Land
in no degree like Taxes that Charge
it directly, yet Exciſes will always
lye ſo heavily upon the Landed Men,
as to make them concern'd in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to continue ſuch Duties no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
than the Neceſſity of the War
continues.</p>
               <p>Beſides, when 'tis ſaid Exciſes are
eaſie, 'tis in reſpect of other Taxes,
and in regard they Charge every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual
Man more equally than other
Impoſitions: For all <hi>Ways and Means</hi>
whatſoever, that raiſe great Sums,
and drein the Country of Money,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:51665:82"/>
are, and ever will be, thought bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenſome
to the whole.</p>
               <p>And though the Dangers which
threaten from Abroad, have made
us willing to raiſe ſuch great Sums,
as for theſe late Years have been Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied
in <hi>England,</hi> yet all Men know,
that in Times of Peace, they are far
above the Value, Wealth and Power
of this Country, and cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued,
nor under any head whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
paid a long ſpace, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving
the People of that Stock
which ſhould carry on their Labour,
Trade, and Manufacture, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently,
introducing Univerſal Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty.</p>
               <p>So that there ſeems little reaſon to
fear the Gentlemen in Parliament can
ever be prevail'd upon to make Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes
a ſtanding Revenue.</p>
               <p>There are other Taxes, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably,
in their conſequence, may
prove more dangerous to Liberty
than Exciſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:51665:82"/>
The Rights of the People are ſafe
ſo long as we preſerve Parliaments;
and while that Poſt is ſecure, and
well guarded, we are out of danger;
our felicity being ſuch, That we
cannot be undone, but by our ſelves,
and by our own conſent.</p>
               <p>Thoſe Kings who have deſign'd
the ſubverting of our Laws, by force
and open War, as King <hi>John, Harry</hi> the
Third, <hi>Edward</hi> and <hi>Richard</hi> the 2d,
could never prevail; on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
their attempts did end in procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to the Nation more ample
Charters of Freedom.</p>
               <p>But thoſe Princes have been more
likely, and nearer to compaſs their
ends, who have had the Art to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine
our Priviledges by corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Parliaments.</p>
               <p>And nothing can ſooner diſpoſe
the Gentry to that Corruption, and
put them more in the power of the
Court, than ſuch heavy Taxes as will
make them uneaſie in their Fortunes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:51665:83"/>
And the Subverſion of moſt free
Governments that we read of, has
happen'd when the Gentry has been
Ambitious, and overwhelm'd with
Debts, and preſs'd with too great
Neceſſities.</p>
               <p>If theſe hight Land-Taxes, are long
continued in a Country ſo little given
to Thrift as ours, the Landed Men
muſt inevitably be driven into the
Hands of Scriveners, Citizens, and
Uſurers, except ſome few of the moſt
wary Families.</p>
               <p>And in ſuch a caſe, the Country
Gentlemen would ſtill preſerve the
Intereſt of being choſen into the
Parliament for a time, becauſe they
would hold their Eſtates till they
are evicted out of them by Law, or
forc'd to ſell to their Creditors, who,
indeed, are the true Owners.</p>
               <p>Now can there in the World, be
a circumſtance more dangerous to
the Liberty of a Nation, than to
have the real Right, Intereſt, and
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:51665:83"/>
Property of Land, in one Hand, and
the Power of being choſen into Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
in another?</p>
               <p>To preſerve the Rights of this
Nation, we ſhould be Repreſented
by ſuch as have the greateſt ſhare in
Property.</p>
               <p>And yet if theſe high Land-Taxes
ſhould laſt any conſiderable time,
the real Property of Land will belong
to the Bankers and Uſurers, and we
ſhall be in a great meaſure Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
by ſuch as have only the name
and ſhow of Eſtates.</p>
               <p>And 'tis left to the Conſideration
of any Impartial Man, whither ſuch
a Parliament would not be entirely
in the Power, and at the Devotion
of the Court: And whither Liberty
would not be thereby more endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger'd,
than by making Exciſes a
Fond of Revenue for this War.</p>
               <p>When the People grow once ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate,
as to ſurrender the Rights
of the Nation, there is no ward againſt
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:51665:84"/>
ſuch Corruption; and a Parliament
that would conſent to continue Exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
beyond the neceſſities of the War,
would give up <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> or ſettle
the preſent Land-Taxes into a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity
upon the Crown. But 'tis hoped
there are not hands enow in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
to help a few Flatterers in the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
down the Fences of our Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and to promote a deſign that
would as well ruin the King as his
People.</p>
               <p>If an Honorable and Safe Peace be
ſo much in our Power as ſome Men
imagine, there will be no occaſion of
new <hi>Ways and Means</hi> of ſupplying the
Government.</p>
               <p>But if we are ſo jealous of our Trade,
and Maratime Intereſt, as to deſire the
War may be continued, till the Naval
Power of <hi>France</hi> be a little humbled
and broken, then it vvill import us to
think on the <hi>Ways and Means</hi> proper
for the carrying on a buſineſs of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
and length.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:51665:84"/>
Upon the whole matter, it would
be much for the Honour and Safety
of <hi>England,</hi> if we could bring it
about, to anſwer the Years Expence,
with the Revenue that ſhall ariſe
within the Year; and not to live
upon Anticipations, which eat us out
with Intereſt-Money, and run the
Nation into a long Debt.</p>
               <p>All reaſonable Men muſt grant,
that if the Government could be
otherways ſupplied, it were expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to let Land breath a little, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to give the Country Gentlemen
opportunity to repair the breaches
which are lately made in their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes.</p>
               <p>And in all likelihood, Exciſes
might maintain the whole War, if
they can be ſo ſettled, as the giving
of them may not hazard the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.</p>
               <p>But if Exciſes are thought dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
to Liberty, there ſeems good
reaſon to believe, that an Aid of

                  </gap>ound upon
Land, and Money, join'd with a
Quarterly Poll, and all juſtly and
fairly Levied through the whole
Kingdom, would near ſupply the
preſent Neceſſities.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Ariſtides, Cimon,</hi> and <hi>Themiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi>
or any of the Ancient Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies,
could riſe from the Dead,
they would be aſtoniſh'd at our
proceedings, and wonder to ſee
a Nation, that fights for the Cauſe
of Liberty, Tax themſelves partially,
and not with due proportion.</p>
               <p>'Twas not by ſuch Meaſures, in
their Public Aſſemblies, that the
<hi>Grecians</hi> ſo long withſtood the <hi>Perſian</hi>
Monarchy, but by obſerving, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
