            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

But there is no clearer evidence of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Original of Humane Judicatures, than the ſolemn uſe of <hi>Oaths,</hi> there: Which are a plain recognizing God as the Supream Judge of all, and an Appeal to the High Court of Heaven; For though the Sovereign of the World do communicate his Authority to our Magiſtrates, yet his Attribute of <hi>Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi> is incommunicable; they are capable of repreſenting his Perſon, but not able to diſcern the hearts and thoughts of others. Wherefore ſince there is one part of God's Judicial Perfections that no mortal Judge can receive, <hi>viz.</hi> the knowledge of Mens
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:44754:3"/>
Thoughts, a point ſo neceſſary, that no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible and certain Judgment can be given without it: Therefore in all Controverſies, where the Parties make contrary affirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, there lies an Appeal <hi>to the greater</hi>

            </p>
            <p>And certainly this uſe of Oaths is very ſacred and moſt neceſſary, being a clear ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of God's glory, an evident teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Divine Original of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates Power, and the great ſupport of the adminiſtration of that Juſtice which is the Bond of all Societies. But yet there are ſome ſo ignorant and abſurd as to deny they are lawful, others ſo ſtupid and inconſiderate to take them without reverence, and ſwallow them as Common things; yea, too many ſo Impious to uſe them to gain credit to what they know to be falſe. For the redreſs of which dangerous Errors and Impieties, I ſuppoſe it will be a very ſeaſonable and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:44754:4"/>
undertaking upon this Occaſion to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain this piece of holy Scripture,
<q>For men verily ſwear, &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Wherein we will firſt conſider the Apoſtles general deſign in this place, which will prove the lawfulneſs of Taking Oaths in Judicial caſes. Secondly, we will obſerve the ſeveral particulars contained in the words; which repreſent to us, 1. The nature of an Oath, <hi>For men verily ſwear by the greater.</hi> 2. The reaſon of an Oath, <hi>viz. for Confirmation.</hi> 3. The end and uſe of it in Judgment, to be <hi>an end of all ſtrife.</hi> And ſince a Religious Oath is the foundation of all our Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of Juſtice, the main hinge upon which all theſe Controverſies turn, the only ſecurity that the Reverend Judges, the Jurors, and the Witneſſes do give, that they will ſpeak and act uprightly: doubtleſs no Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject can be more ſuitable or advantagious for this time and place; which therefore we will proſecute in our propoſed Method.</p>
            <p>Firſt, We conſider the Apoſtles general de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, and the occaſion of bringing in theſe words here: And we may obſerve, He is here perſwading the <hi>Hebrews</hi> to imitate their Pious
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44754:4"/>
Anceſtors, in relying on the Truth of God, exhorting them <hi>to be followers of them, who by Faith and Patience inherited the Promiſes,</hi> v. 12. adding, that the Promiſe it ſelf was worthy to be truſted, becauſe it had the higheſt and moſt ſolemn confirmation imaginable, being ſecured by <hi>the Oath of God,</hi> and that no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Oath neither. Not ſuch as the Poets feign the Heathen gods took, whom <hi>Lactan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> derides for their ſwearing by the <hi>Stygian</hi> Lake, a thing meaner than themſelves <note n="k" place="margin">
                  <hi>Lactant.</hi> Inſtit. l. 1. c. 11.</note>. But as Sovereign Princes having no equal in their Kingdom whoſe witneſs can add any Authority to their ſolemn Acts, conclude them with a <hi>Teſte meipſo,</hi> and are witneſſes to themſelves: ſo the King of Kings, <hi>when he made the Promiſe to</hi> Abraham, <hi>becauſe he could ſwear by no greater, ſware by himſelf,</hi> Ver. 13, 14, 15. <hi>Confirming his promiſe</hi> (ſaith <hi>Philo) by an Oath worthy of God,—and therefore he did not ſwear by any other, becauſe there was none greater nor better than he</hi> 
               <note n="l" place="margin">
                  <hi>Philo</hi> le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis Allegor. l. 2. pag. 98.</note>. And leſt any ſhould object, What need was there for the God of Truth to ſwear, <hi>who is ſo far from being made more credible by an Oath</hi> (as the ſame <hi>Philo</hi> notes) <hi>that he only makes an Oath to be firm</hi> 
               <note n="m" place="margin">
                  <hi>Philo</hi> de ſacr. <hi>Cain</hi> &amp; <hi>Abel,</hi> p. 146.</note>;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:44754:5"/>
and (as S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſpeaks) <hi>He alone is the Judge of them that Swear, and the Avenger of them that Swear falſly</hi> 
               <note n="n" place="margin">
                  <hi>Ambroſ.</hi> de eod. T. 1. p. 147.</note>. Therefore the Apoſtle pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents that ſcruple, in the words of the Text, by declaring that an Oath was not neceſſary with reſpect to God, who made the Promiſe, but in compliance to Men who were to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it; in condeſcenſion to their infirmity, He was content to imitate humane Cuſtoms, and to give the ſame ſecurity for his own truth, which men are wont to give for theirs; <hi>For men verily ſwear by the greater, &amp;c.</hi> that is, This is the way (ſaith our Apoſtle) by which men confirm things uncertain, this is the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod they uſe to conclude, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, all doubtful Controverſies where one affirms what the other denies, the higheſt and beſt Means they have to end this ſtrife (which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe would not ceaſe) is to make the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſwear by the Name of God. And the Divine Majeſty was pleaſed to take our mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures in tranſacting his Covenant with us, for he ſwear to confirm it, not by a greater in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed (as we do) becauſe there was no greater, but <hi>by himſelf.</hi> Gen. xxii. 16. <hi>By my ſelf have I ſworn, ſaith the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> and upon this
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44754:5"/>
               <hi>Abraham</hi> did believe the Promiſe, and ſo ought we alſo.</p>
            <p>Now from the words thus explained we infer, <hi>That it is lawful for Chriſtians to uſe an Oath for confirmation in ſolemn Caſes.</hi> We ſee that God did take an Oath, and <hi>if Oaths were evil in themſelves, 'tis certain God would not ſwear</hi> 
               <note n="o" place="margin">
                  <hi>Si enim per ſe malum eſſet jurare profectò Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus non juraſſet.</hi> Decret. l 2. Tit. 24. c. 6. p. 895.</note>, ſince he can neither do nor be tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted to do evil, <hi>James</hi> I. 13. yea his Swearing certainly proves, it is good in its own nature: and His Oath being deſigned to comply with humane cuſtom, as a confirmation of the Truth of his Word on a great and juſt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; by this Imitation and deſign, God hath ratified and approved our ſolemn uſe of Oaths in deciding differences. This one Act of his declaring it lawful to ſwear in all ſuch caſes. Beſides, the Apoſtle here relates the uſe of Oaths in Judgment, ſuppoſing it univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally practiced by <hi>Gentiles, Jews,</hi> and <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> at that time; for he ſaith (not ye <hi>Hebrews</hi> ſwear, or ye (before your Converſion) did ſwear; but) <hi>Men verily ſwear, &amp;c.</hi> that is, all Men do it now. Nor doth he on this occaſion give any intimation either of his diſlike of this general cuſtom, or that it was not to be

allowed to the Chriſtians ſo to do: wherefore we may conclude from his recording this uſage without making any exception to it, and his juſtifying it from the example of God himſelf, that the Apoſtle did allow and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove this uſe of Oaths.</p>
            <p>But our obſtinate Adverſaries, without conſidering how to anſwer theſe Arguments, will preſently object, That Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Swear not at all,</hi> Math. V. 34. and S. <hi>James</hi> adds, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all things, my Brethren, Swear not,</hi> Jam.

            <p>To which I ſhall reply, That ſince 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious to ſuppoſe thoſe Scriptures can contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict this Text, it is reaſonable to believe, that ſome other kind of Swearing is there forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and not that which is commended here; and it is very plain to unprejudiced Men, that our Saviour is ſpeaking of no other Oaths, but thoſe uſed in common diſcourſe, for the next words are, <hi>but let your communication be yea, yea, nay, nay,</hi> ver. 37. which ſhews, he was treating only of <hi>Oaths</hi> in our ordinary Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, which might be wholly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:44754:6"/>
if in our common talk we barely affirmed things by a plain <hi>yea,</hi> or <hi>yes,</hi> or bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly denied them by a plain <hi>nay,</hi> or <hi>no:</hi> and the inſtances he gives of ſwearing <hi>by Heaven, by Earth, by Jeruſalem,</hi> and <hi>by their Head,</hi> ver. 34, 35, 36. were all of that ſort of Oaths which the <hi>Jews</hi> uſed in their uſual diſcourſe, and not one of them was ever uſed in Judgment, where they only ſwear <hi>by the living God,</hi> Math. xxvi. 63. Indeed the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> to take the <hi>Jews</hi> off from the wicked cuſtom of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Swearing by Gods Name, did allow them in their common-talk to ſwear by theſe leſſer things, perſuading them there was lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle danger in them, and no great obligation by them, <hi>Math.</hi> xxiii. 16, &amp;c. But <hi>Jeſus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves this falſe gloſs of the Third Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, declaring, that in our Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication one with another we muſt not ſwear at all, neither by God nor the Creatures; for in our uſual diſcourſe a bare Yes or No is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and whatever is more, comes from either the evil cuſtom of the Speaker, or the evil and jealous temper of the Hearer.

by the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> falſe Teachers, to ſwear in their uſual talk by Heaven, or by Earth, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Oath; but to be ſure always to affirm what was to be affirmed by a plain, Yea, and deny what was to be denied by a ſingle, Nay; leſt they fell under Gods condemnation for profaning his Name <note n="p" place="margin">

            <p>And the Practice of the beſt Chriſtians a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly aſſures us, it was never believed that ſolemn Oaths on great Occaſions were forbidden in the Goſpel. <hi>This Apoſtle S.</hi> Paul, <hi>who certainly knew his Maſters mind</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Auguſtine) did Swear</hi>

But this ſhort and clear account of the Senſe of Holy Scripture, and the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and Practice of the beſt Chriſtians may abundantly ſatisfie all that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced, That Solemn Oaths in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are not only very lawful, but uſeful and neceſſary, and have been uſed by all Men of all Religions as moſt Sacred things: <hi>For Men verily ſwear, &amp;c.</hi> that is, all Men do ſo, and God imitates the uſe, and S. <hi>Paul</hi> records it with approbation. Yet, that Mens irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent taking, and impious breaking of Oaths, may not prejudice this uſeful Inſtitution, nor be an offence to ſuch as are really tender; I ſhall paſs from this proof of the Lawfulneſs of Swearing in general, to conſider the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of the Text: wherein,</p>

            <p>Secondly, The Text informs us of the Reaſon of an Oath, or the Cauſe which

moves a Man to take it; which is, that it may be (<gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>) <hi>For Confirmation.</hi> The Heart of Man is deep and deceitful, ſo that none but only God knows whether mens Words and Hearts agree: And Evil men (being aſſured no Mortal can diſcover their Thoughts) hence preſume, for Gain, or to favour a Friend, yea to hurt a Foe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, to ſpeak what they know to be falſe. But though no Man can diſprove them, the God of Truth ſees their Hearts; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore All Nations have uſed to enjoyn Men, to call upon the All-ſeeing God to atteſt the Truth of what they ſay, with a wiſh of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction to Themſelves, if the Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, who knows their Thoughts, do not allow their Words for Truth. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it may well be ſuppoſed, none will dare to do this open Affront to the God of Heaven, nor expoſe themſelves to his Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, who will diſcover, and can deſtroy them if they ſpeak falſly: Therefore an Oath is the <hi>moſt ſolemn Confirmation of what we af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm in doubtful Caſes, the readieſt way to gain credit to our Words, and the moſt Sacred ſecurity we can give for our Truth and Veracity</hi>

the leſs, and not the more, for our Vain-Swearing.

is this, <hi>He that after his Pledge given for his Truth, dares tell a Lie for favour or Malice, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fears God, nor loves himſelf; he is a deſperate Wretch, unfit for Human Society, and really doth far more miſchief to himſelf than to his Adverſary.</hi> And ſince an <hi>Oath</hi> is thus guarded, we may well be content it ſhould end all Strife among us, for no greater Security under Heaven can be given or deviſed. Now from this deſcription of the <hi>End of an Oath,</hi> we will obſerve,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That Perjury,</hi> eſpecially in Courts of Juſtice, <hi>is a heinous and horrid Impiety:</hi> the very End of theſe Courts is to find out <hi>Truth,</hi> and But to ſpeak <hi>falſly</hi> there, though by ſuch as are not upon their Oath, is to affront the <hi>Vice-gerents</hi> of God, and wickedly to deſign to <hi>pervert Judgment,</hi> as well as to make that <hi>holy Inſtitution</hi> uſeleſs, which is the great Security of all Societies. But when Men come to Swear, <hi>God</hi> himſelf is directly appealed to, the <hi>Searcher of all Hearts</hi> is ſet upon the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal, and the Perjured Wretch <hi>Lies not unto Men, but unto God,</hi> Acts V. 4. He defies the <hi>King of Heaven</hi> to his face, and affronts him openly in ſome of his tendereſt Attributes, disbelieving his <hi>Truth,</hi> tràmpling on his <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and deſpiſing his <hi>Power;</hi> yea, he makes (as much as in him lies) the <hi>Righteous God</hi> a Party to that <hi>Falſhood,</hi> by which
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:44754:19"/>
he Murders or Robs his Neighbour; ſaying, as <hi>Philo</hi> hath elegantly expreſſed it, <hi>O God, I ſhould not be believed but for thy Name, and therefore I uſe thee for the Cloak of my Injuſtice; I would not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered in my ſin, do thou help me, and take the blame on thy ſelf; for though I am a Tranſgreſſor by thy Name, I ſhall paſs for an Honeſt man; thou neither loveſt Truth, nor puniſheſt Falſhood</hi> 
               <note n="i" place="margin">Philo <hi>de legibus in Specie differ.</hi>
               </note>. This horrid Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy is the import of all Perjury, the very I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the Falſe-Swearers Thoughts, and can any thing be more wicked? This accurſed Sin, not only flies in the Face of God, but by gilding <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Lies</hi> with his Name, miſleads that Sacred Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority he hath ſet over us for ſecuring our Rights, and endeavours to make that the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Revenge and Cruelty; it impoſes upon the moſt upright <hi>Juries,</hi> with deſign to make them Partners in the Crime; it robs an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent man of his <hi>good Name,</hi> his <hi>Eſtate,</hi> his <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,</hi> nay, his very <hi>Life,</hi> if their <hi>falſe Witneſs</hi> be believed: Or if the <hi>Jurors</hi> be the <hi>Perjured Men,</hi> in ſpight of all Evidence, it reſcues the greateſt and moſt dangerous Malefactors (by a <hi>Partiality</hi> that defies Heaven) from the Juſtice of the Law, and encourages not only them, but others to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the like Crimes. And whoſoever they be, <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors</hi> or <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> who regard not their <hi>Oaths,</hi> They
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:44754:20"/>
do what in them lies, to <hi>ſubvert</hi> the Laws, to <hi>take away</hi> the Adminiſtration of Juſtice, and to <hi>ruine</hi> the Community they live in, by baffling this Great and Sacred Inſtrument of our Peace and Safety. If they do this for <hi>Fear</hi> or <hi>Favour,</hi> it ſhews they value <hi>Men</hi> more than <hi>God,</hi> and dare purchaſe Their Love with his utmoſt Diſpleaſure: If they are Perjur'd for <hi>Hire,</hi> they ſell their Souls for a Vile Price, and purchaſe a <hi>Reverſion</hi> in Hell, which they ſhall inherit for ever: If they do it in <hi>Malice,</hi> it is like the Crime of <hi>Witches,</hi> who give their Souls to the <hi>Devil</hi> for ever, to be enabled to do a tranſient harm to their Neighbours. And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be the <hi>Principle</hi> it ſprings from, yea, and whatever event it have as to the Party Accuſed, the Perjur'd Man devotes himſelf to all the <hi>Curſes</hi> in Gods Book, and cuts himſelf off from all hope of the <hi>Divine Help</hi> for ever; and therefore the Old <hi>Romans</hi> allotted no Human Puniſhment for this Sin, but left the <hi>Criminal</hi> to the more terrible Vengeance of the <hi>gods,</hi> who were moſt directly affronted by it <note n="k" place="margin">Tertul. <hi>Apol. c.</hi> 28. <hi>Item Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript.</hi> Alex.

And all Laws deprive theſe Wretches of the Priviledge of <hi>gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Teſtimony</hi> in any other Cauſe, and their <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit</hi> is Eternally blaſted. The <hi>Indians</hi> cut off their <hi>Fingers</hi> and <hi>Toes,</hi> to reduce them to Beggery and Shame; the <hi>Egyptians</hi> put them to <hi>Death,</hi> as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to Live among Mankind after ſo inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable a Wickedneſs. But whatever they ſuffer here, <hi>Damnation</hi> doth await them in the next World, unleſs they do Repent ſincerely, and make Satisfaction alſo. But I hope, we need aggravate this Crime no further, but having ſurveyed all the Particulars of the Text, may now paſs to the Application. And that which naturally follows from the Premiſſes, is,</p>
            <p>Firſt, That all Perſons concerned be very Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious in <hi>taking Oaths,</hi> and that when they come to Swear, they do it with all <hi>Religious Fear</hi> and <hi>Reverence;</hi> not only as being immediately in Gods Preſence, but as making a direct Appeal to him, and offering their <hi>Souls</hi> as a Pledge for the <hi>Truth</hi> of what they ſhall ſpeak; and though the thing they Swear be never ſo True, yet this Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication is ſo venerable, and ſo high a piece of Religion, that it ought to be done with all <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity</hi>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:44754:21"/>
and <hi>humble Reverence;</hi> and if they be ſo ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, to confirm a known and certain <hi>Truth,</hi> they do exceedingly tend to the <hi>Honour of God,</hi> and to the <hi>Benefit of Mankind,</hi> and are ſo very lawful, that we may as well ſcruple to make Application to Gods <hi>Mercy</hi> in Prayer, as to his <hi>Truth</hi> in Solemn Swearing, on a Juſt Occaſion; eſpecially, ſince it is evident by Reaſon and Univerſal Practice, that the <hi>World</hi> cannot well be Governed, nor <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice</hi> Diſpenſed without them; and it is the Abuſe of them, not the Serious and Juſt uſe of <hi>Oaths,</hi> that ought to be avoided.</p>
            <p>Secondly, When we have taken them, let us be very fearful of breaking them, and make Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of anſwering and acting in every Point agreeable to what we have Sworn; let us fear no <hi>Anger,</hi> but that of <hi>Heaven,</hi> nor ſeek no <hi>Favour,</hi> but that of <hi>God,</hi> nor wiſh for any <hi>Gain,</hi> but the <hi>Peace of a good Conſcience.</hi> We ſee, that the Laws of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Men</hi> have put the <hi>End of all Strife</hi> upon our <hi>Fidelity,</hi> ſuppoſing we are <hi>Chriſtians</hi> and <hi>Hóneſt men,</hi> who Fear the <hi>Lord of Hoſts,</hi> and value our own <hi>Souls,</hi> and we have given the greateſt Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty under Heaven, that we will be Impartial. Now, how vile and infamous a Crime will it be in us, to betray his Truſt, to abuſe the <hi>Judge of all the World,</hi> and his <hi>Vice-gerents,</hi> to wrong the <hi>Innocent,</hi>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:44754:21"/>
and deſtroyour own Souls? One would imagine, nothing could tempt a Rational Man to ſuch an Act; if the too frequent and ſad Experience of <hi>Oppoſite,</hi> yea of <hi>Contradictory Oaths</hi> (in this Impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Age of ours) did not convince us, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is too monſtrous or unreaſonable for an <hi>Ill Man</hi> to do. If <hi>Popiſh Zealots,</hi> by Aſſurances of <hi>Diſpenſation,</hi> were the only Perſons, who aſſumed the Impudence to commit this Crime, it would not be ſo very ſtrange: But for Us, who ſay, <hi>No Power on Earth can Cancel this Sacred Bond of an Oath,</hi> for Us to Perjure our ſelves, is at once our Shame, and the Worlds Wonder; doubtleſs ſuch Men deſerve not only the bare Puniſhments of the Law, but to ſuffer an Univerſal Deteſtation, that as they are the <hi>Bane</hi> of our Government, the <hi>Scandal</hi> of our Religion, and the <hi>Enemies</hi> of God, ſo they may be eſteemed and treated as the <hi>Foes</hi> of all Mankind, until by <hi>Sorrow</hi> and <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> they ſhall own their <hi>Faults,</hi> and return to a better <hi>Mind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Finally, Let us Bleſs the <hi>Holy Name of God</hi> for our Good Laws, and the Security we enjoy by them, ſince no Man can hurt us in <hi>Body,</hi> in <hi>Goods,</hi> or <hi>Good Name,</hi> without venturing the <hi>Damnation</hi> of his own Soul; we have excellent Methods to find out the <hi>Guilty,</hi> and clear the <hi>Innocent.</hi> And
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:44754:22"/>
though Evil Men will claim <hi>unjuſtly,</hi> accuſe <hi>falſly,</hi> or deny their <hi>Guilt</hi> impudently, yet while we have ſo <hi>Juſt</hi> and ſo <hi>Prudent Magiſtrates</hi> on Earth, and ſo <hi>Righteous</hi> and <hi>Powerful GOD</hi> in Heaven, we may rationally hope, that all <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, Falſhood,</hi> and <hi>Injuſtice,</hi> ſhall be diſcovered either Here, or Hereafter. <hi>Cicero</hi> mentions a Falſe-witneſs at <hi>Rome,</hi> who was ſtruck Dumb juſt as He was pronouncing that part of his Oath,—<hi>If I willingly ſpeak falſly</hi> 
               <note n="n" place="margin">Cicero, <hi>Epiſt.</hi> l. 7. <hi>ep.</hi> 1.</note>. But if ſuch Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance be not Now preſently executed, let us not deſpair; for there is a Great <hi>Aſſize</hi> coming, where all <hi>Errors</hi> in Judgment ſhall be rectified, and all <hi>Falſe-Swearers</hi> diſcovered and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. But it would prevent many a ſad Sentence at that <hi>Dreadful Day,</hi> and hinder all Publick <hi>Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice</hi> here, if all that are called to this Duty would very ſeriouſly remember, That <hi>They Swear by the Greater;</hi> and ſo their <hi>Oath for Confirmation,</hi> would ever be a Juſt <hi>End of all Strife: Which God of His Mercy grant, for Jeſus Chriſts ſake; to whom, with the Father and the Holy Spirit, be all Honour and Glory, now, and for evermore,</hi>
