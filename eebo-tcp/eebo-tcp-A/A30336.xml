            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Title of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender of the Faith,</hi> is so inherent in the Royal Dignity, and so essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial a part of its security as well as of its glory, that there was no need of Papal Bulls
<pb facs="tcp:42659:5"/>
to add it to the Crown that Your MAJESTY now wears: You hold it by a much better Tenure, as well as by a more ancient Possession. Nor can one reflect on the Pope's gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it to King <hi>Henry</hi> the VIII<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, without remembring what is said of <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> that <hi>being High Priest that year, he Prophesied.</hi> For since that time, the true Faith hath been so eminently Defended by our Princes, and that of both Sexes, we having had our <hi>Pulcheria</hi>'s as well as our <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi>'s and our <hi>Theodose</hi>'s, that this Church has been all along the chief strength and
<pb facs="tcp:42659:5"/>
honour of the Reformation, as well as the main Object of the envy and spite of those of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion.</p>
            <p>But tho Your MAJESTY'S Royal Ancestors have done so much for us, there remains yet a great deal to be done for the compleating of our Reformation, especially as to the Lives and Manners of men. This will most effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually be done by obliging the Clergy to be more exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary in their Lives, and more diligent and faithful in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of their Pastoral Duty. And this Work seems to be reserved for Your MAJE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STIES,
<pb facs="tcp:42659:6"/>
and designed to be the Felicity and Glory of Your Reign. To serve God by promoting this Great and Glorious Design, which is so truly worthy of Your MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>JESTY'S best care and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, I have purposely writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten this Treatise, which I do with all humility Dedicate and present to Your Sacred MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>JESTY.</p>
            <p>May that God who is the King of kings, and hath bless'd us with Two such Excellent Princes, preserve You Both long to us, and make You as happy in us, as we are in You<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> May You Reign over
<pb facs="tcp:42659:6"/>
us till You have accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all those Great Designs for which God hath raised You up, and with which He hath filled Your Hearts: And may this Church be made by Your means <hi>the Perfection of Beauty,</hi> and <hi>the Ioy of the whole Earth.</hi>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THIS Subject, how Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant soever in it self, yet has been so little treated of, and will seem so severe in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny parts of it, that if I had not judged this a necessary service to the Church, which did more decent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come from one, who, how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deserving soever he is, yet is raised to a Post that may justify the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on so tender a Head, I should never have undertaken it. But my Zeal for the true Interests of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and of this Church, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined me to set about it; yet since my Design is to correct things for
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:42659:11"/>
the future, rather than to reproach any for what is past, I have resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to cast it rather into Advices and Rules, into plain and short Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, than into long and laboured Discourses, supported by the shews of Learning, and Citations from Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and Historical Observations; this being the more profitable, and the less invidious way of handling the Subject.</p>
            <p>It ought to be no Imputation on a Church, if too many of those that are dedicated to her Service, have not all the Characters that are here set forth, and that are to be desired in Clergymen. Even in the Apostles days there were false Apostles, and false Teachers; as one of the Twelve was a Traytor, and had a Devil; some loved the pre-eminence, others loved this present World to a scandalous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; some of those that preached
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:42659:11"/>
Christ, did it <hi>not sincerely,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Phil. 16.</note> 
               <hi>but out of contention</hi>; they vied with the Apostles, and hoped to have car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away the esteem from them, even while they were suffering for the Faith: for envying their Credit, they designed to raise their own Authority, by lessening the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles; and so hoped to have <hi>added affliction to their bonds.</hi> In the first and purest Ages of the Church we find great Complaints of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glects and Disorders of the Clergy of all Ranks. Many became the <hi>Stewards</hi> and <hi>Bailiffs</hi> of other Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Estates; and while they look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed too diligently after those <hi>Cares</hi> which did not belong to them, they even in those times of trial, grew very remiss in the most <hi>important</hi> of all <hi>Cares,</hi> which was their proper business.</p>
            <p>As soon as the Empire became Christian, the Authority, the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity,

and the other Advantages, which by the bounty of Princes, followed the Sacred Functions, made them to be generally much desired; and the Elections being then for most part popular, (though in some of the greater Cities, the Magistracy took them into their hands, and the Bishops of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince were the Judges both of the fitness of the Person, and of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity of the Election); these were managed with much faction and violence, which often ended in blood, and that to so great an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, that if we had not Witnesses to many Instances of this among the best men in those Ages, it would look like an uncharitable Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on those Times, to think them capable of such Enormities. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Disorders, the Animosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the going so oft backwards and forwards in the matters of Faith, as
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:42659:12"/>
the Emperors happened to be of different Sides, are but too ample a proof of the Corruptions that had then got into the Church. And what can we think of the breach made in the Churches of <hi>Africk</hi> by <hi>Donatus,</hi> and his Followers, upon so inconsiderable a Point, as whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Cecilian</hi> and his <hi>Ordainers</hi> had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the <hi>Faith</hi> in the last Persecution, or not? which grew to that height, that almost in every Town of <hi>Africk</hi> there were divided Assemblies, and separating Bishops, upon that Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. Nor was this Wound healed but with the utter ruine of those Churches. St. <hi>Ierom,</hi> though par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial enough to his own side, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by his espousing <hi>Damasus</hi>'s In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests, notwithstanding that vast effusion of blood that had been at his Election; which was set on by him, and continued for four days with so much violence, that in one night,
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:42659:13"/>
and at one Church, a hundred and seven and thirty were killed; yet he could not hold from laying open the Corruptions of the Clergy in a very severe style. He grew so weary of them, and they of him, that he went and spent the rest of his days at <hi>Bethlehem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Those Corruptions were so much the more remarkable, because the Eminent Men of those times, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured a great many Canons to be made, both in Provincial and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Councils, for correcting Abuses, as soon as they observed them creeping into the Church: but it is plain from St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi>'s Story, that tho bad men did not oppose the making good Rules, while they were so many dead Letters in their Registers; yet they could not bear the rigorous Execution of them: so that those good <hi>Canons</hi> do shew us indeed what were the growing Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:42659:13"/>
of the Times, in which they were made; and how good men set themselves against them; but are no sure indications of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation that was effected by them.</p>
            <p>The Tottering state of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Empire which had then fallen under a vast Dissolution of Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline and Manners, and coming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to feeble hands, was then sinking with its own weight, and was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come on all sides an easy Prey to its Invaders, who were either <hi>Pagans</hi> or <hi>Arians,</hi> ought to have awakened the Governours of the Church to have apprehended their approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ruin; to have prevented it by their Prayers and Endeavours; and to have corrected those Abuses which had provoked God, and weakned and distracted both Church and Empire. But if we may believe either <hi>Gildas</hi> here in <hi>Britain,</hi> or <hi>Salvian</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> they
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:42659:14"/>
rather grew worse, more impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and more insensible, when they saw the Judgments of God coming upon the Empire, Province after Province rent from it, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-run by the <hi>Barbarians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When that great Wound was in some sort healed, and a Second Form of Christianity rose up and prevailed again in the <hi>Western</hi> Parts, and the World became <hi>Christian</hi> with the allay that dark and superstitious Ages had brought into that holy Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine: Then all the Rules of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Ages were so totally forgotten, and laid aside, that the Clergy u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversally lost their esteem: And tho' <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, and his Son, held a great many Councils for cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting these Abuses, and publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed many <hi>Capitulars</hi> on the same de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign; yet all was to no purpose: There was neither Knowledge nor Vertue enough left to reform a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:42659:14"/>
that was become universal. The Clergy by these Disorders fell under a general Contempt, and out of that rose the Authority, as well as the Wealth of the <hi>Monastick Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>; and when Riches and Power had corrupted them, the <hi>Begging Orders</hi> took away the Credit from both; yet even their Reputation, which the outward severity of their Rule, Habit, and Manner of Life did both establish and maintain long, was at last so generally lost, that no Part or Body of the <hi>Roman-Clergy</hi> had Credit enough to stop the Progress of the <hi>Reformation;</hi> which was in a great measure occasion'd by the scorn and hatred that fell on them, and which was so spread over all the parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> that to it, even their own Historians do im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the great Advances that <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>'s Doctrine made for about Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Years together; whole Kingdoms
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:42659:15"/>
and Provinces embracing it as it were all of the sudden.</p>
            <p>It has now for above an Hundred Years made a full stand, and in most places it has rather lost ground, than gained any. The true ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this is not easily given; the Doctrine is the same; and it has been of late defended with greater A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>vantages, with more Learning, and better Reasoning than it was at first; yet with much less Success. The true reason of the slackning of that Work, must be imputed to the Reformation made in several Points with relation to the Manners, and the Labours of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> by the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> and the Depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation under which most of the <hi>Reformed Churches</hi> are fallen. For the Manners and the Labours of the Clergy, are real Arguments, which all people do both understand and feel; they have a much more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:42659:15"/>
force, they are more visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and perswade more universal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, than Books can do, which are little read, and less considered: And indeed the Bulk of Mankind is so made, that there is no working on them, but by moving their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and commanding their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem. It cannot be denied but that the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> established the Errors of Popery in such a manner, as to cut off all possibility of ever treating, or reuniting with them; since those <hi>Decisions,</hi> and their <hi>Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,</hi> which is their Foundation, are now so twisted together, that they must stand and fall together: Yet they established such a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in <hi>Discipline,</hi> as may make Churches that pretend to a more <hi>Glorious Title,</hi> justly ashamed. For tho, there are such Reserves made for the <hi>Plenitude</hi> of the <hi>Papal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> that in great instances, and
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:42659:16"/>
for a Favourite, all may be broke through; yet the most notorious A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buses are so struck at, and this has been in many places so effectually observed, chiefly where they knew that their Deportment was looked into, and watched over by <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,</hi> that it must be acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the cry of the Scandals of Religious Houses is much laid: And tho' there is still much Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mong their <hi>Mass-Priests;</hi> yet their <hi>Parish-Priests</hi> are generally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother sort of men: They are well instructed in their Religion; lead regular Lives, and perform their Parochial Duties with a most won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful diligence: They do not only say Mass, and the other publick Functions daily, but they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most perpetually imploying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seves in the several parts of their Cures: Instructing the Youth, hearing Confessions, and visiting
<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:42659:16"/>
the Sick: and besides all this, they are under the constant obligation of the <hi>Breviary</hi>: There is no such thing as <hi>Non-residence</hi> or <hi>Plurality,</hi> to be heard of in whole Countries of that Communion; and though about Cathedrals, and in Greater Cities, the vast number of <hi>Priests,</hi> gives still great and just occasion to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; yet the <hi>Parish-Priests</hi> have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most universally recovered the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>f the People: They are no more disposed to think ill of them, or to hearken to any thing that may give them a <hi>just cause,</hi> or at least a <hi>plausible colour</hi> for departing from them. So that the <hi>Reformation</hi> that <hi>Popery</hi> hath been forced to make, has in a great measure stopt the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress of the <hi>Reformation</hi> of the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> and <hi>Worship</hi> that did so long carry every thing before it.</p>
            <p>But this is the least Melancholy part of the Account that may be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:42659:17"/>
of this matter. The <hi>Reformers</hi> began that blessed Work with much Zeal; they and their first Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors carried it on with Learning and Spirit: They were active in their Endeavours, and constant and patient in their Sufferings; and these things turn'd the esteem of the world, which was alienated from <hi>Popery,</hi> by the Ignorance and Scandals of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> all towards them: But when they felt the warmth of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Encouragement that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and States gave them, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensibly slackned; They fell from their <hi>First Heat</hi> and <hi>Love</hi>; they began to build Houses for themselves, and their Families, and neglected the <hi>House of God</hi>: They rested satisfied with their having reformed the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Worship; but did not study to reform the Lives and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of their People: And while in their <hi>Offices</hi> they lamented the not
<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:42659:17"/>
having a <hi>Publick Discipline</hi> in the Church, as it was in the Primitive Times; They have either made no attempts at all, or at least very faint ones for restoring it. And thus, while <hi>Popery</hi> has purified it self from many former Abuses, <hi>Reformed Churches</hi> have added new ones to the old, that they still retain, and are fond of. Zeal in Devotion, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence in the <hi>Pastoral Care,</hi> are fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len under too visible and too scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous a decay. And whereas the understanding of the Scriptures, and an Application to that Sacred Study, was at first the distinguishing Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of <hi>Protestants,</hi> for which they were generally nicknamed <hi>Gospellers</hi>; These <hi>Holy Writings</hi> are now so little studied, that such as are obliged to look narrowly into the matter, find great cause of regret and lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from the gross Ignorance of such as either are in Orders,
<pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:42659:18"/>
or that pretend to be put in them.</p>
            <p>But the most Capital and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive of all Abuses, is, That the false Opinion of the worst Ages of Popery, that made the chief, if not the only obligation of <hi>Priests</hi> to be the performing <hi>Offices</hi>; and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that if these were done, the chief part of their Business was also done, by which the <hi>Pastoral Care</hi> came to be in a great measure neglected, does continue still to leaven us: While men imagine that their whole work consists in Publick <hi>Functions,</hi> and so reckon, that if they either do these themselves, or procure and hire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother person in <hi>Holy Orders</hi> to do them, that then they answer the <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bligation</hi> that lies on them: And thus the <hi>Pastoral Care,</hi> the Instructing, the Exhorting, the Admonishing and Reproving, the directing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting, the visiting and comforting the People of the Parish, is general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="xvii" facs="tcp:42659:18"/>
neglected: while the Incumbent does not think fit to look after it, and the Curate thinks himself bound to nothing but barely to perform Offices according to agreement.</p>
            <p>It is chiefly on design to raise the sense of the Obligations of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy to the Duties of the <hi>Pastoral Care,</hi> that this Book is written. Many things do concur in our present Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, to awaken us of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> to mind and do our duty with more zeal and application than ever. It is very visible that in this present Age, the Reformation is not only at a stand, but is going back, and grows sensibly weaker and weaker. Some Churches have been plucked up by the roots; and brought under a total desolation and dispersion; and others have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len under terrible oppressions and shakings. We have seen a Design formed and carried on long, for the
<pb n="xviii" facs="tcp:42659:19"/>
utter destruction of that <hi>Great Work.</hi> The Clouds were so thick gathered over us, that we saw we were marked out for destruction: And when that was once compass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d, our E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>emies saw well enough, that the rest of their Designs would be more easily brought about. It is true, our Enemies intended to se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> us one upon another by turns, to make us do half their work; and to have still an abused Party among us ready to carry on their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>; for they thought it too bold an Attempt, to fall upon all at once; but while they were thus shifting Hands, it pleased God to cut them short in their Designs; and to blast that part of them in which we were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, so entirely, that now they carry them on more barefacedly: and drive at <hi>Conquest,</hi> which is at one stroke to destroy our <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> our <hi>Laws</hi> and our <hi>Properties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xix" facs="tcp:42659:19"/>In this critical state of things, we ought not only to look at the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Calamities that have fallen so heavily on so many Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Churches, and of the Dangers that hang over the rest; but we ought chiefly to look up to that God, who seems to be provoked at the whole Reformation; because they have not walked suitably to the Light that they have so long enjoyed, and the Blessings which had <hi>been</hi> so long continued to them; but have corrupted their ways be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him. They have lost the <hi>Power of Religion,</hi> while they have seemed to magnify the <hi>Form</hi> of it, and have been zealous for Opinions and Customs; and therefore God has in his <hi>wrath,</hi> taken even that <hi>Form</hi> from them, and has loathed their <hi>Solemn Assemblies</hi>; and brought them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a <hi>famine of the Word of the Lord,</hi> which they had so much despised.
<pb n="xx" facs="tcp:42659:20"/>
While these things are so, and while we find that we our selves, are as a <hi>brand pluck'd out of the fire,</hi> which may be thrown back into it again, if we are not allarmed by the just, but unsearchable Judgments of God, which have wasted other Churches so terribly, while they have only frighted us; what is more evident, than that the present state of things, and the <hi>signs of the times,</hi> call aloud upon the whole Nation to bring forth <hi>fruits meet for repentance? since the ax is laid to the root of the tree.</hi> And as this indeed concerns the body of the Nation, so we who are the <hi>Priests and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of the Lord,</hi> are under more particular Obligations, first to look into our own ways, and to reform whatsoever is amiss among us, and then to be Intercessors for the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, committed to our Charge: to be mourning for their Sins, and by
<pb n="xxi" facs="tcp:42659:20"/>
our secret Fastings and Prayers, to be standing in those Breaches which our crying Abominations have made: and so to be averting those Judgments, which may be ready to break in upon us; and chiefly to be <hi>lifting up our voices like Trumpets, to shew our people their transgressions.</hi> To be giving them faithful <hi>warning,</hi> from which we may expect this blessed success, that we may at least gain upon such a number, that for their sakes, <hi>God, who will not slay the righteous with the wicked,</hi> may be yet entreated for our sins; and that the Judgments which hang over us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing quite dissipated, his Gospel, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with Peace and Plenty, may still dwell among us, and may shine from us, with happy Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences to all the ends of the Earth. And even such Pastors as shall faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully do their duty, but without any success, may depend upon
<pb n="xxii" facs="tcp:42659:21"/>
this, that they shall <hi>save their own souls</hi>; and shall have a distinguished fate, if we should happen to fall under a common Calamity: they having on them not only the <hi>mark of Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> and Intercessors, but of <hi>faithful Shepherds</hi>: Whereas if an overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Scourge should break in upon us, we have all possible reason, both from the Judgments of God, and the present scituation of Affairs, to believe that it will <hi>begin at the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary,</hi> at those who have <hi>profaned</hi> the <hi>holy things;</hi> and have made the <hi>daily Sacrifice to be loathed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is another, and perhaps yet a more dismal Character of the present state of the Age, that calls on the <hi>Clergy,</hi> to consider well both their own deportment, and the Obligations that lie upon them; which is the growing <hi>Atheism</hi> and <hi>Impiety,</hi> that is daily gaining ground, not only among us, but indeed all
<pb n="xxiii" facs="tcp:42659:21"/>
               <hi>Europe</hi> over. There is a Circulation observed in the general Corruptions of Nations: sometimes Ignorance and Brutality overruns the World, that makes way for Superstition and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry: When Mankind is disgusted with these, then fantastical and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiastical Principles, and under these hypocritical Practises have their course; these being seen through, give grea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> occasions to profaness, and with that, <hi>Atheism,</hi> and a di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>belief of all Religion, at least of all Revealed Religion, is nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished: and that is very easily recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by depraved Minds, but very hardly rooted out of them: For though it is very easie to beat an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirer into things, out of all specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Atheism; yet when a disbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of Sacred Matters, and a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane Contempt of them, has once vitiated ones mind, it is a very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary thing, and next to mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous,
<pb n="xxiv" facs="tcp:42659:22"/>
to see such an one reduced. Now this I am forced to declare, That having had much free Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation with many that have been fatally corrupted that way, they have very often owned to me, that nothing promoted this so much in them, as the very bad Opinion which they took up of all Clergy-men of all sides: They did not see in them that strictness of life, that contempt of the World, that Zeal, that Meekness, Humility and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; that Diligence and Earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, with relation to the great Ttuths of the Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which they reckoned they would most certainly have, if they themselves firmly believed it: Therefore they concluded, that those, whose business it was more strictly to enquire into the truth of their Religion, knew that it was not so certain, as they themselves,
<pb n="xxv" facs="tcp:42659:22"/>
for other ends, endeavoured to make the World believe it was: And that, tho for carrying on of their own Authority or Fortunes, which in one word, they call their <hi>Trade,</hi> they seemed to be very positive in affirming the Truth of their Doctrines; yet they in their own hearts did not believe it, since they lived so little suitable to it, and were so much set on raising them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by it; and so little on advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Honour of their <hi>Profession,</hi> by an exemplary Piety, and a Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Conversation.</p>
            <p>This is a thing not to be answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by being angry at them for say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, or by reproaching such as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat it, as if they were <hi>Enemies to the Church</hi>; these Words of Heat and Faction signifying nothing to work upon, or convince any. For how little strength soever there may be in this, as it is made an Argument,
<pb n="xxvi" facs="tcp:42659:23"/>
it is certainly so strong a preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, that nothing but a real Refuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, by the eminent Vertues and Labours of many of the Clergy, will ever conquer it. To this, as a Branch or Part of it, another con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration from the present State of things is to be added, to call upon the Clergy to set about the Duties of their Calling; and that is, the contempt they are generally fallen under, the Injustice they daily meet with, in being denied their Rights, and that by some out of Principle, and by others out of downright and undisguised Sacriledge. I know a great deal of this is too justly, and too truly to be cast on the Poverty of the Clergy: But what can we say, when we find often the poorest Clarks in the Richest Livings? whose Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bents not content to devour the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony of the Church, <hi>while they feed themselves, and not the Flock</hi> out
<pb n="xxvii" facs="tcp:42659:23"/>
of it; are so scandalously hard in their Allowance to their Curates, as if they intended equally to starve both <hi>Curate and People</hi>: And is it to be supposed, that the People will think themselves under a very strict obligation of Conscience, to pay re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiously all that is due to one, who seems to think himself under no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bligation to labour for it. And since it is a <hi>Maxim</hi> founded upon Natural Equity, <hi>That the Benefice is given for the Office;</hi> men will not have great Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in denying the <hi>Benefice,</hi> where the <hi>Office</hi> is neglected, or ill perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. And as for the too common Contempt that is brought on the Clergy, how guilty soever those may be, who out of hatred to their Profession, despise them <hi>for their works sake</hi>; yet we who feel our selves under these Disadvantages, ought to reflect on those Words of the <hi>Prophet,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Malach. 2.7, 8, 9.</note> and see how far they
<pb n="xxviii" facs="tcp:42659:24"/>
are applicable to us; <hi>The Priests lips should keep Knowledge, and they should seek the Law at his mouth, for he is the Messenger of the Lord of Hosts. But ye are departed out of the way, ye have caused many to stumble at the Law: Therefore have I also made you contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and base before all the People; accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as ye have not kept my ways, but have been partial in my Law.</hi> If we studied to honour God, and so to do honour to our <hi>Profession,</hi> we might justly hope that he would raise it again to that credit which is due to it; and that he would make even our Enemies to be at peace with us, or at least afraid to hurt or offend us. And in this we have good reason to rest assured; since we do not find many Instances of Clergy-men, who live and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, who preach and visit as they ought to do, that are under any E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent Degrees of Contempt: If some do despise those that are faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>It was on design to raise in myself and in others, a deep sense of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations that we lie under, of the Duties of our Functions; of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of them, and of the Rewards that follow them, and to observe the proper Methods of performing them, so as they may be of the greatest advantage both to our selves and others, that I have entred on these Meditations.

               <head>CHAP. I. Of the Dignity of Sacred Imployments, and the Names and Designations gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to them in Scripture.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>OW low soever the Esteem of the Clergy may be sunk in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane and corrupt Age, and how much soever the Errors and Disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Clergy-men may have contributed to bring this not only upon themselves, but upon others who deserve better, but are unhappy in being mixed with so much ill Company; yet
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:42659:28"/>
certainly if we either consider the nature of things in themselves, or the value that is set on that <hi>Profession,</hi> in the Scriptures, it will appear that it ought to be consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at another rate than it is. As much as the <hi>Soul</hi> is better than the <hi>Body,</hi> and as much as the purifying and perfecting the <hi>Soul</hi> is preferable to all those Mechanical Imployments which relate to the <hi>Body,</hi> and as much as <hi>Eternity</hi> is more valuable than this short and transitory <hi>Life</hi>; so much does this Imployment excel all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>A Clergy-man, by his Character and design of life, ought to be a man separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Cares and Concerns of this World, and dedicated to the study and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation of Divine matters. Whose Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation ought to be a Pattern for others; a constant Preaching to his People: who ought to offer up the Prayers of the People in their name, and as their mouth to God; who ought to be praying and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding for them in secret, as well as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiating among them in publick: who ought to be distributing among them the Bread of life, <hi>the Word of God</hi>; and to be dispensing among them the sacred Rites, which are the Badges, the Union, and the Supports of Christians. He ought
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:42659:28"/>
to admonish, to reprove, and to comfort them, not only by his general Doctrine in his Sermons, but from <hi>House to House</hi>; that so he may do these things more home and effectually, than can be done from the Pulpit. He is to watch over their Souls, to keep them from error, and to alarm them out of their sins, by giving them <hi>warning</hi> of the Judgments of God; to visit the sick, and to prepare them for the Judgment and life to come.</p>
               <p>This is the <hi>Function</hi> of a <hi>Clergy-man</hi>; who that he may perform all these Duties with more advantage, and better effect, ought to behave himself so well, that his own Conversation may not only be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>offence,</hi> but be so <hi>exemplary,</hi> that his People may have reason to conclude, that he himself does firmly believe all those things which he proposes to them: that he thinks himself bound to follow all those Rules that he sets them; and that they may see such a serious spirit of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion in him, that from thence they may be induced to believe, that his chief design among them, is to do them good, and to save their Souls: which may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them so to esteem and love him, that they may not be prejudiced against any thing that he does and says in publick, by
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:42659:29"/>
any thing that they observe in himself in secret. He must also be imploying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self so well in his private Studies, that from thence he may be furnished with such a variety of lively thoughts, divine meditations, and proper and noble expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, as may enable him to discharge every part of his duty, in such a manner, as may raise not so much his own reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the credit of his Function, and of the great <hi>Message</hi> of <hi>Reconciliation</hi> that is committed to his charge: Above all Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, he ought to apply himself to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the Holy Scriptures aright; to have his memory well furnished that way, that so upon all occasions, he may be able to enforce what he says out of them, and so <hi>be an able Minister of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is in short the <hi>Character</hi> of a true <hi>Clergy-man,</hi> which is to be more fully opened and enlarged on in the following parts of this Book. All this looks so great and so noble, that it does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear necessary to raise it, or to insist on it more fully. Indeed it speaks its own dignity so sensibly, that none will dispute it, but such as are open Enemies to all Religion in general, or to the Christian Religion in particular; and yet even few
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:42659:29"/>
of these, are so entirely corrupted, as not to wish that External Order and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy were kept up among men, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straining the Injustice and Violence of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly Appetites and Passions; which few, even of the Tribe of the Libertines, seem to desire to be let loose; since the Peace and Safety of Mankind, require that the World be kept in Method, and under some Yoke.</p>
               <p>It will be more sutable to my design, to shew how well this <hi>Character</hi> agrees with that which is laid down in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures concerning these <hi>Offices.</hi> I shall begin first with the <hi>Names,</hi> and then go on to the <hi>Descriptions,</hi> and lastly proceed to the <hi>Rules</hi> that we find in them. The name of <hi>Deacon,</hi> that is now appropriated to the lowest <hi>Office</hi> in the Church, was in the time that the New Testament was writ, used more promiscuously: For the <hi>Apostles,</hi> the <hi>Evangelists,</hi> and those whom the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles sent to visit the Churches, are all called by this <hi>name.</hi> Generally in all those places where the word <hi>Minister</hi> is in our Translation, it is <hi>Deacon</hi> in the Greek, which signifies properly a <hi>Servant,</hi> or one who labours for another. Such Persons are dedicated to the immediate Service of God; and are appropriated to the Offices
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42659:30"/>
and Duties of the Church: so this term both expresses the dignity and the labour of the Imployment.</p>

                  <hi>Overseer,</hi> as it imports a Dignity in him, as the chief of those who <hi>labour</hi>; so it does likewise express his obligation to care and diligence, both in observing, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing the whole <hi>Flock,</hi> and more special<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in inspecting the Deportment and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of his <hi>Fellow Workmen,</hi> who are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate to him in the constitution of the Church, yet ought to be esteemed by him in imitation of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> his <hi>Brethren,</hi> his <hi>Fellow-Labourers,</hi> and <hi>Fellow-Servants.</hi> Next to the Names of the Sacred Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I shall consider the other Designati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Figures, made use of to express them.</p>
               <p>The most common is that of <hi>Pastor</hi> or <hi>Shepherd.</hi> It is to be remembred, that in the first simplicity of Mankind for many Ages, men looked after their own Cattel, or employed their Children in it; and when they trusted that care to any other, it was no small sign of their Confidence, according to what <hi>Iacob</hi> said to <hi>Laban.</hi> The care of a good <hi>Shepherd</hi> was a Figure then so well understood, that the Prophet expresses God's care of his People, by <hi>this, of his feeding them as a Shepherd,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isa. 40.11.</note> 
                  <hi>carrying his Lambs in his Bosom, and gently leading them that were with young.</hi> Christ also calls himself <hi>the Good Shepherd,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 10.1.</note> 
                  <hi>that knew his
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:42659:31"/>
Sheep, and did not as a hireling, fly away when the Wolf came, but laid down his life for his Sheep.</hi> This then being so often made use of in both Testaments, is an expression of the great Trust committed to the Clergy, which likewise supposes a great, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, and a tender care in looking to, in feeding or instructing, in watching over, and guarding the Flock against Errors and Sins, and their being ready to offer themselves to the first Fury of <hi>Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Title of <hi>Stewards,</hi> or <hi>Dispensers,</hi> which is the most honourable in a House<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, is also given to them.

An <hi>Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor</hi> is very solicitous to maintain the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of his Character, and his Master's Honour; and chiefly to carry on that which is the main business that he is sent upon, which he is always contriving how to promote: So if the Honour of this Title affects us as it ought to do, with a just value for it, we ought at the same time to consider the Obligations that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany it, of living suitable to it, answering in some sort, the Dignity and Majesty of <hi>the King of kings,</hi> that has committed it to us; and of labouring with all possible diligence, to effectuate the great Design on which we are sent; The reconciling Sinners to God: The <hi>Work</hi> having in it self a proportion to the <hi>Dignity</hi> of him that imploys us in it.</p>

               <p>I do not among these Titles reckon those of <hi>Rulers</hi> or <hi>Governours,</hi> that are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so given to Bishops,<note place="margin">3.

               <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> does also call Church-men by the Name of <hi>Builders,</hi> and gives to the <hi>Apostles</hi> the Title of <hi>Master-builders</hi>;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.10.</note> this imports both hard and painful Labour, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise great care and exactness in it, for want of which the Building will be not only exposed to the injuries of Weather, but will quickly tumble down; and it

               <p>THIS General Consideration re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives a vast improvement from the great Example that the Author of our Religion, <hi>the great Bishop and Shepherd of our Souls</hi> has set us; who went about, ever doing good, to whom <hi>it was as his meat and drink, to do the will of his Father that sent him: He was the good Shepherd that knew his Sheep, and laid down his Life for them</hi>: And since he set such a value on the Souls of that Flock which he hath redeemed, and purchased with his own Blood; certainly those to whom he has committed that <hi>work of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation</hi> which stood himself so dear, ought to consider themselves under very strict Obligations, by that charge of which they must give a severe account at the great day, in
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:42659:41"/>
which the Blood of all those who have perished through their neglect and default, shall be required at their hands. Yet because I will not aggravate this Argument unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, I will make no use of those pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages which relate immediately to the Apostles: For their Function being ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>raordinary, as were also the Assistances that were given them for the discharge of it, I will urge nothing that belongs properly to their Mission and Duty.</p>
               <p>In the Character that the Gospel gives of the <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> of that time, we may see a just and true Idea, of the Corruptions into which a bad Clergy is apt to fall; they studied to engross the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Law to themselves; and to keep the People in Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and in a blind dependance upon them: They were zealous in lesser matters, but neglected the great things of the Law: They put on an outward appearance of strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, but under that there was much rottenness: They studied to make Proselites to their Religion, but they had so depraved it, that they became
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:42659:42"/>
thereby worse men than before: They made great shews of Devotion, of Praying, and Fasting much, and giving Alms: But all this was to be seen of men, and by it they devoured the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states of poor and simple people: They were very strict in observing the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions and Customs of their Fathers, and of every thing that contributed to their own Authority or Advantage; but by so doing they made void the Law of God: In a word, they had no true worth in themselves, and hated such as had it: They were proud and spiteful, false and cruel, and made use of the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit they were in with the people, by their complying with them in their Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and flatterring them with false hopes to set them on to destroy all those who discovered their Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and whose real and shining worth, made their counterfeit shew of it the more conspicuous and odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. In this short view of those enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Disorders, which then reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amongst them, we have a full Picture of the corrupt state of bad Priests, in all Ages and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, with this only difference, That the <hi>Priests</hi> in our Saviour's time were more
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:42659:42"/>
careful and exact in the External and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible parts of their Conversation, than they have been in other times: in which they have thrown off the very decencies of a grave and sober Deportment.</p>
               <p>But now to go on with the Characters and Rules that we find in the <hi>New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>: our Saviour as he compared the Work of the Gospel, in many parables to a <hi>Field</hi> and <hi>Harvest,</hi> so he calls those whom his Father was to send<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>the Labourers in that Harvest,</hi> and he left a direction to all his Followers to <hi>pray to his Father that he would send Labourers into his Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest.</hi>

several capacities and necessities: but the bad <hi>Stewards</hi> are those who put the evil day far from them, and <hi>say in their heart the Lord declareth his coming,</hi> upon which <hi>they eat, drink, and are drunken</hi>: they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge their sensual Appetites even to a scandalous excess, and as for their <hi>fellow Servants,</hi> instead of feeding, of instructing, or watching over them, they <hi>beat them</hi>: they exerci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The <hi>good Shepherds</hi> enter <hi>by the Door,</hi> and <hi>Christ is this Door</hi> by whom they must enter; that is from whom they must have their Vocation and Mission: but the <hi>Thief and Rober</hi> who comes to <hi>kill, steal, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

The <hi>good Shepherd feeds the Flock,</hi> and looks for <hi>Pasture</hi> for them; and is <hi>ready to give his Life for the Sheep</hi>: but the bad Shepherd is represented as a <hi>Hireling that careth not for the Flock; that sees the Wolfe coming, and upon that leaveth the Sheep and flieth.</hi> This is, it is true a Figure, and therefore I know it is thought an ill way of reasoning to build too much upon figurative Discourses: yet
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:42659:44"/>
on the other hand our Saviour having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered so great a part of his Doctrine in Parables, we ought at least to consider the main Scope of a Parable: and may well build upon that, tho' every particular Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance in it cannot bear an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

                  <note place="margin">12 St. <hi>Io.</hi> 15.</note> he pursues still the Figure of a <hi>Shepherd</hi>; so the question that he asked preparatory to it, was <hi>Simon lovest thou me more than these,</hi> from which they justly gather, that the <hi>Love of God,</hi> a Zeal for his Honour, and a preferring of that to all other things whatsoever, is a necessary and indispensible qualification for that Holy Imployment; which distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishes the true <hi>Shepherd</hi> from the <hi>Hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi>: and by which only he can be both animated and fortified, to go through with the labours and difficulties, as well as the dangers and sufferings which may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company it.</p>

                  <hi>in Doctrine, shewing uncorrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, gravity, sincerity; and using such sound Speech as could not be condemned: that so those who were of the contrary Party</hi> (the <hi>Iudaizers</hi> who were studying to corrupt the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion by making a medly of it and <hi>Iudaisme) might have no evil thing to say of him</hi>; and after a glorious but short Abstract of the design of their <hi>holy</hi> Religion; he concludes that part of the <hi>Epistle</hi> in these words, <hi>These things speak and exhort, and rebuke with all authority</hi>: to which he adds a Charge, that may seem more proper to be addressed to others, then to himself, <hi>let no man despise thee</hi>: The same is likewise in his <hi>Epistle</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

In the Conclusion of the <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:42659:50"/>
we find both the Characters of those who had laboured among them, and had ruled them but who were then dead; and also of such as were yet alive.<note place="margin">13 <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Remember them who had the rule over you; who have spoken to you the Word of God, whose Faith follow, considering the end of their conversation</hi>: they had both lived and died, as well as la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured in such a manner, that the <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring</hi> of what had appeared in them, was an effectual means of perswading the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi> to be steady in the Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: for certainly, though while a man lives let him be ever so eminent, there is still room for ill-nature and jealousie to misrepresent things, and to suspect that something lies hid under the fairest ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances; which may shew it self in due time; all that goes off, when one has finished his course, so that all appears to be of a piece, and that he has died as he had lived. Then the Argument from his conversation appears in its full strength, without any diminution. But the charge given with relation to those who then had the rule over them is no less remarkable, <hi>Obe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:42659:50"/>
that is unprofitable for you</hi>: Here Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Submission is enjoyned, upon the account of their <hi>Rulers watching over them, and for them</hi>: and therefore those who do not <hi>watch</hi> like Men that know that they must give account of that Trust, have no reason to expect these from their Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: Of a piece with this is St. <hi>Pauls</hi> charge to the <hi>Thessalonians, we beseech you to know</hi> (or to acknowledge,) <hi>them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you, and to esteem them very highly in love, for their works sake</hi>: Here both the Submission and Esteem, as well as the acknowledgment that is due to the Clergy, is said to be for <hi>their works sake</hi>: And therefore such as do not the work and that do not labour and admonish their People, have no just claim to them. There is another expression in the 2<hi>d E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle</hi> to the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> that is much urged by those who have writ on this Head, <hi>That if any will not work he should not eat,</hi> which if it is a Rule binding all Men, seems to lie much heavier on the Clergy.</p>

                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:42659:51"/>I shall conclude all that I intend to bring out of the Scripture upon this Argument, with St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s charge to the <hi>Elders</hi> of the Churches, to which he writ; which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed so full, that though in the Course of the <hi>New Testament,</hi> it had not lain last, it deserved by the Rules of Method, to be kept last; for the closing and enforcing all that has gone before, and for giving it its full weight.

               <p>With this I make an end of Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from Scripture: I think it is as plain as words can make any thing, that such as are dedicated to the service of God and of his Church, ought to labour constantly and faithfully: And that in their own Persons. For it is not possible to express a personal Obligation, in terms that are both more strict and more solemn then these are which have been cited, and all the returns of obedience and submission, of esteem and support, being declared to be due to them on the account of their <hi>watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p>I will not enter here into any Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Account of the Discipline of the Church, during the first and best Ages of Christianity. It is the glory of this Church, that in her disputes of both han<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ution were not only in its main and most essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al parts, formed upon that glorious Model; but were also in its Rules and Administrations, made more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly conformable to those best and purest times. I can never forget an advice that was given me above thirty years ago, by one of the worthiest Clergy-men now alive; while I was
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:42659:54"/>
studying the Controversie relating to the Government of the Church, from the Primitive Times, he desires me to joyn with the more Speculative Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that I should make, the Sense that they had of the Obligations of the Clergy, both with relation to their Lives, and to their Labours: And said that the Argument in favour of the Church, how clearly soever made out, would never have its full effect upon the World, till abuses were so far corrected, that we could shew a Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Spirit in our Administration, as well as a Primitive pattern for our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution. This made even then, deep Impressions on me, and I thank God the Sense of it has never left me in the whole course of my Studies.</p>
               <p>I will not at present enter upon so long and so Invidious a work as the descending into all the particulars, into which this matter might be branched out; either from the Writings of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> the Decrees of <hi>Councils,</hi> the <hi>Roman Law</hi> and the <hi>Capitulars,</hi> or even from the dreg of all, the <hi>Canon Law</hi> it self, which though a Collection made in one of the worst Ages, yet carries many rules in it, that would seem excessively severe, even to
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:42659:54"/>
us, after all our Reformation of Doctrine and Worship. This has been already done with so much exactness, that it will not be necessary to set about it after the <hi>Harvest,</hi> which was gathered by the learned Bishop of <hi>Spalato</hi> in the last Book of his great Work: which the Pride and Inconstancy of the Author, had brought under a disesteem, that it no way deserves: For whatever he might be, that work was certainly one of the best productions of that Age. But this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign has been prosecuted of late with much more exactness and learning, and with great honesty and fidelity, where the interest of his Church did not force him to use a little Art, by <hi>F. Thomasin,</hi> who has compared the modern and the ancient Discipline, and has shewed very copiously, by what steps the Change was made; and how abuses crept into the Church. It is a work of great use, to such as desire to understand that matter truly. I will refer the curious to these, and many other lesser Treaties, writ by the <hi>Iansenists</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> in which abuses are very honestly complained off, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Remedies are proposed; which in many places being entertained by Bishops<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that had a right Sense of the Primitive
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:42659:55"/>
Rules, have given the Rise to a great Reformation of the <hi>French</hi> Clergy.</p>
               <p>Instead then of any Historical de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of these matters, I shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent my self with giving the Sense of <hi>two</hi> of the <hi>Fathers</hi> of the <hi>Greek Church,</hi> and <hi>one of t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e Latin</hi> upon this whole business, of the Obligations of the Clergy. The first is <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Nazianze</hi> whose Father ordained him a Presbyter, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all his hum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>le Intercessions to the contrary, according to the custom of the best Men of that Age; who instead of pressing into Orders, or aspiring to them, fled from them, excused them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and judging themselves unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of so holy a Character and so high a Trust, were not without difficulty prevailed on to submit to that, which in degenerate Ages Men run to as to a subsistance, or the mean of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing it, and seem to have no other Sense of that Sacred Institution, then Mechanicks have of obtaining their Freedom in that Trade or Company in which they have passed their Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticeship. It were indeed happy for the Church, if those who offer themselves to <hi>Orders</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had but such a Sense of them as Tradesmen have of their <hi>Freedom:</hi> Who
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:42659:55"/>
do not pretend to it till they have finished the time prescribed; and are in some sort qualified to set up in it: Whereas, alas! men who neither know the Scriptures, nor the body of Divinity, who have made no progress in their Studies, and can give no tollerable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of that holy Doctrine, in which they desire to be Teachers, do yet with equal degrees of confidence, and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, pretend to this Character, and find the way to it too easie, and the access of it too free. But this Holy Father had a very different sense of this matter. He had indeed submitted to his Fathers Authority, he being his Bishop as well as his Father. But immediately after he was ordained, he gives this account of himself in his <hi>Apologetical Oration,</hi> That he judging he had not that <hi>sublimity of Vertue, nor that familiar acquaintance with divine matters, which became Pastors and Teachers</hi>; he therefore intending to purifie his own Soul <hi>to higher degrees of Vertue, to an Exaltation above sensible Objects, above his Body and above the World, that so he might bring bis mind to a recollected and divine State, and fit his Soul that as
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:42659:56"/>
a polished mirrour it might carry on it the Impressions of divine Ideas unmixed with the allay of earthly Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and might be still casting a bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness upon all his Thoughts,</hi> did in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the raising himself to that, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to the Wilderness. He had obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that many <hi>pressed to handle the holy Mysteries, with unwashed hands, and defiled Souls: And before they were meet to be initiated to the divine Vocation, were crouding about the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, not to set patterns to others, but designing only a subsistence to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: reckoning that the holy dignity, was not a Trust for which an account was to be given, but a state of Au<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thority and Exemption. They had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther piety nor parts to recommend them, but were the reproaches of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion, and were the Pests of the Church: Which infected it faster than any plague could do the Air, since Men did easily run to imitate bad Examples, but were drawn off very hardly by the perfectest patterns to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Vertue. Vpon which he formed a high Idea of the eminent worth and vertues which became those who governed
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:42659:56"/>
the Church: And of the great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress that they ought to be duly making, not contented with low mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of it, as if they were to weigh it critically in nice ballances; and not to rise up to the highest degrees possible in it. Yet even this, was not all: For to govern mankind which was so various, and so uncertain a sort of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, seemed to him the highest pitch of knowledge and wisdom, as far above that skill and labour that is necessary to the curing of bodily Diseases as the Soul is superiour to the Body, and yet since so much Study and Observation was necessary to make a Man a skillful Physician, he concluded that much more was necessary for the Spiritual Medicine: The design of which was to give Wings to the Soul, to raise it above the World, and to consecrate it to God,</hi> here he runs out into a noble rapture, upon the excellence and sublimity of the Christian Religion, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the art of governing Souls, of the different methods to be taken, according to the diversity of mens capacity and tempers: and of divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the word of God aright, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong

them. The difficulties of which he prosecutes in a great variety of sublime Expressions and Figures: but concludes lamenting that <hi>there was so little order, then observed, that men had scarce passed their Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood when, before they understood the Scriptures, not to say before they had washed off the spots and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filements of their Souls, if they had learned but two or three pious words, which they had got by heart, or had read some of the Psalms of</hi> David, <hi>and pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:42659:57"/>
talk to the deaf, as hope to work upon Persons, who have not yet got to that degree of Wisdom, of being sensible of their own ignorance. This evil he had often with many tears lamented, but the pride of such men was so great, that nothing under the Authority of a St.</hi> Peter <hi>or a St.</hi> Paul, <hi>could work upon them.</hi> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this mention of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> he breaks out into a rapture, upon his labours and sufferings, and the care of all the Churches that lay on him; his becoming all things to all men, his gentleness where that was necessary, and his authority upon other occasions, his zeal, his patience, his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy, and his prudence in full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling all the parts of his Ministry. Then he cites several of the Passages of the Prophets, particularly those of <hi>Ieremy</hi> and <hi>Ezekiel, Zachary</hi> and <hi>Malachi,</hi> which relate to the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of the <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Shepherds</hi> of <hi>Israel.</hi> And shews how applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble they were to the Clergy at that time, and that all the woes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:42659:58"/>
against the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> belonged to them, with heavy aggravations. <hi>These thoughts possessed him day and night; they did eat out his very strength and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance; they did so afflict and deject him, and gave him so terrible a Prospect of the Iudgments of God, which they were drawing down upon the Church, that he instead of dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to undertake any part of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of it, was only thinking how he should cleanse his own Soul and fly from the wrath, which was to come, and could not think that he was yet while so young, meet to handle the Holy Things.</hi> Where he runs out into a new Rapture in mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying the dignity of holy Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and upon that says, <hi>that tho' he had been dedicated to God from his Mothers Womb, and had renounced the World and all that was charming in it, even Eloquence it self, and had delighted long in the Study of the Scriptures, and had subdued many of his Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites and Passions, yet after all this, in which perhaps he had become a Fool in glorying, he had so high a
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:42659:58"/>
Nation of the care and government of Souls, that he thought it above his strength; especially in such bad times in which all things were out of order: Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were formed, and Charity was lost; so that the very Name of a Priest was a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, as if God had poured out Contempt upon them: and thereby impious Men daily blasphemed his Name.</hi> And indeed, all the shew of Religion that remained was in their mutual heats and animosities, concerning some matters of Religion; <hi>they condemned and censured one another, they cherished and made use of the worst Men, so they were true to their Party; they concealed their Crimes, nay, they flattered and defended some that should not have been suffered to enter into the Sanctuary: They gave the holy things to Dogs, while they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired very narrowly into the failings of those that differed from them, not that they might lament them, but that they might reproach them for them. The same faults which they excused in some, were declaimed against in others: So that the very Name of a good or a bad Man were not now considered, as the Characters of their Lives, but of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of or against a side. And these abuses were so Vniversal, that they were like Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple like Priest: If those heats had arisen
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:42659:59"/>
upon the great Heads of Religion, he should have commended the Zeal of those who had contended for the Truth, and should have studied to have followed it. But their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputes were about small Matters, and things of no consequence; and yet even these were fought for, under the Glorious Title of the Faith, tho the root of all was Men's pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Animosities: These things had exposed the Christian Religion to the hatred of the Heathen, and had given even the Christians themselves very hard Thoughts of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy: This was grown to that height, that they were then acted and represented upon the Stage; and made the Subject of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples scorn. So that by their means, the name of God was blasphemed: This was that which gave him much sadder Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, than all that could be feared from that wild Beast, that was then beginning to vex and persecute the Church,</hi> (by which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably <hi>Iulian</hi> is meant,) <hi>the comfortable prospect of dying for the name of Christ, made that a Persecution was not so dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a thing, in his account, as the Sins, the Divisions, and Distractions of Christians.</hi> This then was the reason that had made him fly to the Wilderness, for the state of the Church had made him despond, and lose all his courage: He had also gone thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:42659:59"/>
that he might quite break himself to all his Appetites and Passions, and to all the Pleasures and Concerns of this Life, that did darken the shinings of the Divine Image upon his Soul; and the emanations of the Heavenly Light. When he considered the Judgments of God upon <hi>bad Priests</hi> and many other strict Rules in the old Dispensation, and the great Obligations that lay upon those who were the <hi>Priests,</hi> of the living God, and that ought before they presumed to offer up other Sacrifices, to begin with the Oblation of themselves to God; he was upon all these Reasons moved to prepare himself, by so long a Retreat.</p>
               <p>I have given this long Abstract of his <hi>Apologetical Oration,</hi> not only to set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my Reader the Sense that he had of the sacred Functions, but likewise to shew what were the Corruptions of that Age, and with how much Freedom this Holy Father laid them open. If there is any occasion for applying any part of this to the present Age, or to any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in it, I chose rather to offer it in the Words of this great Man, than in any of my own. I wish few were concerned in them; and that such as are, would make a due Application of them to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:42659:60"/>
and save others the trouble of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it more severely.</p>
               <p>I go next to another <hi>Father</hi> of the <hi>Greek Church,</hi> S. <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> whose Books of the <hi>Priesthood,</hi> have been ever rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned among the best pieces of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</hi> The Occasion of writing them, was this: He had lived many years in great Friendship with one <hi>Basil</hi>; at last, they having both dedicated themselves to sacred Studies, the Clergy of <hi>Antioch</hi> had resolved to lay hold on them, and to use that Holy Violence, which was in those times often done to the best Men, and to force them to enter into <hi>Orders.</hi> Which when <hi>Basil</hi> told <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome,</hi> he concealed his own Intentions, but pressed <hi>Basil</hi> to submit to it, who from that, believing that his Friend was of the same Mind, did not go out of the way, and so he was laid hold on; but <hi>Chrysostome</hi> had hid himself. <hi>Basil,</hi> see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he could not be found, did all that was possible to excuse himself: but that not being accepted of, he was ordained: Next time that he met his Friend, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postulated severely with him for having forsaken him upon that Occasion: This gave the Occasion to those Books, which are pursued in the way of a Dialogue.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:42659:60"/>The first Book contains only the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory Discourses, according to the Method of such Writings. In the 2<hi>d.</hi> he runs out to shew from our Saviour's Words to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> Simon <hi>lovest thou me?</hi>
                  <q>What tender and fervent Love both to Christ and to his Church, a Priest ought to feel in himself before he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters upon the feeding those <hi>Sheep,</hi> which Christ <hi>has purchased with his own Blood.</hi> To lose the Souls of the <hi>Flock</hi> first, and then ones own Soul, for his Remissness, was no light matter. To have both the Powers of Darkness, and the Works of the Flesh to fight against, required no ordinary measure both of strength and courage. He pursues the Allegories of a <hi>Shepherd</hi> and a <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician,</hi> to shew by the Parallel of these laid together; the labours and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of the <hi>Priesthood,</hi> especially, when this Authority was to be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained only by the strength of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion; and yet sometimes severe methods must be taken; like Incisions to prevent Gangrenes, or to cut off a Part already corrupted. In the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging this, great Art and Prudence was necessary: a Bishop ought to have a great and generous, a patient and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:42659:61"/>
undaunted Mind: Therefore, <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome</hi> says that he found, tho he truly loved his Saviour, yet he was so afraid to offend him, that he durst not undertake a Charge, that he did not yet judge himself quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for. It was not enough that a Man was tolerably well esteemed by others: He ought to examine himself; for that of a Bishop's being <hi>well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of,</hi> is but one of many Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, declared necessary by S. <hi>Paul.</hi> He complains much that those who raised Men to Orders, had more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to <hi>rank</hi> and <hi>wealth,</hi> and to much time spent in a vain search into <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane Learning</hi> (tho Christ chose Fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er-men and Tent-makers) than to true Worth, and an earnest Zeal for the real good of the Church. In the 3<hi>d.</hi> Book, he runs out with a great compass on the praises of the <hi>Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Function</hi>; he looked upon it as a dignity raised far above all the Honours of this VVorld, and approaching to the Angelical Glory. A Priest ought to aspire to a Purity above that of other Mortals, answering that of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. VVhen a Priest performs the Holy Functions, is sanctifying the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:42659:61"/>
Eucharist, and is offering a Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified Christ to the People, his thoughts should carry him Heavenwards, and as it were translate him into those upper Regions. If the Mosaical <hi>Priest</hi> was to be <hi>Holy</hi> that offered up Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices of a lower Order, how much <hi>Holier</hi> ought the <hi>Priests</hi> of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to be, to whom Christ has given the Power both of retaining and forgiving of Sins: But if S. <hi>Paul,</hi> after all his Visions and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, after all his Raptures and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, yet was inwardly burnt up with the concerns of the Church, and laboured with much fear and trembling, how much greater Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions ought other Persons to have of such a Trust. If it were enough to be called to this Function, and to go thr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ugh with the Duties incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent on it in some tolerable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the danger were not great; but when the Duty as well as Dignity, together with the Danger belonging to it, are all laid together, a Man is forced to have other Thoughts of the matter. No Man that knows he is not capable of conducting a Ship, will undertake it, let him be pressed
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:42659:62"/>
to it never so much: Ambitious Men that loved to set themselves forward, were of all others the most exposed to Temptations: They were apt to be inflamed by the smallest Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, to be glad at the faults of others, and troubled if they saw any do well; they courted Applause, and aspired to Honour; they fawned on great Persons, and trod on those that were below them; they made base Submissions, undecent Addresses, and often brought Presents to those in Authority; they durst not in any sort reprove them for their Faults, tho they reproached the poor out of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure for their failings. These were not the natural Consequences of the Dignity of the Priesthood; but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy and defiled Persons, who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out true Merit, had been advanced to it, had brought it under Reproach. There had been no due care used in the choice of Bishops; and by the means of bad choices, the Church was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most ruined, through the gross Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Unworthiness of many in that Post. Certainly, a worthy Priest has no ambitious aspirings: Those who fly to this Dignity from that base Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:42659:62"/>
will give a full vent to it, when they have attained it. If Submissions, Flatteries, and Money it self, are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, all will be employed: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was an indispensable Preparation to it, that one should be duly sensible of the greatness of the Trust, and of his own Unfitness for it; that so he might neither vehemently desire it, nor be uneasie if he should happen to be turned out of it. A Man may <hi>desire the Office of a Bishop,</hi> when he considers it as a VVork of toyl and labour, but nothing is more pestiferous than to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire it, because of the Power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority that accompanies it: Such Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons can never have the Courage that ought to shew it self in the Discharge of their Duty, in the reproving of Sin, and venturing on the Indignation of great Men; he confesses he had not yet been able to free his Mind from that Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease, and till he had subdued it, he judged himself bound to fly from all the steps to Preferment; for the nearer he should come to it, he reckoned the appetite to it, would rage the higher within him; whereas, the way to break it quite, was to keep himself at the greatest distance from it: nor had he
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:42659:63"/>
that vivacity, or lively activity of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, which became this Function; nor that softness and gentleness of mind, that was necessary to prepare him to bear in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, to endure contempt, or to treat People with the mildness that Christ has enjoined his followers, which he thought more necessary to a <hi>Bishop</hi> than all Fastings, or bodily Mortifications whatsoever: And he runs out into a long Digression upon the great Mischiefs that a fretful and spiteful temper did to him that was under the power of it, and to the Church, when a Bishop was soured with it. It will often break out, it will be much observed, and will give great scandal: For as a little Smoke will darken and hide the clearest Object: so if all the rest of a Bishop's Life were brighter than the Beams of the Sun, a little Blemish, a Passion, or Indiscretion, will darken all, and make all the rest be forgotten: Allowances are not made to them, as to other Men; the VVorld expects great things from them, as if they had not Flesh and Blood in them, not a Humane but an Angelical nature; therefore, a Bishop ought by a constant watchfulness, and a perpetual strictness, to be armed with Armour of Proof of
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:42659:63"/>
all sides, that no wound may hurt him. Stories will be easily believed to his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage, and his Clergy about him will be ready to find them out, and to spread them abroad. He laies this down for a certain Maxim, That every man knows himself best: and therefore what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever others might think of him, he who knew well that he had not in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self those qualifications, that were neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for this Function, ought not to suffer himself to be determined by that. After this he lays open the great Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, Factions, Partialities, and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies, with which the Popular Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions were at that time managed: and the general Corruption that had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run the whole Church; so that the Strictness and Authority, the Gentleness and Prudence, the Courage and Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that were necessary to a Bishop were very hard to be found all together. He instances to make out the difficulty of discharging the duty of a Bishop, in that single point, of managing the Widows: who were so medling, so immoral, so factious and so clamorous, that this alone was enough to imploy a Bishop's prudence, and to exercise his patience: from that and another Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:42659:64"/>
relating to it concerning the Virgins, he goes to consider the Trouble, the Difficulties, and Censures that Bishops were subject to, by the hearing of Causes, that were referred to them: Many pretending they were wronged by their Judgments, made shipwrack of the Faith, in revenge: and they pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed so hard upon the Bishops time, that it was not possible for him to content them, and discharge the other parts of his Duty. Then he reckons up the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Visits that were expected from Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops: the several Civilities they were obliged to, which it was hard to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage so, as not to be either too much or too little in them: Matter of censure would be found in both extreams. Then he reflects on the great temper that ought to be observed in the final sentence of Excommunication; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a gentleness to Vice on the one hand, and the driving men to Despair and Apostasie on the other. And he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes that Book with Reflections on the vast Burthen that follows the care of Souls. In his 4th. Book he runs through a variety of Arts and Professions; and shews how much skill and labour was necessary for every one of them: from whence he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:42659:64"/>
strongly, that much more was necessary for that which was the most important of all others; so that no consideration whatsoever, should make a man undertake it, if he did not find himself in some sort qualified for it: more particularly he ought to be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to give an account of his Faith, and to stop the mouths of all gainsaiers, <hi>Iews, Gentiles,</hi> and <hi>Hereticks</hi>: in which the Ignorance of many Bishops, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things from one extream to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, had given great occasion to Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours. A Bishop must understand the stile and phrase of the Scriptures well. From this he runs out into a very No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Panegyrick upon St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in whom a pattern was set to all Bishops. His 5th Book sets out the labour of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the tentations to Vanity in it; the censures that were apt to be made if there was either too much or too little Art or Eloquence in Sermons: to this he adds the great exactness that a Bishop should use in preserving his Reputation; yet without Vanity: observing a due temper between despising the censures of theMultitude, and the servile courting of applauses: In his Sermons he ought above all things to study to edifie;
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:42659:65"/>
but not to Flatter his Hearers: or to use vain arts to raise esteem, or admiration from them. Since a Bishop whose mind was not purged from this disease, must go through many tossings and be much disquieted: and upon that he runs out so fully, upon the tentations to desire ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause for Eloquence, and a readiness in speaking, that it plainly appears that he felt that to be his own weak side. The 6th Book is chiefly imployed to shew how much a harder thing it was to govern the Church, than to live in a <hi>Desart,</hi> under the severest mortifications.</q>

               <p>I will go no further in this abstract, I hope I have drawn out enough to give a Curiosity to such as have not yet read those Excellent Books, to do it over and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver again. For to any that has a true relish, they can never be too often read: eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reading will afford a fresh pleasure, and new matter of Instruction, and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation. But I go in the last place to offer St. <hi>Ierom</hi>'s sense in this matter. I shall not bring together, what lies scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered through his works, upon this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, nor shall I quote what he writ in his Youth upon it, when the natural flame of his temper joyned with the heat of Youth might make him carry his

thoughts further, than what humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture could bear: But I shall only give an abstract of that which he writ to <hi>Nepotion</hi> on this Head, in his old Age, as he says himself: a good part of that Epistle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a reflection upon the different sense that old Age gives of these things, from that which he felt during the ardour of Youth.</p>
               <p>He begins with the title <hi>Clerk,</hi> which signifying a Lot or Portion.
<q>Imports ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that the Clergy are <hi>God's Portion,</hi> or that <hi>God is theirs,</hi> and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ought to <hi>possess God, and be possessed of him.</hi> He that has this por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, must be satisfied with it, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to nothing, but having Food and Rayment, be therewith content: and (as men carried their Crosses naked, so) to be ready to carry his. He must not seek the advantages of this world in Christ's wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>fare; some Clerks grew richer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Christ, who made himself poor, than ever they could have been, if they had continued in the service of the God of this World: So that the Church groaned under the wealth of those, who were Beggars before they forsook the World: Let the Strangers and the Poor be fed at your Tables, says he,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:42659:66"/>
and in these you entertain Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. When you see a trafficking Clerk, who from being Poor grows Rich, and from being mean becoms great, fly from him as from a Plague. The conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of such men corrupted good minds: They sought after wealth, and loved Company, the publick Places of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation, Fairs and Market places: whereas a true Clerk loves silence, and retirement: then he gives him a strong caution against conversing with Women: and in particular against all those mean compliances, which some Clerks used towards rich Women; by which they got not only Presents during their lives, but Legacies by their Wills. That a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse had grown to such an intolerable excess, that a Law was made excluding <hi>Priests</hi> from having any benefit by <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staments:</hi> They were the only persons that were put under that incapacity: Heathen Priests were not included in the <hi>Law,</hi> yet he does not complain of the <hi>Law,</hi> but of those who had given just occasion for making it. The Laws of Christ had been contemned, so it was necessary to restrain them by humane Laws. It was the Glory of a <hi>Bishop</hi> to provide for the poor, but it was the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:42659:66"/>
                     <hi>Reproach</hi> of a <hi>Priest</hi> to study the <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching of himself.</hi> He reckons up ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Instances of the base and abject Flattery of some Clerks, to gain up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on rich and dying persons, and to get their Estates. Next he exhorts him to the constant and diligent study of the Scriptures; but to be sure to do nothing that should contradict his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses or give occasion to his Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to answer him thus, <hi>Why do not you do as you say?</hi> Then he speaks of the Union that ought to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Bishop, and his Clergy: the affection on the one side, and the obedience on the other. In Preaching he must not study to draw <hi>applauses</hi> but <hi>Groans</hi> from his Hearers. Their Tears was the best sort of commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of a Sermon, in which great care was to be taken to avoid the methods of the Stage, or of common Declamations. Great use was to be made of the Scriptures. The mysteries of our Faith and the Sacraments of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion ought to be well explained: Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maces and solemn Looks are often made use of to give Weight and Authority to that which has none in it self. He
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:42659:67"/>
charges him to use a plain simplicity in his Habit, neither shewing too much nicety on the one Hand, that savours of Luxury, nor such a neglect on the other, as might savour of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation. He recommends particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Care of the Poor to him. Then he speaks of Clergy-Mens mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually preferring one another; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering that there are different Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in one Body, and that every one has his own Function, and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Talent: And that therefore no man ought to over-value his own, or undervalue his Neighbours. A plain Clerk ought not to value him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self upon his Simplicity and Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, nor ought a learned and elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Man measure his Holiness by his Rhetorick; for indeed of the two, a Holy Simplicity is much more valuable, than Unsanctified Eloquence. He speaks against the Affectation of Magnificence and Riches, in the Worship of God, as things more becoming the Pomp of the Jewish Religion, than the Humility of the Spiritual Doctrine of Christ. He falls next upon the high and sumptuous way of living of some Priests, which they
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:42659:67"/>
pretended was necessary to procure them the respect that was due to them; and to give them interest and credit: but the World, at least the better part of it, would always value a Priest more for his Holiness, than for his Wealth. He charges him strictly to avoid all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses of Wine, and in Opposition to that to fast much, but without Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or a nicety in the choice of such things as he was to live on in the time of fasting. Some shewed a trifling Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition in those Matters, as well as Vanity and Affectation; that was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Scandalous. Plain and simple Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting was despised as not singular nor pompous enough for their Pride. For it seems by what follows, that the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy was then corrupted with the same dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, with which our Saviour had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached the <hi>Pharasees,</hi> while they did not study inward Purity, so much as outward Appearances; nor the pleasing of God, so much as the praise of Men. But here he stops short, for it seems he went too near the describing some emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Man in that Age; from that he turns to the Government of a Priest's
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:42659:68"/>
Tongue: He ought neither to detract from any one himself, nor to encourage such as did: The very hearkning to slande<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, was very unbecoming. They ought to visit their People, but not to report in one place, what they observed in another; in that they ought to be both discreet and secret. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> adjured those that came to study from him, to be secret, grave, and prudent in their whole behaviour; but how much more did this become those, to whom the Care of Souls was trusted. He advises him to visit his People rather in their Afflictions, than in their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity; not to go too often to their Feasts, which must needs lessen him that does it too much. He, in the last place, speaks very severely of those who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the Wealth of the Church to their own private Uses. It was Theft to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud a Friend, but it was <hi>Sacrilege</hi> to rob the Church. It was a Crime that exceeded the Cruelty of High-way Men, to receive that which belonged indeed to the Poor, and to withdraw any part of it to ones private Occasions. He concludes with this excuse, That he had
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:42659:68"/>
named no Person, he had not writ to reproach others; but to give them war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. And therefore since he had trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the Vices of the Clergy in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Terms, if any was offended with him for it, he thereby plainly confessed that he himself was guilty.</q>

               <p>I Will go no further, in gathering Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to shew the sense that the Fathers had in these matters: these are both so full and so express, that I can find none more plain and more forcible. I shall to these add some of the <hi>Canons</hi> that have been made both in the best and in the worst Ages of the Church, obliging Bishops and other Clerks to <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidence</hi> and to be contented with <hi>one Cure.</hi> In that at <hi>Sardica</hi> that met in the Year 347. consisting of above 350. Bishops two Canons were made, (the 11<hi>th</hi> and the 12<hi>th</hi>) against <hi>Bishops who without any urgent necessity, or pressing business,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:42659:69"/>
should be absent from their Church above three weeks, and thereby grieve the Flock, that was committed to their care:</hi> And even this provision was made because Bishops had Estates lying out of their Diocesses; therefore they were allowed to go and look after them, for three weeks, <hi>in which time they were to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the divine function in the Churches to which those Estates belonged.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Many provisions were also made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst such as went to Court, unless they were called by the Emperors, or went by a Deputation from the Church upon a publick account. There is not any one thing more frequently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided against, than that any of the Clergy should leave their Church, and go to any other Church, or live any where else without the Bishops leave and consent: nor is there any thing clearer from all the Canons of the first Ages, than that they considered the Clergy of every Church as a body of men dedicated to its service, that lived upon the Oblations of the Faithful, and that was to labour in the several parts of the Ecclesiastical Ministry, as they should be ordered by the Bishop.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:42659:70"/>In the 4<hi>th</hi> General Council at <hi>Calce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don Pluralities,</hi> do first appear: for they are mentioned and condemned in the 10<hi>th</hi> Canon, which runs thus, <hi>No Clerk shall at the same time belong to two Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; to wit, to that in which he was was first ordained, and that to which as being the greater, he has gone, out of a desire of vain glory; for such as do so, ought to be sent back to that Church in which they were at first ordained, and to serve there only; but if any has been translated from one Church to another, he shall receive nothing out of his former Church; nor out of any Chapel or Alms-house be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to it: and such as shall trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress this definition of this General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil are condemned by it, to be degraded.</hi> I go next to a worse Scene of the Church to see what provisions were made in this matter about the 8<hi>th</hi> Century, both in the East and in the West: The worse that those Ages and Councils were, it makes the Argument the stronger, since even bad men in bad times, could not justifie or suffer such an abuse.</p>
               <p>In the year 787. the Second Council of <hi>Nice</hi> was held that setled the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of Images. The 15 Canon of it runs
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:42659:70"/>
thus.
<q>No Clerk shall from henceforth be reckoned in two Churches, (for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Church had a Catalogue of its Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, by which the dividends were made) for this is the Character of Trafficking, and Covetousness, and wholly estranged from the Ecclesiastical Custom. We have heard from our Saviour's own words, that <hi>no man can serve two Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters: for he will either hate the one or love the other, or cleave to the one and despise the other: Let every one therefore</hi> according to the Apostles words, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the Vocation in which he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,</hi> and serve in one Church: For those things which filthy Lucre has brought into Church matters are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to God. There is a variety of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, for acquiring the necessary supplies of this life: Let every one that pleases, make use of these, for furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing himself: For the Apostle saies <hi>these hands Ministred to my necessities,</hi> and to those that were with me. This shall be the rule in this Town, which is guarded by God, but in remote Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages an Indulgence may be granted by reason of the want of men.</q>
It is upon this that the Canonists do found the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:42659:71"/>
first of the two reasons, for which only they allow that a Dispensation for hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two Benefices may be lawful, one is, the want of fit and sufficient men for the service of the Church. The foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the other will be found in the Canon, which I shall next set down.</p>
               <p>It is the 49 Canon of the sixth Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil at <hi>Paris,</hi> under <hi>Lewis the Good,</hi> in the Year 829. this Council came after a great many, that had been held by <hi>Charles the Great,</hi> and his Son for purging out abuses, and for restraining the Primitive Discipline. These Councils sat at <hi>Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, Ments, Aken, Rheims, Chalons, Tours, Arles,</hi> and this of <hi>Paris</hi> was the last that was held upon that design. In these, all the Primitive Canons relating to the Lives and Labours, and the government of the Clergy, were renewed. Among others is that of <hi>Calcedon</hi> formerly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned: but it seems there was no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion given to make a special one against Pluralities, before this held at <hi>Paris,</hi> which consisted of four Provinces of <hi>France, Rheims, Sens, Tours,</hi> and <hi>Rouen.</hi> The Canon runs thus: <hi>As it becomes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very City to have its proper Bishop; so it
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:42659:71"/>
is also becoming and necessary that every Church dedicated to God, should have, its proper Priest. Yet Covetousness which is Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry (of which we are much ashamed) has so got hold of some Priests and caught them captives in its Fetters, that they, blinded with i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, know neither whither they go nor what they ought to be or do; so that they being kindled with the fire of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness, and forgetful of the Priestly Dignity, neglecting the care of those Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, to which they were promoted, do by some presents given or promised, procure other Churches not only from Clerks, but from Lay-men, in which they do against Law undertake to perform the Ministry of Christ. It is not known whether their Bishops are consulted in this matter, or not; if they are, without doubt their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops become partakers of their sin: but if they presume to do it without consulting them, yet it is to be imputed to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops negligence. There is scarce a Priest to be found who warreth worthily, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently in that Church in which he is dedicated, to the Divine Service: but how much less will he be able to do that worthily in two, three or more Churches? This practice brings a reproach on the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:42659:72"/>
Religion, and a confusion on the Priestly Order. The Covetousness of the Clergy is censured by their people; the worship of God is not performed in places consecrated to him; and as was obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the former Chapters, the Souls of the people are thereby much endangered· Wherefore we do all unanimously appoint, that no Bishop suffer this to be done in his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish</hi> (or <hi>Diocess,</hi> these words being u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed promiscuously) <hi>any more, and we Decree, that every Church that has a Congregation belonging to it, and has means by which it may subsist, shall have its proper Priest: for if it has a Congregation but has not Means by which it may subsist, that matter is left to the Bishop, to consider whether it can or ought to be supported or not. But it is specially recommended to their care to see that under this pretence, no Priest may out of Covetousness hold two or three Churches, in which he cannot serve, nor perform the worship of God.</hi> The last provisions in this Canon are the grounds upon which the <hi>Canonists</hi> found the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond just cause of dispensing with <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralities,</hi> which is when a Church is so poor, that the Profits which arise out of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:42659:72"/>
it cannot afford a competent mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to a Clark: but then the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion arises what is a <hi>Competent Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance</hi>: this, they do all bring very low, to that which can just maintain him: and they have so clogged it, that no pretence should be given by so ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral a word, to <hi>Covetousness, Voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,</hi> or <hi>Ambition.</hi> And indeed while we have so many poor Churches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, instead of restraining such Pluralities, it were rather to be wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that it were made easier than by Law it is at present; either to unite them together, or to make one man ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of serving two Churches, when both Benefices make but a tolerable subsistance, rather than to be forced to have a greater number of Clerks, than can be decently maintained; since it is certain, that it is more for the Interest of Religion and for the good of Souls, to have one worthy man serving two Churches, and dividing himself between them; than to have Clerks for many Benefices, whose scandalous provisions, make too many scandalous incumbents, which is one of the greatest Diseases and Miseries of this Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:42659:73"/>But a due care in this matter has no relation to the accumulation of Livings, at great distances, (every one of which can well support an Incumbent) up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the same Person merely for the making of a Family, for the support<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Luxury or Vanity, or for other base and Covetous designs. But I go next to two of the worst Councils that ever carried the name of <hi>General ones,</hi> the third and the fourth of the <hi>Lateran</hi> that we may see what was the sense of the Twefth and Thirteenth Century in this matter; notwithstanding the Corruption of those Ages. The Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Canon of the Third <hi>Lateran Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,</hi> runs thus.
<q>Forasmuch, as some whose Covetousness has no bounds, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to procure to themselves divers Ecclesiastical Dignities, and several Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish Churches, against the Provisions of the Holy Canons; by which means, tho they are scarce able to perform the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of one, they do claim the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions due to many: We do severely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, that this may not be done for the future: And therefore, when any Church or Ecclesiastical Ministry is to be given, let such a one be sought out
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:42659:73"/>
for it, as shall reside upon the place, and shall be able to discharge the Care in his own Person: If otherwise, he who receives any such benefice, contrary to the Canons, shall lose it, and he who gave it shall likewise lose his right of Patronage.</q>
This Canon not being found effectual to cure so great an abuse. The Twenty Ninth Canon of the Fourth <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel</hi> in the <hi>Lateran,</hi> was penned in these Words.
<q>It was with great Care forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in the <hi>Council</hi> of the <hi>Lateran,</hi> that any one should have divers Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Dignities, and more Parish Churches than one, which is contrary to the Holy Canons. Otherwise, he that took them should lose them, and he that gave them should lose the right of giving them: But by reason of some Mens Presumption and Covetousness, that Decree has had little or no effect hitherto; we therefore desiring to make a more evident and express Provision against these abuses, do appoint that whosoever shall receive any Benefice, to which a Care of Souls is annexed, shall thereupon by Law be deprived of any other such Benefice, that he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly had; and if he endeavours still
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:42659:74"/>
to hold it, he shall lose the other like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise; and he to whom the right of the Patronage of his first Benefice did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, is empowered to bestow it upon his accepting another; and if he delays the bestowing it, above Three months, not only shall his right devolve to another, according to the Decree of the Council in the <hi>Lateran,</hi> but he shall be obliged to restore to the Church, to which the Benefice belongs, all that which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eceived during the vacancy. This we do likewise Decree as to Personages; and do further appoint that no Man shall presume to hold more Dignities or Parsonages than one in the same Church, even though they have no Cure of Souls annexed to them. Provided always that Dispensations may be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Apostolical See,</hi> to Persons of high Birth, or eminently learned (<hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limes &amp; literatas personas</hi>) or digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in Universities, for so the word <hi>lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rati</hi> was understood, who upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion may be honoured, with greater Benefices.</q>
It was by this last Proviso, that this as well as all other Canons, made against these Abuses became quite inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual; for this had no other effect, but
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:42659:74"/>
the obliging People to go to <hi>Rome</hi> for <hi>Dispensations</hi>; so that <hi>this</hi> Canon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of reforming the Abuse, did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally establish it, for the Qualifications here mentioned were so far stretched, that any Person that had obtained a Degree in any University, came with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Character of <hi>lettered</hi> or learned, and all those that were in any depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon <hi>great Men,</hi> came likewise within the other Qualification of <hi>high Rank and Birth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was the Practice among us, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the 8<hi>th.</hi> and he when he was beginning to threaten the <hi>See of Rome,</hi> in the matter of his <hi>Divorce,</hi> got that Act to be passed, which has been the occasion of so much Scandal and Disorder in this Church. It seems to one that considers it well, that the Clauses which qualifie <hi>Pluralities</hi> were grafted upon another Bill against <hi>Spiritual Persons taking Estates to Farm,</hi> with which that Act begins: And that in the carrying that on, such a temper shewed it self, that the other was added to it. It contained indeed a Limitation of the <hi>Papal</hi> Authority, but so many Provisions were made, that the <hi>Nobility,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:42659:75"/>
Clergy,</hi> and the more eminent of the <hi>Gentry, Knights</hi> in particular, were so taken Care of, that it could meet with no gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ition in the Parliament; but from the state of that Time, and from several Clauses in the Act it self, it appears, it was only intended to be a Provisional Act; tho it is conceived in the Style of a perpetual Law. By it then, and by it only (for I have not been able to find that any such Act ever passed in any Kingdom or State in <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom,</hi> many having been made plainly to the contrary in <hi>France,</hi> declaring the Obligation to <hi>Residence</hi> to be of <hi>Divine Right</hi>) were the Abuses, that had arisen out of the Canon of one of the worst Councils that ever was, authorised and settled among us; as far as a Law of the Land can settle them. But after all, it is to be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that a Law does indeed change the Legal and Political Nature of things, it gives a Title to a Free-hold and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty: But no Humane Law can change the Moral or Divine Laws, and cancel their Authority. If a <hi>false Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> is settled by Law, it becomes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the <hi>legal Religion;</hi> but is not a
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:42659:75"/>
whit the <hi>truer</hi> for that. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if the Laws of the Gospel oblige Clerks to Personal Labour, as was formerly made out; <hi>An Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> may indeed qualifie a Man, in <hi>Law,</hi> to enjoy the <hi>Benefice,</hi> whether he labours in it or not, but it can never dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>olve his Obligation to <hi>Residence</hi> and <hi>Personal</hi> Labour.</p>
               <p>But to bring this Chapter to an end, I shall only add Three Decrees that were made by the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> in this matter, that so it may appear what Provisions they made against Abuses, which are still supported by Laws a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us: A part of the 1<hi>st:</hi> Chap. of Reformation that past in the Sixth Session, runs thus:
<q>This Synod ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monishes all that are set over any Cathedral Churches, by what Title so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that they taking heed to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and to all the Flock, over which the Holy Ghost has set them, to Govern the Church of God, which he has purchased with his own Blood, do watch and labour and fullfil their Ministry, as the Apostle has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded: And they must know that they cannot do this, if as Hirelings
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:42659:76"/>
they forsake the Flock committed to them, and do not watch over those Sheep, whose Blood will be required at their Hands, in the last Day. Since it is certain that no excuse will be received, if the Wolfe devours the Sheep, when the Shepherd does not look after them. Yet since to our great Grief it is found, that some at this time neglect the Salvation of their own Souls, and preferring Earthy things to Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, are still about Courts, and forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Fold, and the Care of the Sheep trusted to them, do give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves wholly to Earthly and Temporal Cares; therefore all the Ancient Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, which by the Iniquity of Times, and the Corruptions of Men were fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into desuetude, are renewed against <hi>Non-residents.</hi>
                  </q> To which, several com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsory Clauses are added, which are indeed slight ones, because the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them was intirely put in the Pope's Power, and the Punishment did only lie, if a Bishop was absent Six Months in a Year.</p>
               <p>This Decree did not satisfie those who moved for a Reformation; so a fuller one was made in the 23<hi>d.</hi> Session, 1<hi>st. Chap.</hi>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:42659:76"/>
in these Words:
<q>Whereas, by the Law of God, all those to whom the Care of Souls is committed, are commanded to know their Sheep, to offer Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for them, to feed them by the Preaching of the Word of God, the Administration of the Sacraments, and by the Example of a good Life, to have a tender Care of the poor, and all other miserable Persons, and to lay themselves out upon all the other Functions of the Pastoral Care; which cannot be performed by those, who do not watch over, nor are present with their Flock: Therefore this Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod does admonish and exhort them, that they remembring the Divine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, and being made an Example to their Flock, may feed and govern them in Righteousness and Truth. Upon this they declare that all Bishops, even Cardinals themselves, are obliged to Personal Residence, in their Church and Diocess, and there to discharge their Duty: Unless upon some special Provisions.</q>
By which indeed a Door is opened to as many Corruptions as the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> thinks fit to dispense with.
Yet without this, none may
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:42659:77"/>
be absent above two, or at most, three Months, in the whole Year; and even that must be upon a just reason, and without any prejudice to the Flock; <q>and they leave this upon the Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of such as withdraw for so long a time, which they hope will be Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and Tender in this matter, since all Hearts are known to God, and it is no small Sin to do his Work negligently.</q>
They declare the breaking this Decree to be a <hi>Mortal Sin,</hi> and that such as are guilty of it, cannot with a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science enjoy the mean Profits, during such their Absence; but are bound to lay them out on the Fabrick, or give them to the Poor: and all these Provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Punishments, they do also make against the inferior Clergy, that enjoyed any Benefice, to which the Cure of Souls was annexed, and the execution of that, is put in the Bishop's Hands, who is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not to dispense with their <hi>Residence,</hi> unless upon a very weighty occasion, above two Months; and in this they give the Bishop so full an Authority, that no Appeal or Prohibition was to lie against his Sentence, upon <hi>non-Residents,</hi> even in the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> In these
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:42659:77"/>
Decrees, tho the Papal Party hindred a formal Declaration of the Obligation to <hi>Residence,</hi> by <hi>Divine Right,</hi> that so room might still be left for the <hi>Dispensing Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi>; yet they went very near it, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied Passages of Scripture to it, and laid the charge of <hi>mortal Sin</hi> upon it.</p>
               <p>In the last place, I shall set down the Decree that was made in the 24<hi>th.</hi> Ses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, <hi>Chap.</hi> 17. against Pluralities, in these Words:
<q>Whereas the Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Order is perverted, when one Clerk has the Offices of many committed to him, it was therefore well provided by the Holy Canons, that no Man should be put in two Churches. But many led by their depraved Covetousness, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving themselves, but not God, are not ashamed to elude those good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions, by several Artifices, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain more Benefices than one at the same time: Therefore the <hi>Synod</hi> being desirous to restore a proper Discipline for the Government of Churches, does, by this Decree, by which all Persons, of what Rank soever, even Cardinals themselves, shall be bound; appoint, that for the future, one Man shall be capable of receiving only one Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:42659:78"/>
Benefice. But if that is not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for the decent maintenance of him that has it, then it shall be lawful to give him another <hi>simple Benefice,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided that both Benefices do not require <hi>Personal Residence.</hi> This Rule must be applied not only to Cathedrals, but to all other Benefices whether Secular, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, or such as are held by Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, or of what sort or order soever they may be. And as for such as do at present possess either more Parish-Churches than one, or one Cathedral, and another Parish-Church, they shall be forced notwithstanding of any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensations or Unions that may have been granted them, for term of Life, to resign within the space of Six Months, all that they do now hold, except one Cathedral, or one Parochial Church; otherwise, all their Benefices, whether Parochial, or others, shall be by Law esteemed void; and as such they shall be disposed of to others. Nor may those who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ormerly enjoyed them, receive the mean Profits, after the term of Six Months, with a good Conscience. But the Synod wishes that some due Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>on might be made, such as the Pope
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:42659:78"/>
shall think fit, for the necessities of those who are hereby obliged to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign.</q>
               </p>
               <p>These were the decrees that were made by that <hi>pretended general Council:</hi> And wheresoever that Council is received, they are so seldom dispensed with, that the Scandal of <hi>Non-Residence,</hi> or <hi>Plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> does no more cry in that Church. In <hi>France,</hi> tho that <hi>Council</hi> is not there received, yet such regard is had to Primitive Rules, that it is not heard of among them. Such Examples are to us Reproaches indeed: And that of the worst sort, when the Argument from the neglect of the Pastoral Care, which gave so great an Advantage at first to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers, and turned the Hearts of the World so much from their Careless Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors to those who shewed more Zeal and Concern for them, is now against us, and lies the other way. If the Nature of Man is so made, that it is not possible, but that <hi>Offences must come,</hi> yet, <hi>woe be to him, by whom they come.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. VI. Of the declared Sense and Rules of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> in this matter.</head>
               <p>WHatsoever may be the practice of any among us, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever may be the force of some Laws that were made in bad times, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps upon bad ends, yet we are sure the Sense of our Church is very different; She intended to raise the obligation of the Pastoral Care higher than it was before: and has laid out this matter more fully and more strictly, than any Church ever did, in any Age; as far at least as my Enquiries can carry me. The truest Indication of the Sense of a Church is to be taken from her Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, in her <hi>Publick Offices</hi>: This is that which she speaks the most fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:42659:79"/>
and the most publickly: even the <hi>Articles of Doctrine</hi> are not so much read and so often heard, as her <hi>Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies</hi> are: and as this way of Reasoning has been of late made use of with great advantage, against the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> to make her accountable, for all her <hi>Publick Offices</hi> in their plain and literal meaning; so I will make use of it on this occasion: It is the stronger in our case, whose Offices being in a Tongue understood by the people, the Argument from them does more evidently conclude here.</p>
               <p>In general then this is to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that no Church before ours, at the <hi>Reformation,</hi> took a formal <hi>Sponsion at</hi> the <hi>Altar,</hi> from such as were ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Deacons</hi> and <hi>Priests.</hi> That was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed always demanded of Bishops, but neither in the <hi>Roman</hi> nor <hi>Greek Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fical,</hi> do we find any such solemn Vows and Promises demanded or made by Priests or Deacons, nor does any print of this appear in the <hi>Constitutions,</hi> the pretended <hi>Areopagite</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or the antient <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of the Church.</hi> Bishops were asked many questions, as appears by the first Canon of the fourth Council of <hi>Carthage.</hi>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:42659:80"/>
They were required to profess their Faith, and to promise to obey the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons,</hi> which is still observed in the <hi>Greek Church.</hi> The questions are more express in the Roman Pontifical, and the first of these demands a promise <hi>that they will instruct their people</hi> in the Christian Doctrine, according <hi>to the Holy Scriptures</hi>: which was the Foundation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which our Bishops justified the Reformation; Since the first and chief of all their Vowes binding them to this, it was to take place of all others; and if any other parts of those Spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, contradicted this, such as their Obedience and Adherence to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> they said that these were to be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited by this.</p>
               <p>All the account I can give of this general practice of the Church in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding Promises only of <hi>Bishops,</hi> and not of the other <hi>Orders</hi> is this, that they considered the Government of the <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Deacons,</hi> as a thing that was so entirely in the <hi>Bishop,</hi> as it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed by the first Constitution, that it was not thought necessary to bind them to their Duty by any Publick Vowes or Promises (though it is very
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:42659:80"/>
probable that the <hi>Bishops</hi> might take private engagements of them, before they ordained them) it being in the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi>'s power to Restrain and Censure them in a very Absolute and Summary way. But the case was quite different in <hi>Bishops,</hi> who were all equal by their <hi>Rank</hi> and <hi>Order</hi>: None having any Authority over them, by any Divine Law or the Rules of the Gospel: the power of Primates, and Metropolitans having arisen out of Ecclesiastical and Civil Laws, and not being equally great in all Countries and Provinces: and therefore it was more necessary to proceed with greater caution, and to demand a further security f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>m them.</p>
               <p>But the new face of the Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church, by which <hi>Priests</hi> were not under so absolute a subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to their <hi>Bishops,</hi> as they had been at first, which was occasioned partly, by the Tyranny of some <hi>Bishops,</hi> to which bounds were set by Laws and <hi>Canons,</hi> partly by their having a speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Propety and <hi>Benefice</hi> of their own, and so not being maintained by a Dividend out of the common-stock of the Church
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:42659:81"/>
as at first; had so altered the state of things, that indeed no part of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopacy was left entrirely in the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi>'s hands, but the power of Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This is still free and unrestrained: no <hi>Writs,</hi> nor <hi>Prohibitions</hi> from <hi>Civil Courts</hi>; and no <hi>Appeals</hi> have clogged or fettered this, as they have done all the other parts of their Authority. Therefore our Reformers observing all <hi>Office</hi> of <hi>Ordination,</hi> and they made both the Charge that is given, and the Promises that are to be taken, to be very express and solemne, that so both the <hi>Ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> and the <hi>Ordained</hi> might be rightly instructed in their Duty and struck with the awe and dread, that they ought to be under in so holy and so impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant a performance: and though all mankind does easily enough agree in this, That Promises ought to be Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously observed, which men make to one another, how apt soever they may be to break them; yet to make the sense of these Promises go deeper, they are ordered to be made at the <hi>Altar,</hi> and in the nature of a <hi>Stipulation</hi> or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, the Church conferring <hi>Orders,</hi>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:42659:81"/>
or indeed rather, Christ by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestry of the Officers that he has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted, conferring them upon those <hi>Promises</hi> that are first made. The Forms of Ordination in the <hi>Greek Church,</hi> which we have reason to believe are less changed, and more conform to the Primitive pattenrs, than those used by the <hi>Latins,</hi> do plainly import that the Church only declared the Divine Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. <hi>The Grace of God, that perfects the feeble, and heals the weak, promotes this man to be a Deacon, a Priest or a Bishop</hi>: Where nothing is expressed as <hi>conferred</hi> but only as <hi>declared,</hi> so our Church by making our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s <hi>words,</hi> the form of Ordination, must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strued to intend, by that that it is Christ only that sends, and that the <hi>Bishops</hi> are only his Ministers to pronounce his Mission; otherwise it is not so easie to justifie the use of this Form, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Holy Ghost</hi>: which as it was not used in the Primitive Church nor by the Roman, till within these five Hundred Years, so in that Church, it is not the Form of Ordination but a Benediction given by the <hi>Bishop</hi> singly, after the Orders are given by the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:42659:82"/>
and the other <hi>Priests</hi> joyning with him. For this is done by him alone as the final consummation of the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But our using this as the form of Ordination shews, that we consider our selves only as the Instruments that speak in Christ's Name and Words: Insinuating thereby that he only Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dains. Pursuant to this in the Ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Priests,</hi> the questions are put <hi>in the name of God and of his Church.</hi> Which makes the answers to them to be of the nature of <hi>Vows</hi> and <hi>Oaths.</hi> So that if men do make conscience of any thing, and if it is possible to strike terrour into them, the Forms of our <hi>Ordinations</hi> are the most effectually contrived for that end that could have been framed.</p>
               <p>The first question that is put in the <hi>Office of Deacons,</hi> is, <hi>Do you trust that you are inwardly moved by the Holy Ghost to take upon you this Office, to serve God for the promoting of his Glory, and the edifying of his people?</hi> To which he is to answer <hi>I trust so.</hi> This is put only in this <hi>Office,</hi> and not repeated after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: it being justly supposed that where one has had this motion, all the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:42659:82"/>
other Orders may be in time conferred pursuant to it; but this is the first step, by which a Man dedicates him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to the Service of God; and therefore it ought not to be made by any, that has not this Divine Voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Certainly, the <hi>Answer</hi> that is made to this, ought to be well consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered; for if any says, <hi>I trust so,</hi> that yet knows nothing of any such <hi>motion,</hi> and can give no account of it, he <hi>lies</hi> to the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi>; and makes his first approach to the Altar, with a <hi>lie</hi> in his Mouth; and that not to <hi>Men,</hi> but to <hi>God</hi>; and how can one expect to be received by <hi>God,</hi> or be <hi>sent</hi> and <hi>sealed</hi> by him, that dares do a thing of so crying a Nature, as to pretend that he trusts he has this <hi>motion,</hi> who knows that he has it not, who has made no Reflections on it, and when asked, what he means by it, can say nothing concerning it, and yet he dares venture to come and say it to <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>Church</hi>: If a Man pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends a <hi>Commission</hi> from a <hi>Prince,</hi> or indeed from any Person, and acts in his <hi>Name</hi> upon it, the Law will fall on him, and punish him, and shall
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:42659:83"/>
the <hi>Great God of Heaven and Earth,</hi> be thus vouched, and his <hi>motion</hi> he pretended to, by those whom he has neither <hi>called</hi> nor <hi>sent</hi>? and shall not he reckon with those who dare to run without his <hi>Mission,</hi> pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they <hi>trust</hi> they have it, when perhaps they understand not the Importance of it, nay, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps some laugh at it, as an Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Question, who, yet will go through with the <hi>Office</hi>? They come to Christ for the <hi>Loaves</hi>: They hope to live by the <hi>Altar,</hi> and the <hi>Gospel,</hi> how little soever they <hi>serve</hi> at the one, or <hi>Preach</hi> the other; therefore they will say any thing, that is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for qualifying them to this whether true or false. It cannot be denied, but that this Question car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries a sound in it, that seems a little too high, and that may rather raise Scruples, as importing somewhat that is not ordinary, and that seems to savour of <hi>Enthusiasme</hi>; and therefore it was put here, without doubt, to give great caution to such as come to the Service of the Church; many may be able to answer it truly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:42659:83"/>
to the Sense of the Church, who may yet have great doubting in themselves concerning it; but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Man that has it not, must needs know that he has it not.</p>
               <p>The true meaning of it must be resolved thus; the Motives that ought to determine a Man, to dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate himself to the Ministring in the Church, are a Zeal for promoting the Glory of God, for raising the Honour of the Christian Religion, for the making it to be better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, and more submitted to. He that loves it, and feels the excellency of it in himself, that has a due Sense of God's goodness in it to Mankind, and that is entirely possessed with that, will feel a Zeal within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, for communicating that to others; that so <hi>the only true God, and Iesus Christ whom he has sent,</hi> may be more universally glorified, and served by his Creatures: And when to this he has added a concern of the Souls for Men, a Tenderness for them, a Zeal to res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue them from endless Misery, and a desire to put them in the way to everlasting Happiness, and from
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:42659:84"/>
these Motives feels in himself a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to dedicate his Life and Labours to those ends; and in order to them studies to understand the Scriptures, and more particularly, the <hi>New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> that from thence he may form a true Notion of this Holy Religion, and so be <hi>an able Minister of it</hi>; this Man, and only this Man, so <hi>moved</hi> and so qualified, can in Truth, and with a good Conscience answer, that he <hi>trusts he is inwardly moved by the Holy Ghost.</hi> And every one that ventures on the saying it, without this, is a <hi>Sacrilegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous profaner</hi> of the Name of <hi>God,</hi> and of his <hi>Holy Spirit.</hi> He breaks in upon his Church, not to <hi>feed</hi> it but to rob it: And it is certain that he who begins with a Lie, may be sent by the <hi>Father of Lies,</hi> but he cannot be thought to enter in, by the Door, who prevaricates in the first word that he says in order to his Admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
               <p>But if the Office of <hi>Deacons</hi> offers no other particular matter of Reflection, the Office of Ordaining <hi>Priests,</hi> has a great deal; indeed the whole of it, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to the best Notions of the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:42659:84"/>
best Times. In the Charge that is given, the Figures of <hi>Watchmen, Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds,</hi> and <hi>Stewards,</hi> are pursued, and the places of Scripture relating to these are applied to them: <hi>They are required to have always printed in their Remembrance; How great a Treasure was committed to their Charge: The Church and Congregation whom you must serve is his Spouse and Body. Then the greatness of the fault of their Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, and the horrible Punishment that will follow upon it, is set before them, in case the Church or any Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of it take any hurt or hinderance by reason of it: They are charged ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to cease their Labour, Care and Diligence, till they have done all that lieth in them, according to their boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Duty, towards all such, as are, or shall be committed to their Care, to bring them to a Ripeness and Perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Age in Christ.</hi> They are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain urged to <hi>consider with what care and study, they ought to apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to this; to pray earnestly for Gods Holy Spirit, and to be studious in Reading and Learning of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and to forsake and set aside,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:42659:85"/>
as much as they may, all Worldly Cares and Studies. It is hoped that they have clearly determined by Gods Grace, to give themselves wholly to this Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: and as much as lieth in them to apply themselves wholly to this one thing; and to draw all their Cares and Studies this way, and to this end; and that by their daily reading and weighing the Scriptures, they will study to wax riper and stronger in their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry.</hi> These are some of the words of the preparatory <hi>Charge</hi> given by the Bishop, when he enters upon this Office; before he puts the questions that follow to those, who are to be ordained. What greater force or ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy could be put in Words, than is in these? Or where could any be found that are more weighty and more express; to shew the intire Dedication of the <hi>whole Man,</hi> of his <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Labours,</hi> and the <hi>separating himself from all other Cares to follow this one thing with all possible Application and Zeal?</hi> There is nothing in any Office, Ancient or Modern, that I ever saw which is of this <hi>force,</hi> so serious and so solemn; and it plainly
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:42659:85"/>
implies not only the <hi>Sense</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> upon this whole matter, but likewise their design who framed it, to oblige <hi>Priests,</hi> notwithstanding any Relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that the Laws of the Land had still favoured, by the firmest and sacredst bonds possible to attend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their <hi>Flocks</hi>; and to do their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For a bare <hi>Residence,</hi> without labouring, is but a mock <hi>Residence,</hi> since the obligation to it, is in order to a further end; that they may <hi>watch over,</hi> and <hi>feed their Flock,</hi> and not enjoy their Benefices only as Farms, or as <hi>Livings,</hi> according to the gross, but common abuse of our Language, by which the Names of <hi>Cures, Parishes,</hi> or <hi>Benefices,</hi> which are the Ecclesiastical Names, are now swallowed up into that of <hi>Living,</hi> which carries a carnal Idea in the very sound of the word, and I doubt a more carnal effect on the minds of both Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy and Laity.</p>
               <p>What ever we may be, our Church is free of this Reproach: since this Charge carries their Duty as high, and as home, as any thing that can be laid in Words. And it is further to
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:42659:86"/>
be considered, that this is not of the Nature of a private Exhortation, in which a Man of lively thoughts, and a warm fancy, may be apt to carry a point too high: It is the constant and uniform voice of the Church. Nor is it of the nature of a Charge, which is only the Sense of him that gives it, and to which the Person to whom it is given, is only Passive: He hears it, but cannot be bound by another Man's Thoughts or Words, further than as the Nature of things binds him. But <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> are of the nature of a <hi>Covenant</hi> between <hi>Christ</hi> and the <hi>Clerks;</hi> in which so many Privileges and Powers are granted on the one part, and so many Duties and <hi>Offices</hi> are promised on the other; and this <hi>Charge</hi> being the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to it, it is <hi>stipulatory.</hi> It declares the whole <hi>Covenant</hi> of both sides; and so those who receive <hi>Orders</hi> upon it, are as much bound by every part of it, and it becomes as much their own Act, as if they had pronounced or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised it all, in the most formal Words that could be, and indeed the <hi>Answers</hi> and <hi>Promises</hi> that are afterwards made, are only the Application of this, to
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:42659:86"/>
the particular Persons, for giving them a plainer and livelier Sense of their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation, which yet, in it self, was as intire and strong, whether they had made any promise by Words of their own or not.</p>
               <p>But to put the matter out of doubt, let us look a little further into the <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi> to the Promises that they make, with relation to their <hi>Flock,</hi> even to such <hi>as are, or shall be committed to their Charge.</hi> They promise, <hi>That by the Help of the Lord they will give their Faithful Diligence, always so to Minister the Doctrine and Sacraments, and the Discipline of Christ, as the Lord hath commanded, and as this Realm hath received the same, according to the Commandment of God; so that they may teach the People committed to their Care and Charge with all Diligence to keep and observe the same.</hi> This does plainly bind to personal Labour, the mention that is made of <hi>what this Realm has received,</hi> being limited by what follows <hi>according to the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God,</hi> shews that by this is meant the <hi>Reformation</hi> of the Doctrine and Worship that was then received,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:42659:87"/>
and established by Law; by which these general Words, <hi>The Doctrine and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Discipline of Christ,</hi> to which all Parties pretend, are determined to our Constitution; so that tho there were some Disorders among us, not yet provided against by the <hi>Laws of the Land;</hi> this does not secure a reserve for them. This is so slight a remark, that I should be ashamed to have made it, if it had not been urged to my self, slight as it is, to justifie in point of Conscience, the claiming all such Privileges, or Qualifications, as are still allowed by <hi>Law.</hi> But I go on to the other Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: The Clerk says <hi>he will, by the help of God, be ready with all Faithful Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, to banish and drive away all erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous and strange Doctrines, contrary to God's Word, and to use both publick and private Admonitions, and Exhortations, as well to the sick, as to the whole, within his Cure, as need shall require, and as occasion shall be given</hi>: This is as plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly personal, and constant, as Words can make any thing. And in this is expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the so much neglected, but so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Duty, which Incumbents owe their Flock, in a <hi>private way,</hi> visiting,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:42659:87"/>
instructing, and admonishing them, which is one of the most useful, and important parts of their Duty, how generally soever it may be disused or forgotten: These being the chief instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and acts of <hi>watching over and feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Flock,</hi> that is committed to their <hi>Care.</hi> In the next place they promise, <hi>That they will be diligent in Prayers, and in reading of the Holy Scriptures, and in such Studies as help to the Knowledge of the same, laying aside, the study of the World and the Flesh:</hi> This still carries on that great Notion of the <hi>Pastoral Care,</hi> which runs through this whole <hi>Office;</hi> that it is to be a Man's intire Business, and is to possess both his thoughts and his time. They do further promise <hi>That they will maintain, and set forward, as much as lieth in them, quietness, peace, and love among all Christian People, and especially among them, that are, or shall be committed to their Charge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These are the Vows and Promises that Priests make before they can be Ordained: And to compleat the Stipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, the <hi>Bishop</hi> concludes it, with a Prayer to God <hi>who has given them the will to do all these things, to give them
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:42659:88"/>
also strength, and power to perform the same: that he may accomplish his Work, which he hath begun in them, until the time that he shall come<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at the latter day, to judge the quick and the dead.</hi> Upon the whole matter either this is all a piece of gross and impudent <hi>Pageantry,</hi> dressed up in grave and lofty Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to strike upon the weaker part of Mankind, and to furnish the rest with matter to their profane and impious Scorn; or it must be confessed that <hi>Priests</hi> come under the most formal and express Engagements, to constant and diligent <hi>labour,</hi> that can be possibly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived or set forth in Words. It is upon this, that they are Ordained: So their <hi>Ordination</hi> being the consummation of this <hi>compact,</hi> it must be acknowledged that according to the nature of all mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual <hi>compacts;</hi> a total failure on the one side, does also dissolve all the Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that lay on the other: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore those who do not perform their part, that do not <hi>Reside</hi> and <hi>Labour,</hi> they do also in the sight of God, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit all the <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Privileges</hi> that do follow their <hi>Orders,</hi> as much as a <hi>Christian</hi> at large, that does not perform
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:42659:88"/>
his <hi>Baptismal Vow,</hi> forfeits the Rights and Benefits of his Baptism, in the sight of God; tho both in the one, and in the other, it is necessary that for the prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of disorder and confusion, a Sentence Declaratory of <hi>Excommunication,</hi> in the one, as of <hi>Degradation</hi> in the other, pass before the Visible Acts and Rights, pursuant to those Rites, can be denied.</p>
               <p>To all this I will add one thing more, which is, that since our Book of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, is a part of our <hi>Liturgy,</hi> and likewise a part of the <hi>Law</hi> of the <hi>Land,</hi> and since constant Attendance, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent Labour is made necessary by it, and since this Law is subsequent to the Act of the 21<hi>st.</hi> of <hi>Henry</hi> the 8<hi>th.</hi> that qualifies so many for <hi>Pluralities,</hi> and <hi>Non-Residence,</hi> and is in plain Terms contrary to it, this as subsequent does repeal all that it contradicts: It is upon all this, a matter that to me seems plain, that by this Law, the other is Repealed, in so far, as it is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with it. This Argument is by this Consideration made the stronger, that the Act of King <hi>Henry</hi> does not <hi>enact</hi> that such things shall be,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:42659:89"/>
but only reserves <hi>privildeges</hi> for such as may be capable of an Exemption from the common and general rules. Now by the Principles of Law, all <hi>Priviledges</hi> or Exemptions of that sort, are <hi>odious things</hi>; and the <hi>Constructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Law</hi> lying hard and heavy against <hi>odious Cases,</hi> it appears to me according to the general grounds of <hi>Law,</hi> very probable (I speak within bounds, when I say only <hi>probable</hi>) that the Act of Uniformity which makes the <hi>Offices of Ordination</hi> a part of the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> is a Repeal of that part of the Act of King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> which qualifies for <hi>Pluralities.</hi> To conclude, Whatsoever may be the strength of this Plea in Bar to that Act, if our <hi>Faith</hi> given to <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>Church,</hi> in the most express and plainest words possible, does bind, if <hi>Promises</hi> given at the <hi>Altar</hi> do ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige, and if a <hi>Stipulation,</hi> in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of which <hi>Orders</hi> are <hi>given, is</hi> sacred and of an indispensible ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation, then, I am sure, this is.</p>
               <p>To make the whole matter yet the stronger, this Office is to be complea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with a <hi>Communion</hi>: So that upon
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:42659:89"/>
this occasion, that is not only a piece of Religious Devotion, accompanying it; but it is the taking the <hi>Sacrament</hi> upon the <hi>Stipulation</hi> that has been made, between the Priest and the Church: So that those who have framed this Office, have certainly intended by all the ways that they could think on, and by the weightiest words they could choose, to make the sense of the <hi>Priestly Function,</hi> and of the <hi>Duties</hi> belonging to it, give deep and strong impressions to such as are <hi>Ordained.</hi> I have compared with it, all the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations that are in all the Offices I could find, <hi>Ancient</hi> and <hi>Modern,</hi> whether of the <hi>Greek</hi> or the <hi>Latin</hi> Church, and this must be said of <hi>Ours,</hi> without any sort of partiality to our own <hi>Forms,</hi> that no sort of compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison can be made between <hi>Ours</hi> and all the others: and that as much as <hi>ours</hi> is more simple than those as to its <hi>Rites and Ceremonies,</hi> which swell up other <hi>Offices,</hi> so much is it more grave and weighty in the <hi>Exhortations, Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects</hi> and <hi>Sponsions</hi> that are made in it. In the Roman Pontifical no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises are demanded of <hi>Priests,</hi> but
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:42659:90"/>
only that of <hi>Obedience: Bishops</hi> in a corrupted state of the Church, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king care only of their own Authority, while they neglected more important obligations.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Office</hi> of <hi>Consecrating Bishops</hi>; as all the <hi>Sponsions</hi> made by them, when they were ordained <hi>Priests,</hi> are to be considered as still binding, since the Inferiour <hi>Office</hi> does still subsist in the Superiour; so there are new <hi>ones</hi> superadded, proportioned to the exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of <hi>Dignity</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> that accompanies that <hi>Office.</hi> In the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Pontifical,</hi> there are indeed que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions put to a Bishop, before he is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated: but of all these the first on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is that which has any relation to his <hi>Flock</hi>: which is in these words: <hi>Wilt thou teach the people over whom thou art to be set, both by thy Example and Doctrine: those things that thou learnst out of the Holy Scripture?</hi> All the rest are general, and relate only to his Conversation; but not at all to his <hi>Labours</hi> in his <hi>Diocess</hi>: Whereas on the contrary, the engagements in our <hi>Office</hi> do regard not only a Bishop's own <hi>Conversation,</hi> but chiefly his Duty to
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:42659:90"/>
his People: he declares that <hi>he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to instruct the People committed to his Charge, out of the Holy Scriptures:</hi> That <hi>he will study them, so as to be able by them, to teach and exhort, with wholsome Doctrine; and withstand and convince the Gain-sayers:</hi> That <hi>he will be ready with all faithful Diligence, to banish and drive away all erroneous and strange Doctrine, contrary to God's word: And both privately and openly to call upon and encourage others to the same:</hi> That <hi>he will maintain and set forward as much as lies in him; quietness, love, and peace among all Men; and correct and punish such as be unquiet, disobedient, and criminous, within his Diocess: Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to such Authority as he has.</hi> In particular, <hi>He promises to be Faithful in ordaining, sending, or laying Hands upon others: He promises also to shew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be gentle, and merciful for Christ's sake, to poor and needy People, and to all Strangers destitute of Help.</hi> These are the Covenants and Promises under which <hi>Bishops</hi> are put, which are again reinforced upon them, in the Charge that is given immediately after their Consecration, when the Bible is
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:42659:91"/>
put in their Hands; <hi>Give heed to Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Exhortation, and Doctrine: Think upon the things contained in this Book; be diligent in them, that the increase co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming thereby may be manifest unto all Men. Take heed unto thy Self, and to Doctrine, and be diligent in doing them, for by doing this thou shalt both save thy self and them that hear thee. Be thou to the Flock of Christ, a Shepherd, not a Wolf; feed them, devour them not: Hold up the weak, heal the sick, bind up the broken, bring again the out-casts, seek the lost: Be so merciful that you be not too remiss: So Minister Discipline that you forget not Mercy: That when the chief Shepherd shall appear, you may receive the never fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Crown of Glory, through Iesus Christ our Lord.</hi> In these Words, the great Lines of our Duty are drawn, in very expressive and comprehensive Terms. We have the several Branches of our Function, both as to Preaching and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning very solemnly laid upon us: And both in this <hi>Office</hi> as well as in all the other <hi>Offices</hi> that I have seen, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that the constant sence of all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, in all Ages, has been that <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> was the Bishops <hi>great Duty,</hi> and
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:42659:91"/>
that he ought to lay himself out in it most particularly.</p>
               <p>I shall only add one advice to all this, before I leave this Article of the Sence of our <hi>Church</hi> in this matter; both to those, who intend to take <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> and to those who have already taken them. As for such as do intend to dedicate themselves to the service of the Church, they ought to read over these <hi>Offices</hi> frequently; and to ask themselves solemnly, as in the presence of God, Whether they can with a good Conscience, make those answers which the Book prescribes, or not? and not to venture on offering themselves to <hi>Oders,</hi> till they know that they dare and may safely do it. Every person who looks that way, ought at least on eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Ordination Sunday, after he has once formed the resolution of dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himself to this work, to go over the Office seriously with himself, and to consider in what disposition or prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of mind he is; suitable to what he finds laid down in it. But I should add to this, that for a Year before he comes to be <hi>ordained,</hi> he should every first Sunday of the Month read over

the Office very deliberately; and frame resolutions, conform to the several parts of it, and if he can, receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon it, with a special set of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Devotions relating to his intentions. As the time of his <hi>Ordination</hi> draws near, he ought to return the oftner to those exercises. It will be no hard task for him to read these over every Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, during the last Quarter before his <hi>Ordination</hi>; and to do that yet more solemnly, every day of the week in which he is to be <hi>ordained</hi>: and to joyn a greater earnestness of <hi>fasting</hi> and <hi>prayer</hi> with it on the Fast-days of his Ember Week.</p>
               <p>Here is no hard imposition. The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance is as easie in it self, as it will be successful in its effects. If I did not consider, rather what the Age can bear, than what were to be wished for, I would add a great many severe Rules calculated to the Notions of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive times. But if this advice were put in practice, it is to be hoped, that it would set back many who come to be <hi>ordained,</hi> without considering duly, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther what it is that they ask, or what it is that is to be asked of them: which
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:42659:92"/>
some do with so supine a negligence, that we plainly see that they have not so much as read the <hi>Office,</hi> or at least that they have done it in so slight a manner, that they have formed no clear Notions upon any part of it, and least of all, upon those parts to which they themselves are to make answers. And as such a method as I have proposed would probably strike some with a due awe of Divine matters, so as to keep them at a distance, till they were in some sort prepared for them; so it would oblige such as came to it, to bring along with them a serious temper of mind, and such a preparation of soul as might make that their <hi>Orders</hi> should be a blessing to them, as well as they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves should be a blessing to the <hi>Church.</hi> It must be the greatest joy of a <hi>Bishops</hi> life, who truly minds his <hi>duty</hi> in this weighty trust of <hi>sending out Labourers into Gods Vineyard</hi>; to Ordain such persons of whom he has just grounds to hope, that they shall do their <hi>duty,</hi> faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, in reaping that <hi>Harvest.</hi> He reckons these as his Children indeed, who are to be his <hi>strength</hi> and <hi>support,</hi> his <hi>fellow Labourers</hi> and <hi>Helpers</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:42659:93"/>
                  <hi>Crown</hi> and his <hi>Glory.</hi> But on the other hand, how heavy a part of his <hi>Office</hi> must it be to <hi>Ordain</hi> those against whom, perhaps there lies no just objection, so that according to the Constitution and Rules of the Church, he cannot deny them; and yet he sees nothing in them that gives him courage or cheerfulness. They do not seem to have that <hi>love</hi> to God, that <hi>zeal</hi> for Christ, that <hi>tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> for souls, that <hi>meekness</hi> and <hi>humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> that <hi>mortification</hi> and <hi>deadness</hi> to the world, that becomes the Character and Profession which they undertake; so that his heart fails him, and his hands tremble when he goes to <hi>Ordain</hi> them.</p>
               <p>My next advice shall be to those, who are already in <hi>Orders,</hi> that they will at least four times a year, on the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation Sundays, read over the <hi>Offices</hi> of the Degrees of the Church in which they are: and will particularly consider the Charge that was given, and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers that were made by them; and then ask themselves as before God, who will <hi>Iudge</hi> them at the <hi>Great-day,</hi> upon their Religious performance of them, whether they have been true to them or
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:42659:93"/>
not that so they may humble themselves for their Errours, and Omissions, and may renew their <hi>Vows</hi> for the future, and so to be going on from Quarter to Quarter, through the whole course of their <hi>Ministry</hi> observing still what ground they gain, and what progress they make, to such as have a right Sense of their Duty, this will be no hard perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance. It will give a vast joy to those that can go through it with some measure of assurance, and find, that tho in the midest of <hi>many tentations</hi> and of much weakness, they are sincerely and seriously going on in their work to the best of their skill, and to the utmost of their power: So that their Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences say within them, and that without the partialities of self love and flattery, <hi>Well done, good and faithful servant.</hi> The hearing of this said within, upon true grounds, being the certainest Evidence possible that it shall be publickly said at the Last and Great-day. This exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise will also offer checks to a man that looks for them; and intends both to understand his errours, and to cleanse himself from them. It will upon the whole matter, make <hi>Clergy Men</hi> go on

               <p>Having known the very good effect that this Method has had on some, I dare the more confidently recommend it to all others.</p>
               <p>Before I conclude this Chapter, I will shew what Rules our Reformers had prepared with Relation to <hi>Non-Residence,</hi> and <hi>Pluralities</hi>; which tho they never passed into Laws, and so have no bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing force with them, yet in these we see what was the sense of those that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared our <hi>Offices,</hi> and that were the chief Instruments in that blessed Work of our <hi>Reformation.</hi> The 12<hi>th.</hi> Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Title, <hi>concerning those that were to be admitted to Ecclesiastical Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,</hi> runs thus. <hi>Whereas, when many Benefices are conferred on one Person, every one of these must be served with less order and exactness, and many learned Men, who are not provided, are by that means shut out; therefore, such as examine the Persons who are proposed for Benefices, are to ask eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of them, whether he has at that time another Benefice or not, and if he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses that he has, then they shall not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to his obtaining that to which he is
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:42659:94"/>
presented, or the first Benefice shall be made void, as in case of Death, so that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron may present any other Person to it.</hi> Chap 13. is against <hi>Dispensations,</hi> in these Words. <hi>No Man shall hereafter be capable of any Privilege, by virtue of which he may hold more Parishes than one. But such as have already obtained any such Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensations for Pluralities, shall not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the effects of them, by virtue of this Law.</hi> The 14<hi>th. Chapter</hi> relates to <hi>Residence,</hi> in these Words. <hi>If any Man by reason of Age or Sickness, is disabled from discharging his Duty, or if he has any just cause of absence for some time, that shall be approved of by the Bishop, he must take care to place a worthy Person, to serve during his absence. But the Bishops ought to take a special Care, that upon no regard whatsoever, any Person may, upon feigned or pretended Reasons, be suffered to be lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger absent from his Parish, than a real ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity shall require.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These are some of the Rules which were then prepared, and happy had it been for our <hi>Church,</hi> if that whole work of the <hi>Reformation of the Ecclesiastical Law,</hi> had been then setled among us. Then we might justly have said, that
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:42659:95"/>
our <hi>Reformation</hi> was <hi>compleat,</hi> and not have lamented as our <hi>Church</hi> still does in the <hi>Office of Commination that the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Discipline which was in the Primitive Church is not yet restored,</hi> how much, and how long soever it has been <hi>wished</hi> for. It is more than probable that we should neither have had <hi>Schisms,</hi> nor <hi>Civil Wars,</hi> if that great design had not been abortive. If but the 19<hi>th.</hi> and 20<hi>th.</hi> Titles of that work, which treat of the <hi>publick offices, and Officers in the Church,</hi> had became a part of our Law, and been duly executed, we should in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed have had matter of glorying in the World.</p>
               <p>In the Canons of the Year 1571. tho there was not then strength enough in the Church, to cure so inveterate a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease, as <hi>Non-Residence,</hi> yet she expressed her detestation of it, in these Words. <hi>The absence of a Pastor from the Lord's Flock; and that supine negligence and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoning of the Ministry, which we observe in many, is a thing vile in it self, odious to the People, and pernicious to the Church of God; therefore, we exhort all the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors of Churches, in our Lord Iesus, that they will as soon as is possible, come to their
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:42659:95"/>
Churches, and diligently Preach the Gospel, and according to the value of their Livings, that they will keep House, and hospitably relieve the Poor.</hi> It is true, all this is much lessened by the last Words of that Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, <hi>That every Year they must reside at least Threescore daies upon their Benefices.</hi> By the <hi>Canons</hi> made at that time, Plurali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were also limited to 20 <hi>miles distance.</hi> But this was enlarged to 30 miles, by the Canons in the Year 1597. Yet by these the <hi>Pluralist</hi> was required to spend <hi>a good part of the Year</hi> in both his Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. And upon this, has the matter rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ever since; but there is no express definition made how far that general word of <hi>a good part of the Year</hi> is to be understood.</p>
               <p>I will not to this add a long invidious <hi>History</hi> of all the attempts that have been made for the <hi>Reforming</hi> these abuses, nor the methods that have been made use of to defeat them. They have been but too successful, so that we still groan under our abuses; and do not know when the time shall come in which we shall be freed from them. The defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of those abuses, who get too much by them, to be willing to part with them,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:42659:96"/>
have made great use of this, that it was the <hi>Puritan Party,</hi> that during <hi>Q. Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> and K. <hi>Iames</hi> the 1<hi>sts.</hi> Reign, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted these <hi>Bills,</hi> to render the Church <hi>odious</hi>: Whereas, it seems more probable, that those who set them forward, what invidious Characters soever their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies might put them under, were really <hi>the Friends of the Church</hi>; and that they intended to preserve it, by freeing it from so crying, and so visible an abuse: which gives an offence and scandal, that is not found out by much learning, or great observation; but arises so evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of the nature of things, that a small measure of <hi>common sense,</hi> helps every one to see it, and to be deeply prejudic'd against it. But since our Church has fallen under the evils and mischiefs of <hi>Schism,</hi> none of those who divide from us, have made any more attempts this way; but seem rather to be not ill pleased, that such <hi>Scandals</hi> should be still among us, as hoping that this is so great a load up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Church, that it both weakens our strength, and lessens our Authority. It is certainly the interest of an Enemy to suffer the body to which he opposes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to lie under as many Prejudices, and
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:42659:96"/>
to be liable to as much censure, as is possible; whereas every good and wise Friend studies to preserve that body to which he unites himself, by freeing it from every thing that may render it less acceptable, and less useful.</p>
               <p>Here I will leave this Argument, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving I think said enough, to convince all, that have a true Zeal to our Church, and that think themselves bound in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science to obey its Rules, and that seem to have a particular jealousie of the <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Powers,</hi> breaking in too far upon the <hi>Ecclesiastical Authority,</hi> that there can be nothing more plain and express, than that our <hi>Church</hi> intends to bring all her <hi>Priests</hi> under the strictest obligations pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, to constant and personal <hi>Labour,</hi> and that in this she pursues the designs and Canons, not only of the <hi>Primitive,</hi> and <hi>best</hi> times, but even of the <hi>worst Ages,</hi> Since none were ever so corrupt as not to condemn those abuses by <hi>Canon,</hi> even when they maintained them in <hi>practice.</hi> She does not only bind <hi>them</hi> to this, by the <hi>Charge</hi> she appoints to be given, but also by the <hi>Vows</hi> and <hi>Promises</hi> that she demands of such as are <hi>Ordained.</hi> When all this is laid together, and when there
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:42659:97"/>
stands nothing on the other side, to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance it, but a Law made in a very bad time, that took away some <hi>abuses,</hi> but left pretences to cover others; Can any man that weighs these things together, in the <hi>sight of God,</hi> and that believes he must answer to him for this at the <hi>great Day,</hi> think, that the one, how strong soever it may be in his favour at an earthly Tribunal, will be of any force in that <hi>last and dreadful Iudgment.</hi> This I leave upon all Mens Consciences; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping that <hi>they will so judge themselves, that they shall not be judged of the Lord.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>THE greatest good that one can hope to do in this World is upon young Persons, who have not yet ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken their ply, and are not spoiled with Prejudices, and wrong Notions. Those who have taken an ill <hi>one</hi> at first, will neither be at the pains to look over their Notions, nor turn to new Methods; nor will they by any change of Practice, seem to confess that they were once in the wrong; so that if Matters that are amiss, can be mended or set right, it must be by giving those that have not yet set out, and that are not yet engaged, truer views, and juster Idea's of things. I will therefore here lay down the model, upon which a <hi>Clerk</hi> is to be formed, and will begin with such things as ought to be previous and preparatory to his being initiated into Orders.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:42659:98"/>These are of two sorts, the one is of such preparations as are necessary to give his Heart and Soul a <hi>right temper,</hi> and a <hi>true sense</hi> of things: The other is of such <hi>studies</hi> as are necessary to enable him to go through with the several parts of his Duty. Both are necessary, but the first is the more indispensible of the two; for a Man of a good Soul, may with a moderate proportion of knowledge do great Service in the Church, especially if he is suited with an imployment, that is not above his <hi>Talent</hi>: Whereas unsanctified knowledge puffs up; is insolent and unquiet, it gives great scandal, and occasions much distraction in the Church. In treating of these qualifications, I will watch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver my thoughts, not to let them rise to a pitch that is above what the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon frailties of humane Nature, or the Age we live in, can bear: and after all, if in any thing I may seem to exceed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hese measures, it is to be considered, that it is natural in proposing the <hi>Ideas</hi> of things, to carry them to what is <hi>wished</hi> for, which is but too often be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what can be <hi>expected</hi>; consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>both</hi> the corruption of mankind and of these degenerated times.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:42659:98"/>First of all then, he that intends to dedicate himself to the Church, ought, from the time that he takes up any such Resolution, to enter upon a greater De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency of Behaviour, that his Mind may not be vitiated by ill Habits; which may both give such bad Characters of him, as maystick long on him afterwards, and make such ill Impressions on himself, as may not be easily worn out or defaced. He ought, above all things, to possess himself with a high Sense of the <hi>Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> of its Truth and Excellence, of the Value of Souls, of the Dignity of the <hi>Pastoral Care,</hi> of the Honour of <hi>God,</hi> of the Sacredness of <hi>Holy Functions,</hi> and of the Great <hi>Trust</hi> that is committed to those who are set apart from the World, and dedicated to God and to his Church. He who looks this way, must break himself to the Appetites of Pleasure, or Wealth, of Ambition, or Authority; he must consider that the <hi>Religion,</hi> in which he intends to Officiate, calls all Men to great Purity and Vertue; to a Probity and Innocence of Manners, to a Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Gentleness, to a Humility and Self-denial, to a Contempt of the World and a Heavenly Mindedness, to a Patient Resignation to the Will of
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:42659:99"/>
God, and a readiness to bear the Cross, in the hopes of that everlasting Reward, which is reserved for Christians in another State: All which was eminently recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, by the unblemish'd Pattern that the Author of this <hi>Religion,</hi> has set to all that pretend to be his Followers. These being the Obligations which a Preacher of the Gospel is to lay daily upon all his Hearers, he ought certainly to accustom himself often to consider seriously of them; and to think how Shameless and Impudent a thing it will be in him, to perform <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices</hi> suitable to all these, and that do sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose them, to be Instructing the People, and Exhorting them to the Practice of them, unless he is in <hi>some sort</hi> all this him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, which he teaches others to be.</p>
               <p>Indeed to be tied to such an Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, while one has not an inward Conformity to it, and Complacence in it, is both the most unbecoming, the most unpleasant, and the most uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable State of Life imaginable. Such a Person will be exposed to all Mens Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures and Reproaches, who when they see things amiss in his Conduct, do not only Reproach him, but the whole Church and Body, to which he belongs; and which is more, the Religion which he
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:42659:99"/>
seems to recommend by his Discourses, though his Life and Actions, which will always pass for the most real Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his inward Sentiments, are a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible and continual opposition to it. On all these things, he whose Thoughts car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry him towards the Church, ought to reflect frequently: Nothing is so odious as a Man that disagrees with his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, a Soldier that is a <hi>Coward,</hi> a Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier that is <hi>Brutal</hi>; an Ambassadour that is <hi>Abject,</hi> are not such unseemly things, as a bad or vicious, a drunken or dissolute <hi>Clergy-man.</hi> But though his Scandals should not rise up to so high a pitch, even a Proud and Passionate, a Worldly Minded and Covetous <hi>Priest,</hi> gives the Lye to his Discourses so palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, that he cannot expect they should have much weight. Nor is such a Man's State of Life less unpleasant to himself, than it is unbecoming. He is obliged to be often performing <hi>Offices,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing <hi>Discourses,</hi> in which if he is not a Good Man, he not only has no Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, but must have a formed Aversion to them. They must be the heaviest Burden of his Life; he must often feel se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Challenges within; and though he as often silences these, yet such unwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:42659:100"/>
Reflections are uncomfortable things. He is forced to manage himself wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h a perpetual constraint, and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve a <hi>decorum</hi> in his Deportment, lest he fall under a more publick Censure: Now to be bound to act a Part, and live with restraint ones whole Life, must be a very Melancholy thing. He cannot go so quite out of sight of Religion, and Convictions, as other bad Men do, who live in a perpetual hurry, and a total for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulness of Divine Matters: They have no Checks, because they are as seldom in the way to find them, as is possible. But a <hi>Clerk</hi> cannot keep himself out of their way; he must remember them, and speak of them, at least upon some occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, whether he will or no: He has no other way to secure himself against them, but by trying what he can do, to make himself absolutely disbelieve them. <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative Atheism,</hi> that is, a total neglect of all Religion, is but too easily arrived at; yet this will not serve his turn, he must build his Atheism upon some Bottom, that he may find quiet in it. If he is an Ignorant Man, he is not furnished with those flights of Wit, and shews of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that must support it: But if he is really Learned, he will soon be beaten
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:42659:100"/>
out of them; for a Learned Atheism is so hard a thing to be conceived, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less a Man's Powers are first strangely vitiated, it is not easie to see how any one can bring himself to it. There is nothing that can settle the quiet of an ill Priest's Mind and Life, but a stupid Formality, and a <hi>Callus</hi> that he Contracts, by his insensible way of handling Divine Matters; by which he becomes hardn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d against them. But if this settles him by stupifying his Powers, it does put also him so far out of the reach of Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in all the ordinary methods of Grace, that it is scarce possible he can ever be awakned; and by Consequence that he can be saved; and if he perishes, he must fall into the lowest degree of Misery, even to the Portion of <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites:</hi> For his whole Life has been a course of <hi>Hypocrisie</hi> in the strictest Sence of the Word, which is the Acting of a Part, and the Counterfeiting another Person. His Sins have in them all pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Aggravations; they are against Knowledge and against Vows, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his Character; they carry in them a deliberate Contempt of all the Truths and Obligations of Religion; and if he perishes, he does not perish alone,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:42659:101"/>
but carries a Shoal down with him, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of those who have perished in Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, through his neglect; or of those who have been hardned in their Sins, through his ill Example: And since all this must be put to his Account, it may be justly inferred from hence, That no man can have a heavier share in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series of another State, than profane and wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>He ought more particularly to examine himself, whether he has that Soft and Gentle, that Meek and Humble, and that Charitable and Compassionate Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, which the Gospel does so much press upon all Christians; that shined so emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently through the whole Life of the Blessed Author of it; and which he has so singularly recommended to all his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers; and that has in it so many Charms and Attractives, which do not only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend those who have these amiable Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,

                  </gap>nd a peevishness of Spirit, rendring the Lives of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> for the most part, bitter to themselves, and their Labours, how va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable soever otherwise they may be, unacceptable and useless to their People. A Clergyman must be prepared to bear Injuries, to endure much unjust Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and Calumny, to see himself of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten neglected, and others preferred to him, in the esteem of the People. He that takes all this ill, that resents it, and complains of it, does thereby give himself much disquiet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to be sure, he will, through his Peevishness, rather encrease than lessen that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, under which he is so uneasie; which is both better born, and sooner overcome, by a meek and a lowly Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. A Man of this Disposition affects
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:42659:102"/>
no Singularities, unless the faultiness of those about him, makes his doing his Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to be a <hi>Singularity</hi>: He does not study to lessen the value that is due to others, on design to encrease his own: His low thoughts of himself, make that he is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aspiring, nor envying such as<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are advanced: He is prepared to stay till God in his Providence thinks fit to raise him: He studies only to deserve Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and leaves to others the <hi>wringing</hi> Posts of Advantage out of the Hands of those that give them. Such a Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Mind in a Clergy-man, disposes him to be Happy in whatsoever Station he may be put, and renders the Church happy in him; for Men so moulded, even though their Talents should be but mean, are shining Lights, that may perhaps be at first despised, as Men of a low size, that have not Greatness of Soul enough to aspire, but when they have been seen and known so long, that all appears to be sincere, and that the Principle from whence this flows, is rightly considered, then every thing that they say or do, must have its due weight: The plainest and simplest things that they say have a Beauty in them, and will be hearkned to as Oracles.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:42659:102"/>But a Man that intends to prepare himself right for the Ministry of the Church, must indeed above all things, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to break himself to the love of the World, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ither of the Wealth, the Pomp, or the Pleasures of it. He must learn to be content with plain and sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Diet; and often even abridge that, by true <hi>Fasting:</hi> I do not call <hi>Fasting,</hi> a trifling distinction of Meats, but a lessening of the quantity, as well as the quality, and a contracting the time spent at Meals, that so he may have a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Freedom both in his Time, and in his Thoughts; that he may be more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and pray and meditate more, and that what he saves out of his Meals, he may give to the Poor. This is, in short, the true Measure and right Use of <hi>Fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> In cold Climates, an abstinence till Night, may create Disorders, and raise such a Disturbance both in the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, and in the Digestion; that this managed upon the practices of other Countries, especially in young Persons, may really distract instead of furthering those who do it Indiscreetly. In short <hi>Fasting</hi> unless joyned with Prayer and Alms-giving, is of no Value in the sight of God. It is a vast Advantage to a Man to be
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:42659:103"/>
broken to the Niceties of his Palate, to be content with plain Food, and even to dislike Delicacies and studied Dishes. This will make him easie in narrower Circumstances; since a plain Bill of Fare is soon discharged. A lover of his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites, and a slave to his Taste, makes but a mean Figure among Men, and a very scurvy one among Clergy-men.</p>
               <p>This deadness to the World must raise one above the Affectations of Pomp and State, of Attendance and high Living. Which to a Philosophical Mind will be heavy, when the Circumstances he is in, seem to impose and force it on him. And therefore he who has a right Sense, finds it is almost all he can do, to bear those things which the Tyranny of Custom or false Opinions put upon him: So far is he from longing for them. A Man that is truly dead to the World, would chuse much rather to live in a lowly and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Figure; than to be obliged to enter into the Methods of the greatness of this World; into which, if the Constitutions and Forms of a Church and Kingdom put him, yet he feels himself in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural and uncouth Posture: It is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his own Genius and Relish of things; and therefore he does not court
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:42659:103"/>
nor desire such a situation, but even while he is in it, he shews such a Neglect of the State of it, and so much Indifference and Humility in it, that it appears how little power those things have over his Mind, and how little they are able to subdue and corrupt it. This mortified Man must likewise become dead to all the Designs and Projects of making a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, or of raising the Fortunes of those that are nearly related to him: He must be Bountiful and Charitable; and tho' it is not only lawful to him, but a necessary Duty incumbent on him, to make due provision for his Family, if he has any, yet this must be so moderated that no vain nor sordid Designs, no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct nor unbecoming Arts, may mix in it; no excessive Wealth nor great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects must appear; he must be contented with such a proportion, as may set his Children in the way of a vertuous and liberal Education; such as may secure them from Scandal and Necessity, and put them in a Capacity to serve God and their Generation in some honest Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment. But he who brings along with him, a Voluptuous, an Ambitious, or a Covetous Mind, that is Carnal and Earthly minded, comes as a <hi>Hireling</hi> to
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:42659:104"/>
                  <hi>feed himself and not the Flock, he comes to Steal and to Destroy.</hi> Upon all, this great Reflection is to be made concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Motives that determine one to offer himself to this Employment.</p>
               <p>In the first beginnings of Christianity, no Man could reasonably think of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <hi>Orders,</hi> unless he had in him the <hi>Spirit of Martyrdom.</hi> He was to look for nothing in this Service, but Labour and Persecution: He was indeed to <hi>live of the Altar,</hi> and that was all the Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that he was to expect in this World. In those Days an extraordinary Measure of Zeal and Devotion was necessary, to engage Men to so hard and difficult a Province, that how great soever its Reward might be in another World, had nothing to look for in this, but a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Provision, and the first and largest share of the Cross: They were the best known, the most exposed, and the soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est fallen upon in the Persecution. But their Services and their Sufferings did so much recommend that Function in the succeeding Ages, that the Faithful thought they could never do enough to express their Value for it. The Church came to be Richly endowed; and tho' Superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had raised this out of measure, yet
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:42659:104"/>
the Extreme went as far to the other hand at the Reformation, when the <hi>Church</hi> was almost stript of all its Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, and a great many Churches were left so poor, that there was not in most Places, a sufficient; nay, not so much as a necessary Maintenance, reserved for those that were to minister in Holy Things. But it is to be acknowledged that there are such Remnants preserved, that many <hi>Benefices</hi> of the Church still may, and perhaps do but too much, work upon Mens corrupt Principles, their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, and their Covetousness: And it is shrewdly to be apprehended, that of those who present themselves at the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,</hi> a great part comes, as those who followed Christ, for the <hi>Loaves:</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the good Prospect they have of making their Fortunes by the Church.</p>
               <p>If this Point should be carried too far, it might perhaps seem to be a pitch above Humane Nature; and certainly very far above the degeneracy of the Age we live in: I shall therefore lay this matter, with as large an allowance, as I think it can bear. It is certain, that since God has made us to be a <hi>Compound of Soul and Body,</hi> it s not only <hi>lawful</hi> but <hi>suitable</hi> to the order of Nature, for us in the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:42659:105"/>
Choice we make of the <hi>state of Life</hi> that we intend to pursue, to consider our <hi>Bodies,</hi> in the next place after our <hi>Souls:</hi> Yet we ought certainly to begin with our <hi>Souls,</hi> with the Powers and Faculties that are in them, and consider well of what Temper they are; and what our Measure and Capacity is; that so we may chuse such a course of Life, for which we seem to be fitted, and in which we may probably do the most good both to our selves and others: From hence we ought to take our Aims and Measures chiefly: But in the next place, we not only may, but ought to consider our <hi>Bodies,</hi> how they shall be maintained, in a way suitable to that <hi>state of Life,</hi> into which we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged. Therefore tho' no Man can with a good Conscience, begin upon a world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Account, and resolve to dedicate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to the Church, merely out of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal regard; such as an Advowson in his Family, a Friend that will Promote him, or any other such like Prospect, till he has first consulted his Temper and Disposition, his Talents and his Capacities; yet, tho' it is not Lawful to make the Regards of this World his first Consideration, and it cannot be denied to be a perfecter state, if a Man should offer himself to
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:42659:105"/>
the Church, having whereon to support himself, without any Assistance or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward out of its Patrimony; and to be nearer to S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s practice, <hi>whose hands ministred to his necessities,</hi> and who reckoned that in this he had <hi>whereof to glory, that he was not burthensome to the Churches:</hi> Yet it is, without doubt, <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> for a Man to Design that he may subsist in and out of the Service of the Church: But then these Designs must be limited to a <hi>Subsistence,</hi> to such a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Proportion, as may maintain one in that state of Life. And must not be let fly by a restless Ambition, and an insa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiable Covetousness, as a ravenous Bird of prey, does at all Game. There must not be a perpetual Enquiry into the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of Benefices; and a constant Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuning of such as give them: If <hi>Laws</hi> have been made in some <hi>States</hi> restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all <hi>Ambitus</hi> and aspirings to Civil Imployments, certainly it were much more reasonable to put a stop to the scandalous Importunities, that are every where complained of; and no where more visible and more offensive than at <hi>Court.</hi> This gives a Prejudice to Men that are otherwise enclined enough to search for one, that can never be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:42659:106"/>
but by putting an effectual bar in the way of that scrambling for Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and Preferments; which will ever make the <hi>Lay</hi> part of Mankind conclude, that let us pretend what we will, <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness</hi> and <hi>Ambition</hi> are our true Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and our chief <hi>Vocation.</hi> It is true, the strange Practices of many <hi>Patrons,</hi> and the Constitution of most <hi>Courts,</hi> give a colour to excuse so great an Indecency. Men are generally successful in those Practices, and as long as Humane Nature is so strong, as all Men feel it to be, it will be hard to divert them from a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod which is so common, that to act otherwise would look like an affectation of Singularity; and many apprehend, that they must languish in Misery and Necessity if they are wanting to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, in so general a Practice. And, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, if <hi>Patrons,</hi> but chiefly if <hi>Princes</hi> would effectually cure this Disease which gives them so much Trouble, as well as Offence, they must resolve to distribute those Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices that are in their <hi>Gift,</hi> with so visible a Regard to true Goodness and real Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and with so firm and so constant an Opposition to <hi>Application</hi> and <hi>Importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> that it may appear that the only way to Advancement, is to live well, to study
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:42659:106"/>
hard, to stay at home, and labour dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently; and that <hi>Applications</hi> by the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> themselves, or any set on by them, shall always put those back who make them: This would more effectually cure so great an Evil, than all that can be said against it. One <hi>successful suiter</hi> who carries his <hi>Point,</hi> will promote this <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order,</hi> more than Twenty Repulses of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; for unless the <hi>Rule</hi> is severely car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on, every one will run into it; and hope to prosper as well as he, who they see has got his end in it. If those who have the Disposition of <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,</hi> to which the <hi>Cure of Souls is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed,</hi> did consider this as a <hi>Trust,</hi> lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with them, for which they must answer to God, and that they shall be in a great measure accountable for the <hi>Souls,</hi> that may be lost through the bad choice that they make, knowing it to be bad; if, I say, they had this more in their Thoughts, than so many Scores of Pounds, as the Living amounts to; and thought themselves really bound, as without doubt they are, to seek out Good and Worthy Men, well qualified and duely prepared, according to the Nature of that Benefice which they are to give; then we might hope to
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:42659:107"/>
see men make it their chief Study, to qualifie themselves aright; to order their Lives, and frame their Minds, as they ought to do, and to carry on their Studies with all Application and Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence; but as long as the <hi>short Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods,</hi> of Application, Friendship, or Interest, are more effectual than the <hi>long and hard way,</hi> of Labour and Study; Human Nature will always carry men to go the surest, the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siest, and the quickest way to work.</p>
               <p>After all I wish it were well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, by all <hi>Clerks,</hi> what it is to run without being either <hi>called</hi> or <hi>sent</hi>; and so to thrust ones self into the <hi>Vineyard,</hi> without staying, till God by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence puts a piece of his work in his Hands; this will give a man a vast ease in his Thoughts, and a great satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in all his Labours, if he knows that no Practices of his own, but merely the Directions of Providence, have put him in a Post. He may well trust the Effects of a thing to God, when the Causes of it do plainly flow from him. And though this will appear to a great many a hard Saying, so that few will be able to bear it, yet I must add this to the encouragement and comfort of
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:42659:107"/>
such as can resolve to deliver them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves up to the Conduct and Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Providence,</hi> that I never yet knew any one of those few (too few I confess they have been) who were pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed with this <hi>Maxim,</hi> and that have followed it exactly, that have not found the Fruit of it even in this World. A watchful Care hath hovered over them: Instruments have been raised up, and Accidents have happened to them so prosperously, as if there had been a <hi>secret Design</hi> of Heaven by blessing them so <hi>signally,</hi> to encourage others to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their <hi>Measures,</hi> to depend on God, to deliver themselves up to his Care, and to wait till he opens a way for their being Imployed, and settled in such a Portion of his Husbandry, as he shall think fit to assign to them.</p>
               <p>These are Preparations of Mind, with which a <hi>Clerk</hi> is to be formed and sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned: And in order to this, he must read the Scriptures much, he must get a great deal of those Passages in them, that relate to these things, by heart, and repeat them often to himself; in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar many of the most tender and melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Psalms,</hi> and many of the most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive Passages in the Epistles; that
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:42659:108"/>
by the frequent reflecting on these, he may fill his Memory with Noble Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and right Idea's of things: The Book of <hi>Proverbs,</hi> but chiefly <hi>Ecclesiastes,</hi> if he can get to understand it, will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get in him a right view of the World, a just value of Things, and a contempt of many Objects that shine with a false Lustre, but have no true Worth in them. Some of the Books taught at <hi>Schools,</hi> if read afterwards, when one is more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to observe the Sense of them, may be of great use to promote this Temper. <hi>Tully</hi>'s <hi>Offices</hi> will give the Mind a noble sett; all his Philosophical Discourses, but chiefly his <hi>Consolation</hi>; which though some Criticks will not allow to be his, because they fansie the Stile has not all the force and beauty in it that was pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to him, yet is certainly the best Piece of them all; these, I say, give a good <hi>

                     </gap>avour</hi> to those who read them much. The Satyrical Poets, <hi>Horace, Iuvenal</hi> and <hi>Persius</hi> may contribute wonderfully to give a man a Detestation of Vice, and a Contempt of the common Methods of mankind; which they have set out in such true Colours, that they must give a very generous Sense to those who delight in reading them often. <hi>Persius</hi>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:42659:108"/>
his Second <hi>Satyr,</hi> may well pass for one of the best Lectures in Divinity. <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eracles</hi> upon <hi>Pythagoras</hi>'s <hi>Verses, Plutarch</hi>'s Lives; and above all the Books of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenism, <hi>Epictetus</hi> and <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> contain such Instructions, that one cannot read them too often, nor repass them too frequently in his thoughts. But when I speak of reading these Books, I do not mean only to run through them, as one does through a Book of History, or of Notions; they must be read and weighed with great Care, till one is become a <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> of all the Thoughts that are in them: They are to be often turned in ones Mind, till he is thereby wrought up to some Degrees of that Temper, which they propose: And as for Christian Books, in order to the framing of ones Mind aright, I shall only Recommend <hi>The whole Duty of Man, Dr.</hi> Sherlock <hi>of Death and Iudgment,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Scot</hi>'s Books, in particular that great distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that runs through them, of the <hi>means</hi> and of the <hi>ends</hi> of <hi>Religion.</hi> To all which I shall add one small Book more, which is to me ever <hi>new and fresh,</hi> gives always good Thoughts and a Noble Temper, <hi>Thomas a Kempis of the Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Christ.</hi> By the frequent read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:42659:109"/>
of these Books, by the relish that one has in them, by the delight they give, and the Effects they produce, a man will plainly perceive, whether his Soul is made for Divine Matters or not, what suitableness there is between him and them; and whether he is yet touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with such a Sense of Religion, as to be capable of dedicating himself to it.</p>
               <p>I am far from thinking that no man is fit to be a <hi>Priest,</hi> that has not the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per which I have been describing, quite up to that heig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If these things are begun in him, if they are yet but as a Grain of Mustard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seed, yet if there is a Life in them, and a Vital Sense of the Tendencies and Effects they must have; such a Person, so moulded, with those Notions and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, and such only are qualified, so as to be able to say with Truth and Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that they <hi>trust they are inwardly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Holy Ghost to undertake that Office.</hi>

Here is a vast Errour in the first form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our <hi>Clergy,</hi> that a Contempt has been cast on that sort of <hi>Books</hi>; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to rise no higher, than to a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual reading over different <hi>Systems</hi> is but a mean pitch of Learning; and the swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing down whole <hi>Systems</hi> by the Lump, has help'd to possess Peoples Minds too early with Prejudices, and to shut them up in too implicite a following of others. But the throwing off all these <hi>Books,</hi> makes that many who have read a great deal, yet have no intire <hi>Body of Divinity</hi> in their Head; they have no Scheme or Method, and so are Ignorant of some very plain things, which could never have happened to them, if they had carefully read and digested a <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stem</hi> into their Memories. But because this is indeed a very low Form; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to lead a man farther, to have a freer view of Divinity, to examine things
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:42659:111"/>
equally and clearly, and to use his own Reason, by balancing the various Views, that two great Divisions of <hi>Protestants</hi> have, not only in the Points which they controvert, but in a great many others, in which though they agree in the same <hi>Conclusions,</hi> yet they arrive at them by very different <hi>Premises</hi>; I would advise him that studies Divinity, to read two larger Bodies, writ by some Eminent Men of both sides; and because the latest are commonly the best; <hi>Turretin</hi> for the whole <hi>Calvinist Hypothesis,</hi> and <hi>Limburgh</hi> for the <hi>Arminian,</hi> will make a Man ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>Master</hi> of all the Notions of both sides. Or if one would see how far middle ways may be taken; The <hi>Theses</hi> of <hi>Sanmur,</hi> or <hi>le Blanc</hi>'s <hi>Theses,</hi> will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat him in that. These Books well read, digested into Abstracts, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently reviewed or talked over by two <hi>Companions in Study,</hi> will give a Man an entire view of the whole Body of Divinity.</p>
               <p>But by reason of that pest of Atheism, that Spreads so much among us, the Foundations of Religion must be well laid: Bishop <hi>Wilkins</hi> Book of <hi>Natural Religion,</hi> will lead one in the first Steps through the Principles that he has laid together in a plain and natural Method.
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:42659:111"/>
                  <hi>Grotius</hi> his Book of the <hi>truth of the Christian Religion,</hi> with his <hi>Notes</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, ought to be read and almost got by heart. The whole Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie both of <hi>Atheism</hi> and <hi>Deism,</hi> the Arguments both for the <hi>Old and New Testament,</hi> are fully opened, with a great variety both of Learning and Reasoning, in Bishop <hi>Stillingfleet</hi>'s <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines Sacrae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There remains only to direct a Student how to form right Notions of Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Matters; and particularly of Preaching. Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>'s <hi>Practical Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techism,</hi> is a Book of great use; but not to be begun with, as too many do: It does require a good deal of previous Study, before the force of his Reasonings is apprehended; but when one is ready for it, it is a rare Book, and States the Grounds of Morality, and of our Duty, upon true Principles. To form one to understand the right Method of Preaching, the Extent of it, and the proper ways of Application, Bishop <hi>Sanderson,</hi> Mr. <hi>Faringdon,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Barrow,</hi> are the best and the fullest Models. There is a vast variety of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sermons, which may be read with an equal measure of Advantage and
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:42659:112"/>
Pleasure. And if from the time that one resolves to direct his Studies to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Church, he would every Lords day read two Sermons of any good Preacher, and turn them a little over in his Thoughts, this would insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly in two or three years time, carry him very far, and give him a large view of the different ways of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and furnish him with Materials for handling a great many <hi>Texts of Scripture</hi> when he comes to it.</p>
               <p>And thus I have carried my Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent through those Studies, that seem to me so necessary for qualifying him to be an able <hi>Minister of the New Testament,</hi> that I cannot see how any Article of this can be well abated. It may seem strange, that in this whole Direction, I have said nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Study of the <hi>Fathers</hi> or <hi>Church History.</hi> But I said at first, that a great distinction was to be made between what was necessary to prepare a Man to be a <hi>Priest,</hi> and what was necessary to make him a Compleat and Learned <hi>Divine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The knowledge of these things is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to the latter, though they do not seem so necessary for the former:
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:42659:112"/>
There are many things to be left to the Prosecution of a Divine's Study, that therefore are not mentioned here, not with any design to disparage that sort of Learning; for I am now on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon that measure of Knowledge, under which I heartily wish that no Man were put in <hi>Priests Orders</hi>; and therefore I have pass'd over many other things, such as the more accurate Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of the <hi>Controversies</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us and the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> and the unhappy Disputes between us and the <hi>Dissenters</hi> of all sorts; though both the one and the other, have of late been opened with that perspicui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that fulness of Argument, and that clearness as well as softness of <hi>Stile,</hi> that a <hi>Collection</hi> of these may give a Man the fullest Instructions, that is to be found in any Books I know. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and perhaps the far greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, will think that I have clogged this Matter too much. But I desire these may consider how much we do <hi>justly</hi> reckon, that our <hi>Profession</hi> is preferrable either to <hi>Law</hi> or <hi>Medicine.</hi> Now, if this is true, it is not unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable, that since those who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to these, must be at so much
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:42659:113"/>
Pains, before they enter upon a <hi>Practice</hi> which relates only to Men's <hi>Fortunes,</hi> or their <hi>Persons,</hi> we whose Labours relate to their <hi>Souls</hi> and their <hi>eternal State,</hi> should be at least at some considerable Pains, before we enter upon them. Let any <hi>young Divine</hi> go to the Chambers of a <hi>Student</hi> in the <hi>Inns of Court,</hi> and see how many Books he must read, and how great a Volume of a <hi>Common-Place-Book</hi> he must make, he will there see through how hard a Task one must go, in a course of many Years, and how ready he must be in all the Parts of it, before he is called to the <hi>Barr,</hi> or can manage <hi>Business.</hi> How exact must a <hi>Physician</hi> be in Anatomy, in Simples, in Pharmacy, in the Theory of Diseases, and in the Observations and Counsels of Doctors, before he can ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with <hi>Honour,</hi> or a <hi>safe Conscience,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake <hi>Practice</hi>? He must be ready with all this, and in that infinite number of <hi>hard Words,</hi> that belong to every part of it, to give his Directions and write his <hi>Bills</hi> by the Patient's Bed-side; who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not stay 'till he goes to his <hi>Study</hi> and turns over his Books. If then so long a course of Study, and so much exactness and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness in it, is necessary to these Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; nay, if every mechanical Art, even
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:42659:113"/>
the meanest, requires a course of many Years, before one can be a Master in it, shall the noblest and the most important of all others, that which comes from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and leads thither again; shall that which God has honoured so highly, and to which Laws and Governments have added such Privileges and Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements, that is employ'd in the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limest Exercises, which require a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned worth in those who handle them, to maintain their Value and Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the Esteem of the World; shall all this, I say, be esteemed so low a thing in our Eyes, that a much less degree of Time and Study, is necessary to arrive at it, than at the most sordid of all Trades whatsoever? And yet after all, a Man of a tolerable Capacity, with a good degree of Application, may go through all this well, and exactly, in two Years time. I am very sure, by many an Experiment I have made, that this may be done in a much less compass: But because all Men do not go alike quick, have not the same force, nor the same application, therefore I reckon two Years for it; which I do thus divide: One Year before <hi>Deacons Orders,</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther between them and <hi>Priests Orders.</hi>
                  <pb n="174" facs="tcp:42659:114"/>
And can this be thought a hard Imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Or do not those, who think thus, give great occasion to the <hi>Contempt of the Clergy,</hi> if they give the World cause to observe, that how much soever we may magnifie our Profession, yet by our pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, we shew that we do judge it the meanest of all others, which is to be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at upon less previous study and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration to it, than any other whatsoever? Since I have been hitherto so minute, I will yet divide this matter a little lower into those parts of it, without which, <hi>Deacons</hi> Orders ought not to be given, and those to be reserved to the second Year of study. To have read the <hi>New Testament</hi> well, so as to carry a great deal of it in one's Memory, to have a clear notion of the several Books of it, to understand well the Nature and the Conditions of the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> and to have read one <hi>System</hi> well, so as to be <hi>Master</hi> of it, to understand the whole <hi>Catechetical</hi> matter, to have read <hi>Wilkins</hi> and <hi>Grotius</hi>; this, I say, is that part of this Task, which I propose before one is made <hi>Deacon.</hi> The rest, though much the larger, will go the easier, if those Foundations are once well laid in them. And upon the Article
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:42659:114"/>
of Studying the Scriptures, I will add one Advice more.</p>
               <p>There are two Methods in reading them, the one ought to be merely <hi>Critical,</hi> to find out the meaning and coherence of the several Parts of them, in which one runs easily through the greater Part, and is only obliged to stop at some harder Passages, which may be marked down and learned Men are to be consulted upon them: Those that are really hard to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, are both few, and they relate to Matters that are not so essential to Christianity; and therefore after one has in general seen what is said upon these, he may put off the fuller Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of that to more leisure, and better opportunities. But the other way of reading the Scriptures, is to be done merely with a view to Practice, to raise Devotion, to encrease Piety, and to give good Thoughts and severe Rules. In this a Man is to imploy him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self much. This is a Book always at hand, and the getting a great deal of it by <hi>heart,</hi> is the best part of a Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's Study; it is the Foundation, and lays in the Materials for all the rest. This alone may furnish a Man with a
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:42659:115"/>
noble Stock of lively Thoughts, and sublime Expressions; and therefore it must be always reckoned as that, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which all other things amount to nothing; and the chief and main Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the Study, the Meditation and the Discourses of a Clergy-man.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="8" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. VIII. Of the Functions and Labours of Clergy-men.</head>
               <p>I Have in the former Chapter laid down the Model and Method, by which a Clerk is to be formed and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared; I come now to consider his Course of <hi>Life,</hi> his Publick <hi>Functions,</hi> and his Secret <hi>Labours.</hi> In this as well as in the former, I will study to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what Mankind can <hi>bear,</hi> rather than what may be offered in a fair Idea, that is far above what we can hope ever to bring the World to. As for a Priests <hi>Life</hi> and Conversation, so much was said in the former Chapter; in which as a preparation to Orders, it was proposed what he ought to be,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:42659:115"/>
that I may now be the shorter on this Article.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Clergy</hi> have one great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, beyond all the rest of the World, in this respect, besides all others, that whereas the particular Callings of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Men, prove to them great Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractions, and lay many Temptations in their way, to divert them from minding their <hi>high and holy Calling</hi> of being <hi>Christians,</hi> it is quite otherwise with the <hi>Clergy,</hi> the more they follow their private <hi>Callings,</hi> they do the more certainly advance their general one: The better <hi>Priests</hi> they are, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come also the better <hi>Christians</hi>: every part of their <hi>Calling,</hi> when well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, raises good Thoughts, brings good Idea's into their Mind, and tends both to encrease their Knowledge, and quicken their Sense of Divine Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. A Priest therefore is more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable to God, and the World for his Deportment, and will be more severely accounted with than any other Person whatsoever. He is more watched over and observed than all others: <hi>Very good men</hi> will be, even to a Censure, jealous of him; <hi>very bad men</hi> will wait for his halting, and Insult upon it;
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:42659:116"/>
and all sorts of Persons, will be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to defend themselves against the Authority of his Doctrine and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions; by this <hi>he says but does not</hi>; and though our Saviour charged his Disciples and Followers,<note place="margin">Math. 23.2, 3.</note> 
                  <hi>to hear those who sat in Moses his Chair, and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve and do whatsoever they bid them observe, but not to do after their works, for they said and did not</hi>; the World will reverse this quite, and consider rather how a Clerk <hi>Lives,</hi> than what he <hi>Says.</hi> They see the one, and from it conclude what he himself thinks of the other; and so will believe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves not a little justified, if they can say that they did no worse, than as they saw their Minister do before them.</p>
               <p>Therefore a Priest must not only ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain from gross Scandals, but keep at the furthest distance from them: He must not only not be drunk, but he must not sit a Tipling; nor go to Taverns or Ale-houses, except some urgent occasion requires it, and stay no longer in them, than as that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion demands it. He must not only abstain from Acts of Lewdness, but from all indecent Behaviour, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:42659:116"/>
Raillery. <hi>Gaming</hi> and <hi>Plays,</hi> and every thing of that sort, which is an approach to the Vanities and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders of the World, must be avoided by him. And unless the straitness of his Condition, or his Necessities force it, he ought to shun all other Cares, such as, not only the farming of Grounds, but even the teaching of Schools, since these must of necessity take him off both from his Labour and Study. Such Diversions as his Health, or the Temper of his Mind, may render proper for him, ought to be Manly, Decent and Grave; and such as may neither possess his Mind or Time too much, nor give a bad Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of him to his People: He must also avoid too much Familiarity with bad People; and the squandring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his time in too much vain and idle Discourse. His chearfulness ought to be frank, but neither excessive nor licentious: His <hi>Friends</hi> and his <hi>Garden</hi> ought to be his chief Diversions, as his <hi>Study</hi> and his <hi>Parish,</hi> ought to be his chief Imployments. He must still carry on his Study, making himself an absolute Master of the few Books he has, till his Circumstances grow
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:42659:117"/>
larger, that he can purchase more. He can have no pretence, if he were ever so narrow in the World, to say, that he cannot get, not only the <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects,</hi> but the <hi>Psalms,</hi> and the <hi>New Testament</hi> by heart, or at least a great part of them. If there are any Books belonging to his Church, such as <hi>Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els</hi> Works, and the <hi>Book of Martyrs,</hi> which lie tearing in many Places, these he may read over and over again, till he is able to furnish himself better, I mean with a greater variety; but let him furnish himself ever so well, the reading and understanding the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> chiefly the <hi>Psalms and the New Testament,</hi> ought to be still his chief Study, till he becomes so conversant in them, that he can both say many Parts of them, and explain them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Book.</p>
               <p>It is the only visible Reason of the <hi>Iews</hi> adhering so firmly to their Religion, that during the Ten or Twelve years of their Education, their Youth are so much practised to the Scriptures, to weigh every word in them, and get them all by heart, that it is an Admiration, to see how ready both Men and Women among
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:42659:117"/>
them are at it; their <hi>Rabbi's</hi> have it to that Perfection, that they have the Concordance of their whole Bible in their Memories, which give them vast Advantages, when they are to argue with any that are not so ready as they are in the Scriptures: Our Task is much shorter and easier, and it is a <hi>Reproach,</hi> especially to us Protestants, who found our Religion merely on the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that we know the <hi>New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> so little, which cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused.</p>
               <p>With the Study of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> or rather as a part of it comes in the Study of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> as far as one can go; in these their <hi>Apologies,</hi> and <hi>Epistles,</hi> are chiefly to be read; for these give us the best view of those Times: <hi>Basil</hi>'s and <hi>Chrysostom</hi>'s Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, are by much the best. To these Studies, <hi>History</hi> comes in as a noble and pleasant Addition; that gives a Man great views of the Providence of God, of the Nature of Man, and of the Conduct of the World. This is above no Man's Capacity; and though some Histories are better than others; yet any Histories, such as one can get, are to be read, rather than none
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:42659:118"/>
at all. If one can compass it, he ought to begin with the History of the Church, and there at the Head <hi>Iosephus,</hi> and go on with <hi>Eusebius, Socrates,</hi> and the other Historians, that are commonly bound together; and then go to other later Collectors of Ancient History; the History of our own Church and Country is to come next; then the Ancient <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> History, and after that, as much History, Geography, and Books of Travels as can be had, will give an easie and a useful Entertainment, and will furnish one with great variety of good Thoughts, and of pleasant, as well as edifying Discourse. As for all other Studies, every one must fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his Inclinations, his Capacities, and that which he can procure to himself. The Books that we learn at Schools are generally laid aside, with this Prejudice, that they were the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours</hi> as well as the <hi>Sorrows</hi> of our <hi>Childhood</hi> and <hi>Education</hi>; but they are among the best of Books. The <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Authors have a Spirit in them, a force both of Thought and Expression, that l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ter Ages have not been able to imitate: <hi>Buchanan</hi> only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:42659:118"/>
in whom, more particularly in his <hi>Psalms,</hi> there is a Beauty and Life, an Exactness as well as a Liberty, that cannot be imitated, and scarce enough commended. The Study and Practice of <hi>Physick,</hi> especially that which is safe and simple, puts the Clergy in a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of doing great Acts of Charity, and of rendring both their Persons and Labours very acceptable to their People; it will procure their being soon sent for by them in Sickness, and it will give them great advantages in speaking to them, of their Spiritual Concerns, when they are so careful of their Persons, but in this nothing that is <hi>sordid</hi> must mix.</p>
               <p>These ought to be the chief Studies of the Clergy. But to give all these their full effect, a Priest that is much in his Study, ought to Imploy a great part of his Time in secret and fervent <hi>Prayer,</hi> for the Direction and Blessing of God in his Labours, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant assistance of his Holy Spirit, and for a lively Sense of Divine Matters, that so he may feel the Impressions of them grow deep and strong upon his Thoughts. This, and this only, will make him go on with his <hi>work,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:42659:119"/>
wearying, and be always rejoycing in it: This will make his Expressions of these things to be Happy and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, when he can bring them out of the <hi>good Treasure of his Heart</hi>; that is, ever full, and always warm with them.</p>
               <p>From his Study, I go next to his Publick Functions: He must bring his Mind to an inward and feeling Sense of those things that are <hi>prayed</hi> for in our <hi>Offices</hi>: That will make him pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce them with an equal measure of Gravity and Affection, and with a due Slowness and Emphasis. I do not love the Theatrical way of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in which it is a great Study, and a long Practice, to learn in every one of their <hi>Offices,</hi> how they ought to Compose their Looks, Gesture and Voice; yet a light wandring of the Eyes, and a hasty running through the <hi>Prayers,</hi> are things highly unbecoming; they do very much lessen the Majesty of our <hi>Worship,</hi> and give our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies advantage to call it <hi>dead and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal,</hi> when they see plainly, that he who officiates <hi>is dead and formal</hi> in it. A deep Sense of the things prayed for, a true Recollection and Attention of
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:42659:119"/>
Spirit, and a holy Earnestness of Soul, will give a Composure to the Looks, and a weight to the Pronunciation, that will be tempered between affectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on the one hand, and Levity on the other. As for <hi>Preaching,</hi> I referr that to a Chapter apart.</p>
               <p>A Minister ought to Instruct his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple frequently, of the nature of <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,</hi> that they may not go about it merely as a Ceremony, as it is too visible the greater part do; but that they may consider it as the Dedicating their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to God, the Offering them to Christ, and the holding them thereafter as his, directing their chief care about them, to the breeding them up in the <hi>nurture and admonition of the Lord.</hi> There must be Care taken to give them all a right Notion of the use of <hi>God-fathers</hi> and <hi>God-mothers,</hi> which is a good Institution, to procure a <hi>double</hi> Security for the Education of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; it being to be supposed, that the common Ties of Nature and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, bind the <hi>Parents</hi> so strongly, that if they are not mindful of these, a Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Vow would not put a new force in them, and therefore a <hi>Collateral Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity</hi> is also demanded, both to supply
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:42659:120"/>
their Defects, if they are faulty, and to take care of the Religious Education of the Infant, in case the Parents should happen to die before that is done; and therefore no <hi>God-father</hi> or <hi>God-mother</hi> are to be invited to that Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, but such with whom one would trust the care of the Education of his Child, nor ought any to do this Office for another, but he that is willing to charge himself, with the <hi>Education of the Child</hi> for whom he answers. But when Ambition or Vanity, Favour or Presents, are the Considerations upon which those <hi>Sureties</hi> in Baptism are cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen; great advantage is hereby given to those who reject <hi>Infant Baptism,</hi> and the Ends of the Church in this Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution are quite defeated; which are both the making the Security that is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for the Children so much the stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and the establishing an Endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and a Tenderness between Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies; this being, in its own Nature, no small Tye, how little soever it may be apprehended or understood.</p>
               <p>Great care must be taken in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of the Youth: The bare saying the <hi>Catechism</hi> by Rote is a small Matter; it is necessary to make them understand

the weight of every Word in it: And for this end, every <hi>Priest,</hi> that minds his Duty, will find that no Part of it is so useful to his People, as <hi>once</hi> every <hi>year</hi> to go through the whole <hi>Church Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chism,</hi> Word by Word, and make his People understand the Importance of every Tittle in it. This will be no hard labour to himself; for after he has once gathered together the Places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that relate to every Article, and formed some clear Illustrations, and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie Similies to make it understood; his <hi>Catechetical Discourses,</hi> during all the rest of his Life, will be only the going over that same Matter again and again; by this means his People will come to have all this by heart; they will know what to say upon it at home to their Children; and they will understand all his Sermons the better, when they have once had a clear Notion of all those Terms that must run through them; for those not being understood, renders them all unintelligible.

<pb n="188" facs="tcp:42659:121"/>
Quarter of an Hour is time sufficient; for it will grow tedious and be too little remembred, if it is half an hour long. This would draw an Assembly to Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Prayers, which we see are but too much neglected, when there is no sort of Discourse or Sermon accompanying them. And the practising this, during the Six Months of the year, in which the days are long, would be a very effectual means, both to Instruct the People, and to bring them to a more Religious Observation of the Lord's Day; which is one of the powerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest Instruments for the carrying on, and advancing of Religion in the World.</p>
               <p>With <hi>Catechising,</hi> a Minister is to joyn the preparing those whom he In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structs to be <hi>Confirmed</hi>; which is not to be done merely upon their being able to say over so many words by <hi>Rote.</hi> It is their renewing their Baptismal Vow in their own Persons, which the Church designs by that <hi>Office,</hi> and the bearing in their own Minds, a Sense of their being bound immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by that, which their Sureties then undertook for them: Now to do this in such a manner, as that it may make
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:42659:121"/>
Impression, and have a due effect upon them, they must stay, till they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves understand what they do, and till they have some Sense and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to it; and therefore till one is of an Age and Disposition fit to receive the Holy Sacrament of the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> and desires to be Confirmed, as a solemn Preparation and Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to it; he is not yet ready for it; for in the common Management of that <hi>Holy Rite,</hi> it is but too visible, that of those Multitudes that crowd to it, the far greater Part, come merely as if they were to receive the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop's Blessing, without any Sense of the <hi>Vow</hi> made by them, and of their renewing their Baptismal Engagements in it.</p>
               <p>As for the greatest and solemnest of all the Institutions of Christ, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorating his Death, and the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of it in the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Supper</hi>; this must be well explained to the People, to preserve them from the extreams of Superstition and Irreverence; to raise in them a great Sense of the Goodness of God, that appeared in the Death of Christ; of his Love to us, of the Sacrifice he once offered,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:42659:122"/>
and of the Intercession which he still continues to make for us: A share in all which is there <hi>Federally</hi> offered to us, upon our coming under Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to answer our Part of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> and to live according to the Rules it sets us: On these things he ought to enlarge himself, not only in his Sermons, but in his <hi>Catechetical Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises,</hi> and in private Discourses; that so he may give his People right Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of that Solemn Part of Worship, that he may bring them to delight in it; and may neither fright them from it, by raising their Apprehensions of it to a strictness that may terrifie too much, nor encourage them in the too common Practice of the dead and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal <hi>receiving,</hi> at the great Festivals, as a piece of Decency recommended by Custom.</p>
               <p>About the time of the Sacrament, every Minister that knows any one of his Parish guilty of eminent Sins, ought to go and Admonish him to change his Course of Life, or not to profane the <hi>Table of the Lord</hi>; and if private Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions have no Effect; then if his Sins are Publick and Scandalous, he ought to deny him the Sacrament;
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:42659:122"/>
and upon that he ought to take the Method which is still left in the Church, to make Sinners <hi>ashamed,</hi> to <hi>separate</hi> them from <hi>Holy things,</hi> till they have edified the <hi>Church</hi> as much by their <hi>Repentance,</hi> and the outward Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of it, as they had formerly scandalized it by their <hi>Disorders.</hi> This we must confess, that though we have great Reason, to lament our want of the <hi>Godly Discipline that was in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church,</hi> yet we have still Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for a great deal <hi>more</hi> than we put in <hi>Practice.</hi> Scandalous Persons ought, and might be more frequently present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than they are, and both Private and Publick Admonitions might be more used than they are. There is a flatness in all these things among us. Some are willing to do nothing, because they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do all that they ought to do; whereas the right way for procuring an enlargement of our <hi>Authority,</hi> is to use that we have <hi>well</hi>; not as an Engine to gratifie our own or other Peoples Passions, not to vex People, nor to look after Fees, more than the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Manners, or the Edification of the People. If we began much with private Applications, and brought
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:42659:123"/>
none into our Courts, till it was visible that all other ways had been unsuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessful, and that no regard was had ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Persons or Parties, to Men's Opinions or Interests, we might again bring our Courts into the esteem which they ought to have, but which they have almost entirely lost: We can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hope to bring the World to bear the <hi>Yoke of Christ,</hi> and the Order that he has appointed to be kept up in his Church, <hi>of noting those that walk disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, of separating our selves from them, of having no fellowship, no, not so much as to eat with them,</hi> as long as we give them cause to apprehend, that we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend by this to bring them under our <hi>Yoke,</hi> to subdue them to us, and <hi>to rule them with a Rod of Iron</hi>: For the truth is, Mankind is so strongly compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that it is very hard to restrain <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Tyranny</hi> on the one hand, without running to a <hi>Lawless Licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness</hi> on the other; so strongly does the World love Extreams, and avoid a Temper.</p>
               <p>Now I have gone through the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Functions o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> a Priest, and in speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the last of these, I have broke in upon the Third Head of his Duty,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:42659:123"/>
his <hi>private Labours</hi> in his Parish. He understands little the Nature and the Obligations of the <hi>Priestly Office,</hi> who thinks he has discharged it, by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the Publick Appointments, in which if he is defective, the Laws of the Church, how feeble soever they may be as to other things, will have their Course; but as the private Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the <hi>Pastoral Care,</hi> are things upon which the Cognisance of the Law cannot fall, so they are the most impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant and necessary of all others; and the more Praise Worthy, the freer they are, and the less forc'd by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion of Law. As to the Publick Functions, every Man has his Rule; and in these all are almost alike; every Man, especially if his Lungs are good, can read Prayers, even in the largest Congregation; and if he has a right Taste, and can but choose good Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, out of the many that are in Print, he may likewise serve them well that way too. But the difference between one Man and another, shews it self more sensibly in his <hi>private Labours,</hi> in his prudent Deportment, in his modest and discreet Way of procuring Respect to himself, in his Treating his <hi>Parish,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:42659:124"/>
in reconciling such Differences as may happen to be among them, or in Admonishing Men of Rank, who set an ill Example to others, which ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to be done in that way, which will probably have the best effect upon them; therefore it must be done secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and with Expressions of Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Respect for their Persons; fit times are to be chosen for this; it may be often the best way to do it by a Letter: For there may be ways fallen upon, of reproving the worst Men, in so soft a manner, that if they are not reclaimed, yet they shall not be irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or made worse by it, which is but too often the Effect of an indiscreet Reproof. By this a Minister <hi>may</hi> save the Sinners Soul; he is at least <hi>sure</hi> to save his own, by having discharged his Duty towards his People.</p>
               <p>One of the chief Parts of the <hi>Pastoral Care,</hi> is the <hi>visiting the sick</hi>; not to be done barely when one is sent for: He is to go as soon as he hears that any of his Flock are ill; He is not to satisfie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with going over the <hi>Office,</hi> or gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them the <hi>Sacrament</hi> when desired: He ought to inform himself of their Course of Life, and of the Temper of
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:42659:124"/>
their Mind, that so he may apply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to them accordingly. If they are insensible, he ought to awaken them with the Terrours of God; the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and the Wrath to come. He must endeavour to make them sensible of their Sins; particularly of that which runs through most Men's Lives, their forgetting and neglecting God and his Service, and their setting their Hearts so inordinately upon the World: He must set them on to examine their deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and make them seriously to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, that they can expect no Mercy from God, unless they restore whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they may have got unjustly from any other, by any manner of way, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven though their Title were confirmed by Law: He is to lay any other Sins to their charge, that he has reason to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect them guilty of; and must press them to all such Acts of Repentance as they are then capable of. If they have been Men of a bad Course of Life, he must give them no encouragement to hope much from this <hi>Death-bed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi>; yet he is to set them to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore the <hi>Mercies of God in Christ Iesus,</hi> and to do all they can to obtain his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. But unless the Sickness has been
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:42659:125"/>
of a long continuance, and that the Person's Repentance, his Patience, his Piety has been very extraordinary, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Course of it, he must be sure to give him no positive ground of <hi>Hope</hi>; but leave him to the <hi>Mercies of God.</hi> For there cannot be any greater Treachery to Souls, that is more fatal and more pernicious, than the giving quick and easie hopes, upon so short, so forced, and so imperfect a Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. It not only makes those Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons perish securely themselves, but it leads all about them to destruction; when they see one, of whose <hi>bad Life</hi> and <hi>late Repentance</hi> they have been the Witnesses, put so soon in hopes, nay by some unfaithful Guides, made <hi>sure</hi> of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; this must make them go on very secure in their Sins; when they see how small a measure of <hi>Repentance</hi> sets all right at last: All the Order and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice of a Nation, would be presently dissolved, should the howlings of <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals,</hi> and their Promises of Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, work on <hi>Iuries, Iudges,</hi> or <hi>Princes</hi>: So the hopes that are given to <hi>Death-bed Penitents,</hi> must be a most effectual means to root out the Sense of Religion of the Minds of all that see it;
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:42659:125"/>
and therefore though no dying Man is to be driven to <hi>Despair,</hi> and left to die obstinate in his Sins; yet if we love the Souls of our People, if we set a due value on the Blood of Christ, and if we are touched with any Sense of the Honour or Interests of Religion, we must not say any thing that may encourage others, who are but too apt of themselves to put all off to the last Hour. We can give them no hopes from the Nature of the <hi>Gospel Covenant</hi>; yet after all, the best thing a dying Man can do, is to <hi>Repent</hi>; if he recovers, that may be the Seed and Beginning of a new Life and a new Nature in him: Nor do we know the Measure of the <hi>Riches of God's Grace and Mercy</hi>; how far he may think fit to exert it beyond the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Promises of the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> at least to the lessening of such a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons Misery in another State. We are sure he is not within the <hi>New Covenant</hi>; and since he has not <hi>repented,</hi> according to the <hi>Tenor</hi> of it, we dare not, unless we betray our Commission, give any hopes beyond it. But one of the chief Cares of a Minister about the Sick, ought to be to exact of them Solemn Vows and Promises, of a Renovation of Life,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:42659:126"/>
in case God shall raise them up again; and these ought to be demanded, not only in general Words, but if they have been guilty of any scandalous Disorders, or any other ill Practices, there ought to be special Promises made with Relation to those. And upon the Recovery of such Persons, their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters ought to put them in mind of their Engagements, and use all the due free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Admonitions and Reproof, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their breaking loose from them. In such a Case they ought to leave a terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble denunciation of the Judgments of God upon them, and so at least they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit themselves.</p>
               <p>There is another sort of <hi>sick Persons,</hi> who abound more in <hi>Towns</hi> than in the Country; those are the troubled in Mind; of these there are two sorts, some have committed enormous Sins, which kindle a Storm in their Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and that ought to be cherished, till they have compleated a Repentance proportioned to the Nature and Degree of their Sin. If <hi>Wrong</hi> has been done to another, <hi>Reparation</hi> and <hi>Restitution</hi> must be made to the utmost of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty's Power. If <hi>Blood</hi> has been shed, a long course of Fasting and Prayer; a
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:42659:126"/>
total abstinence from <hi>Wine</hi>; if <hi>Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> gave the rise to it, a making up the loss to the Family, on which it has fallen, must be enjoyned. But alas, the greater part of those that think they are troubled in Mind, are Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly hypochondriacal People, who, what through some false Opinions in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, what through a foulness of Blood, occasioned by their unactive Course of Life, in which their Minds work too much, because their Bodies are too little imployed, fall under dark and cloudy Apprehensions; of which they can give no clear nor good Account. This, in the greatest Part, is to be removed by strong and <hi>Chalybeate</hi> Medicines; yet such Persons are to be much pitied, and a little humoured in their Distemper. They must be diverted from thinking too much, being too much alone, or dwelling too long on Thoughts that are too hard for them to Master.</p>
               <p>The Opinion that has had the chief Influence in raising these Distempers, has been that of <hi>Praying by the Spirit</hi>; when a flame of Thought, a melting in the Brain, and the abounding in tender expressions, have been thought the Effects of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> moving all those Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:42659:127"/>
of a warm Temper. Now in all People, especially in Persons of a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy Disposition, that are much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, there will be a great diversity, with relation to this at different times: Sometimes these Heats will rise and flow copiously, and at other times there will be a damp upon the Brain, and a dead dryness in the Spirits. This to men that are prepossessed with the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, now set forth, will appear as if God did sometimes <hi>shine out,</hi> and at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times <hi>hide his face</hi>; and since this last will be the most frequent in men of that Temper; as they will be apt to be lifted up, when they think they have a <hi>fulness of the Spirit</hi> in them, so they will be as much cast down when that is withdrawn; they will conclude from it, that <hi>God is angry with them,</hi> and so reckon that they must be in a very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Condition: Upon this, a vast variety of troublesom Scruples will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise, out of every thing that they either do or have done. If then a Minister has occasion to treat any in this Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he must make them apprehend that the heat or coldness of their Brain, is the effect of <hi>Temper</hi>; and flows from the different State of the <hi>Animal Spirits,</hi>
                  <pb n="201" facs="tcp:42659:127"/>
which have their Diseases, their hot and their cold Fits, as well as the Blood has; and therefore no measure can be taken from these, either to Judge for or against themselves. They are to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what are their Principles and Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, and what's the settled Course of their Life; upon these they are to form sure Judgments, and not upon any thing that is so fluctuating and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constant as Fits or Humours.</p>
               <p>Another part of a Priest's Duty is, with relation to them <hi>that are without,</hi> I mean, that are not of our Body, which are of the side of the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> or among the <hi>Dissenters.</hi> Other Churches and Bodies are noted for their Zeal, in making <hi>Proselytes,</hi> for their restless En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, as well as their unlawful Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods in it, they reckoning, perhaps, that all will be sanctified by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing their Party, which is the true name of <hi>making Converts,</hi> except they become at the same time <hi>Good Men,</hi> as well as Votaries to a Side or Cause. We are certainly very remiss in this, of both hands, little pains is taken to gain either upon <hi>Papist</hi> or <hi>Nonconformist</hi>; the Law has been so much trusted to; that that method only was thought sure; it
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:42659:128"/>
was much valued, and others at the same time as much neglected; and whereas at first, without force or violence, in Fourty years time, <hi>Popery</hi> from being the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Religion, was reduced to a <hi>hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> we have now in above twice that number of years, made very little Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress. The favour shew'd them from our Court, made us seem, as it were, unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to disturb them in their Religion; so that we grow at last to be kind to them, to look on them as harmless and inoffensive Neighbours, and even to che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish and comfort them; we were very near the being convinc'd of our mistake, by a terrible and dear bought <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi> Now they are again under Hatches; certainly it becomes us, both in Charity to them, and in regard to our own Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to study to gain them by the force of Reason and Persuasion; by shewing all kindness to them, and thereby disposing them to hearken to the Reasons that we may lay before them. We ought not to give over this as desperate upon a few unsuccessful Attempts, but must follow them in the <hi>meekness of Christ,</hi> that so we may at last prove happy Instruments, in delivering them from the Blindness and Captivity they are kept under, and the
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:42659:128"/>
Idolatry and Superstition they live in: We ought to visit them often in a Spirit of Love and Charity, and to offer them Conferences; and upon such Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, we have reason to expect a Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, at least this, of having done our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and so delivering our own Souls.</p>
               <p>Nor are we to think, that the <hi>Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> under which the Law has settled the <hi>Dissenters,</hi> does either absolve them from the Obligations that they lay under be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, by the Laws of God and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, to maintain the <hi>Vnity of the Church,</hi> and not to rent it by unjust or causeless Schisms, or us from using our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to bring them to it, by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of Perswasion and Kindness: Nay, perhaps, their being now in Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that they can no more be <hi>forced</hi> in these things, may put some of them in a greater towardness to hear Reason; a Free Nation naturally hating Constraint: And certainly the less we seem to grudge or envy them their <hi>Liberty,</hi> we will be thereby the nearer gaining on the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerouser and better Part of them, and the rest would soon lose Heart, and look out of Countenance; if these should hearken to us. It was the Opinion ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:42659:129"/>
had of their <hi>strictness,</hi> and of the <hi>looseness</hi> that was amongst us, that gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them their Credit, and made such numbers fall off from us. They have in a great measure lost the <hi>Good Character</hi> that once they had; if to that we should likewise lose our <hi>bad one</hi>; if we were stricter in our Lives, more serious and constant in our Labours; and studied more effectually to Reform those of our Communion, than to rail at theirs; If we took occasion to let them see that we love them, that we wish them no harm, but good, then we might hope, by the Blessing of God, to lay the Obligations to Love and Peace, to Unity and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord before them, with such Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, that some of them might open their Eyes, and see at last upon how flight Grounds, they have now so long kept up such a Wrangling, and made such a Rent in the Church, that both the <hi>Power of Religion</hi> in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and the strength of the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Religion,</hi> have suffered extreamly by them.</p>
               <p>Thus far I have carried a <hi>Clerk</hi> through his Parish, and all the several Branches of his Duty to his People.
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:42659:129"/>
But that all this may be well gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and indeed as the Foundation upon which all the other Parts of the Pastoral Care may be well managed, he ought frequently to visit his whole Parish <hi>from House to House</hi>; that so he may know them, and be known of them. This I know will seem a vast Labour, especially in <hi>Towns,</hi> where Parishes are large; but that is no excuse for those in the Country, where they are generally small; and if they are larger, the going this Round will be the longer a doing; yet an hour a day, Twice or Thrice a Week, is no hard Duty; and this in the Compass of a Year will go a great way, even in a large <hi>Parish.</hi> In these Visits, much Time is not to be spent; a short Word for stirring them up to mind their Souls, to make Conscience of their Ways, and to pray earnestly to God, may begin it, and almost end it. After one has asked in what Union and Peace the Neighbourhood lives, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired into their Necessities, if they seem very Poor, that so those to whom that Care belongs, may be put
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:42659:130"/>
in mind to see how they may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved. In this course of visiting, a Minister will soon find out, if there are any truly <hi>Good Persons</hi> in his <hi>Parish,</hi> after whom he must look with a more particular regard. Since these are the <hi>Excellent ones, in whom all his delight ought to be.</hi> For let their Rank be ever so mean, if they are sincerely Religious, and not Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical Pretenders to it, who are vainly puffed up with some Degrees of Knowledge, and other outward Appearances, he ought to consider them as the most valuable in the sight of God; and indeed, as the chief Part of his Care; for <hi>a living Dog is better than a dead Lion.</hi> I know this way of Parochial Visitation, is so worn out, that, perhaps, neither Priest nor People, will be very desirous to see it taken up. It will put the one to Labour and Trouble, and bring the other under a closer Inspection, which bad Men will no ways desire, nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps endure. But if this were put on the <hi>Clergy</hi> by their <hi>Bishops,</hi> and if they explained in a Sermon before they began it, the Reasons and Ends of doing it;
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:42659:130"/>
that would remove the Prejudices which might arise against it. I confess this is an encrease of Labour, but that will seem no hard matter to such as have a right Sense of their <hi>Ordination-Vows,</hi> of the value of <hi>Souls,</hi> and of the Dignity of their <hi>Function.</hi> If Men had the <hi>Spirit of their Calling</hi> in them, and a due measure of Flame and Heat in carrying it on; <hi>Labour</hi> in it would be rather a Pleasure than a Trouble. In all other Professions, those who follow them, labour in them all the Year long, and are hard at their Business every Day of the Week. All Men that are well suted in a Profession, that is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their Genius and Inclination, are really the easier and the better pleased, the more they are employed in it.

<pb n="208" facs="tcp:42659:131"/>
setting about their Business to purpose; this would, by the Blessing of God, be a most effectual Means, of stopping the Progress of <hi>Atheism,</hi> and of the <hi>Contempt</hi> that the Clergy lies under; it would go a great way towards the healing our Schism, and would be the chief step that could possibly be made, towards the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing to us such Laws as are yet want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the compleating our Reformation, and the mending the Condition of so many of our poor Brethren, who are languishing in Want, and under great Straits.</p>
               <p>There remains only somewhat to be added concerning the Behaviour of the <hi>Clergie</hi> towards one another. Those of a higher Form in Learning, Dignity and Wealth, ought not to despise poor <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cars</hi> and <hi>Curates</hi>; but on the contrary, the poorer they are, they ought to pity and encourage them the more, since they are all of the same <hi>Order,</hi> only the one are more happily placed than the others: They ought therefore to cherish those that are in worse Circumstances, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them to come often to them; they ought to lend them Books, and to give them other Assistances in order to
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:42659:131"/>
their progress in Learning, 'Tis a bad thing to see a <hi>Bishop</hi> behave himself super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliously towards any of his <hi>Clergy,</hi> but it is intolerable in those of the <hi>same Degree.</hi> The Clergy ought to contrive Ways to meet often together, to enter into a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly Correspondence, and into the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns one of another, both in order to their progress in Knowledg, and for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting together in all their Affairs. This would be a means to cement them into one Body: hereby they might understand what were amiss in the Conduct of any in their Division, and try to correct it either by private Advices and Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, or by laying it before the <hi>Bishop,</hi> by whose private <hi>Labours,</hi> if his <hi>Clergy</hi> would be assisting to him, and give him free and full Informations of things, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Disorders might be cured, without rising to a publick Scandal, or forcing him to extream Censures. It is a false Pity in any of the Clergy, who see their Brethren running into ill Courses, to look on and say nothing: it is a Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty to the Church, and may prove a Cruelty to the Person of whom they are so unseasonably tender: for things may be more easily corrected at first, before they have grown to be publick, or are
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:42659:132"/>
hardned by Habit and Custom. Upon all these Accounts it is of great advantage, and may be Matter of great Edification to the <hi>Clergie,</hi> to enter into a strict U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion together, to meet often, and to be helpful to one another: but if this should be made practicable, they must be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly strict in those <hi>Meetings,</hi> to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve so exact a <hi>Sobriety,</hi> that there might be no Colour given to censure them, as if these were <hi>merry Meetings,</hi> in which they allowed themselves great Liberties: it were good, if they could be brought to meet to <hi>fast and pray</hi>; but if that is a strain too high for the present Age, at least they must keep so far within bounds, that there may be no room for Calumny. For a Disorder upon any such Occasion, would give a Wound of an extraordinary Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to the Reputation of the whole <hi>Clergy,</hi> when every one would bear a Share of the Blame, which perhaps be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed but to a few. Four or five such Meetings in a Summer, would neither be a great Charge, nor give much Trouble: but the Advantages that might arise out of them, would be very sensible.</p>
               <p>I have but one other Advice to add, but it is of a thing of great consequence, though generally managed in so loose
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:42659:132"/>
and so indifferent a Manner, that I have some reason in Charity to believe, that the <hi>Clergy</hi> make very little Reflection on what they do in it: And that is, in the Testimonials that they sign in <hi>favour</hi> of those that come to be <hi>Ordained.</hi> Many have confessed to my self, that they had signed these upon general Reports, and Importunity; tho the Testimonial bears personal Knowledg. These are instead of the <hi>Suffrages</hi> of the Clergy, which in the Primitive Church were given before any were <hi>Ordained.</hi> A Bishop must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon them; for he has no other way to be certainly informed: and therefore as it is a Lie, pass'd with the Solemnity of <hi>Hand</hi> and <hi>Seal,</hi> to affirm any thing that is beyond one's own Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, so it is a <hi>Lie</hi> made to <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi>; since the design of it is to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure <hi>Orders.</hi> So that if a Bishop trusting to <hi>that,</hi> and being satisfied of the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of one that brings it, ordains an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and unworthy Man, they that signed it, are deeply and chiefly involved in the Guilt of his laying Hands suddenly upon him: therefore every Priest ought to charge his Conscience in a deep particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Manner, that so he may never testify for any one, unless he knows his Life to
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:42659:133"/>
be so regular, and believes his Temper to be so good, that he does really judg him a Person fit to be put in Holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. These are all the Rules that do occur to me at present.</p>
               <p>In performing these several Branches of the Duty of a Pastor, the trouble will not be great, if he is truly a good Man, and delights in the Service of God, and in doing Acts of Charity: the Pleasure will be unspeakable; first, that of the Conscience in this Testimony that it gives, and the Quiet and Joy which arises from the Sense of one's having done his Duty: and then it can scarce be supposed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> by all this, some will be wrought on; some Sinners will be reclaimed; bad Men will grow good, and good Men will grow better. And if a generous Man feels to a great degree, the Pleasure of having delivered one from Misery, and of making him easy and happy; how so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign a Joy must it be to a Man that believes there is another Life, to see that he has been an Instrument to rescue some from endless Misery, and to further others in the way to everlasting Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness? and the more Instances he sees of this, the more do his Joys grow upon him. This makes Life happy, and Death
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:42659:133"/>
joyful to such a Priest, for he is not terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with those words, <hi>Give an Account of thy Stewardship, for thou mayest be no longer Steward:</hi> He knows his Reward shall be full, pressed down, and running over. He is but too happy in those <hi>Spiritual Children,</hi> whom he has <hi>begot in Christ,</hi> he looks after those as the chief part of his Care, and as the principal of his <hi>Flock,</hi> and is so far from aspiring, that it is not without some Uneasiness that he leaves them, if he is commanded to arise to some higher Post in the Church.</p>
               <p>The Troubles of this Life, the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of bad Men, and even the prospect of a Persecution, are no dreadful Things to him that has this <hi>Seal of his Ministry</hi>; and this Comfort within him, that he has not <hi>laboured in vain,</hi> nor <hi>run and fought as one that beats the Air; he sees the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel of his Soul, and is satisfied when he finds that God's Work prospers in his hand.</hi> This comforts him in his sad Reflections on his own past Sins, that he has been an Instrument of advancing God's Honour, of saving Souls, and of propagating his Gospel: Since to have saved one Soul, is worth a Man's coming into the World, and richly worth the Labours of his whole Life. Here is a Subject that might
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:42659:134"/>
be easily prosecuted by many warm and lively Figures: But I now go on to the last Article relating to this Matter.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IX. Concerning Preaching.</head>
               <p>THE World naturally runs to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams in every thing. If one Sect or Body of Men magnify Preaching too much, another carries that to another Extream of decrying it as much. It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a noble and a profitable Exercise, if rightly gone about, of great use both to Priest and People; by obliging the one to much Study and Labour, and by setting before the other full and copious Discoveries of Divine Matters, opening them clearly, and pressing them weightily upon them. It has also now gained so much Esteem in the World, that a Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man cannot maintain his Credit, nor bring his People to a constant Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on the Worship of God, unless he is happy in these Performances.</p>
               <p>I will not run out into the <hi>History of Preaching,</hi> to shew how <hi>late</hi> it was before
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:42659:134"/>
it was brought into the Church, and by what <hi>steps it</hi> grew up to the <hi>pitch</hi> it is now at: How long it was before the Roman Church used it, and in how many diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent shapes it has appeared. Some of the first Patterns we have, are the best: for as <hi>Tully</hi> began the <hi>Roman Eloquence,</hi> and likewise ended it, no Man being able to hold up to the pitch to which he raised it; so St. <hi>Basil</hi> and St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> brought Preaching from the dry pursuing of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legories</hi> that had vitiated <hi>Origen,</hi> and from the excessive Affectation of Figures and Rhetorick that appears in <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> to a due Simplicity; a native Force and Beauty, having joined to the Plainness of a clear but noble Stile, the Strength of Reason, and the Softness of Persuasion. Some were disgusted at this Plainness; and they brought in a great deal of Art into the Composition of Sermons: Mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Applications of Scripture grew to be better liked than clear Texts; an Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation of Figures, a Cadence in the Periods, a playing upon the Sounds of Words, a Loftiness of Epithets, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten an Obscurity of Expression, were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the different Tastes of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Ages run into. Preaching has past through many different Forms among
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:42659:135"/>
us, since the Reformation. But without flattering the present Age, or any Persons now alive, too much, it must be confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, that it is brought of late to a much greater Perfection, than it was ever before at among us. It is certainly brought nearer the Pattern that S. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> has set, or perhaps carried beyond it. Our Language is much refined, and we have returned to the plain Notions of simple and genuine Rhetorick.</p>
               <p>We have so vast a number of excellent Performances in Print, that if a Man has but a right understanding of Religion, and a true relish of good Sense, he may easily furnish himself this way. The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent Way of dividing Texts is laid aside, the needless setting out of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginals, and the vulgar Version, is worn ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. The trifling Shews of Learning in many Quotations of Passages, that very few could understand, do no more flat the Auditory. <hi>Pert Wit</hi> and <hi>luscious Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence</hi> have lost their relish. So that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons are reduced to the plain opening the Meaning of the Text, in a few short Illustrations of its Coherence with what goes before and after, and of the Parts of which it is composed; to that is joined the clear stating of such Propositions as
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:42659:135"/>
arise out of it, in their Nature, Truth and Reasonableness: by which, the Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers may form clear Notions of the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Parts of Religion; such as are best suted to their Capacities and Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions: to all which Applications are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, tending to the Reproving, Directing, Encouraging, or Comforting the Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, according to the several Occasions that are offered.</p>
               <p>This is indeed all that can be truly be intended in Preaching, to make some Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Scripture to be rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood; to make those Truths contain'd in them, to be more fully apprehended; and then to lay the Matter home to the Consciences of the Hearers, so directing all to some good and practical end. In the choice of the <hi>Text</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> care is to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken not to chuse <hi>Texts</hi> that seem to have Humour in them; or that must be long wrought upon, before they are under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood. The plainer a Text is in it self, the sooner it is cleared, and the fuller it is of Matter of Instruction; and therefore such ought to be chosen to common Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditories. Many will remember the <hi>Text,</hi> that remember nothing else; therefore such a choice should be made, as may at least put a weighty and speaking Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:42659:136"/>
of the Scriptures upon the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the People. A Sermon should be made for a <hi>Text,</hi> and not a <hi>Text</hi> found out for a <hi>Sermon</hi>; for to give our Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses weight, it should appear that we are led to them by our <hi>Texts:</hi> such Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons will probably have much more Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy than a general Discourse, before which a <hi>Text</hi> seems only to be read as a decent Introduction, but to which no regard is had in the Progress of it. Great Care should be also had both in opening the Text, and of that which arises from it to illustrate them, by concurrent Passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Scripture: a little of this ought to be in every Sermon, and but a little: for the People are not to be over-charged with too much of it at a time; and this ought to be done with judgment, and not made a bare <hi>Concordance</hi> Exercise, of citing Scriptures, that have the same Words, though not to the same purpose and in the same sense. A Text being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, then the Point upon which the Sermon is to run is to be opened; and it will be the better heard and understood, if there is but one Point in a Sermon; so that one Head, and only one is well stated, and fully set out. In this, great regard is to be had to the Nature of the
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:42659:136"/>
Auditory, that so the Point explained may be in some measure proportioned to them. Too close a Thread of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, too great an Abstraction of Thought, too sublime and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> too metaphisical a Strain, are sutable to very few Auditories, if to any at all.</p>
               <p>Things must be put in a clear Light, and brought out in as short Periods, and in as plain Words as may be: The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of them must be made as sensible to the People as is possible; as in Vertues and Vices; their Tendencies and Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects; their being sutable or unsutable to our Powers, to both Souls and Bodies, to the Interests of this Life as well as the next; and the Good or Evil that they do to Humane Societies, Families and Neighbourhoods, ought to be fully and frequently opened. In setting these forth, such a Measure is to be kept, that the Hearers may perceive, that things are not strained in the Way of a Declamation, into forced Characters, but that they are set out, as truly they are, without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them seem better by imaginary Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, or worse by an undue Aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. For the carrying those Matters beyond the plain Observation of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, makes that the Whole is looked
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:42659:137"/>
on as a piece of Rhetorick; the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher seeming to intend rather to shew his Skill, is raising his Subject too high, or running it down too low, than to lay before them the native Consequences of things; and that which upon Reflection they may be all able to perceive is really true. <hi>Vertue</hi> is so good in it self, that it needs no false Paint to make it look bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: and <hi>Vice</hi> is so bad, that it can never look so ugly, as when shewed in its own natural Colours. So that an undue <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime</hi> in such Descriptions, does hurt, and can do no good.</p>
               <p>When the Explanatory Part of the Sermon is over, the Application comes next: and here great Judgment must be used, to make it fall the heaviest, and lie the longest, upon such Particulars as may be within the compass of the Auditory: Directions concerning a high Devotion, to a stupid ignorant Company; or of Generosity and Bounty, to very poor People; against Pride and Ambition, to such as are dull and low minded, are ill suted; and so must have little effect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. Therefore care must be taken that the Application be useful and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; that it make the Hearers apprehend som of their Sins and Defects, and see how
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:42659:137"/>
to perform their Duty; that it awaken them to it, and direct them in it: and therefore the most common Sins, such as Mens neglecting their Duty to God, in the several Branches of it; their setting their Hearts inordinately upon the World; their Lying in Discourse, but chiefly in Bargaining; their evil Speaking, and their Hatred and Malice, ought to be very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten brought in. Some one or other of thes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, ought to be in every Application that is made, by which they may see, that the whole design of Religion lies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them. Such particular Sins, Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Drunkenness, or Leudness as abound in any place, must likewise be frequently brought in here. The Application must be clear and short, very weighty, and free of every thing that looks like the Affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Wit and Eloquence; here the Preacher must be all Heart and Soul, designing the good of his People. The whole Sermon is directed to this: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as it is fit that the chief Point which a Sermon drives at, should come often o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and over, that so the Hearers may never lose sight of it, but keep it still in view; so in the Application, the Text must be shewed to speak it; all the Parts of the Explanation must come in, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:42659:138"/>
it: the Application must be opened in the several Views that it may have, but those must be chiefly insisted on that are most sutable both to the Capacities and the Circumstances of the People. And in conclusion, all ought to be sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med up in a weighty Period or two; and some other signal Passage of the Scriptures relating to it may be sought for, that so the Matter may be left upon the Auditory in the solemnest manner pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.</p>
               <p>Thus I have led a Preacher through the Composition of his Sermon; I will next lay before him some Particulars rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to it. The shorter Sermons are, they are generally both better heard, and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter remembred. The custom of an Hour's length, forces many Preachers to trifle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way much of the Time, and to spin out their Matter, so as to hold out. So great a length does also flat the Hearers, and tempt them to sleep; especially when, as is usual, the first part of the Sermon is languid and heavy: In half an Hour a Man may lay open his Matter in its full extent, and cut off those Superfluities which come in only to lengthen the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course: and he may hope to keep up the Attention of his People all the while. As
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:42659:138"/>
to the <hi>Stile,</hi> Sermons ought to be very plain; the Figures must be easy, not mean, but noble, and brought in upon design to make the Matter better understood. The Words in a Sermon must be simple, and in common use; not savouring of the Schools, nor above the understanding of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. All long <hi>Periods,</hi> such as carry two or three different Thoughts in them, must be avoided; for few Hearers can follow or apprehend these: Niceties of <hi>Stile</hi> are lost before a common Auditory. But if an easy Simplicity of Stile should run through the whole Composition, it should take place most of all in the explanatory part; for the thing being there offered to be understood, it should be stript of all garnishing: <hi>Definitions</hi> should not be offered in the Terms, or Method, that <hi>Logick</hi> directs. In short, a <hi>Preacher</hi> is to fancy himself, as in the room of the most unlearned Man in his whole Parish; and therefore he must put such parts of his Discourse as he would have all under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, in so plain a form of Words, that it may not be beyond the meanest of them: This he will certainly study to do, if his desire is to edify them, rather than to make them admire himself as a learned and high-spoken Man.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="224" facs="tcp:42659:139"/>But in the Applicatory part, if he has a true taste of Eloquence, and is a Master at it, he is to employ it all in giving some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times such tender Touches, as may soften; and deeper Gashes, such as may awaken his Hearers. A vain Eloquence here, is very ill plac'd; for if that can be born any where, it is in illustrating the Matter: but all must be grave, where one would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade: the most natural but the most sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Expressions come in best here. Such an Eloquence as makes the Hearers look grave, and as it were out of Countenance, is the properest. That which makes them look lively, and as it were smile upon one another, may be pretty, but it only tickles the Imagination, and pleases the Ear; whereas that which goes to the Heart, and wounds it, makes the Hearer rather look down, and turns his Thoughts inward, upon himself: For it is certain that a Sermon, the Conclusion whereof makes the Auditory look pleased, and sets them all a talking one with another, was either not right spoken, or not right heard; it has been fine, and has probably delighted the Congregation, rather than edified it. But that Sermon that makes every one go away silent and grave, and hastning to be alone, to meditate or pray
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:42659:139"/>
over the matter of it in secret, has had its true effect.</p>
               <p>He that has a Taste and Genius for Eloquence, must improve it by reading <hi>Quintilian,</hi> and <hi>Tully</hi>'s Books of <hi>Oratory</hi>; and by observing the Spirit and Method of <hi>Tully</hi>'s Orations: or if he can enter into <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> there he will see a much better Pattern, there being a simplicity, a shortness, and a swiftness, and rapidity in him, that could not be heard without putting his Auditors into a great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion. All our Modern Books upon those Subjects, are so far short of those great Originals, that they can bear no Comparison: yet <hi>F. Rapin</hi>'s little Book of <hi>Eloquence</hi> is by much the best, only he is too short. <hi>Tully</hi> has so fully opened all the Topicks of <hi>Invention,</hi> that a Man who has read him, will, if he has any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of his own, and if he knows throughly his Matter, rather have too much than too little in his view, upon every Subject that he treats. This is a Noble Study, and of great use to such as have Judgment to manage it; for Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Eloquence, without a Flame within, is like Artificial Poetry; all its Producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are forced and unnatural, and in a great measure ridiculous. Art helps and
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:42659:140"/>
guides Nature; but if one was not born with this <hi>Flame,</hi> Art will only spoil him, make him luscious and redundant. To such Persons, and indeed to all that are not <hi>Masters</hi> of the <hi>Body of Divinity,</hi> and of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> I should much rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend the using other Mens Sermons, than the making any of their own. But in the choice of these, great Judgment must be used; one must not take an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor that is too much above himself, for by that, compared with his Ordinary Conversation, it will but too evidently appear, that he cannot be the Author of his own Sermons; and that will make both him and them lose too much of their weight. He ought also to put those printed Sermons out of that strength and closeness of Stile, which looks very well in print; but is too stiff, especially for a common Auditory. He may reverse the Method a little, and shorten the Expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, that so he may retain all that is practical; and that a Man may form him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to Preaching, he ought to take some of the best Models, and try what he can do upon a Text handled by them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reading them, and then compare his Work with theirs; this will more sensibly, and without putting him to the Blush,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:42659:140"/>
model him to imitate, or if he can, to excel the best Patterns: and by this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, if he will restrain himself for some time, and follow it close, he may come to be able to go without such Crutches, and to work without Patterns: till then, I should advise all to make use of other Mens Sermons, rather than to make any of their own.</p>
               <p>The Nation has got into so good a Taste of <hi>Sermons,</hi> from the vast number of those excellent ones that are in print, that a mean Composition will be very ill heard; and therefore it is an unseasonable piece of Vanity, for any to offer their own Crudities, till they have well dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted and ripened them. I wish the Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty of the <hi>Pulpit</hi> were more looked to; and that no Sermons were offered from thence, but such as should make the Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers both the better, and the wiser, the more knowing, and the more serious.</p>
               <p>In the Delivering of <hi>Sermons,</hi> a great Composure of Gesture and Behaviour is necessary, to give them Weight and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority: Extreams are bad here, as in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing else; some affect a light and flippant Behaviour; and others think that wry Faces and a tone in the Voice, will set off the Matter. Grave and composed
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:42659:141"/>
Looks, and a natural, but distinct Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation, will always have the best Effects. The great Rule which the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of Rhetorick press much, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be enough remembred; that to make a Man speak well, and pronounce with a right <hi>Emphasis,</hi> he ought throughly to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand all that he says, be fully persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of it, and bring himself to have those Affections, which he desires to infuse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to others. He that is inwardly persuaded of the Truth of what he says, and that has a Concern about it in his Mind, will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce with a natural Vehemence, that is far more lively, than all the Strains that Art can lead him to. An <hi>Orator,</hi> if we hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to <hi>them,</hi> must be an honest Man, and speak always on the side of <hi>Truth,</hi> and study to <hi>feel</hi> all that he says; and then he will speak it so as to make others <hi>feel</hi> it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise. And therefore such as read their <hi>Sermons,</hi> ought to practise Reading much in private, and read aloud, that so their own Ear and Sense may guide them, to know where to raise or quicken, soften or sweeten their Voice, and when to give an Articulation of Authority, or of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction; where to pause, and where to languish. We plainly see by the <hi>Stage,</hi> what a Force there is in Pronunciation:
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:42659:141"/>
the best Compositions are murdered, if ill spoken; and the worst are acceptable, when <hi>well said.</hi> In <hi>Tragedies</hi> rightly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced and acted, though we know that all is Fable and Fiction; the tender Parts do so melt the Company, that Tears cannot be stop'd, even by those who laugh at themselves for it. This shews the power of apt Words, and a just Pronunciation. But because this depends in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, upon the present Temper of him that speaks, and the lively Disposition in which he is, therefore he ought by much previous Seriousness, and by earnest Prayer to God, to endeavour to raise his Mind to as warm a sense of the Things he is to speak of, as possibly he can, that so his Sermons may make deep Impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on his Hearers.</p>
               <p>This leads me to consider the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence that is between the Reading and the Speaking of Sermons. <hi>Reading</hi> is peculiar to this Nation, and is endured in no other. It has indeed made that our <hi>Sermons</hi> are more exact, and so it has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to us many Volumes of the best that are extant; but after all, though some few read so happily, pronounce so truly, and enter so entirely into those Affections which they recommend, that in them we see both the Correctness of
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:42659:142"/>
                  <hi>Reading,</hi> and the Seriousness of <hi>Speaking</hi> Sermons, yet every one is not so happy: some by hanging their Heads perpetual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly over their Notes, by blundring as they read, and by a cursory running o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them, do so lessen the Matter of their <hi>Sermons,</hi> that as they are generally read with very little <hi>Life</hi> or <hi>Affection,</hi> so they are heard with as little regard or esteem. Those who <hi>read,</hi> ought certainly to be at a little more pains, than for most part they are, to read true, to pronounce with an <hi>Emphasis,</hi> and to raise their Heads, and to direct their Eyes to their Hearers: and if they practis'd more alone the just way of Reading, they might deliver their Sermons with much more advantage. Man is a low sort of Creature; he does not, nay nor the greater part cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider things in themselves, without those little Seasonings that must recommend them to their Affections. That a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course be heard with any <hi>Life,</hi> it must be spoken with <hi>some</hi>; and the Looks and Motions of the Eye do carry in them such Additions to what is said, that where these do not at all concur, it has not all the Force upon them, that otherwise it might have: besides, that the People, who are too apt to censure the Clergy, are ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:42659:142"/>
carried into an obvious Reflection on <hi>Reading,</hi> that it is an Effect of Lazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
               <p>In pronouncing <hi>Sermons,</hi> there are two Ways; the one is when a whole Discourse is got by heart, and delivered word for word, as it was writ down: this is so vast a Labour, that it is scarce possible that a Man can be able to hold up long to it: Yet there is an Advantage even in this to Beginners; it fills their Memories with good Thoughts, and regular Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations: and when they have got some of the most important of their Sermons by heart in so exact a manner, they are thereby furnished with Topicks for Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course. And therefore there are at least two different Subjects, on which I wish all Preachers would be at the pains, to form Sermons well in their Memories: the one is the Grounds of the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> of both sides, God's offers to us in Christ, and the Conditions that he has required of us, in order to our Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation with him. This is so important a Point, in the whole course of our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, that no Man ought to be to seek in the opening or explaining it: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that he may be ripe in it, he ought to have it all rightly laid in his Memory,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:42659:143"/>
not only as to the Notions of it, but to have such a lively Description and Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustration of it all, as to be able to speak of it sensibly, fully, and easily upon all Occasions. Another Subject in which every Minister ought also to be well fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, is concerning <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>; that so when he visits the Sick, and, as is common, that the Neighbours come in, he may be able to make a grave Exhortation, in weighty and fit Words, upon those Heads. Less than this, I think no Priest ought to have in his Memory. But indeed, the more <hi>Sermons</hi> a young Beginner gets by heart, he has still there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the more Discourse ready upon those Heads; for though the whole Contexture of the Sermon will stick no longer than as he has occasion for it, yet a great deal will stay with him: the Idea of the Whole, with the most important Parts of it, will remain much longer.</p>
               <p>But now I come to propose another Method of Preaching, by which a Priest may be prepared, after a right View of his Matter, a true Understanding his Text, and a Digesting of his Thoughts upon it into their natural and proper Order, to deliver these both more easily to himself, and with a better Effect both
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:42659:143"/>
upon Himself and his Hearers. To come at this, he must be for some Years at a great deal of pains to prepare himself to it: yet when that is over, the Labour of all the rest of his Life, as to those Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, will become very easy and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pleasant to him. The Preparations to this must be these; First he must read the Scriptures very exactly, he must have great Portions of them by heart; and he must also in reading them, make a short Concordance of them in his Memory; that is, he must lay together such Passages as belong to the same Matter; to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how far they agree or help to illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate one another, and how the same thing is differently expressed in them; and what various Ideas or Ways of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending a thing rise out of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordance. Upon this a Man must exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise himself much, draw Notes of it, and digest it well in his Thoughts. Then he must be ready with the whole body of Divinity in his Head; he must know what Parts come in as Objections to be answered, where Difficulties lie, how one Part coheres with another, and gives it Light. He must have this very current in his Memory, that he may have things lie before him in one full view; and upon
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:42659:144"/>
this, he is also to work, by making <hi>Tables,</hi> or using such other Helps as may lay Matters clearly before him. He is more particularly to lay before him, a System of Morality, of all Vertues and Vices, and of all the Duties that arise out of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Relations of Mankind; that he m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y have this Matter very full in his eye, and know what are the Scriptures that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to all the Parts of it: he is also to make a Collection of all such Thoughts, as he finds either in the Books of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cien<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Philosophers, (where <hi>Seneca</hi> will be of great use to him) or of Christian Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors: he is to separate such Thoughts as are forced, and that do become rather a strained Declamation made only to please, than a solid Discourse designed to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade. All these he must gather, or at least such a number of them, as may help him to form a distinct Notion of that Matter, so as to be able both to open it clearly, and to press it with Affection and Vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence.</p>
               <p>These are the Materials that must be laid together, the Practice in using them comes next; He that then would prepare himself to be a Preacher in this Method, must accustom himself to talk freely to himself, to let his Thoughts flow from
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:42659:144"/>
him, especially when he feels an edg and heat upon his Mind; for then happy Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions will come in his Mouth, things will ventilate and open themselves to him, as he talks them thus in a Soliloquy to himself. He must also be writing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Essays upon all sorts of Subjects; for by writing he will bring himself to a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectness both in thinking and in speaking: and thus by a hard practice for two or three Years, a Man may render himself such a <hi>Master</hi> in this <hi>Matter,</hi> that he can never be surprised, nor will new Thoughts ever dry up upon him. He must talk o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to himself the whole Body of Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and accustom himself to explain, and prove, to clear Objections, and to apply every part of it to some practical use. He must go through Human Life, in all the Ranks and Degrees of it, and talk o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all the Duties of these; consider the advantages or disadvantages in every one of them, their Relation to one another, the Morality of Actions, the common Vertues and Vices of Mankind; more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Duties of Christians, their Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to Meekness and Humility, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give Injuries, to relieve the Poor, to bear the Cross, to be patient and contented in every State of Life, to pray much and
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:42659:145"/>
fervently, to rejoice ever in God, and to be always praising him, and most parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly to be applying seriously to God through Jesus Christ, for Mercy and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and for his Grace and Spirit; to be worshipping him devoutly in publick, and to be delighting frequently to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorate the Death of Christ, and to partake of the Benefits of it. All these, I say, he must talk over and over again to himself; he must study to give his Thoughts all the Heat and Flight about them that he can: and if in these his Meditations, happy Thoughts, and noble and tender Expressions, do at any time offer themselves, he must not lose them, but write them down; and in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing over such Discourses to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, he must observe what Words sound harsh, and agree ill together; for there is a Musick in Speaking, as well as in Singing; which a Man, tho not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise critical in Sounds, will soon disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. By a very few Years practice of two or three of such Soliloquies a Day, chiefly in the Morning when the Head is clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, and the Spirits are liveliest, a Man will contract a great easiness both in thinking and speaking.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="237" facs="tcp:42659:145"/>But the Rule I have reserved last, is the most necessary of all, and without it all the rest will never do the Business; it is this, That a Man must have in himself a deep sense of the Truth and Power of Religion; he must have a Life and Flame in his Thoughts, with relation to those Subjects: He must have felt in himself those things which he intends to explain and recommend to others. He must ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve narrowly the motions of his own Mind, the good and bad Effects that the several sorts of Objects he has before him, and Affections he feels within him, have upon him; that so he may have a lively Heat in himself, when he speaks of them; and that he may speak in so sensible a manner, that it may be almost felt that he speaks from his Heart. There is an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in the simplest Things that can be said, when they carry visible Characters of Genuineness in them. Now if a Man can carry on this Method, and by much Meditation and Prayer draw down Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Influences, which are always to be expected, when a Man puts himself in the way of them, and prepares himself for them; he will often feel, that <hi>while he is musing, a Fire is kindled within him,</hi> and then he will <hi>speak with Authority,</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:42659:146"/>
Constraint; his Thoughts will be true, and his Expressions free and easy: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times this Fire will carry him, as it were, out of himself; and yet without any thing that is Frantick or Enthusiastical. Discourses brought forth with a lively Spirit and Heat, where a composed Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, and the proper Motions of the Eye and Countenance, and the due Modula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Voice concur, will have all the effect that can be expected from any thing that is below immediate Inspiration: and as this will be of use to the Hearers, so it will be of vast use to the Preacher himself, to oblige him to keep his Heart always in good Tune and Temper; not to suffer irregular or forbidden Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites, Passions, or Projects to possess his Mind: these will both divert him from going on in the course of Meditation, in which a Man must continue many Years, till all his Thoughts are put in order, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd and fixed; they will make him like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise speak much against the grain, with an Aversion that will be very sensible to himself, if not to his Hearers: If he has Guilt upon him, if his Conscience is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching him, and if any ill Practices are putting a damp upon that good sense of Things, that makes his Thoughts <hi>sparkle,</hi>
                  <pb n="239" facs="tcp:42659:146"/>
upon other occasions, and gives him an Air and Authority, a Tone of Assurance, and a Freedom of Expression.</p>
               <p>Such a Method as I have been opening, has had great Success with all those that I have known to have tried it. And tho every one has not that swiftness of Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, nor that clearness of Expression, that others may have, so that in this Men may differ as much as they do in their written Compositions; yet every Man by this Method may rise far above that which he could ever have attained to any other way: It will make even ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act Compositions easier to him, and him much readier and freer at them. But great care must be used by him, before he suffers himself to speak with the liberty here aimed at in publick; he must try himself at smaller Excursions from his fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Thoughts, especially in the Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory part, where Flame and Life are more necessary, and where a mistaken Word, or an unfinished Period are less observed, and sooner forgiven, than in the Expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natory part, where Men ought to speak more severely. And as one succeeds in some short Excursions, he may give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self a farther Scope; and so by a long practice, he will at last arrive at so great
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:42659:147"/>
an easiness, both in thinking and speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that a very little Meditation will serve to lay open a Text to him, with all the Matter that belongs to it, together with the o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>der in which it ought to be both explained and applied. And when a Man has attained to a tolerable degree in this, he is then the <hi>Master</hi> of his Business; he is <hi>Master</hi> also of much Time, and of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny noble Thoughts, and Schemes that will arise out of them.</p>
               <p>This I shall prosecute no further; for if this opening of it, does not excite the Reader to follow it a little, no enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments I can offer upon it, will work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. But to return to <hi>Preaching,</hi> and so conclude this Chapter. He that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends truly to <hi>preach the Gospel,</hi> and not himself; he that is more concerned to do good to others, than to raise his own Fame, or to procure a following to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and that makes this the measure of all his Meditations and Sermons, that he may put things in the best Light, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend them with the most advantage to his People; that reads the Scriptures much, and meditates often upon them; that prays earnestly to God for direction in his Labours, and for a Blessing upon them; that directs his chief endeavours
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:42659:147"/>
to the most important, and most indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensible, as well as the most undeniable Duties of Religion; and chiefly to the inward Reformation of his Hearers Hearts, which will certainly draw all other lesser Matters after it; and that does not spend his Time, nor his Zeal, upon lesser or disputable Points; this Man so made, and so moulded, cannot miscarry in his Work: He will certainly succeed to some degree, <hi>The Word spoken by him, shall not return again.</hi> He shall have his <hi>Crown,</hi> and his <hi>Reward</hi> from his <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours:</hi> And to say all that can be said, in one Word, with St. <hi>Paul, He shall both save himself, and them that hear him.</hi>

                  <head>The CONCLVSION.</head>
                  <p>I have now gone over all that seemed to me most important upon this Head, <hi>of the Pastoral Care,</hi> with as much Short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Clearness as I could: so now I am to conclude. The <hi>Discourse</hi> may just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly seem imperfect, since I say nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Duties incumbent on <hi>Bishops.</hi> But I will upon this occasion say very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle on that Head. The Post I am in, gives me a Right to teach <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Deacons</hi> their <hi>Duty</hi>; therefore I thought, that
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:42659:148"/>
without any great Presumption, I might venture on it: but I have been too few Years in the <hi>higher Order,</hi> to take upon me to <hi>teach</hi> them, from whom I shall ever be ready to <hi>learn.</hi> This is certain, that since, as was formerly said, the Inferiour <hi>Orders</hi> subsist in the <hi>Superior, Bishops</hi> must still be under all the Obligations of <hi>Priests:</hi> They are then, take the Matter at lowest, bound to live, to labour, and to preach as well as they. But why are they raised to a higher Rank of Dignity and Order, an encrease of Authority, and an Extent of Cure? And why have Christian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and States, given them great Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, and an Accession of Secular Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours? All this must certainly import their Obligation to <hi>labour</hi> more eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and to lay themselves out more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely in the <hi>Work of the Gospel:</hi> in which, if the greatest Encouragements and As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistances, the highest Dignities and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, belong to them, then according to our Saviour's Example and Decision, <hi>who came not to be ministred unto, but to minister</hi>; and who declared, that <hi>he who is first shall be last,</hi> and <hi>he who is the greatest must be the Servant of all</hi>; then I say, the higher that any are raised in this Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, they ought to lay themselves out the
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:42659:148"/>
more entirely in it, and labour the more abundantly. And as our Obligations to <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Church,</hi> tie us to a greater Zeal and Diligence, and to a more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Application of our Care and Thoughts; so the <hi>Secular Supports</hi> of our <hi>Honours</hi> and <hi>Revenues</hi> were given us to enable us to go through with that extent of <hi>Care</hi> and <hi>Iurisdiction</hi> that lies upon us. We are not only <hi>Watchmen</hi> to <hi>watch</hi> over the <hi>Flock,</hi> but likewise over the <hi>Watchmen</hi> themselves. We keep the <hi>Door</hi> of the <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> and will have much to answer for, if through our Remissness or feeble Easiness, if by trusting the Examination of those we ordain to others, and yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Intercession and Importunity, we bring any into the <hi>Service of the Church,</hi> who are not duly qualified for it. In this, we must harden our selves, and become inexorable, if we will not partake in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mens Sins, and in the Mischiefs that these may bring upon the Church. It is a false Pity, and a cruel Compassion, if we suffer any Considerations to prevail upon us in this Matter, but those which the Gospel directs. The longer that we know them before we <hi>ordain</hi> them, the more that we sift them, and the greater
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:42659:149"/>
variety of Trials, through which we make them pass, we do thereby both se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Quiet of our own Consciences the more, as well as the Dignity of holy Things, and the true <hi>Interest</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> and the <hi>Church:</hi> for these two <hi>Interests</hi> must never be separated; they are but <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>same</hi> in themselves; and <hi>what God has joined together, we must never set asunder.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We must be setting constantly before our <hi>Clergie,</hi> their Obligations to the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Parts of their Duty; we must lay these upon them, when we <hi>institute</hi> or collate them to <hi>Churches,</hi> in the solemnest Manner, and with the weightiest Words we can find. We must then lay the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of the Care of Souls before them, and <hi>adjure</hi> them, as they will <hi>answer to God</hi> in the <hi>great</hi> Day, in which we must <hi>appear</hi> to <hi>witness</hi> against them, that they will seriously consider and observe their <hi>Ordination-Vows,</hi> and that they will apply themselves wholly to that <hi>one Thing.</hi> We must keep an Eye upon them conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually; and be applying Reproofs, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations, and Encouragements, as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion offers: We must enter into all their Concerns, and espouse every Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:42659:149"/>
of that Part of the Church that is as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed to their <hi>Care:</hi> We must see them as oft as we can, and encourage them to come frequently to us; and must live in all things with them, <hi>as a Father with his Children.</hi> And that every thing we say to stir them up to their <hi>Duty,</hi> may have its due weight, we must take care so to order our selves, that they may evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly see, that we are careful to do our <hi>own.</hi> We must enter into all the Parts of the Worship of God with them; not think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our selves too good for any piece of Service that may be done; visiting the Sick, admitting poor and indigent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, or such as are troubled in mind, to come to us; Preaching of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>There has been an Opinion of late, much favoured by some <hi>great Men</hi> in our <hi>Church</hi>; that <hi>the Bishop is the sole Pastor of his whole Diocess</hi>; that the Care of all the Souls is singly in him, and that all the <hi>Incumbents,</hi> in Churches, are only his <hi>Curates</hi> in the different parts of his <hi>Parish,</hi> which was the Ancient Designa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:42659:150"/>
of his Diocess. I know there are a great many Passages brought from <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity</hi> to favour this: I will not enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Question, no not so far as to give my own Opinion of it. This is certain, that such as are persuaded of it, ought thereby to consider themselves as under very great and strict Obligations, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Labour and Diligence; otherwise, it will be thought, that they only favour this Opinion, because it encreases their <hi>Authority,</hi> without considering that neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary Consequence that follows upon it.</p>
                  <p>But I will go no further on this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, at this time, having said so much only, that I may not seem to fall under that heavy Censure of our Saviour's, with relation to the Scribes and Pharisees, <hi>That they did bind heavy Burdens, and grievous to be born, upon others; and laid them upon Mens Shoulders, when they themselves would not move them with one of their Fingers.</hi> I must leave the whole Matter with my Readers. I have now laid together with great Simplicity what has been the chief Subject of my Thoughts for above <hi>thirty Years.</hi> I was formed to them by a <hi>Bishop</hi> that had the greatest Elevation of Soul, the largest compass of Knowledg, the
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:42659:150"/>
most mortified and most heavenly Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, that I ever yet saw in <hi>Mortal</hi>; that had the greatest Parts as well as Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, with the perfectest Humility that I ever saw in Man; and had a <hi>sublime</hi> Strain in <hi>Preaching,</hi> with so grave a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, and such a Majesty both of Thought, of Language, and of Pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation, that I never once saw a wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring Eye where he preached; and have seen whole Assemblies often <hi>melt in Tears</hi> before him; and of whom, I can say with great truth, that in a free and frequent Conversation with him, for above two and twenty Years, I never knew him say an <hi>idle Word,</hi> that had not a direct Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to <hi>Edification:</hi> and I never once saw him in any other Temper, but that which I wished to be in, in the last Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes of my Life. For that Pattern which I saw in him, and for that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation which I had with him, I know how much I have to answer to God: and though my reflecting on that which I knew in him, gives me just cause of being <hi>deeply humbled</hi> in my self, and before God; yet I feel no more sensible Pleasure in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing, than in going over in my Thoughts all that I saw and observed in him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="248" facs="tcp:42659:151"/>I have also another Reason, that has determined me at this time, to prepare this Discourse, and to offer it to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick; from the present posture of our Affairs. We arenow brought very near the greatest <hi>Crisis</hi> that ever <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> had. And as on the one Hand, if God should so far punish us for our Sins, for our Contempt of his Gospel, and <hi>Neglect</hi> of our <hi>Duties,</hi> as to deliver us over to the Rage of our Enemies; we have nothing to look for, but a <hi>Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> more dreadful than any is in History: So if God hears our Prayers, and gives us a happy Issue out of all those Dangers, with which the Malice of our Enemies threaten us; we have in view the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Prospect of a blessed and lasting Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement, that even our Wishes can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to us. Now nothing can so certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly avert the one, or prepare us to glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy God in it, if he in his Justice and Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom should call us to a Fiery <hi>Trial</hi> of our <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Patience</hi>; as the serious mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Functions, of our Duties and Obligations, the confessing of our Sins, and the correcting of our Errors. We shall be very unfit to <hi>suffer</hi> for our <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> much less to <hi>die</hi> for it, and very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:42659:151"/>
able to endure the hardships of <hi>Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,</hi> if our Consciences are reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us all the while, that we have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured these Things to our selves; and that by the ill use of our Prosperity, and other Advantages, we have kindled a Fire to consume us. But as we have good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son from the present State of Affairs, as well as from the many eminent Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, and happy Providences, which have of late, in so signal a manner, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over and protected us, to hope that God according to the Riches of his <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> and for the <hi>Glory</hi> of his <hi>Great Name,</hi> will hear the Prayers that many good Souls offer up, rather than the Cry of those Abominations that are still among us: So nothing can so certainly hasten on the fixing of our Tranquillity, and the compleating our Happiness, as our lying often between the Porch and the Altar, and interceding with God for our Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and our giving our selves wholly to the Ministry of the Word of God, and to Prayer. These being then the surest Means, both to procure and to establish to us, all those great and glorious Things that we pray and hope for; this seemed to me a very proper Time to publish a Discourse of this Nature.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="250" facs="tcp:42659:152"/>But that which made it an Act of <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi> as well as <hi>Zeal,</hi> was the Authority of my <hi>Most Reverend Metropolitan</hi>; who, I have reason to believe, employs his Time and Thoughts, chiefly to consider what may yet be wanting to give our <hi>Church</hi> a greater Beauty and Perfection; and what are the most proper Means both of puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying and uniting us. To which I thought nothing could so well prepare the way, as the offering to the Publick a plain and full Discourse of the <hi>Pastoral Care,</hi> and of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Thing relating to it. <hi>His Grace</hi> appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of this, and desired me to set about it: Upon these Motives I writ it, with all the Simplicity and Freedom that I thought the Subject required, and sent it to him; by whose particular <hi>Approbation</hi> I publish it, as I writ it at his <hi>Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is indeed one of my Motives that I have not yet mentioned, and on which I cannot enlarge so fully as I well might. But while we have such an inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable and unexampled Blessing, in the <hi>Persons</hi> of those <hi>Princes</hi> whom God hath set over us; if all the Considerations which arise out of the Deliverances that God has given us by <hi>their</hi> Means, of the
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:42659:152"/>
Protection we enjoy under <hi>them,</hi> and of the great hopes we have of <hi>them:</hi> If, I say, all this does not oblige us, to set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the reforming of every Thing that may be amiss or defective among us, to study much, and to labour hard; to lead strict and exemplary Lives, and so to stop the Mouths, and overcome the Prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, of all that divide from us; this will make us look like a Nation cast off and <hi>forsaken of God,</hi> which is <hi>nigh unto cursing,</hi> and <hi>whose end is burning.</hi> We have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to conclude, that our present Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings are the last Essays of God's Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to us, and that if we bring forth no Fruit under these, the next Sentence shall be, <hi>Cut it down, why cumbreth it the Ground?</hi> These Things lie heavy on my Thoughts continually, and have all concurred to draw this Treatise from me; which I have writ with all the sincerity of Heart, and purity of Intention, that I should have had, if I had known that I had been to die at the Conclusion of it, and to answer for it to God.</p>
                  <p>To him I humbly offer it up, together with my most earnest Prayers, That the Design here so imperfectly offered at,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:42659:153"/>
may become truly effectual, and have its full Progress and Accomplishment; which whensoever I shall see, I shall then with Joy, say, <hi>Nunc Dimittis, &amp;c.</hi>
