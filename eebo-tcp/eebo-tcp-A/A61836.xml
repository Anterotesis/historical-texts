         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT is the saying of the Wise man even of a King, <hi>Solomon</hi> the wisest of all Kings that ever raigned in this earth, that in the countenance of the King is life and death, like to the sonne which by the sending forth of his glorious beames upon the fruits of the earth nourisheth, and causeth the same to fructifie and grow, gives vigor and strength to all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that lives in and upon the same, and by withdrawing his light being over shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with clouds keepes back the grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and flourishing of the creature, yea and by continuance in that his hidden motion procureth at last the utter withering and perishing thereof.</p>
            <p>His gracious Majesty, who is our sonne and comforter at such time as his glorious beames of grace and favour reflect upon
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:96705:3"/>
hi good Subjects, they increase &amp; grow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire &amp; tender affection towards his Majesty, that no distempers or troubles whatsoever can separate betweene him and them. But this our sonne being over-shadowed with clouds, and mists of discontent and disfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour towards his People, causeth them to wander in obscurity and darknesse, even ready to faint and dispaire of any designe they take in hand, for the safety and securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his Majesty and his Kingdomes, yea and strikes them as it were with death and utter distruction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Master Speaker.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I perswade my selfe our gracious Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne in his owne naturall disposition, is altogether bright and comfortable, and that never causeth or retracts to himselfe any discontent towards his loving Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, but by suggestion information, and instigation, of malignant and disaffected spirrits, both to the tranquillity and peace of his Majesty and the whole state of this Kingdome.</p>
            <p>It is <hi>Master Speaker</hi> the onely pollicy of desparate and evill minded persons, that have beene the onely troublers of our Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell finding themselves in danger (by cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of them to an accompt for their mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeds and misdemeanours) to be brought to punishment for the same, to cast asper<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sions

upon those faithfull councellours of the King and State, which strive to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their malicious and wicked designes, to overthrow and destroy the same.</p>

            <p>These Articles Master Speaker exhibited against my selfe and the other gentelmen are I conceive not really intended against vs as if we were actually guiltie of the same but onely to procure our absence from this honourable house that wee may not
