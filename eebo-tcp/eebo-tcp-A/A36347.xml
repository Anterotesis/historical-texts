            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>SPEECH
Of the Right Reverend Father in God
ANTHONY LORD BISHOP of MEATH,
When the Clergy waited on His MAJESTY at His Camp nigh Dublin, <date>July 7. 1690.</date>
            </head>
            <head type="sub">Together with
His MAJESTY's Moſt Gracious ANSWER.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>May it pleaſe Your MAJESTY,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WE are ſome of the Remains of the Clergy that have ventur'd to ſtay behind our
Brethren in Perillous Times, and under great Diſcouragements, for the Diſcharge
of our Duty to God and the People. Two of us are Biſhops, who, together with
Five more in the Kingdom, thought our ſelves obliged to continue here, to preſerve the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
of the Clergy, by the Ordination of Prieſts and Deacons, and the Seminary of the
Church by Confirmation. The reſt of our Members are the Clergy of this City, and the
Rural Clergy. The former of theſe have ſtaid upon their Charge, under great Wants and
Diſcouragements, having not only been deprived of all their Maintenance, but expoſed to
daily Dangers, in and for the Diſcharge of their Duties: And the latter are Perſons driven
from their Cures, and forced to ſeek Relief and Sanctuary in this City.</p>
            <p>We may poſſibly be cenſured by thoſe, who underſtand not the Grounds and Reaſons of
our continuance in this Kingdom, as <hi>Trimmers,</hi> or Favourers of Popery: From the firſt we
are able to acquit our ſelves, having been guilty of no Compliances, but ſuch as were the
effects of Prudence and Self preſervation, ſuch as were at once both innocent and neceſſary,
and fit to be obſerved to a Power, that was able to cruſh us far worſe than it did: And we
are ſo far from being guilty of the latter, that we humbly conceive, That we could not more
effectually oppoſe the growth and inundation of Popery, than by keeping up the publick
Aſſemblies, by ſticking to our Flocks, and preventing their ſeduction by the Romiſh E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſaries.</p>
            <p>We do not come to crave your Majeſties Protection for our Perſons, our Churches, our
Religion, or our Properties, which have been all in ſome meaſure invaded. Our Perſons
have been impriſon'd, our Churches taken from us, our Properties deſtroyed by a late Act of
Parliament that took away our Tithes; and the free exerciſe of our Religion for ſome time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted.
A Requeſt of this Nature might perhaps look like a diſtruſt of your Majeſties Care
of us, and ſeem to contradict the Glorious deſign of your coming into this Kingdom. We
are ſenſible that the generous End of your Majeſties Preſence is to reſcue us from the Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
and Tyranny of Popery; and are well aſſured, that the ſame Paternal Affection, that
moved your Majeſty to pity our Diſtreſs, will ſtill protect us now we are deliver'd.</p>
            <p>We come rather to bleſs God as the Author of our Deliverance, and Your Majeſty as the
Happy Inſtrument raiſed up by His Providence for the effecting it; to expreſs our Gratitude
and Duty to Your Majeſty, who has a double Title to our Services, not only as our King, but
as our Gracious Benefactor and Deliverer: To pray for the Succeſs of Your Majeſty's Forces,
for the Conſummation of that Good Work that you have with ſo much Perſonal Hazard un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken:
That you may carry your Victorious Arms into other Countries, where the Cries
and the Groans, and the Oppreſſions of the Afflicted Proteſtants, are as great as they have
been here; That God would be an Helmet of Salvation to you in the Day of Battle, and
deal with You as he did with <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> when he promis'd him the Kingdom of <hi>Egypt</hi>
for his hard Service againſt <hi>Tyrus:</hi> May he likewiſe recompenſe your hard Labour in this
Kingdom, with the Addition of another that is far more valuable: And may you prove as
Happy and Succeſsful an Inſtrument in the ſuccouring of others, as you have been of the
Poor Afflicted People of this Kingdom.</p>

               <head>His MAJESTY's Anſwer.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> Am come hither to deliver you from the Tyranny of Popery and Slavery, to protect
the Proteſtant Religion, and Reſtore you to your Liberties and Properties; and you
may depend upon it.</p>
