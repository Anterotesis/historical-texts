         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

to the curse of the law, and to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall

            <p>2. That they had great need to bee

of their seruitude; for being
<note n="h" place="margin">Vers. 35.</note> seruants, and not sons, howsoeuer
now they had a place in the house of

               </gap>ertion is presupposed in this
place, as being the hypothesis wherupon
this inference is grounded. Those that
be the sonnes of God, abide in the house
of God for euer; therefore if the Sonne
shall make you free, &amp;c. presupposing
that men attaine to the freedome of
Gods sonnes, by the benefit of Christ,
the onely begotten Sonne of God.</p>
            <p>Wherupon, as I said, is inferred the
fourth thing, which is my text; <hi>If the
Sonne therefore shall make you free, you
shall be free indeed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As if hee had said: you haue no cause
to cauil at the promise of libertie, which
I make to all them which truly beleeue
in me. For I tell you vpon my word,
which is Amen (that is, true and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible)
that both you, and all men by
nature, though the seed of <hi>Abraham</hi>
(as you are), though liuing (as you do)
in the visible Church of God, are the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:2369:7"/>
very seruants of sinne; that being ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
and not sonnes, they must not
looke to inherite<note n="n" place="margin">Galath. 4. 28</note> with the sons of the
promise, or to abide in the house for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer;
but when the time of separation
commeth, they shall as<note n="o" place="margin">Matth. 3. 12. 13. 30. 25. 33</note> chaffe be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
from the wheate; as tares, from

<note n="p" place="margin">Gen. 21. 10. Galath. 4. 30.</note> 
               <hi>Hagar</hi> and <hi>Ismael,</hi> from <hi>Isaak</hi> the sonne
of the promise. Therefore, though your
pride will not suffer you to see and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
thus much: yet certainly
great need haue you to bee made free;
that of the seruants of sinne, you may
become the sons of God. But you, who
are (as all<note n="q" place="margin">Ephes. 2. 3.</note> men by nature are) the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of wrath, cannot possiblie bee the
sons of God, except you beleeue in me,
who am the only begotten Son of
God; that I may by the grace of adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
communicate that vnto you, which
I my selfe am by nature and eternall ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.
So shall you, of the seruants of
sinne, sons of Satan, and heires of Hell
and damnation, be made the sons of
God, heires of eternall life, citizens and
free denizens of the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:2369:8"/>
Whereas now therefore you are
miserable seruants, notwithstanding
your corporall and carnall libertie,
whereof you vaunt, which is not a true
libertie, but a voluntarie seruice of sin:
if you shall beleeue in me, and approue
your selues to be my true disciples, by
abiding in my words; I, who am the
truth, will make you free, not with a
counterfeit or imaginary freedome, such
as is your libertie, but with a true and
spirituall freedome, which is the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,

               </gap>y, but a true li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.
Of all which points, I will speake
very briefly.</p>
            <p>As touching the first: for as much as
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:2369:9"/>
Logicians teach,<note place="margin">§. Sect. 3. The definition of Christian libertie.</note>
               <note n="a" place="margin">Arist. Post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. 1. 14.</note> that the definition of
the speciall, is to bee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>etched from the
distribution of the generall; for which
cause, the<note n="b" place="margin">Plato in Sophista.</note> diuine Philosopher calleth
a distribution <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as being the
ready, and as it were the Kings way to
a definition: wee will therefore take a
suruey of the diuers sorts of liberty. For
there is an outward or externall liberty,
and there is an inward or internall li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ty.
The former, is the liberty of the
outward man from externall or bodily
seruitude; which may be called the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
or ciuill liberty. Of this our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
speaketh not, though the Iewes
would seeme so to vnderstand him; but
of the internall, which may well stand
with the outward or ciuill bondage. For
as our Sauiour Christ noted them,
<note n="c" place="margin">Iohn. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 33. 34.</note> though outwardly free, to bee in spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
bondage: so contrariwise, those
who in respect of the inner man are
free, may notwithstanding bee subiect
to the external or ciuill seruitude; which
nothing impeacheth or impaireth the
liberty of the soule and conscience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God. In which regard the Apostle
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:2369:10"/>
saith;<note n="d" place="margin">1. Cor. 7. 21.</note> 
               <hi>Hee that is called in the Lord, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a seruant, is the Lords freeman.</hi> So
that the liberty whereof we speake, is a
liberty of the soule, or inner man. Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
therefore is the doctrine of the
Anabaptists, who therby exempt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
from all subiection to the ciuill
Magistrate, vnder pretence of Christian
liberty. I call their doctrine wicked, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi>
               <note n="e" place="margin">1. Pet. 2. 16.</note> saith; that they
who vnder pretence of Christian liberty
deny obedience to the Magistrate in
lawfull things, doe vse their liberty for
a cloake to couer their wickednesse.</p>
            <p>Againe, the inward liberty is either a
carnall, or spirituall libertie. The car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
libertie is that, whereby the soule
of man is free from righteousnesse:
which indeed is a voluntary seruice of
sin. For when men be free from righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,
they are seruants of sinne, and
contrariwise; as the Apostle<note n="f" place="margin">Rom. 6. 20.</note> sheweth.
But our Sauiour speaketh of a liberty,
which, as it freeth men from the serui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of sinne, and all the spirituall yokes
of bondage, which accompany the
same; so it maketh them the seruants
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:2369:10"/>
of righteousnesse. For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>we are</hi>
               <note n="g" place="margin">Rom. 6. 18.</note> 
               <hi>made
free from sinne, wee are made the seruants
of righteousnes.</hi> Wherefore, as in respect
of the former, we say with the Apostle;
Hee that is called, being a seruant, is the
freeman of Christ: so in respect of this
latter,<note n="h" place="margin">1. Cor. 7. 22.</note> he <hi>that is called being free, is the
seruant of Christ.</hi> Diuellish therefore is
the Doctrine of the Libertines, who
vnder pretence of Christian liberty, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
Christians from all obedience to
the law of God, setting them free to do
whatsoeuer themselues thinke good.
And such is the slander of the Papists,
laying that doctrine to our charge, who
notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding are further from it then
themselues. For by the Popes indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences
and pardons, and the Priests
absolutions, setting men free from sinne
for small, and oft times for ridiculous
penances, what doe they else but teach
men to make but a sport of sinne? Of
such Libertines the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi>
               <note n="i" place="margin">2. Pet. 2. 19.</note> spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth,
that whilest they promise liberty
to others, themselues are the seruants of
corruption.</p>
            <p>It remaineth therefore, that Christian
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:2369:11"/>
liberty is a spirituall liberty, freeing the
true Christian from the seruitude of
sinne, and from all other yokes of spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
bondage, wherewith sinne had
intangled vs.</p>
            <p>Neither is Christian liberty onely
priuatiue, as being a freedome and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity
from bondage; as though this
were all, that by it we are not seruants:
but as appeareth by this Scripture, it is
also positiue, as being a liberty, power,
right, and interest to the priuileges of
Gods children, who are also heires of
God, and coheires with Christ. For
when hee had said that seruants abide
not in the house for euer, but that such
as bee sonnes, abide in the house of God
for euer, hee inferreth, If therefore the
sonne shall make you free, you shall bee
free indeed. Giuing vs to vnderstand,
that those whom hee freeth, hee doth
not onely make them not seruants, <hi>viz.</hi>
of sinne, but also sonnes and heires of
God, and citizens of heauen. Euen as
they who are made freemen of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
or any other terrestriall Citie, are
not only exempted from being seruants
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:2369:11"/>
or apprentises; but also are indowed
with the liberties and priuileges of free
Burgesses and Citizens. So saith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle,
<note n="k" place="margin">Gal 4. 5. 6. 7</note> Gal. 4. 5. that Christ hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
those who were vnder the law,
that wee might receiue the adoption of

            <p>Christian liberty therefore is a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
liberty, which as the<note n="a" place="margin">Galath. 2. 4. <gap reason="foreign">

by whom wee haue<note n="x" place="margin">Ephes. 1. 7. 1. Cor. 1. 30.</note> redemption,
wee all acknowledge him to bee the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of our libertie. Let vs rather consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
how hee procureth this libertie
vnto vs. This he doth two waies; both
meritoriously, and effectually. By his
merit, in<note n="y" place="margin">1. Tim. 2. 6.</note> 
               <hi>giuing himselfe to bee a price
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:2369:13"/>
of ransome for vs.</hi> For, as <hi>Peter</hi>
               <note n="z" place="margin">1. Pet. 1. 18. 19.</note> saith,
we <hi>are redeemed not with any corruptible
things, as siluer and gold, but with the
precious blood of Christ,</hi> by<note n="a" place="margin">Heb. 9. 12.</note> which
<hi>blood hee is entred once into the holy place,
hauing procured an eternall redemption
for vs.</hi> Secondly, by the efficacie of his
spirit, for wee are not to imagine, that
Christ hath only merited and purchased
this libertie for vs; but that also hee
doth confer, applie, and bestow it vpon
vs: which he doth by giuing vnto vs his
<note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 8. 9. 19 Gal. 4. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Spirit.</hi> For, as in the naturall bodie,
the animall spirit, which causeth sense

               <hi>libertie</hi> is communicated to all his

in the degrees of our saluation, viz.

therefore you bee the sons of God
by faith, truly called, engrafted into

doth not belong vnto you. For it is a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie,
as the Apostle saith,<note n="z" place="margin">Galath. 2. 4.</note> 
               <hi>which wee

of Christ, and children of God? How
then do you say, wee are not free? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued,
as this obiection is not vnlike the

the Church of God, as these <hi>Iewes</hi> were;
and that you haue beene baptised, as they
had beene circumcised. But you must
distinguish, first, of the Church; that
there is a Church visible, and a Church
inuisible, which is the mysticall body
of Christ. And you are to know, that
there bee many in the Church visible,
which are not<note n="a" place="margin">1. Ioh. 2. 19.</note> of the Church inuisible;
many in the house of God, which bee
seruants and not sonnes. Secondly, of
calling; that there is an outward calling
by the Word, which is common to all
in the Church, of which it is said,<note n="b" place="margin">Matth. 20. 16. &amp; 22. 14.</note> many
called, and few chosen. And there is an
inward and effectuall calling, according
to Gods <hi>purpose,</hi> of which it is said,
<note n="c" place="margin">Rom. 8. 28. 30</note> whom hee elected, hee called. Thirdly,
of Baptisme; there is an outward Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme,
which is the sprinkling of the

the<note n="g" place="margin">Rom. 2. 28. 29.</note> Iewes, that they were either

according to the flesh, and according to

               <note n="i" place="margin">Gal. 3. 7.</note> 
               <hi>which be of faith, are the sonnes of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham:</hi>
so men are called Christians, mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Christ, sonnes of God, not only
who are such indeede and in truth; but
also such as are Christians onely in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
members of Christ in appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
<note n="k" place="margin">Ezech. 16. 20. 21.</note> sonnes of God in respect of the
outward couenant.<note place="margin">Matth. 8. 12.</note> Wherefore though
you liue in the visible Church, though
you bee called, though you haue beene
baptized, and by baptisme sacramentally
vnited to the body of Christ, which is
his Church; though in your owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
and in the reputation of others,
who conceiue of you (as they ought)
according to the iudgement of charitie,
you are Christians, members of Christ,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:2369:20"/>
and sonnes of the kingdome: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
if you doe not truely beleeue
in Christ and vnfainedly repent of your
sinnes, you are seruants and not sonnes.
Yea, so farre shall these outward priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
bee from exempting you from
damnation, that they shall greatly ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauate
your iudgement. For hath God
called vs, and wee are not called? hath
hee inuited vs to turne vnto him, and
wee are not conuerted? hath hee by his
Ministers<note n="l" place="margin">2. Cor. 5. 20.</note> intreated vs, that wee would
bee reconciled vnto him, and wee will
not bee reconciled? hath hee offered vs
infinite mercy in the mysterie of our sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
by Christ, and wee haue despised
the same, not caring to apprehend the
mercies of God and merits of Christ,
but suffering his precious blood to bee
spilt as it were on the ground in vaine?
hath hee often sought<note n="m" place="margin">Matth. 23. 37.</note> togather vs vnto
him, as the Hen gathered the Chickens
vnder her wings, and wee would not?
Then haue the meanes of saluation been
the meanes of obduration vnto vs; and
the Word, which to the faithfull is the
<note n="n" place="margin">2. Cor. 2. 16.</note> sauour of life vnto life, vnto vs is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:2369:21"/>
come a sauour of death vnto death. Yea,
for this contempt of the Gospell, if wee
persist in it, our estate in the day of
iudgement shall bee more<note n="o" place="margin">Matth. 10. 15.</note> intolerable,
then theirs of Sodom and Gomorah.
And vnto vs belongeth that fearfull wo
denounced by our Sauiour Christ,<note n="p" place="margin">Matth. 11. 21. 23.</note> Wo
to thee Bethsaida, woe to thee Caper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naum:
for if the meanes which you haue
had, had beene vouchsafed to them of
Tyrus and Sidon, yea to them of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
they would haue turned vnto
God, but <hi>I say vnto you, it shall bee easier
for them in the day of iudgement, then for
you.</hi> Againe, hath the Lord sent his
Sonne to redeeme vs, giuen vs meanes
to applie Christ vnto vs, hath he entre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
vs to beleeue and repent, and put to
his seale in Baptisine, thereby assuring
vs, that if wee beleeue and repent, our
soules are washed with the blood of
Christ, that wee are ingrafted into him,
and in him are made the sons of God,
and heires of eternall life? Shall not wee
therefore most worthily perish in our
sinnes, if notwithstanding wee will not
beleeue and repent; especially hauing
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:2369:21"/>
in our Baptisme by a solemne vow
bound our selues thereto? The conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
whereof must force men, who
are not yet regenerated, vnfainedly to
turne vnto God, and to lay hold vpon
Christ by faith. For it is most certaine,
though they liue in the house of God,
which is his Church, yet vntill they tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
beleeue and repent, they are servants
and not sonnes: and such servants as are
held vnder the most miserable and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
slavery of sin and Satan: being not
only bound hand and foot, yea in heart
and mind, so that they can neither doe
nor thinke that which is spiritually
good; but are also caried away<note n="q" place="margin">2. Tim. 2. 26 Titus 3. 3.</note> cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue,
to performe the will of Satan, and
the lusts of the flesh; whereby it comes
to passe, that as they can doe no good,
so can they doe nothing but sinne.</p>
            <p>The next thing to bee considered,<note place="margin">§. 6. The quality or property of this liberty.</note> is
the quality of this liberty, viz. that it
is a true liberty. For neither is it an ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary
liberty, as in the paradox of the
Stoicks, who held that wise men of the
world were only free, when they also,
being not freed by Christ, were and are
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:2369:22"/>
no better but servants; or in the secure
imaginations of carnall men, who with
these Iewes, though being in bondage
thinke themselues free. Neither is it a
loose liberty or licentiousnesse, such as
Libertines assume to themselues, but a
true and a holy liberty, whereby wee
being freed from sin, become servants
of righteousnesse, and being deliuered
from the hands of our spirituall ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
are inabled to worship God with
willing mindes, and chearefull hearts:
for that is the only true liberty: and such
is the liberty of the Saints in heauen,
and of the blessed Angels, who count it
not only their liberty, but also their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse,
willingly &amp; cheerefully to serue
the Lord. For if the Sonne, who is the
truth, shall make you free, then shall
you be free <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in deed, and in truth.</p>
            <p>This therefore, as it serueth for the
comfort of the godly; so also for the
terror of the wicked. For, from this
speech of our Saviour, we may conclude
both waies. 1. Whosoeuer are made
free by Christ, they are free indeed:
but all the faithfull are made free by
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:2369:22"/>
Christ; therefore (whatsoever the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell
or their owne corruption can ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
to the contrarie) they are free in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</p>
            <p>Againe, If the Son make you free,
saith Christ, then are you free indeed;
but you (say I to vnbeleevers and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent
sinners,) are not free indeed: <hi>For
he that committeth sin, is the servant of
sin;</hi> therefore, howsoever you professe
your selues redeemed by Christ, and
howsoever also it bee most true, that
Christ hath paid a ransome sufficient for
the redemption of all; yet are you not
actually redeemed, nor the benefit of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
applied vnto you, vntill you
be ingrafted into Christ by faith, and
renued by the holy Ghost. And the
same may be confirmed by the oath of
the Lord, (<hi>wherein</hi>
               <note n="r" place="margin">Heb. 6. 18.</note> 
               <hi>it is impossible that
he should lie,)</hi> the oath which hee sware
to our father <hi>Abraham,</hi> that hee would
giue vs, both that we should bee delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from the hand, that is, the power &amp;
dominion of our spirituall enemies; and
<note n="s" place="margin">Luk. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> being <hi>deliuered, should also haue grace
to worship God without feare, in holines
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:2369:23"/>
and righteousnesse before him, all the daies
of our life.</hi> If therefore wee doe not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to worshippe God in holinesse
and righteousnesse, with willing minds
and vpright hearts; it is as sure as the
oath of the Lord is true, that as yet wee
are not actually freed and redeemed by
Christ. For <hi>if the Sonne make you free,
you shall be free indeed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus much of the generall do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Christian liberty: wherein I
haue beene the shorter, because all these
points, whereof I haue thus generally
and briefly spoken, <hi>viz.</hi> that Christian
liberty is a spirituall liberty, which the
faithfull haue in and by Christ Iesus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that it consisteth on two parts, an immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
and freedome from all spirituall
bondage, &amp; an <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, &amp; right to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
and liberties of Gods children:
that Christ our redeemer is the author
of this liberty, both in respect of his
merit and efficacie: that it is bestowed
only vpon the faithfull, who are the
sonnes of God and members of Christ:

Rom. 4. and by such<note n="d" place="margin">Iam. 2. 20. 21.</note> a faith, Iam. 2.)
so haue they the same liberty which is
obtained by faith, and in some chiefe
points thereof is, as<note n="e" place="margin">Instit. lib. 3. cap. 19. §. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Calvin</hi> saith, an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix

            <p>The common liberty of grace,<note place="margin">The liberty of saving grace.</note> which
may fitly be called the liberty of sauing
grace, containeth many particulars;
which, for your easiest remembrance,
may be reduced to these three heads.</p>
            <p>For it is a liberty
which we haue
in and by our
<list>
                  <item>Vocation.</item>
                  <item>Iustification.</item>

For, although these three concurre in
time, because a man is no sooner effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
called, but he is also iustified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:2369:25"/>
God, and no sooner iustified, but
he beginneth also to bee sanctified
(which is duly to be obserued of those,
who presuming, and that perhaps for a

doe still remaine vnsanctified) not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
in order of nature<note n="f" place="margin">Rom. 8. 30.</note> voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
goeth before iustification, and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification
before sanctification. And let
this also by the way be observed for the
comfort of the godly. For whosoever,
professing the true faith, hath a true pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
and vnfained desire to walke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God in the obedience of his will,
making conscience of all his waies: that

in many particulars; yet he is sanctified,
and from his sanctification may certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

is called, that he is elected, that he shall

the better vnderstanding of this point,
we must remember, that Christ at a

you are called vnto liberty:</hi> which words
we are thus to vnderstand, that by our

Christian liberty in generall, as a maine
benefit of our Christian profession; but
also by it are enfranchised, being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
put into possession of a good part
of it, and entituled to the rest. For
whereas naturally wee are wholy, and
not only in part (for that may be verifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of the faithfull, Rom. 7. 14.) carnall,
sold vnder sinne; by our calling wee are
first made spirituall, being in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure

Now the spirit of Christ, being the <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of liberty,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> speaketh,<note n="l" place="margin">Psal. 51. 14.</note> Psal.

            </p>
            <p>But the liberty which wee haue by
our calling standeth on these degrees.
First, as it is an immunity; our mindes
are therein freed from the servitude of
blindnesse and incredulity, our hearts
and willes from the bondage of that,
which the Apostle calleth<note n="n" place="margin">Rom. 11. 32</note>

that is, disobedience and infidelity;
our selues, from the servitude of Satan,

               </gap>, that is, a power and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest;
wee are in our calling indued, as
I said, with the spirit of liberty, which
freeth our soules by enlightning our
minds, perswading our iudgements, and
softening our hearts, enspiring thereinto
godly desires and gratious resolutions;
whereby he beginning the grace of faith
in vs, doth regenerate vs and vnite vs
vnto Christ. So that by our effectuall
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:2369:27"/>
calling, in regard that therein the spirit
of liberty is communicated vnto vs, and
the saving grace of faith is therein be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
in vs, we are made the sonnes of
God and members of Christ, and are
not only entituled to all the rights and
priviledges of the children of God, and
members of Christ; but also are present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<note n="x" place="margin">Iohn. 5. 24.</note> translated, as it were from death to
life, and from the state of damnation
vnto the state of grace and salvation.</p>
            <p>But these things doe need some far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

ministry of the Gospell, which is the
ministry<note n="y" place="margin">2. Cor. 3. 8. 1. P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

vs with his grace, sendeth the
spirit of his sonne into our hearts; which
being, as I said, the spirit of liberty; first,
freeth our mindes from the bondage of
ignorance, incredulity &amp; vanity, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
vntill then wee are held captiue, not
onceable of our selues to entertaine a

thoughts being<note n="d" place="margin">Gen. 6. 5. &amp; 8. 21.</note> onely evill continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:2369:27"/>
the wisdome of our flesh,<note n="e" place="margin">Rom. 8. 7.</note> or that
which our flesh mindeth, being enmity
against God; our selues, not only not
perceiuing, but being<note n="f" place="margin">1. Cor. 2. 14.</note> not able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
the things which are of the spirit
of God, and much lesse able to giue as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
vnto them (for no man can say that
<note n="g" place="margin">1. Cor. 12. 3.</note> Iesus is Christ but by the holy Ghost)
and much lesse to assent effectually, or
by a liuely faith. The spirit of God
therefore by the ministry of the word
(which is a<note n="h" place="margin">Psal. 119. 105.</note> light vnto our feete) as the
meanes, and by the Ministers of the
Gospell as his instruments (who are
therefore called the<note n="i" place="margin">Mat. 5. 14.</note> light of the world,

               </gap>, that is, not only

to assent to those things which are

maketh vs vnfainedly to acknowledge

servitude, and damnable estate
in our selues, and also the gratious liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and sauing grace of God offered in
Christ. And this is the first degree of the
liberty which we haue in our calling,
that therein we are called out of<note n="n" place="margin">1. Pet. 2. 9.</note> dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
into light. Of this liberty the Apostle
speaketh, 2. Cor. 3.<note n="o" place="margin">2. Cor. 3. 15. 16. 17.</note> that whereas there
is naturally a vaile over mens hearts,
that they cannot vnderstand the word;
this vaile is taken away by the spirit of
God, when they turne vnto the Lord.
Now the <hi>Lord</hi> (saith he) <hi>is the spirit, &amp;
where the spirit of the Lord is, there is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</hi>
In this regard the spirit is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to an<note n="p" place="margin">Apoc. 3. 18.</note> eye-salue, and is called
that<note n="q" place="margin">1. Ioh. 2. 27.</note> anointing, which, being receiued
from Christ, teacheth vs all things.</p>
            <p>Hauing thus revealed vnto vs both
our owne miserable estate in our selues,
and the infinite mercies of God in
Christ, and moued vs truly to assent
thereto; in the next place hee toucheth
our hearts with a sense of our misery,
and with a hatred of sinne, which hath
brought vs into that miserable estate, and
by the ministry of the Word, which is
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:2369:28"/>
his<note n="r" place="margin">Rom. 1. 16.</note> power to our salvation, and his
<note n="s" place="margin">Esai. 53. 1.</note> arme to draw vs vnto him, hee turneth
our will and affections from darknesse
(which naturally<note n="t" place="margin">Ioh. 3. 19. Act. 26. 18.</note> wee loue) vnto light,
not only working in vs hearty desires, to
come out of that damnable estate, and
to be made partakers of Christ (which
desires also he being the<note n="u" place="margin">Zac. 12. 10. Rom. 8. 26.</note> Spirit of sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication,
helpeth vs to expresse in hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
prayer;) but also inspiring into vs a

that receiue Christ by faith; wee will
therefore resolue vndoubtedly to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
him to be our only Saviour,
and to rest vpon him alone for salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Thus by working, 1. In our mindes
an effectuall assent to the promise of the

to bee made partakers of Christs

magnifiers of our pure naturals; they
neither acknowledge the wofull bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
wherein we are by nature, nor the
happy liberty, whereunto wee are, not
borne, but called. For this is a liberty,

by regeneration. Neither is it a common

we are called and saued against our
willes, and we must looke with the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiasts
for violent raptures. I answere,
that there is in our willes a freedome of
nature, whereby it is free from compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
For, that the will should bee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
it implieth a contradiction: for then
it should both will and nill the same
thing at one time. Notwithstanding this
freedome of the will, vntill it bee freed
by grace, is a voluntary service of sinne;
voluntarily and with greedinesse, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
that which is evill, although it can
will nothing else. But the preventing
grace of God, whereby we are called; is
perswasiue, and not ordinarily by the
Word; drawing vs indeede, and so of
vnwilling making vs willing, but this is
by perswasion, and not by compulsion.
For although our willes in the first act
of our conversion bee meerely passiue,
and none can come to Christ vnlesse the

            <p>Now we are to intreate of the liberty
which we haue both in our iustification,<note place="margin">Iustification and sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not to be confounded.</note>
and also in our sanctification. For how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
these graces doe alwaies so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre,
as that whosoeuer hath the one,
hath the other; and whosoeuer hath not
both, hath neither; yet are wee carefully
to distinguish them. For the Papists in
not distinguishing them, confound the
Law and the Gospell, abolish the maine
benefit of Christ, which in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
goeth vnder the name of iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and with it the liberty which wee
haue by it; and lastly, by their Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
doctrine teach men to place the
matter of their iustification, and the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of salvation in themselues. For they
doe teach, that a man is iustified, when
he is made righteous by righteousnesse
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:2369:30"/>
inherent in himselfe, and performed by
himselfe, and accordingly make two de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of iustification: The one, which
they call the first iustification, when a
man of a sinner is made iust, by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
of faith, hope, and charity; the
other, which they call the second iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
when a man of a iust man is
made more iust by bringing forth good
workes. So that according to their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
the righteousnesse of the first iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification,
is habituall and inherent in
themselues; of the second, actuall, and
performed by themselues. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
iustification standeth on two parts,
<hi>viz.</hi> remission of sinne, and the making,
or, as the<note n="c" place="margin">Rom. 5. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of vs righteous; as they teach, that
we are made righteous, not by imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but by infusion of righteousnesse:
so they teach, that remission of sinne is
the deletion of sinne, and that sinnes are
then pardoned, when by infusion of the
contrary graces they are expelled. Even
as water is then said to bee warmed,
when by the accession of heate the cold
is expelled. Againe, where the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:2369:31"/>
saith,<note n="c" place="margin">Rom. 3. 14.</note> that we are iustified by grace,
that is, by the meere favour of God in
Christ, by faith without workes, by the
righteousnesse of God, which without
the law is manifested in the Gospell;
they by grace vnderstand the graces of
God in vs, which they say concurre
with faith vnto iustification; by righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,
not the righteousnesse of
Christ apprehended by faith, but a
righteousnesse from Christ infused into
vs, &amp;c. Which doctrines, being vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
of sanctification, are for the most
part true. For we doe not deny, but that
the matter of our sanctification is inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
in vs, and performed by vs; and that
it is partly habituall, and partly actuall;
that it consisteth in our dying vnto sin,
which is called mortification, and liuing
vnto righteousnesse, which is called vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vification:
that there be degrees thereof,
according to the measure of grace re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived:
that wee are sanctified by the
grace, or rather graces of God in vs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
that thereunto not faith alone, but hope
and charity, &amp; other both inward gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and outward obedience doe concur,
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:2369:31"/>But if the iustification which the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
teach, be nothing else but sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;
what then is become of that,
which in the Scriptures goeth vnder the
name of iustification, and is the maine
benefit of the Messias, whereby wee are
not only freed from the guilt of sinne,
which bound vs over to death and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;
but also are in Christ accepted
as righteous, and made heires of eternall
life; by which wee are freed from the
feare of damnation, and are entitled vnto
the kingdome of heauen? Surely by the
Popish doctrine it is in a manner aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,
and with it the liberty which wee
haue by it, which is no lesse then our
deliverance from hell, and our title to
the kingdome of heauen, which if wee
haue not by Christ, we haue no salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by him. For it is certaine, that
whereby we are iustified, thereby wee
are saved.</p>
            <p>This most pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ious and Antichristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
errour they seeke to justify by the
like notation of the Latine words. For
as to be sanctified, is to be made holy,
by holinesse wrought in vs; so to be iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:2369:32"/>
in their conceit, is to bee made
iust, by righteousnesse wrought in vs.</p>
            <p>Wherevnto I answere, that if the
Latine notation were to bee respected,
it would not hinder our cause. For, wee
doe freely confesse, that whom the Lord
iustifieth, he maketh iust. But then the
question is, whether by imputation, or
by infusion. By imputation, we say, as
he iustifieth; by infusion, not as hee iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifieth,
but as he sanctifieth. But the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
word is no farther to be vrged, then
as it is the translation of the Hebrew
word in the old Testament, and of the
Greeke in the new, which signifieth to
iustify. Now it is plaine, that both
the Hebrew <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and the greeke

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, is <hi>verbum forese,</hi> a iudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
word ascribed vnto God, as the
Iudge; to teach vs, when wee thinke
of iustification, to summon our selues
before the iudgement seat of God. And
in this sense it is opposed to condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as in the<note n="d" place="margin">Deut. 25. 1. Prov. 17. 15.</note> iudgements of men, Deut.

then appeareth, both what iustification
is, and wherein it differeth from sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.
For the contrary to sanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
is polluting; but the contrary to iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying,
is condemning. Wherefore as
sanctifying being the contrary to pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luting,
doth signify making holy; so iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying
being the contrary to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning,
doth signifie absoluing, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitting,
pronouncing iust. And in this
sense evermore, in the question of iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
it is vsed when it is ascribed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God. Neither are the Papists able to
produce any one testimony, where iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification
being ascribed to God, (as
<note n="f" place="margin">Rom. 3. 26. &amp; 8. 33.</note> It is God that doth iustify) doth sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify
making righteous by infusion. This
then is the first note of difference, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
others may be added. For in iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
as I said before, we haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with Christ, in respect of his
merits imputed vnto vs, to free vs from
the guilt of sinne, and feare of damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and to entitle vs to the kingdome of
heauen. In sanctification we haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:2369:33"/>
with Christ in respect of his
graces, which being in him without
measure, are by his spirit deriued to vs
in measure, and communicated by infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
to free vs from the corruption and
dominion of sinne, and to prepare and
fit vs for the kingdome of heauen.</p>
            <p>The matter therefore of Iustification,
or that whereby we are absolved, and in
respect whereof, God doth acquit vs
from our sinnes, and accepting vs as iust,
doth so pronounce of vs, is the merits,
righteousnes, and obedience of Christ
our Saviour. For by what we are redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
by that wee haue<note n="g" place="margin">Eph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:2369:34"/>
Christ which hee performed on earth,

vnto vs, but as <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
saith, all transient things are communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated,
<hi>viz.</hi> by imputation? The reason
of wich imputation is this. For as all
men being in <hi>Adam</hi> as the roote of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
originally, are guilty of his sinne,
it being imputed vnto them, because in
him and by him, by reason of their vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with him, all sinned: so the faithfull
being in Christ as their head or roote,
are iustified by his obedience, if being
imputed to them, because in him, and
by him, by reason of our vnion with
him, we fulfilled the Law, and in him,
and by him wee satisfied the iustice of
God. But we are sanctified by the infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Iustification is the very intitling of vs

            <p>The righteousnesse of iustification is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
perfect, (for it is the righteousnesse of
Christ) and therefore of iustification it
selfe there are no degrees, though of the

to the measure of faith. The
righteousnesse of our sanctification,
which is inherent, is vnperfect in this

there are degrees, as wee grow in

            <p>Wee are both iustified and sanctified <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/>
by faith, but in divers respects. We are
iustified by faith, because by it wee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
the righteousnesse of Christ, &amp;
therefore are iustified by it, not formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as it is a power or habit in vs, or as
it is a part of inherent righteousnesse, but
relatiuely in respect of the obiect which
it doth apprehend; and by it alone wee
are iustified, because it is the only grace
in vs, which apprehendeth the merits of
Christ to iustification. Wee are sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by faith, as a chiefe part of our

            <p>These things thus premised,<note place="margin">§. 10</note> let vs
consider what that liberty is,<note place="margin">The liberty of iustification.</note> which we

the strength of sinne, though in different
respects, which will bee so many more

things, the guilt thereof, and the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.
In iustification wee are freed

temporall as eternall: for it is absurd to
imagine with the Papists, that Christ ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
freed vs from the eternall punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
hath not freed vs from the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:2369:38"/>
By temporall, we meane the euils
both of this life, whether corporall or
spirituall (which are innumerable) and
also in the end of this life, <hi>viz.</hi> an euill
death. Against both these it will be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected,
and first against the former; that
notwithstanding their iustification, the
faithfull are as subiect to afflictions and
calamities of this life as others, and
therefore to punishment. But I deny
that consequence, if you speake of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments
properly, which be the curses
of the law afflicted vpon men by way of
vengeance, to satisfie the iustice of God.
* For the Lord hath imposed the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of all our sinnes vpon Christ; who
hath fully satisfied the justice of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for them. And therefore as there is
no condermnation, so no punishment
(properly vnderstood) to them that are
in Christ Iesus. Neither can it stand
with the iustice of God (who is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
mercifull, but also<note n="g" place="margin">Rom. 3. 25. 26.</note> iust in iustifying
of vs) to exact a punishment of the
faithfull for the satisfying of his iustice,<note place="margin">1. Iohn. 1. 9.</note>
for whom Christ hath already fully sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
his iustice by bearing the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:2369:38"/>
this were to punish the same sinnes
twice, once in Christ, and againe in vs.
Indeed the faithfull are subiect to cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
and afflictions: but all the afflictions
of the godly are either trials for their
good, or such iudgements as are simply
fatherly chastisements proceeding from
loue, and meerely respecting the good
of the party chastised, whereof the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle

at the house of God. For the Lord
many times correcteth those sinnes in
the Godly, both for his owne honour,
and their good, which he seemeth to
passe by in the wicked. Of this kinde
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:2369:39"/>
we haue an example in <hi>Dauid,</hi> to whom
the Lord vpon his submission forgaue
his greeuous sinnes of murther and adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie,
notwithstanding both for <hi>Dauids</hi>
chastisement, and for the example of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
but chiefly for the maintenance
of his owne glory (which by the scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
offences of Gods children, is by the
wicked blasphemed, as though such sins
were the fruits of the religion and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
of God,) he would not suffer the
child begotten in adulterie to liue.
Why? because by that sinne <hi>Dauid</hi> had
<note n="l" place="margin">2. Sam. 12. 14.</note> caused the enemies of the Lord to blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme.
The vse which we are to make
hereof, is not with the Papists, to teach
men to make satisfaction to God for
their sinnes, as though Christ had not
fully satisfied for them already: but to
teach men, both to beware that they
doe not commit sinne, especially scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
sinnes; because thereby they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please
and dishonor God their mercifull
Father, prouoking him to powre his
iudgements vpon them, for their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment,
that they be not condemned
with the world, and for the maintenance
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:2369:39"/>
of his owne honor: and also that hauing
sinned, we doe<note n="m" place="margin">A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

we may not be iudged of the Lord.</p>
            <p>Against the second it is also obiected,
that notwithstanding their iustification,
the godly die as well as the wicked. I
answere, that as of all afflictions, so also
of death, the nature is changed in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the faithfull; to whom death it
selfe, though brought in by the malice
of the diuell, is not a curse or punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
properly. I doe not denie, but that
many times in respect of the time and
manner of death, the godly iudged and
chastised, the Lord in mercy killing
their bodies, that hee many<note n="o" place="margin">1. Cor. 11. 30. 32.</note> saue their
soules; but from the evill of death they
are wholly freed, for to them it is the
end of sinne, and is therefore inflicted
vpon vs, that sinne might dy with vs, as
<hi>Methodius</hi>

curse, but also a blessing, no losse, but an

yet we speake but of the immunities of

remaineth to be spoken of; that is, free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
from subiection to damnation, to
everlasting death, to the eternall wrath
of God, which is the most miserable
bondage and subiection of all those,
who are not iustified by faith in

hath freed the faithfull. For this

            <p>And thus wee haue heard of two im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities,
which wee haue in our iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation:
that wee are freed from the guilt
of sinne, and from the curse of the Law
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:2369:40"/>
whereto our sinne had made vs subiect.
And from hence ariseth vnspeakeable
peace and liberty to the distressed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
terrified with the guilt of sinne,
the curse of the Law, and feare of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;
when it receiuing Christ by

For it is sure and certaine, that without
righteousnesse, and such a righteousnes,

            <p>Now, this righteousnesse must either
be inherent in our selues, which is the
righteousnesse that the Law requireth
vnto iustification; or being performed
by another, (which is Christ) for vs,
must be imputed vnto vs: and that is the
righteousnes which the Gospell pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth
vnto iustification.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:2369:41"/>A third righteousnes, whereby wee
should be iustified, cannot be named. If
therefore wee bee not partakers of
Christs righteousnes apprehended by

the Law; which is, either to performe

to be iustified. But if Christs righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes

doctrine of the Gospell, the chiefe arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of our religion, the charter of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance,
the assurance which wee haue
of salvation: which wee are so to hold,
as that if an<note n="f" place="margin">Galath. 1. 8. 9</note> Angell from heauen should
teach vs another Gospell, or propound
vnto vs another way of iustification, (as
namely by inherent righteousnesse, and
our owne obedience) wee ought to hold
him accursed, and our selues also, if wee
yeeld to him. For whosoeuer looke to
be iustified by the obedience which the
Law prescribeth, they<note n="g" place="margin">Galath. 5. 4.</note> are separated
from Christ, and fallen from grace.</p>
            <p>Wee doe not deny, but that the
Gospell teacheth repentance as well as
faith; and commendeth the duties of san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification,
as well as it promiseth iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.
Yea, as it promiseth the grace
of justification to those that beleeue; so
to them that are iustified and redeemed,
it promiseth the<note n="h" place="margin">Luk. 1. 74. Ier. 31. 33. 34.</note> grace of sanctification
by the spirit, whereby they are inabled
in some measure to worship God in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:2369:43"/>
and righteousnesse. Wee doe also
confesse, that a greater measure of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and obedience is required of the
faithfull vnder the Gospell, then was
vnder the Law; because to whom more
is given, of them more is required, and
the greater benefit requireth the greater
duties of thankfulnesse. But when the
question is of the matter of our iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
and merit of our salvation,
whereby wee being sinners and lost in
our selues, should bee iustified before
God, and entituled vnto the kingdome
of heauen; what that is, whereby we are
absolued from our sinnes, and accepted
as righteous, and as heires of eternall

iudgement before God, and which wee
may trust vnto, when we appeare before

whole matter of iustification, and merit
of salvation in the righteousnesse and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
of Christ alone; by whose
blood, as the Apostle<note n="k" place="margin">R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>. 5. 9. 18. 19.</note> speaketh, and by
whose obedience, wee are iustified. As
for that righteousnesse which is inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
in our selues, though infused of
God, and that obedience which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by our selues, though proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

in the question of iustification,<note n="l" place="margin">Philip. 3. 8. 9.</note> to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme
it as drosse and dung, yea as losse,
that we may gaine Christ, and may bee
found in him, not hauing our own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,
which is prescribed in the law,
but that which is through the law of
Christ, the righteousnesse which is of
God through faith.</p>
            <p>This therefore is the liberty which
we haue by the grace of iustification,
that we are freed from that miserable
bondage of the law, which exacteth an
obedience and righteousnesse inherent
vnto iustification, which no man is able
to performe, and therefore holdeth men

notable priviledges.</p>
            <p>First that we are not only freed from
the guilt of sinne, but also are accepted
pronounced iust, &amp; by imputation of
Christs, both<note n="n" place="margin">Rom. 5. 9. 19.</note> passiue and actiue obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

by our iustification we are not only
made not guiltie, but also stand righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
before God, and that, by the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
of Christ.</p>
            <p>Secondly, what we are not only fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the curse of the law, but also are
made pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

will best appeare in the particulars: for
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:2369:45"/>
the faithfull are not onely freed from the
euils of this life, whether corporall or
spirituall, as they be curses; but they are
all turned into blessings vnto them. For
this is the priviledge of the faithfull, that
the Lord causeth all things, whether
good or bad,<note n="r" place="margin">Rom. 8. 28.</note> 
               <hi>To worke together for the
good of those that doe loue him.</hi> In which
sense <hi>Dauid</hi> saith,<note n="s" place="margin">Psal. 1. 3.</note> that <hi>all things succeede

               <hi>blessed,
whom the Lord doth chastise and teach in
his law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe, corporall death is not only no
losse to the faithfull; but also an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage;
because in it they change a sinfull
and mortall life, for a life blessed and
immortall. It is not only no curse, but
also a blessing: for it is not only the end
of sinne and miserie, but the beginning
of perfect and everlasting happinesse;
wherevpon the holy Ghost<note n="*" place="margin">Apec. 14. 13</note> pronounc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

            <p>Neither are the faithfull only freed

put in assurance of euerlasting life, being

happinesse that can be enioyed in this
life.</p>
            <p>Thirdly we are not only freed from
the sentence of the law, exacting of vs
perfect obedience vnto iustification, but
we haue also liberty to plead the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
propounded in the couenant of
grace; and to appeale from the sentence
of the law, to the promise of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell;

            <p>4 With the hope of salvation, which
is<note n="d" place="margin">Rom. 8. 23. Tit. 2. 13.</note> a companion of iustifying faith, &amp; a
consequent of iustification, whereby we
liue in expectation of euerlasting happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>

which <hi>Peter</hi> calleth ioy vnspeakable and
glorious. For the Apostle denying that
the liberty of Christians doth cheifly
stand in<note n="f" place="margin">Rom. 14. 17.</note> meat and drinke, and in the
free vse of outward things; sheweth also
wherein it principally doth consist. For
<hi>the kingdom of God</hi> (saith he) <hi>is not meat
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:2369:46"/>
and drinke but righteousnesse,</hi> which is
the priuiledge of iustification it selfe, <hi>and
peace and ioy in the holy Ghost,</hi> which are
consequents of the former.</p>
            <p>Lastly,<note n="g" place="margin">Iohm 8 35.</note> with perseuerance. For as the
Sonne abideth in the house for euer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<note n="h" place="margin">1. Pet. 1. 5. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> safely kept by the power of God
through faith vnto saluation. For if
<note n="i" place="margin">Rom. 8. 17.</note> sonnes, then heires, heires of God, and
coheires with Christ, &amp;c,</p>
            <p>Now I come to the liberty which
we haue in our sanctification,<note place="margin">§. 14</note> and so
farre forth as we are sanctified.<note place="margin">The liberty of sanctification. 1. From the do<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>minion of sin.</note> Now
our sanctification in this life being but
in part, so is this liberty: which, as it is
an immunity, is also a freedom from the
bondage of sinne, and of the law; though
in other respects, then those that haue
beene mentioned in the liberty of iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
            <p>For, in iustification we are freed from
the guilt of sinne, in sanctification, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the corruption of sinne. But here we are
to consider, how farre forth we are set
free therefrom. For the Hypocritall Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
teach, that when a man is regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated,
or as they also speake, iustified, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:2369:47"/>
sinne is so abolished, as that it
doth not only not raigne, but not so
much as remaine or liue in the partie
sanctified. By which doctrine they teach
men to bee desperate hypocrites, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
searing their conscience, that they
may haue no sense of sinne, and may
please themselues with this conceit, that
they haue no sinne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in which respect the
saying of <hi>Peter</hi>
               <note n="k" place="margin">2. Pet. 2. 19.</note> is verified of them, that
whiles they promise liberty to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
and others, they are indeed ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
of corruption: or if they haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
sense of sinne dwelling in them, they
must perswade themselues they are not
sanctified, nor iustified, and therefore
not to be saued: such miserable comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
they are of poore sinners, as to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
them that they haue not remission
of sinne, vntill sinne be quite abolished
in them. But this doctrine they teach
contrary to the euident testimonies of
Scripture, contrary to the perpetuall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of the faithfull, contrary to the
light of their owne conscience; that they
might thereby vphold their Antichristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
doctrine of iustification by inherent
righteousnesse, and of the merit of good
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:2369:47"/>
workes, which otherwise would fall to
the ground. For, if in respect of originall
sinne, remaining and dwelling in vs, we
be in our selues sinners: how can we be
iustified by inherent righteousnesse?
If our best actions be stained with the
flesh, and our righteousnesse<note n="l" place="margin">Esay. 64. 6.</note> be like pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted
clouts; how should they merit e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
life?</p>
            <p>We are therfore to hold, that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation
we are freed from the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of sinne; not wholly, and at once,
but in part, and by degrees; that sinne
(though mortified in part, and we freed
from the tyrannie of it, that it raigne no
more with full swinge and authority in
vs) still remaineth and dwelleth in vs,
hindering vs from good, provoking vs
vnto euill, defiling and cotaminating our
best actions, neuer suffering vs with the
full consent of<note n="m" place="margin">Galath. 5. 17.</note> will, to performe or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
that which is good. As the Apostle
plainely sheweth by his owne example,
Rom. 7.<note n="n" place="margin">Rom. 7. 14. &amp;c.</note> where the concupiscence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
in him, is not only plainly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
a sinne, but described as a sinne, &amp; as
an <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or a repugnancie to the law of
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:2369:48"/>
God: the sense whereof (though the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
haue no sense of it) made the holy
Apostle crie out,<note n="o" place="margin">Rom. 7. 24.</note> 
               <hi>Miserable man that I
am, who shall deliuer me from this body of
death?</hi> Accursed therefore was the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
of Trent<note n="p" place="margin">Sess. 5.</note> which confessing that
the Apostle calleth it a sinne; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
pronounceth them accursed,
that shall say it is a sinne. But if we say
we haue no sinne, we deceiue our selues,
saith S. <hi>Iohn.</hi>
               <note n="q" place="margin">1. Iohn. 18.</note>, and there is no truth in
vs.</p>
            <p>The freedome therefore which we haue
in our sanctification, which as <hi>Augustine</hi>
saith, is but begun in this life, is not from
the being of sinne in vs altogether and at
once, though we be freed from it, in part
and by degrees, but from the dominion
of it, that wee should no more bee ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of sin, but being freed from sinne,
might become servants of righteousnes,

which though it be a liberty of sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
and appertaining to our new o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience;
yet it dependeth on the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

from the lawes exaction of perfect obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,

So that whereas the law condemneth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very

who covereth their imperfections with
the perfect obedience of Christ, and not

from such weaknesse, as the integrity of
the heart, the vprightnesse of the will

For, first wee are not only freed in part

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:2369:56"/>
of our workes; greater in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
of them as if they were perfect;
but greatest of all in rewarding them.
The consideration whereof, ought to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimate

(as we haue heard) conferred vpon vs

we are to be exhorted to giue

be made sure vnto vs, by leading a godly

nor called, then are we (whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
we are, rich or poore, noble or base,
learned or vnlearned) the most misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
bond-slaues of sinne and Satan; and
being seruants, howsoeuer for a time
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:2369:57"/>
we retaine a place in the house of God,
yet we shall not abide for euer, but when
the time of seperation commeth, we
shall be cast out: whereas contrariwise
being made free by our calling, iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
sanification, as the sons of God, we

            <p>Now followeth the Christian liberty,

            <p>Now, this Christian liberty as it is an

those particulars, which are neither com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded

our conscience is free in respect of these

neither is simple obedience due

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:2369:60"/>
is also an enemy to Christian liberty, not
only in burthening Christians with an
heape of innumerable traditions and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies;
but chiefly, in imposing
them vpon the conscience: teaching,
that the traditions of the Church are
with like<note n="g" place="margin">Conc. Trid. Sess. 4.</note> reuerence, and equall affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

And although many of their cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
be wicked; more, ridiculous;

               </gap> or power, both in
respect of the ordinances of men, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
of the creatures of God. For, being
freed from the ceremoniall, and iudiciall
lawes of God, and therefore not tyed to
any particular or certaine lawes, which
should determine the particulars not
mentioned in the word of God: herevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ariseth a liberty, both to law-giuers,
and those who are subiect to lawes. The
Law-giuers are not restrained to any
particulars, but haue liberty to ordaine
such holsome, either constitutions Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall,
or lawes ciuill, as are not
repugnant to the word of God. Lawes
there must be, to determine the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
not mentioned in the generall law of
God: for they are the very bond of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
societyes, necessary for the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the lawes of God, and for the
maintenance of peace and order among
men. Neither can it be denyed, but that
as the iudiciall law being abollished, it is
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:2369:61"/>
lawfull for Law-giuers to ordaine ciuill
lawes; so likewise the ceremonial law be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
abrogated, to establish lawes Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall.
Only the question is, who must
be these Law-giuers. Surely, not the
Presbyteries of euery parish, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
were in vse in the Primitiue Church,
but Synodes; as appeareth by the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
practice of the Church, both in
the Apostles times, and euer since. Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodes,
I say, either prouinciall, or natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall;
and those assembled, either out of
some nation, or out of some more then
one, which some call <hi>Consilia media,</hi> or
lastly generall. The authority of Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodes
prouinciall and nationall hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
beene of great regard, though
there want a Christian Magistrate to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
and confirme them, being both
assembled and moderated by the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of Metropolitanes and Arch-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops:
but when both nationall Synodes
are assembled, and the Synodall consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions
ratified by the authority of the
Soveraigne, and that according to the
positiue lawes of the land, authorizing
him so to doe; I see not, why men should
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:2369:62"/>
not as well thinke themselues bound to
obserue lawes Ecclesiasticall, as Civill.
For though some make a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
them in this behalfe, because ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
lawes determining particulars be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the second table, cannot bee
violated without breaking the second
table, whereas ecclesiasticall lawes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining
particulars appertaining to
the first table, may bee broken without
transgressing of the first table; yet, who
seeth not the weaknesse of this distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
Seeing the second table is broken by
disobeying the lawfull authority of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors
(which wee ought to obey for
conscience sake) as well by transgressing
the one, as the other. Superiours in the
Church are to be honoured and obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the fifth commandement, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Scriptures<note n="l" place="margin">Heb. 13. 17.</note>, as well as superiours,
in the common-wealth. And if their
constitutions, when they wanted the
concurrence of a Christian Magistrate,
were of force in the Primitiue Church;
then much greater is their validity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
confirmed by the authority of the
Soveraigne, and the Soveraigne autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:2369:62"/>
therevnto by Law.</p>
            <p>The freedome of the subiect is, that
being freed from the yoke of the iudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
and ceremoniall law hee may with a
free conscience obey any other lawes
whether Ecclesiasticall or Civill, which
being not dissonant from the word of
God, are or shall be imposed vpon him.
Which, though it be a plaine and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
truth, yet by some men it is not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served.</p>
            <p>And as touching the vse of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and of all things indifferent, wee
are to know, that the right and domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
we had over the creatures, which
was lost in <hi>Adam,</hi> is restored in Christ,
(for all are yours, saith the Apostle<note n="m" place="margin">1. Cor. 3. 21.</note>, &amp;
you are Christs) and that not onely for
Christians vnder the Gospell, but also
for all the faithfull from the beginning.
For we reade, Gen. 9.<note n="n" place="margin">Gen. 9. 2. 3.</note> that to <hi>Noah,</hi>
who was the heire<note n="o" place="margin">Heb. 11. 7.</note> of the righteousnes,
which is by faith, the graunt was renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and free vse of the creatures permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
Howbeit this freedome was by the
ceremoniall law restrained, not only af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the giuing of the law of <hi>Moses;</hi> but
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:2369:63"/>
also before, a difference being put<note n="p" place="margin">Gen. 7. 2. 9. 4</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
things cleane and vncleane:
which difference by Christ is taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.
For, no<note n="q" place="margin">Rom. 14. 14.</note> creature is vncleane of it
selfe, but every<note n="r" place="margin">1. Tim. 4. 4.</note> creature is good, and
nothing to be refused, but may be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
with thanksgiuing. Yea of all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
things, not forbidden of God,
which commonly are called things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different,
the Apostle affirmeth in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
that<note n="s" place="margin">1. Cor. 6. 12.</note> 
               <hi>all things are lawfull,</hi> and<note n="t" place="margin">Tit. 1. 15.</note> 
               <hi>to
the pure all things are pure.</hi> By this liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
therefore the faithfull are priuiled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
with freedome of conscience, to
vse or forbeare any of the creatures of
God created for our vse, or things indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent,
without opinion of necessity to
bee brought<note n="u" place="margin">1. Cor. 6. 11.</note> vnder the power thereof,

               </gap>, things in our power or
left to our liberty.</p>
            <p>But here for avoiding of error, three
things are from the generall doctrine to
be repeated. First, that this also is a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty<note place="margin">§. 21. Application of the generall doctrine to this particular. 1. That this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so is a liberty of the sons of God.</note>
of the sonnes of God: secondly,
that it is spirituall: and thirdly, that it is
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:2369:63"/>
a true liberty. For as touching the first;
though all things bee pure to the pure;
yet<note n="*" place="margin">Tit. 1. 15.</note> 
               <hi>to them that are vncleane and vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing,
nothing is cleane.</hi> Though to
<note n="*" place="margin">Cor. 6. 12. 1. Tim. 4. 3.</note> the faithfull all these outward things
are lawfull; yet to the wicked and vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers
nothing is lawfull, yea, those
actions, which are materially good as
being commanded of God, as they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from them, are turned into sinne.
Which is spoken, not to this end, to
deriue me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into desperate courses; but to
force them, without farther delaies, to
breake off the course of their sinnes by
speedy and vnfained repentance, and to
sue vnto God for mercy and pardon in
Christ; because this is the only thing
which they may lawfully doe and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
sinne, and which vntill they doe,
they doe nothing else but sinne, and by
sinne hoord vp wrath against the day of
wrath, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. That this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> is a spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all liberty.</note> though this liberty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
outward things; yet it selfe is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
and spirituall, as being a liberty of

and the externall fruits of our consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

the outward vse of our liberty consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth;
the inward liberty notwithstanding
of the conscience before God, remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
entire. <hi>They greatly erre,</hi>

who thinke that their Christian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
is nothing, vnlesse they vse it before
men. But they ought to thinke, that by
their liberty they obtaine no new thing in
the sight of men, but before God; and that
their liberty consisteth as well in abstain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as vsing. If they know, that it is a
thing indifferent before God, whether
they eate flesh or egges, put on red or blacke
apparell: it is enough and more then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.
The conscience is now loose, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the benefit of this liberty doth apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine:
therefore, though hereafter they ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine
from flesh all their life, and alwaies
weare one colour; they are neverthelesse
free. Yea therefore because they are free,
they doe with a free conscience abstaine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. That this al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>so is a true li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</note> as this liberty is spirituall,
so also a true liberty. Now all true and
lawfull liberty of creatures, is limited &amp;
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:2369:64"/>
bounded: the liberty of the Creator a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
being vncircumscribed. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if any arrogate to themselues an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded
liberty, it is a licentiousnesse,
and not a true liberty. As first, in regard
of lawes and commandements of men;
there are bounds set, first to the lawgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
in respect both of the things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
&amp; also of the manner of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding.
For, lawgiuers may not as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
vnto them a liberty to command
what they list, but only such things as
they know, not to bee repugnant to the
law of God. For they must know, that
all their lawes are limited by the law of
God, and themselues vpon paine of
damnation, restrained from command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that which God forbiddeth, and
from forbidding that which God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth.
For by wicked lawes, they
make themselues like <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> who
caused all Israel to sinne. Moreover, they
must be carefull, not only to command
that which is lawfull; but also in civill
lawes, those things which be expedient,
and profitable for the weale publike; &amp;
in lawes Ecclesiasticall, such things as
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:2369:65"/>
tend<note n="b" place="margin">1. Cor. 14. 26. 40.</note> to decency, to order, and edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
Otherwise, though the subiect
may lawfully obey, in such cases; yet
the Lawgiuer offendeth in abusing his

            <p>Againe, in respect of the manner, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours

            <p>Secondly in respect of the creatures

thou shalt passe the bounds of so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety,

               <hi>Brethren you are called to

            </p>
            <p>But here ariseth a doubtfull question,<note place="margin">§. 22. Decision of a doubtfull que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, what is to be done, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we seeme to be in a strait be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Magistrate, and offence to the weake.</note>
the explication whereof is needfull for
these times. For sometimes there seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to be a conflict betweene the law of
loyalty, and the law of charity; as when
that which the Magistrate command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
cannot (as wee thinke) be observed
without the offence or scandall of the
weake, In which case of Antinomy
(which some say is our case) divers
know not which way to turne them,
and others erroneously chuse to diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
the Magistrate, rather then seeme to
offend their weake brethren.</p>
            <p>Consider therefore vprightly what
I shall say, and the Lord giue you vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
mindes, and tractable
hearts, to see and embrace the truth.</p>
            <p>First therefore vnderstand, that wee
are neuer cast into such an exigent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
two sinnes not yet committed;
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:2369:67"/>
but there is an issue from them both
without a third. Suppose therefore, that
in this case there were an Antimony, or
such an opposition betweene the two
lawes of loyalty and charity, as that
the one could not be observed, without
the neglect of the other. In such cases of
Antimony, we are to know, that if wee
obey the superiour law, vnto which we
are more bound, as hauing higher and
more principall ends; the inferiour
<note n="p" place="margin">Mat. 12. 7. Ierem. 7. 22. Luk. 14. 26.</note> (which giueth place vnto it) is not
broken. Now, the supreme end is the
glory of God; then, the common salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Church; then, every mans
owne salvation; then, the salvation of
his neighbour; then, the common out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
good of the Church, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth;
then, our owne; then, our
neighbours. So that publike and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
goods are to bee preferred before
private, and spirituall before corporall,
and the glory of God before all. Well
then, thou saist thou maist not yeeld to
the ceremonies, as namely, the Surplice,
the Crosse, and kneeling at communion;
because these things cannot bee done
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:2369:68"/>
without scandalizing of thy brother.
Suppose it were so, and remember that
I doe but suppose it. But on the other
side, thou refusing the vse of indifferent
things, whereunto thy Christian liberty
extendeth, being enioyned by lawfull
authority, with such conditions as these
are enioyned; I say vnto thee without
supposition, that besides thy disobeying
the lawfull authority of a Christian
Church, and of a Christian Magistrate,
whom thou oughtest to obey even for
conscience sake; thou dost scandalize,
first, thy weake brethren being affected
as thy selfe, who by thine example, for
which thou perhaps thinkest thou hast
good ground, are animated, or, as the
Apostle<note n="q" place="margin">1. Cor. 8. 10.</note> speaketh, edified, without
ground, to contemne<note n="r" place="margin">In this scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall they are deepest, who are of greatest note.</note> the authority of
the Magistrate, and of the Church; and
from that contempt doe many of them
proceed to mislike of the State; &amp; from
mislike, either to separation, or to some
degree of disloyall discontentment. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
those of thine owne disposition,
thou doest offend them who are more
loyally affected; who, if they bee not
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:2369:68"/>
the better grounded in our<note n="s" place="margin">Iud. 20.</note> most holy
faith, doe stumble at your practise, and
begin to stagger in the profession and
practise of religion, when they see men
seeming most zealous in our religion,
&amp; professing, (as they pretend) the cause
of sincerity, vpon no iust cause to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
their ministry, to oppose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
against authority, to maintaine a
faction in the Church, and wilfully (for
any thing that they can see) to persist in
a bad course. And hereupon many take
occasion to rest in outward civility,
without grace, and to mislike all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnesse
in religion for your sakes,
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now here seemeth to be <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>
               <hi>a sca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dall falling two ways;</hi> indeed a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
supposed offence, opposed to a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
scandal, ioyned with disobedience. If
no more could be said, who could doubt
on which side rather to encline? But
to these I adde other respects, that ought
to be regarded more then a supposed sca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall.
The question is not, as many would
seeme to vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it, whether, it being a
thing arbitrary, &amp; meerely left vnto our
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:2369:69"/>
owne choice, either to vse these ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
or to forbeare them, (as it was in
the Apostles question of eating flesh)
whether (I say) we ought to abstaine, if
we vnderstood that a brother would bee
offended at the vse of them, or not: for
then there were no question, but that for
avoiding of scandall, we ought to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine.
But these things are not arbitrary,
in our choice; but imposed by lawfull
authority, and that with such condition,
as that the obseruation of these things
being indifferent in themselues, becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
respectiuely necessary. First in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of authority, which not only for
feare, but also for conscience<note n="t" place="margin">

                  </gap>. 13. 5.</note> sake, wee
are bound to obey in all lawfull things.
This one necessity of obedience is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to excuse me from scandall, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
if I doe my endeauour to preuent it,
as after shall be shewed. Secondly in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the conditions wherewith they
are imposed; as, not to receiue the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
vnlesse we kneele; not to goe on in
our ministery, vnlesse we conforme. For,
care of avoyding scandall respecteth ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary
matters, and not necessary duties
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:2369:69"/>
appertaining to Gods glory, and our sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation:
which we must performe, though
all the world would be offended there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at.
The care of thine owne saluation
must be preferred to the supposed dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of another mans fall: the care of the
Churches saluation, much more, the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of God, most of all. Well then, maist
thou not receiue the Communion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a duty appertaining to thine owne

            <p>
               <hi>Answ</hi> The question is of things indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent.
For though we may &amp; must obey

            <p>
               <hi>Obiect.</hi> But though the things be indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
in themselues, yet their vse may be

            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> That is, when they be imposed
either with opinion of necessity in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,

them, (all which conceits our Church
detesteth, as is manifest by the doctrine,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:2369:71"/>
whereby ceremonies are to be weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:)
or with scandall (I doe not say ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,

            <p>
               <hi>Obiect.</hi> Yea but it is euill to offend my

            <p>I answere, in not yeelding to confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
thou both disobeyest the Mage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,
&amp; offendest thy weak brother too.
So that when thou seemest loath to doe
that which is lawfull and good, for feare
of an imagined euill; thou addest euil to
euill, that is, to disobedience, scandall;
and besides, to the most necessary dutyes
of Gods worship, preferrest the auoyd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a supposed scandall.</p>
            <p>For all this while I speake but by sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.
For here is a supposall of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomie
or opposition of the two lawes of
loyalty and charity, as though the one
could not bee obserued without the
breach of the other; which is not so. For
where the Magistrate enioyneth the vse
of an indifferent thing, whereat it is fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
some will take offence; his duty is,
for preuenting the scandall, to giue some
time of information; that the weake may
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:2369:71"/>
be instructed, as touching the indifferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of the thing, and the sufficiencie of
his authority to command it, and of their
duty in submitting themselues to the
obseruation thereof. It is also the duty
of the Minister, to endeauour to preuent
the scandall, by informing his hearers,
that those things which God hath nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
commanded nor forbidden, are
things indifferent; that no such thing is
vncleane in it selfe; that all such things
are lawfull: and such as wherevnto
Christian liberty doth extend; that in all
lawfull things the Magistrate is to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed;
and therefore that these things
being enioyned, they not only may, in
respect of their Christian liberty, with
free conscience vse them; but also must,
in respect of Gods commandement re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
obedience, yeeld to the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of them. Which course hauing
beene taken (as it hath among vs) if any
will still be offended, it is peeuishnesse
and obstinacy, rather then weaknesse;
and an offence taken, but not given: in
which case, the law of charity it selfe
doth not binde vs: and that, in two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:2369:72"/>
not yet mentioned. The one,
in respect of God; the other, in respect
of his truth. For, I may not offend God,
not to offend my brother. And it is
Gods truth, that Christian liberty pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledgeth
both Christian Lawgiuers
(with such cautions as before haue bin
mentioned) to ordaine such lawes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
outward things, as they shall
iudge expedient: and also the subiects,
without scrupulosity of conscience to
obserue them. Now, it is a principle,
<hi>Satius est nasci scandalum quam deseri
verum: It is better a scandall should arise,
then the truth to be forsaken or betrayed.</hi>
Is our Christian liberty in this point
called into question, whether Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
may command such things, and
whether subiects may obey? We must
maintaine our liberty, though others
would be offended thereat. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
though for a time they yeelded
much to the weaknesse of the Iewes, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and forbearing many things, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void

maintained it, not regarding their
offence. And when as by <hi>Peters</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing

of Christians was called into question;
<note n="y" place="margin">Gal. 2. 11. 12. 13. 14.</note> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> withstood him to his face, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
him before them all, as halting

must they bee content to be vsed, who

               <hi>Obiect.</hi> 1. For first, on the one side, it
is obiected; that seeing Christ hath set vs
free concerning things indifferent, no
man ought to restraine vs; and therefore
the lawes commanding or forbidding
the vse of indifferent things, are against
Christian liberty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:2369:73"/>Wherevnto I answere, first: that
Christian liberty is wholly spirituall,
being a liberty of the conscience and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
man, which may stand with the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
servitude of <hi rend="sup">z</hi> bondslaues, much
more with the subiection and obedience
of free subiects. For though the outward
vse of the liberty be moderated by the
Magistrate, and confined; yet the inward
liberty of the conscience is not impai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
so long as the subiect may obey
with free conscience before God; that
is, so long as the Magistrate seeketh not
to binde the conscience, and to impose
things not commanded of God as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
in themselues, and as matters of
religion before God, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that the liberty of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
is a true, and therefore not an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded
liberty. Now, one of the
boundes and limits which God hath set
it, is, as you haue heard, the law of loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty,
requiring obedience to superiours.
Wherefore a Christian man, though in
respect of the inward man he be free, as
being the sonne of God by adoption in
Christ; yet in respect of the outward
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:2369:73"/>
man, he ought to bee a servant not only
to his<note n="a" place="margin">1. Pet. 2. 13. 16.</note> superiors, in loyalty and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
but also to<note n="b" place="margin">Gal. 5. 13. 1. Cor. 9. 19. &amp;c.</note> all, in benevolence
and charity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obiect.</hi> 2. On the other side, it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected.
1. That for conscience<note n="c" place="margin">Rom. 13. 5.</note> sake we
are to obey the Magistrate; that is, that
we are bound in conscience so to doe;
therefore the lawes and commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Magistrate doe binde the
conscience.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> It followes not, for although
we are bound in conscience, to obey the
lawfull commandements and lawes of
superiours; yet that bond is not in the
particular lawes of men, but in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
commandement of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obiect.</hi> 3. Againe: A thing indifferent
enioyned by the Magistrate, becometh
necessary,<note n="d" place="margin">Rom. 13. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
it is necessary that you bee sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect:
therefore the commandement of
the Magistrate doth binde the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Neither doth this follow. For
it becometh necessary, not by the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
commaundement of man, but
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:2369:74"/>
by the generall commandement of
God. For, notwithstanding the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
of the Magistrate, the thing
commanded remaineth indifferent in it
selfe, and before God; and so to be vsed
with free conscience, without placing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
religion therein; howsoever it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth
necessary so farre forth as by
the generall commandement of God, I
am bound thereto. And this is that
which <hi>Peter</hi>
               <note n="e" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> 2. 16.</note> saith, that wee must obey
Magistrates, <hi>as free,</hi> and yet <hi>as the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants

consciences exempted from humane
power; &amp; yet as servants of God bound
in conscience to obey him in obeying
them, so farre forth as hee doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund
vs to obey them.</p>
            <p>The truth of these answers shall not
only be demonstrated as it were before
your eyes by a syllogisme, wherein is
concluded the bond of conscience, and
necessity of duty in obeying the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements
of men, but also by other
reasons proved.</p>

thou art bound in conscience by
the law of God to obey, so farre
forth as God requireth such com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements
to be obeyed.</p>
               <p>By which argumentation wee may
conceiue, that the distinction of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
vsed in schooles, <hi>viz.</hi> that there is <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessit
as consequentis,</hi> which is simple or

which is not simple, but vpon conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

vnfitly be applied to the necessity of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
imposed by the lawes, either of God,
or man. For Gods commandement im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth
the necessity as it were of the
consequent, (without presupposing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things) requiring simple and abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute

it imposeth onely a necessity of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence,
that is, such a necessity and
no other, as may soundly be concluded
from the law of God, and so farre forth
as it may bee concluded thence. Or to
speake more plainely: in a simple sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
without interpositing any conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or presupposing any anteceden<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
whereupon it is to bee inferred, I may
say, either particularly <hi>this commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God is necessarily, or by necessity
of duty to be obeyed,</hi> or generally, <hi>all Gods
commandements are necessarily to bee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served.</hi>
And this speech is of necessary
truth. But concerning mens commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements,
If I shall say in the generall,
<hi>All the commaundements of men are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
to be observed,</hi> the speech wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
be false and absurd: if in particular, <hi>this
commaundement of the Magistrate is
necessarily to bee observed</hi> this speech
cannot be necessary simply, or by the
necessity of the consequent, or (to speake
more plainely for the explicating of
that phrase) by the necessity of a simpl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
sentence, wherein the consequent (or
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:2369:75"/>
predicat) is both simply and necessarily
affirmed of the antecedent or subiect; it
cannot, I say, bee simply necessary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
(as you heard) the generall is false.
Notwithstanding if you presuppose
these two things: first, that all lawfull
commaundements of Magistrates are by
the commaundement of God necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
to be observed, so farre forth as hee
commaundeth them to be observed: se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
that this particular is a lawfull
commaundement of the Magistrate; vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
these premises you may proue that
speech to be true by necessity of conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
<hi>viz.</hi> that this particular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement
of the Magistrate is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
to be observed, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But some sophister will obiect, that I
might as well conclude thus;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Propos.</hi> All lawfull commaundements
of the Magistrate must necessarily be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ass.</hi> This or that particular is a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
commaundement of the Magistrate:</p>

                  <hi>Concl.</hi> Therefore necessarily to bee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed.</p>
               <p>I answere, that the proposition of this
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:2369:76"/>
syllogisme needeth proofe, as not being
manifest of it selfe. You will say, it may
thus be proued.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Propos.</hi> What is commanded of God,
must necessarily be performed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ass.</hi> Obedience to all law full com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements
of Magistrates is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Concl.</hi> Therefore obedience to all
lawfull commaundements of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates,
is necessarily to be performed.</p>
               <p>But I say againe the assumption of
this syllogisme needeth some explanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
For the Lord would haue difference
put between his owne commandements
and the lawes of men; and therefore
we may not thinke, that he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
all lawes of men simply to be obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
not simply, you must say then, but
so farre forth as he requireth them to be
obeyed.</p>
               <p>By which short discourse wee learne,
that those additions by which I expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the proposition of the syllogisme,
were necessare; and that the bond of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
is not the law of man, but of
God: that we are bound to obey mans
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:2369:76"/>
lawes not simply, but so farre forth as
God requireth. And lastly that this
speech, (<hi>All lawfull commandements of
Magistrates are necessarily to be obeyed</hi>)
is true, not by the necessity of the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,
as an axiome or principle which
is manifest of it selfe; but by the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of consequence, as a conclusion ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested
by discourse.</p>
               <p>Now that the lawes of men doe not
binde the conscience, it may further ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
by these reasons: first, because our
freedome from the lawes iudiciall and
ceremoniall, which in the Scriptures is
extolled for so great a b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nefit, would be
a burthen rather then a benefit, if wee
should in like manner be bound to the
ecclesiasticall and ciuill lawes of men. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
if they did binde the conscience,
there would be no difference betweene
Gods lawes and mans lawes (in respect
of outward actions (and the one sort
would require simple obedience as well
as the other, yea vnlawfull commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
would also binde the conscience.
But it is plaine, that simple obedience is
to be performed onely to the lawes of
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:2369:77"/>
God. To the laws of men we are bound,
not simply, but so farre forth as in obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them, we also obey God, and no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
thas is, as I said, so farre as God
command<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s to obey them. Now,
how farre forth God commandeth vs
to obey the lawes of men, will easily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
by this disti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

command such things as God forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
and forbiddeth such things as hee

are so farre from binding our
consciences, as that we are bound by the

not simply bound, but so farre forth as
God hath commanded vs to obey them;
that is, as<note n="a" place="margin">1. Pet. 2. 16.</note> free (being not simply bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
to those particulars, as necessary in
themselues, but vsing them with free
conscience, as being indifferent, and
therefore such, as wherevnto our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
liberty extendeth,) and yet as ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
of God, thinking our selues so farr
bound to obserue them, <hi>as is necessary
for auoyding of sca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dall or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tempt,</hi> which
God by his law hath forbidden. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt:
for it is necessary, saith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle,
<note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 13. 5. 1 Pet. 2. 13. 16</note> that we should submit our selues
to lawfull authority, not onely for feare
of punishment, but for conscience sake.
For although we be free, as concerning
the inner man; yet in respect of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
man, wee must as the seruants of
God, submit our selues to such superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours,
as God hath set ouer vs, and not
haue our liberty, as a cloake of naughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
Scandall also is to be auoyded.
First, in respect of the superiour, that
by our disobedience wee doe not scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalize
or offend him. Wherein our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
hath giuen vs a notable example,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:2369:78"/>
who, although he were (as he<note n="c" place="margin">Matth 17. 25<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 26 27.</note> saith)
free; yet was content to pay tribute-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
for auoiding of offence. Secondly,
in respect of the subiect; that he stumble
not at the example of our disobedience,
being animated thereby to doe the like.
For whereas some thinke, that we are
not to obey the Magistrates comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
concerning a thing indifferent, if
wee imagine that some weake brother
will be offended thereat; they greatly
mistake the rule of Diuines, who say
these commandements are to be obeyed
for avoyding scandall, and not, that they
are to be disobeyed for auoyding of
scandall. For if this were a sufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to excuse our disobedience, wee
should not neede to obey almost any
commandement of this kinde, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
scarce any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement concerning
things indifferent, wherewith wee may
not imagine some weake &amp; scrupulous
conscience will bee offended. But wee
must thinke our selues more bound, for
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uoyding of contempt and scandall, to
obey a lawfull commandement, then to
disobey, for auoyding a supposed of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:2369:78"/>
That which we are to doe in this
case, is this: If wee feare any will take
offence, we must labour to preuent it,
by informing the party, as before hath
beene said. And hauing so done, wee
must doe our owne duty (whether hee
will be offended or not) in obeying the
lawfull commandement of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,
so farre as it shall be necessary for
auoyding of scandall and contempt.</p>
               <p>Hitherto I haue intreated of the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of grace,<note place="margin">§. 24. The liberty of Glory.</note> both that which is common
to the faithfull in all ages; and also that
which is peculiar to Christians vnder

glory; which is not only a perfect deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance
from sinne, misery, and all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections,
(whereunto because wee

                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:2369:79"/>Thus haue you heard the doctrine of
Christian liberty. Now heare the vse.</p>
               <p>For seeing this liberty is a benefit of
so great excellency in it selfe,<note place="margin">§. 25. The applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or vse.</note> and of such

is, to try and examine our selues by
that which hath beene said, whether wee

If not, (as<note n="p" place="margin">Ioh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>he which committeth sinne,

to acknowledge and feele that miserable
seruitude, wherein wee are, vnder sinne
and Satan (for hee that is not free, and
yet feeleth not his bondage, is drowned
in sinne, euen as he that is ouer head and
eares in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

thereof) that in the sense of our misery
we may not only truly and earnestly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire;
but also carefully vse all meanes to
attaine this liberty, and never be at rest,
vntill we haue obtained it. It is strange
to see what hard services men will vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe,
and what great summes they
will forgoe, to get an earthly freedome;
whiles this spirituall freedome, which
is worth many worlds, will scarcely be
accepted, when men are called and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:2369:80"/>
vnto it. Which sheweth, that men
naturally, are not only servants, but wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
&amp; wilfully continue in servitude.
But you will say, what meanes are wee
to vse? I answere, 1. Diligently and
conscionably to heare the Word, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the meanes. which God hath ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to call you to liberty. 2. To aske,
seeke, knocke by earnest and hearty
prayer vnto God the author of this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
that he would giue you the spirit
of liberty. 3. To turne vnto God vnfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly,
laying hold vpon Christ by faith,
and repenting of your sinnes. <hi>Eris liber,</hi>

is two fold, both which the Apostle
mentioneth, Galath. 5. the one,<note n="*" place="margin">Gal. 5. 1.</note> that
<hi>we stand fast in this liberty, wherewith
Christ Iesus hath made vs free, and not

liberty, because it is mightily assaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:2369:80"/>
by all the enemies of our salvation,
the flesh, the world, the divell. Now,
we are to stand stedfast, both in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Christian liberty, which is the
doctrine of the Gospell, and not suffer
our selues to be allured, or intoxicated,
either with the golden<note n="r" place="margin">Apoc. 17. 4. 18. 3.</note> cup of the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonian
strumpet, the Church of
Rome, which doth not only bereaue
men of Christian liberty, but also draw
them into Antichristian bondage: or
with the Cyrcean cup of the Liberti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
which transformeth Christianisme
into Epicurisme, and the liberty of the
spirit into the liberty of the flesh. And
we are also to be stedfast and resolute in
the practise of Christian liberty: as of
vocation, not to bee entangled againe
with the servitude of sin and Satan, (for,
if hauing professed our selues freed
thereof, we be againe entangled there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,

as not to subiect our selues to

they which are<note n="t" place="margin">Gal. 3. 10.</note> of the workes of the

apprehended by faith; and to hold him

subiect our selues to the dominion<note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 6. 12.</note> of
sinne, or to the terror or rigour of the
law; but without servile feare, willingly
and cheerefully to serue our heavenly
Father, being well assured that hee will
cover our wants, and accept of our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect

in respect of outward things; as not
to suffer our consciences to be bound by
the authority of any creature, inioyning
them as necessary in themselues, and
much lesse to bind our owne conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
as scrupulosluy and superstitiously
putting religion either in the vse or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance
of them. Of the glorious li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
as not to suffer our selues by all
the machinations of the world, the flesh
and the divell, to bee withdrawne from

That is, that we should be carefull,<note place="margin">The abuse of Christian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</note> both
to auoyd the abuse of Christian liberty,

of Christian liberty, in respect of
the creatures of God, &amp; the vse of things
indifferent; when we doe vse them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
regard of our duty, to God, our
neighbour, or our selues.</p>
               <p>The duty which we owe to God, is
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:2369:82"/>
piety; to our neighbour in generall,
charity; and in particular to our superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
obedience and loyalty; to our
selues, sobriety. For these, as I said,
are the bounds of our liberty, which if
we passe in the vse thereof, we abuse it.
The vse of our liberty is contrary to pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety:
First, when we our selues are impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and irreligious. For though the
things in themselues bee cleane, yet the
vse of them is vncleane to them that are
impure. For as<note n="b" place="margin">Titus 1. 15.</note> to the pure, all things
are pure, so to the vncleane nothing is
cleane. Secondly, when the vse of them
is not sanctified vnto vs,<note n="c" place="margin">1. Tim. 4. 5.</note> either by the
Word, as when we make more indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
things, then God in his word hath
made, as drunkennesse, fornication, vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
&amp;c. or when we doe not vse them in
faith and sound perswasion out of the
word of God, which is the charter of
our liberty, that we may lawfully and
with a good conscience vse them (for
though nothing in it selfe be vnclean, yet
to him<note n="d" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </note> that thinketh or doubteth that
it is vncleane, it is so to him; for as the
Apostle, speaking of this particular,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:2369:82"/>
saith, <hi>Whatsoeuer is not of saith, is sinne:)</hi>
or by the dutyes of inuocation. As the
vse of meat and drinke, without either
prayer to God for his blessing in the vse,
or thanksgiuing for the same. Thirdly,
we abuse our liberty irreligiously, when
we vse it to the dishonor of God, or to
the hinderance of his worship and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice,
as in the immoderate and vnseaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
vse of recreations, &amp;c. whereby
men shew themselues to be<note n="e" place="margin">

pleasures more then of God.</p>
               <p>Likewise our vse of the creatures, and
of things indifferent, is against charity,
when we vse them without due regard
of auoyding scandall and offence. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
loyalty, when vsing our liberty
with contempt of lawfull authority, wee
make it a cloake to couer some naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines.
And lastly, against sobriety, when
vnder the pretence of Christian liberty,
the creatures of God, and other things
indifferent, are vsed, either as instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to serue, or as ensignes to display,
our pride or intemperate lusts, as in the
excesse of meat and drinke, recreations,
the vse of the mariage bed, apparell, buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:2369:83"/>
and such like.</p>
               <p>But let vs come to the right vse of our
Christian liberty;<note place="margin">§ 26. The right vse of Christian li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>erty.</note> which is two-fold,
either the sanctification of our liues, or
the pacification of our consciences. As
touching the former: the right vse of
the liberty of sauing grace is, when it is
vsed to the free, voluntary, and cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
worshipp and seruice of God, in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse
and righteousnesse, for<note n="f" place="margin">Luk. 1. 74. 75.</note> that is the
end of our liberty and redemption. The
right vse of Christian liberty in outward
things, is, when it is vsed to a free and
cheerefull seruing, both one of<note n="g" place="margin">Gal. 5. 13.</note> another
in charity, and of the superiour in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
and loialty; that being free<note n="h" place="margin">1. Cor. 9. 19.</note> from
all, we make ourselues servants vnto all,

they be glorious spirits, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
take no scorne to be sent forth into
the<note n="m" place="margin">Heb. 1. 14.</note> ministry and service of our good.</p>
               <p>The right vse of the doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the liberty of glory, is, truly to
beleeue it, and to liue as in expectation
of it; knowing, that he which hath this

at his appearance, will purify himselfe,
as he is pure; that as hee hopes to be like
him, in respect of the liberty of glory, so
hee may in some measure resemble his
gratiousnesse, by the liberty of grace.</p>
               <p>But the cheife vse of this doctrine, is,
to pacifie mens consciences; without
which (vnlesse they sleepe in carnall se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity)
they are so wonderfully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed,
that neither can they liue in peace
nor attempt any thing almost with quiet

things which trouble perplexed consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
this doctrine is a soueraigne reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to cleare and to appease the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
in respect of them all. The first, is
the guilt of sinne, and feare of damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

breathing is knowne to be dead:<note n="z" place="margin">Iam. 2. 26.</note> so
faith with workes is dead. We are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
iustified in this life, and entituled

such as first are sanctified. For as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour

               <p>The second is the conscience of our
manifold wants and imperfections, in
those duties which we doe performe.
For how can a man be perswaded, that
God, to<note n="c" place="margin">Iob. 15. 14. 16. 16.</note> whom no creature being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared

our wants vnto vs, but accepteth of the
truth of our will and desire for the deed,

performance. And therfore a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
may, in respect of this liberty, with
comfort and cheerefulnes performe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
according to the measure of

               <p>Prayer is a simple, vnfaigned, humble
and ardent opening of the heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God wherein we either aske things
needfull for our selues and others, or
giue thanks for benefits receiued: it is
either Publique in the congregation of
the faithfull; or priuate, when wee pray
alone.</p>
               <p>There bee foure chiefe reasons that
ought to induce vs to prayer: first the
commandement of God: Secondly our
sinnes, which driue vs of necessity to
God for life, succour, &amp; helpe; Thirdly,
our weake nature, (being of it selfe
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

strengthen it, as a house pillars to vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
it.</p>
               <p>Lastly the subtilety of the enemy
(who euer attendeth to ouerthrow vs,
euen in those things wee thinke to bee
best done) ought to stirre vs vp vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently
to prayer.</p>
               <p>The excellency of prayer is manifest
by the dignity of the commander and
the admirable effects that follow it.
The commander is God Lord of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
and earth, of our life and death, the
fountaine of all goodnesse: the effects
ther of are such that (prayer proceeding
from a faithfull soule, and squared by
Gods word) will stay, the Sunne to end
our victories, the falling of the raine
from heauen, and at our desire againe,
send downe plenty of it to increase the
fruits of the Earth for our comfort, it
will pierce the heauens for mercy, and
pardon for our sinnes, stay the wrath of
God against vs for the same, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
whatsoeuer good thing is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
for vs in this life, or in the life to

The first, that the consciences of the
faithfull, when the affiance of their iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification
before God is to be sought,
may raise and aduance themselues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
the law, and forger the whole
righteousnesse of the Law.</p>
            <p>For since the law (as we haue already
in another place declared) leaueth no
man righteous, either we are excluded
from all hope of iustification, or wee
must bee loosed from the law, and so
that there bee no regard at all had of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:2369:101"/>
works. For who so thinketh that hee
must bring somewhat, bee it neuer so
little of good works to obtaine righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse;
hee cannot appoint any end or
measure of them, but maketh himselfe
debter to the law. Therefore taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
all mention of the Law, and laying
aside all thinking vpon works, we must
embrace the only mercy of God when
we entreat of iustification, and tur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ing
away our sight from our selues we must
behold Christ alone. For there the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
is not how wee bee righteous, but
how although wee be vnrighteous and
vnworthy, wee bee taken for worthy.
Of which thing if Conscience will at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
any certainety, they must giue no
place to the law. Neither can any man
hereby gather that the Law is superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to the faithfull, whom it doth not
therefore cease to teach, and exhort, &amp;
prick forward to goodnes, although
before the iudgement-seat of God, it
hath no place in their consciences. For
these two things, as they are most di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers,
so must they bee well and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
distinguished of vs. The whole
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:2369:101"/>
life of Christians ought to bee a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
meditation of godlines, because
they are called into sanctification; he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein
standeth the office of the Law, that
by putting them in minde of their duty,
it should stirre them vp to the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
of holinesse, and innocency. But
when consciences are carefull how
they may haue God mercifull, what
they shall answere, and vpon what af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance
they shall stand if they bee called
to his iudgement; there is not to bee
reckoned what the law requireth, but
onely Christ must be set forth for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse,
which passeth all perfection
of the law.</p>
            <p>Vpon this point hangeth almost all<note place="margin">The liberty disputed of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

For that they be found expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitors
which teach, that <hi>Paul</hi> there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth
onely for the liberty of Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
may bee proued by the places
of the arguments. Of which sort these.
That <hi>Christ was made a curse for vs,
that he might redeeme vs from the curse
of the law.</hi> Againe, <hi>stand fast in the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
wherewith Christ hath made you
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:2369:102"/>
free, and bee not againe entangled with
the yoake of bondage. Behold, I Paul say
if yee be circumcized, Christ shall nothing
profit you. And he which is circumcisized
is debtor of the whole law.</hi> Christ is
made idle to you whosoeuer ye be, that
are iustified by the law: ye are fallen
away from grace. Wherein truly is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
some higher thing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the liberty
of Ceremonyes. I grant indeed, that
Paul there intreateth of Ceremonyes,
because hee contendeth with the false
Apostles which went about to bring
againe into the Christian Church the
old shadowes of the law, which were
abolished by the comming of Christ.
But for the discussing of this question,
there werehigher places to be disputed,
in which the whole controuersie stood.
First, because by those Iewish sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes,
the brightnes of the Gospel was
darkened, he sheweth that wee haue in
Christ a full giuing indeed, of all those
things which we shadowed by the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonyes
of <hi>Moses.</hi> Secondly, because
these deceiuers filled the people with a
most naughty opinion, namely, that
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:2369:102"/>
this obedience anailed to deserue the
fauour of God: here he standeth much
vpon this point, that the faithfull should
not thinke that they can by any workes
of the law, much lesse by those little
principles, obtaine righteousnesse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God. And there withall hee tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
that they are by the Crosse of
Christ, free from the damnation of the
law, which otherwise hangeth ouer all
men, that they should with full assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rednes
rest on Christ alone. Which
place properly pertaineth to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
Lastly, hee maintaineth to the
consciences of the faithfull their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that they should not be bound with
any religion, in things not necessary.</p>
            <p>The second part which hangeth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that former part,<note place="margin">The second part of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>an liberty free and by the Law vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constrained obedience.</note> is that consciences
obey the law, not as compelled by the
necessity of the same law, but being free
from the yoake of the law it selfe, of
their owne accord they obey the will of
God. For because they abide in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
terrors, so long as they bee vnder
the dominion of the law, they shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
bee with cheerefull readinesse fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:2369:103"/>
to the obedience of God; vnlesse
they haue first this liberty giuen them.
By an example wee shall both more
briefely, and plainely perceiue what
these things meane. The commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the law is,<note place="margin">

with all our heart, with all our soule, and
with all our strengths.</hi> That this may be
done, our <hi>soule</hi> must bee made voide of
all other sense and thought, our <hi>heart</hi>
must bee cleansed of all desires, all our
strengths must bee gathered vp and
drawne together to this onely pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
            <p>They which haue gone most farre
before other in the way of the Lord, are
yet very farre from this marke: For
though they loue God with their
minde, and with sincere affection of
heart, yet they haue still a great part of
their heart and soule possessed with the
desires of the flesh; by which they are
drawne backe, and stayed from going
forward with hasty course to God.
They doe indeed trauell forward with
great endeauour, but the flesh partly
feebleth their strengths, and partly
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:2369:103"/>
draweth them to it selfe. What shall
they here doe? When they feele that
they doe nothing lesse then performe
the law? They will, they coue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, they
endeauour, but nothing with such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
as ought to bee. If thou looke
vpon the law, they see that whatsoeuer
worke they attempt or purpose, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed.
Neither is there any cause, why
any man should deceiue himselfe with
gathering that the worke is therefore
not altogether <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ection vnlesse
the rigour of it be mitigated. Therefore
his works should fall to nought, which

<hi>that sinne ought not to haue dominion

that they should not giue their members
to bee weapons of wickednesse to sinne, but
should dedicate themselues to God,<note place="margin">Rom. 11. 2. Rom. 6. 12.</note> as they
that are aliue from the dead, and their

not in them, yet there is no cause
why they should feare, and bee discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged,
as though hee had beene alway
displeased with them for the remnants
of sinne, for as much as they are by
grace made free from the law that
their workes should not bee examined

wee are not vnder the Law, let them

For when consciences haue once cast
themselues into the snare they enter
into a long and cumbersome way, from

hee doubt of pleasant wine, afterward
he will not drinke dead wine with good

to thinke it vnlawfull (as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

no light strife, but this is in question;

comprehended all ceremonyes, that

               </gap> which doe thinke that there is no
liberty but that which is vsed before
men, and therefore in vsing it haue no
regard of the weake brethren. In the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:2369:108"/>
first kind, men doe at this day much
offend. There is almost no man
which may by his ability of wealth
bee sumptuous, which delighteth not
in excessiue gorgeousnesse, in furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of banquets, in apparell of body,
in building of houses, which hath not

And all these things are defended vnder

say that they are things indifferent, I

But when they are too greedily coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,

that those things which otherwise

which doe now laugh, which sleepe in

land, whose bankets haue Lute, Harpe,
Taber, and wine? Verily both Iuory,

creatures of God, permitted; yea and
appointed by the prouidence of God
for men to vse. Neither is it any where
forbidden, either to laugh or to bee sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfyed
with meat, or to ioyne new pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions
to their old possessions of their
ancestors, or to bee delighted with mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicall

is true indeed. But when they haue
plenty of things, to wallow in delights,
to glut themselues, to make their wit

               </gap>es,
and alway to gape for new: these things
are most farre from the lawfull vse of
the gifts of God. Therefore let them
take away vnmeasurable desire, let them
take away vnmeasurable wasting, let
them take away vanity and arrogance,
that they may with a pure conscience
purely vse the gifts of God. When the
minde shall bee framed to this sobriety,
they shall haue a rule of the lawfull vse.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:2369:109"/>
On the other side let this moderation

as though their liberty should not
bee sound and safe, vnlesse it had men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witnesses
of it, they doe vndiscreetly
and vnwisely vse it. By which vnseaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
vsing, they many times offend the
weake brethren. You may see at this
day some which thinke that their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:2369:109"/>
cannot stand, vnlesse they take
possession of it by eating flesh on Friday.
I blame not that they eate, but this false
opinion must bee driuen out of their
mindes. For they ought to thinke, that
by their liberty they obtaine no new
thing in the sight of men, but before
God, and that it standeth as well in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staining
as vsing. If they vnderstand,
that it maketh no matter before God,
whether they eate flesh, or eggs, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they weare red, or black garments,
that is enough. The conscience is now
free, to which the benefit of such li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
is due, Therefore although they
doe afterward abstaine all their life
long from flesh, and weare alway but
one colour, yet they are no lesse free.
Yea therefore because they are free,
they do with a free conscience abstaine.
But they doe most hurtfully offend,
because they nothing regard the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of their brethren; which wee ought
so to beare with, that wee rashly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
nothing with offence of them. But
sometime also, it behooueth that our
liberty be set forth before men. And
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:2369:110"/>
this I graunt. But there is a measure
most heedefully to bee kept, that wee
cast not away the care of the weake, of
whom the Lord hath so earnestly giuen
vs charge.</p>
            <p>I will in this place therefore speake
somewhat of offences,<note place="margin">Of offences <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

they are to be taken, which are to

whereupon wee may afterward deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
what place there is for our liberty
amongst men. I like well that common
diuision, which teacheth that there is
of offences one sort giuen, another
taken: for as much as it hath a plaine
testimony of the Scripture, and doth
not vnfitly expresse that which it mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth.

rashnesse, not in order, not in fit place,
whereby the ignorant and weake are
offended, that same may bee called an
offence giuen by thee: because it came
to passe by thy fault that such offence
was stirred vp. And it is alway called
an offence giuen in any thing, the fault
whereof came from the do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>r of the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:2369:110"/>
thing it selfe. It is called an offence ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
when a thing which is otherwise
not euill<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> done, nor out of time, is by
euill will or by some wrongfull mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiousnesse
of mind drawne to occasion
of offence. For in this case was not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
giuen, but these wrongfull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struers
do without cause take one. With
that first kind of offence, none are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended

Wherefore wee shall call the one the
offence of the weake, the other of the
Pharisees: and we shall so temper the

            <p>But whatsoeuer I haue spoken con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
of auoiding offences my mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
is that it bee referred to meane and
different things.<note place="margin">

               </note> For those things that
are necessary to bee done are not to bee
left vndone for feare of any offence.
For as our liberty is to bee submitted
to charity, so charity it selfe likewise
ought to bee vnder the purenesse of
faith. Verily here ought also to bee
had regard of charity, but so far as to
the altars, that is, that for our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
sake wee offend not God. Their
intemperance is not to bee allowed,
which doe nothing but with trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
turmoiling and which had rather
rashly to rend all things then leasurely
to rip them. Neither yet are they to be
harkned to, which when they bee lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders

yet doe feigne that they must
behaue themselues so, that they be none
offence to their neighbours. As though
they doe not in the meane edifie the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:2369:113"/>
consciences of their neighbours to euill
specially whereas they sticke fast in the
same mire without any hope of getting
out. And the pleasant men forsooth,
whether their neighbour bee to bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
with doctrine or example of
life, say that he must be fed with milke,
whom they fill with most euill and poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonous
opinions. <hi>Paul</hi> reported that he
fed the <hi>Corinthians</hi> with drinking of
milke,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 3. 2.</note> but if the Popish Masse had then
been among them, would hee haue sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifized
to haue giuen them the drinke
of milke? No: for milke is not poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
Therefore they lie in saying that
they feed them, whom vnder a show of
flattering allurements they cruelly kill.
But gra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ting that such dissembling for
a time is to bee allowed, how long yet
will they feed their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with milke.
For if they neuer grow bigge that they
may at the least bee able to beare some
light meat, it is certaine that they were
neuer brought vp with milke. There are
two reasons that moue me, why I doe
not now more sharply contend with
them: first because their follies are
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:2369:114"/>
scarcely worthy to bee confuted, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ith
they worthily seeme filthy in the sight
of all men that haue sound wit: second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
because I haue sufficiently done it in
peculiar bookes I will not now doe a
thing already done. Onely let the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s
remember this, that with whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
offences Sathan and the world goe
about to turne vs away from the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
of God, or to stay vs from fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
that which hee appointeth, yet
wee must neuerthelesse goe earnestly
forward, and then, that whatsoeuer
dangers hang vpon it, yet is it not at
our liberty to swarue one haires bredth
from the commandement of the same
God, neither is it lawfull by any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
to attempt any thing but that
which he giueth vs leaue.</p>
            <p>Now therefore sith faithfull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,<note place="margin">The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

hauing receiued such prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue
of liberty as wee haue aboue set
forth, haue by the benefit of Christ ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
this, that they bee not entangled
with any snares of obseruations in those
things in which the Lord willed that
they should bee at liberty: we conclude
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:2369:114"/>
that they are exempt from all power of
men. For it is vnmeete, that either
Christ should loose the thanke of his so
great liberality, or consciences their
profit. Neither ought wee to thinke it
a sleight matter which we see to haue
cost Christ so deare, namely which hee
<hi>valued not with gold or siluer but with
his owne blood:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Pet. 1. 18. Gal. 5. 1. &amp; 4.</note> so that <hi>Paul</hi> sticketh not
to say, <hi>that his death is made voide if we
yeeld our soules into subiection to men.</hi>
For hee trauaileth about nothing else in
certaine Chapters of the Epistle to the
<hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>alathians,</hi> but to shew that Christ is
darkened, or rather destroyed to vs, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
our consciences stand fast in this
liberty which verily they haue lost, if
they may at the will of men bee snared
with the bonds of lawes and ordinances.
But as it is a thing most worthy to bee
knowne, so it needeth a longer and
plainer declaration. For so soone as
any word is spoken of the abrogating
of the ordinance of men, by and by
great troubles are raised vp: partly by
seditious men, partly by slanderers, as
though the whole obedience of men
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:2369:115"/>
were at once taken away and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne.</p>
            <p>Therefore that none of vs may stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
at this stone, first let vs consider
that there are two sorts of gouernment
in man:<note place="margin">Christians are not therefore according to the outward behauiour of their persons priuiledged from subiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the lawes of men, because their cons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>iences are at l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>berty before God.</note> the one spirituall, whereby the
conscience is framed to godlinesse, and
to the worship of God: the other ciuill,
whereby man is trained to the duties of
humanity and ciuility which are to bee
kept among men. They are commonly
by not vnfit names called the Spirituall
and Temporall iurisdiction, whereby is
signified, that the first of the two formes
of gouernment pertaineth to the life of
the soule, and the later is occupied in the
things of this p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>esent life: not onely in
feeding and clothing, but in setting
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>orth of lawes whereby a man may
spend his life among men holily, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
and soberly. For that first kind
hath place in the inward mind, this later
kind ordereth onely the outward beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiours.
The one wee may call the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
Kingdome, the other the ciuill
Kingdome. But these two, as we haue
diuided them, must bee either of them
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:2369:115"/>
alway seuerally considered by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
and when the one is in consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
wee must withdraw and turne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
our minds from the thinking vpon
the other. For there are in man as it
were two worlds, which both diuers
Kings and diuers Lawes may gouerne.
By this putting of difference shall come
to passe, that that which the Gospell
teacheth of the spirituall liberty, wee
shall not wrongfully draw to the ciuill
order, as though Christians were accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the outward gouernment, lesse
subiect to the lawes of men because
their consciences are at liberty before
God: as though they were therefore
exempt from all bondage of the flesh,
because they are free according to the
spirit. Againe, because euen in those
ordinances which seeme to pertaine to
the spirituall Kingdome, there may bee
some error: we must also put difference
betweene these which are to bee taken
for lawfull and agreeable to the Word
of God: and on the other side which
ought not to haue place among the
Godly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Of the Ciuill gouernment as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so

so of the Ecclesiasticall lawes, I omit to

of conscience. Moreouer this increaseth
the difficulty,<note place="margin">

               </gap>eacheth that
the <hi>Magistrate ought to bee obeyed not
onely for feare of punishment but also for
conscience sake.</hi> Whereupon followeth
that consciences are also bound by the
ciuill lawes. If it were so, all should
come to nought which wee both haue
spoken, and shall speake of the spirituall
gouernment. For the loosing of this
knot, fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>st it is good to know what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.
And the definition thereof is
to be fetched from the deriuation of the
word, For as when men doe with mind
and vnderstanding conceiue the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of things, they are thereby said
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>) to know, whereupon is also
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:2369:116"/>
deriued the name of science: Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:
so when they haue a feeling of
the iudgement of God, as a witnesse
ioyned with them, which doth not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
them to hide their sinnes, but that
they bee drawne accused to the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
seat of God, that same feeling is
called conscience. For it is a certaine
meane betweene God and man, because
it suffereth not man to suppresse in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
that which hee knoweth, but pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sueth
him so far till it bringeth him to
guiltinesse.</p>
            <p>This is it which <hi>Paul</hi> meaneth,<note place="margin">Rom. 2. 17.</note> where
hee saith, <hi>that the conscience doth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
witnesse with men,</hi> when their
thoughts doe accuse or acquit them in
the iudgement of God. Therefore this
feeling which presenteth man to the
iudgement of God, is as a keeper ioyned

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:2369:117"/>
of minde, when being perswaded
of the grace of Christ, wee doe without
feare present our selues before God.
And the author of the Epistle to the
<hi>Hebrewes</hi> setteth to haue no more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
of sinne,<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 2.</note> instead of to bee deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
or acquitted that sinne may no
more accuse vs.</p>
            <p>Therefore as worke hath respect to
men,<note place="margin">In what sort the conscience is bound or fiec.</note> so conscience is referred to God, so
that a good conscience is nothing else
but the inward purenesse of the heart.<note place="margin">Tim. 1. 5.</note>
In which sence <hi>Paul</hi> writeth <hi>that Charity
is the fulfilling of the law out of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> pure
conscience and faith not faigned.</hi> After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
also in the same chapter, he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
how much it differeth from vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
saying <hi>that some had suffered
shipwrack from the faith, because they
had forsaken a good conscience.</hi> For in
these words hee signifieth, it is a liuely
affection to worship God, and a sincere
endeauour to liue holily and godlily.
Sometime it extendeth also to men, as
in <hi>Luke,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 24. 16.</note> where the same <hi>Paul</hi> protested,
<hi>that hee endeauored himselfe to walke
with a good conscience toward God and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:2369:117"/>
men.</hi> But this was therefore said, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the fruits of a good conscience,
doe flow and come euen to men. But in
speaking properly, it hath respect to
God onely, as I haue already said.
Hereby it cometh to passe, that the law
is said to bind the Conscience, which
simply bindeth a man without respect
of men; or without hauing any consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of them. As for example: God
commandeth not onely to keepe the
minde chaste, and pure from all lust;
but also forbiddeth all manner of filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of words, and outward wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
whatsoeuer it bee. To the keeping
of this law, my conscience is subiect, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
there liued not one man in the
world. So hee that behaueth himselfe
intemperately, not only sinneth in that
hee giueth an euill example, to the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren:
but also hath his conscience bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
with guiltinesse before God. In things
that are of themselues meane, there is
another consideration. For wee ought
to abstaine from them, if they breede
any offence, but the conscience still be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
free. So <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh of flesh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrate
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:2369:118"/>
secrate to Idols. <hi>If any</hi> (saith he) <hi>mooue
any doubt touch it not for conscience sake.</hi>
I say for conscience, not thine owne but
the others. For a faithful man doth not
sinne which being first warned should
neuerthelesse eate such flesh. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
in respect of his brother it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for him to abstaine as it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
of God.</p>
            <p>I haue deliuered you the freedome

out with Logicall arguments: but they
learne it whose eyes God hath opened,
that they may see light in his light. But
since wee are taught, by faith to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
that whatsoeuer wee haue
neede of, whatsoeuer is wanting in vs;
the same is plentifully in God, and in
our Lord Iesus Christ, namely in
whom the Lord, willed the whole ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of his largenesse to rest; that from
thence wee should all draw, as out of a
most plentifull fountaine: now it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth
that wee seeke in him, and
with prayers craue of him that, which
we haue learned to be in him. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
to know God, to bee the Lord,

vs to pray to him, and not to goe
to him and pray to him; should as little
profit vs, as if a man should neglect a
treasure shewed him buried and digged
in the ground. Therefore the Apostle
to shew that true Faith cannot bee idle
from calling vpon God, hath set this
order:<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 26<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> that as <hi>of the Gospell springeth
Faith, so by it our hearts are framed to
call vpon the name of God.</hi> And this is
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:2369:121"/>
the same thing which hee had a little
before said, that the spirit of Adoption
which sealeth in our hearts the witnesse
of the Gospell, raiseth vp our spirits,
that they dare shew forth their desires
to God, and stirre vp vnspeakable groa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
and crie with confidence <hi>Abba,</hi>
Father: It is meete therefore, that this
last point because it was before but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
spoken of, by the way, and as it were
lightly touched; should now bee more
largely treated of. Wherein I will brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
shew you some particular, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
commodities; which the faithfull
by constant, feruent, and earnest prayer
attaine at the hands of the Almighty.</p>
            <p>This we get by the benefit of prayer,<note place="margin">By prayer we are both en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched with grace and quieted in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresies.</note>
that wee attaine to those riches with are
laid vp for vs with the heauenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
For there is a certaine communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
of men with God whereby they

there is no thing set forth to vs, to bee
looked for at the hand of the Lord
which wee are not commanded to craue
with prayers: for true it is, that by
prayers are digged vp the treasures
which our faith hath looked vpon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
shewed to it by the Gospell of the
Lord. By prayer wee are enriched with
all the graces of the Almighty; and in

               <p>O Lord God, heauenly Father;
when I doe consider how many
wayes, and by how many sorts
of sinnes I haue offended thee night and
day; and doe duely call to minde how
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:2369:125"/>
graciously thou hast kept me this night,
and how many blessings and fauours I
haue receiued of thee without num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber:
I am euen astonished at my great
ingratitude, and doe vtterly condemne
my selfe of highest rebellion against
thee. Many haue been the dayes, weeks,
moneths and yeeres, that thou hast here
afforded mee to liue; and in all the time
of my life hitherunto, thou hast graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
preserued mee, plentifully relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
mee, and continually kept me vnder
thy Fatherly protection, in all my
nights and dayes; and hast beene euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
watchfull ouer mee; that I haue
from time to time, from night to day,
and from day to night, beene euer su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stained
through thy grace, though I
haue sometimes felt thy correcting rod
by some crosses for my sinnes, yet haue
they beene euer easy, in comparison of
my deseruings; and profitable vnto me.
Lord pardon and forgiue mee my sins,
forgiue my manifold offences, wash me
throughly by the blood of Iesus Christ
my Redeemer, and cleanse mee from
all my pollutions, for they are many,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:2369:126"/>
and I am ashamed that euer I gaue way
vnto them. But now Lord, now, though
late, I pray thee to leade mee by thy
Spirit in more obedience; stay me, that
I runne not this day into any vnseemely
or vngodly actions; withhold mine eyes
from vanities; keep vnder the vngodly
affections of my corrupt heart, that
though they may begin to worke sinne
in me, Lord suppresse them before they
come to execution. Disperse Lord, and
dispell all the clouds of ignorance and
errors, that darken mine vnderstanding,
and giue me wisdome rightly to know
thee, and thy Son Christ, and what hee
hath done for my soule; and through
thy grace restraine mee this day from
that thou hast commanded me to shun:
and let mee doe nothing but what may
please thee, then whatsoeuer I shall
thinke, speake or determine, shall bee
to thine owne glory, profitable to my
selfe and others. Preserue mee from the
secret and hidden snares of Satan, who
is restlesse to allure me to sinne, enticing
me to imbrace the vanities of the world,
and to yeeld to the lusts of mine owne
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:2369:126"/>
corrupt nature. But Lord, as I haue by
thy prouidence, past the darkenesse of
this night, and doe now enioy the ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
benefit of the light of this day: so
let mee this day auoid all the workes of
darkenesse; and as the day doth admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
light vnto my corporall eyes, the

my calling; let the light of thy Spirit,
O Lord, shine in my soule, that I may
walke in the light of thy truth in true o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
to the good example of others.
Thou hast allotted mee a calling in this
life; giue me power and wisdom rightly
to performe it: my best endeauours can
little preuaile without thy blessing &amp; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection;
and therfore I humbly pray thee
to prosper whatsoeuer I take in hand
this day. Blesse mine vnderstanding O
Lord, that I may rightly know and bee
able truely and faithfully to performe
what belongeth vnto my place and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.
Blesse the health of my body, the
strength &amp; continuall vse of my limbes
and senses, which of themselues are
weake, and may soone decay without
thy blessing. Increase O Lord, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:2369:127"/>
my faith, grace, wisedome, and
obedience euery day more and more,
that I may euery day more and more
dye vnto sinne, and bee made stronger
&amp; more perfect in righteousnesse. Heale
O Lord, all my corporall and spirituall
infirmities, and dispose my heart, that
I may bee euery day more and more
mindfull, that this my life is short, and
that this day may bee my last day: and
let mee so walke this day, as if it should
bee the last day of this my mortall life;
that I may be assured of the immediate
entrance into that life which is eternall
with Christ my Redeemer. And vntill
that last day shall come, O Lord, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate
thee in the name of Iesus Christ,
that this day and all the rest of my
dayes and nights, may bee prosperous
and blessed vnto mee; the day for the
