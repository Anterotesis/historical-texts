            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>New and Strange News from St. <hi>Christophers,</hi> of a tempestuous Spirit, which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the <hi>Indians</hi> a <hi>Hurry Cano,</hi> which happeneth in many of those Islands of <hi>America,</hi> or the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> as it did in <hi>August</hi> last the 5. 1638.</head>
            <p>GOD, who is every way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite and incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, is pleased sometimes in his just Judgments, to punish or restraine by Terrours and Affrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, most obstinate and rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous sinners: for those that will not lovingly be allured to obey him for his Goodnesse and unspeakable Mercies, will be fearefully infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to abide the rigour of his most
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:11226:3"/>
upright and severe Justice, by which meanes <hi>Hee makes his wayes to be knowne upon Earth, and his saving health amongst all Nations.</hi> And it is to be noted, that where God is least knowne and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, there the Devill hath most power and domination. But hee that drew light out of darknesse, hath often (and can when he wil) draw good out of evill? for through slavery and bondage ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny people and Nations that were Heathens, and barbarous, have beene happily brought to Civility and Christian Liberty. The Great <hi>Alexanders</hi> conquests, those whom hee overcame, learned to build Townes, Cities, and defencible places, to apparell their naked bodies, in their thraldome they found Religion: and whereas in their Freedomes they did use to kill their aged Parents inhumane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to eate them with savadge, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venous,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:11226:3"/>
most greedy Gormandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, by Servitude they learned more reverend Duty; they were taught the Rites aud Lawes of Matrimony: And whereas in their licentious freedome, they bedded with their Mothers, Sisters, Daughters, and Neeces, not spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring any Kindred, Aliance, Propin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, or any degree of blood or consanguinity, they by Servitude learned better life and manners; and also by being conquer'd and overcome, they were taught the use of Armes, the practice of Arts, and the laudable Experience of Tillage and Husbandry. And such as these rude people were in anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent times; even such were the first Inhabitants of this our Island of great <hi>Britaine,</hi> untill such time as more civiller Nations did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, tame, and teach us.</p>
            <p>Yet in the latest Daies of the World all are not civilliz'd; there
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:11226:4"/>
are yet many Heathens, <hi>Indians,</hi> and barbarous Nations unconver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: as for the knowne Examples in <hi>America,</hi> and in divers Islands adjacent, where this <hi>Hurri Cano</hi> is frequent; of which with the manner of the Description of it as followeth.</p>
            <p>From whence the name of it is derived, I know not; but the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> doe call it <hi>Hurri Cano,</hi> or <hi>Hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri Caenae,</hi> or <hi>Cani:</hi> some say that it comes to the same place once in five yeares, but that is uncertaine, for it hath no certaine or set times of either yeares or dayes for the comming of it. It is held by the Natives to be a Spirit, it comes with such an extraordinary vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, with Thunder, Lightning, and impetuous gusts of winde, (as it hath done many times) for it touches not all places there, but sometimes it comes but once, or never in a mans age to one place,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:11226:4"/>
and more often to another, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as it is sway'd or hurried with its owne robustuous motion, or as the influences and force of the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets doe drive it: and the <hi>Indians</hi> are so skilfull, that they doe know two or three or foure dayes before hand of the comming of it, and then they doe make provision to prevent the harme which it may doe unto them, by such meanes as shall be related in the latter end of this Treatise: the <hi>Indians</hi> doe know when it will come, by the markes or signes here mentioned. They doe observe that just so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny daies as it will be before the <hi>Hurri Cano</hi> doth come, so many Circles will bee as it were fringed and gleaming about the Moone: as if it bee but one day before it come, then there will be but one Circle; if two Circles, then it wil be two daies; and so perhaps three or foure Circles, as it did lately
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:11226:5"/>
at Saint <hi>Christophers,</hi> where it came in that fearefull and unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistable fury, on the fifth day of <hi>August</hi> last, 1638. Where, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> had warning of the comming of it, by the knowledge that the <hi>Indians</hi> had by observation of the Moone and the Circles, and that all possible meanes was used for the safeguard of men ships, and goods, yet when it came, the force of it was so great, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued so vehemently the space of foure dayes and nights without intermission, that maugre all the industry that could be, it sunke five Shipps, whereof two were <hi>English,</hi> and three were <hi>Dutch</hi>; and of <hi>Englishmen, Dutchmen,</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi> it did drowne and kill to the number of Seventy and five persons, besides the harme it did to many Houses and goods.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:11226:5"/>Where the <hi>Here</hi> or <hi>Hurri Cano</hi> comes, the Winde doth blow so strong and forcible, that it will puffe men from the ground into the Aire five or sixe foote high, as if they were no more but ragges, clouts, or feathers; and so violent it is, that it leaves not a lease up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any Bough or Tree: and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise it overthroweth many Trees, rending them up by the roots, so that the Inhabitants (when they are warned of the comming of the <hi>Hurri Cano</hi> by the Circles about the Moone) they doe lop off the limbes and great heads off from the Trees, because the violent and outragious Tempest of the tempestuous Windes shall have the lesse force and power to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne them; and especially those Trees which they doe intend to preserve and keepe for bearing of fruite, they doe commonly cut off, and graffe them againe by our English advice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:11226:6"/>The people all of them forsake their Houses, as not daring to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in them for feare that they should be blown down about their eares; at which dangerous times they do creep for safety into holes Caves, pits, Dens and hollow pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the earth, which are either naturall of themselves, or digged and framed by Art or laborious industry of man, which places are <hi>good harbours</hi> and <hi>defences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Hurry-Cano.</hi> They doe likewise tye or make fast <hi>Hamac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koes</hi> or hanging <hi>Cabin</hi> unto <hi>two</hi> Trees that are <hi>lopy'd,</hi> and then the <hi>people</hi> do get into those <hi>Cabins,</hi> &amp; so they do lye downe in them, being hang'd above the ground sixe or seaven <hi>foot,</hi> eyther with strong Ropes or iron chaines; and so they swing two and againe like a Bell when it is rung, when this tempest is; their <hi>Hamackoes</hi> are made either of course linning
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:11226:6"/>
cloath, or of strong stuffe made of twisted threads spun out of the rindes of trees; some who have not these Cabins, do for feare bind themselves with cords, singlely or severally to divers trees, and so they do remaine bound untill the fury of the <hi>Hurry-Cano</hi> is past. And this is the true relation of the nature and quality of it, and also partly of the harmes which it did in the moneth of <hi>August</hi> last past. The Indians do fore-know it by certain circles which appear about the <hi>Moone,</hi> and those Indians that are servants under our English, did give some notice, or else far more hurt had insued; and is when the <hi>Moon</hi> hath divers circles like mists and fogs about it, and of a fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming colour, and by some other signes, the people doe sometimes save themselves and their goods, in making caves or cellers in the ground, or else they loose all.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:11226:7"/>But for a late remarkable proofe of Gods mercy and power, in drawing good out of Evill; I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire the Reader to note that in the year 1609. eight ships were bound from <hi>London</hi> unto <hi>Virginia,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Gates,</hi> and Sir <hi>George Sommers</hi> Knights, were General and Admirall of the Fleete, and Captaine <hi>Newport</hi> was Vice-Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall. The Admirall Ship, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Sir <hi>George Sommers</hi> was, was by a <hi>Hurry-Cano</hi> disperst and sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred from the rest of the Fleete, and with the greatnesse of the storme driven between two rocks at the Iland of <hi>Bermudas,</hi> where his ship stucke fast, and was there lost and split. But hee landed all his men safe, with some of his chiefest goods, where hee found good reliefe of Swine, Fish, and Fowle. But Sir <hi>Thomas Gates</hi> and the other Ships did give Sir <hi>George</hi> with his men to be utterly lost &amp;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:11226:7"/>
cast away, but he made such shift, that with Timber that hee found, and fell'd in the Island, he caused two Ships to be built, with the which he sayled from the <hi>Bermu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daes</hi> to <hi>Virginia,</hi> (after hee had beene tenne Moneths supposed dead) where he was most joyful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly welcomed: and thus out of this great danger (which in mans i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination was evill) God was graciously pleased to make it the happy finding and discovery of that good and fruitfull Island, the Plantation whereof is now so profitable and beneficiall to the English Adventures; and the <hi>Bermudaes,</hi> with some other Islands, are at this time called the <hi>Sommer Islands,</hi> in memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Sir <hi>George Sommers,</hi> who was the first discoverer of them: and thus much shall suffice for the true Report and Description of the <hi>Hurri Cano.</hi>
