            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AN addreſs of this kind, from a Man ſo idle and unuſefull as I am, is at all times unſeaſonable; to a Perſon, whom the Wiſdom o' the King, and the good Fortune o' the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, employ in ſo many great Affairs, as take up your Lordſhips hours. But it can never be more out of time, than now; when your Lordſhip is in ſorrow, for the loſs of your Brother, the late great Earl of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> who mourns not, that knew him? All that knew him, lov'd him, if they lov'd mankind; for, a greater Example of humanity, the World, I believe, has ſeldom found. All honour'd him, that knew him, if they valued Truth and Wiſdom: ſo much good ſence ſell from him, in his common Converſation, that none convers'd with him, but were both Entertain'd and Improv'd, if they were capable of it. And, no doubt, many great Men were the greater for his Acquaintance; and thus, tho' in a private Life, he influenc'd the publick: and the whole Kingdom was the better for him. Some ſurvive themſelves, and their Underſtandings die before 'em. His mind retain'd its wonderfull vigor to the laſt: He was pleaſant to all, when years and pains <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Judge. I cou'd dwell on ſo pleaſing a ſubject, as the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Qualities of this great Nobleman: but ſince, Providence has ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken him from the World, to number up his deſerts and vertues were but to ſet before your Lordſhip your loſſes, and the misfortunes of the Kingdom. Now I am entring on another copious ſubject; what does this Kingdom owe your Lordſhip? you have been in ſeveral Reigns, one of the greateſt Ornaments of <hi>England:</hi> but you have of late been one of its fortunate preſervers: your Lordſhip was an eminent Inſtrument in this Revolution, which has been ſo happy to <hi>England,</hi> and the greateſt part of <hi>Europe.</hi> Had not this change been, almoſt all <hi>Europe</hi> had been overrun by <hi>France; England,</hi> for certain, had loſt its Rights, Liberties, and Religion, and perhaps, been no more a Kingdom, but a Province to <hi>France,</hi> a Vaſſal to Vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals, and for all its Wealth had nothing but a Wafer. What cou'd have ſtop'd that inundation of power, which was rolling on, and ſwelling as it roll'd, delug'd many parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> and threatned all? What cou'd a formidable Fleet and Army, almoſt innumerable, have ask'd of a few divided Counſellors, at <hi>White-hall,</hi> which they durſt have deny'd? And what a glorious figure does <hi>England</hi> now make, in compariſon of what it did ſome years ago? It lay one Reign be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calm'd in Luxury: In another Fetter'd: In this Reign it has not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly freed it ſelf, but humbled <hi>France,</hi> and protected <hi>Germany, Spain,</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> and appears one of the greateſt Powers in Chriſtendom. How much then is owing to your Lordſhip, by whoſe Wiſdom, and Courage, this Revolution was contriv'd and carry'd on; in a Reign, when the leaſt oppoſition to unlimited power, was judg'd an unpardonable Crime? But, I may quit this ſubject, ſince what your Lordſhip has done, will make a noble part of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Hiſtory. In this Play, I ſet Tyranny before the Eyes of the World, and the dreadfull Conſequences of lawleſs and boundleſs power. But ſome wou'd not have the World frightned with ſuch a Figure nor an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of a Government profan'd, which they adore: 'Tis well for 'em, that they worſhip an unknown God. If their Dwellings and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, (if they have any) lay in the reach of a mighty Prince, whoſe Will is Law, I believe, they wou'd be glad if they were ſecur'd from For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Invaſions, by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Seas; and from boundleſs power at home, by <hi>Engliſh</hi> Laws. I have ſuffer'd ſeverely, and therefore may be allow'd to ſpeak. The Favour, or rather Authority, which a mighty Neighbouring Kingdom, had in our Court ſome years ago, got my Inheritance, which, tho' it lay in the Deſarts of <hi>America,</hi> would
<pb facs="tcp:48241:3"/>
have enabled me (if I cou'd have kept it) to have liv'd at my eaſe in theſe beautifull parts o' the World; the loſs of it has made <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> a Deſart to me. No wonder then if I am pleaſed with the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes of our Wiſe and Valiant King, who was born to free and do juſtice to oppreſt mankind: and, I hope, to my ſelf. And now, I doubt not, but your Lordſhip, who has been ſo inſtrumental in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving and eſtabliſhing the Liberties of all <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> will alſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a Poet to enjoy Poetick Liberties. I mean, that leave which has been long granted, of addreſſing to ſuch great Men as your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, for your Favour and Protection<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I need Encouragement from others, becauſe I have none from my ſelf. No Man can have a meaner opinion of me, than I have of my ſelf. I am oppreſt by my ſelf, I will not ſay by my modeſty, for modeſty is a vertue; and modeſty and boaſting are inconſiſtent; my fortune has long languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under an unmanly ſpiritleſs temper of mind, which makes me rather chooſe to ſuffer than give trouble to any: nay, than to ſeek the favour of thoſe, who take a pleaſure in obliging.

            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Cannot blame the World for any unkindneſs I receive from it, I ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom make any court to it. And I have ſo much affected retirement and ſollitude, that a Writing of mine, like an Inſcription on a Wall, at <hi> Belſhazzar</hi>'s Feaſt, comes from an unſeen Scribe. And the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment paſt on <hi> Balſhazzar,</hi> and my Emperor is in ſome meaſure the ſame: <hi> Thou art weigh'd in the balance, and art found too light.</hi> Many ſay, there is more levity in the Character of this Emperor, that ſuits with the dignity of ſo great a Prince, and the gravity of Tragedy. But with what does the Emperor ſport himſelf? with the honour of Women, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune and lives of Men, and the ruin of Nations. And I thought there was ſo much good nature among mankind, that Spectators would have trembled, when they ſaw Kings and Kingdoms, forc'd to yield up their Rights, Religions, Laws, and Gods, to the Luſts and Frenzies of a young fantastical Tyrant, and all the World at the diſpoſal of a mad Man. But to pleaſe, I ſhou'd have ſhewn a more beautifull figure. So I have in <hi> Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerius</hi> and many other Characters in this Play. I have alſo beautified the Emperor's Character, and all parts of the Play, with as much good Senſe and Poetry as are in any of my writings: For I will compare my ſelf only with my ſelf. And few of my contemporaries have pleas'd the World much more than I have done, both in Tragedy and Comedy. But many ſay, the Play
<pb facs="tcp:48241:4"/>
wants Plot; I confeſs, I think it does. I have put little more into the Play, than what I found taken out of Hiſtory. All the Characters and moſt of the Events in the Play, I have taken out of Hiſtory; and I have made as lively Images, of what I found there, as I believe can be done by any Man. This was unknown, it ſeems, to a great part of my Audience, therefore they condemn'd the Character of <hi> Vitellius;</hi> his flattery to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror and courtſhip to the Empreſs: particularly his begging a Sandal of hers, as a reward for his Services, and when he had it, his carrying it in his boſome, and ſometimes kiſſing it. This was a Complement he made to <hi> Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalina,</hi> the belov'd Lewd Wife of the Emperor <hi> Claudius.</hi> By his flattery and addreſſes in the Reigns of three or four bloody Tyrants, he kept himſelf not only ſafe and whole; but raiſed his fortunes to ſuch a heighth, that his Son <hi> Aulus Vitellius,</hi> who had not one good quality, came to be Emperor of <hi> Rome.</hi> I thought moſt Gentlemen had more skill in Hiſtory, Poetry, Courtſhip, and Addreſs to Greatneſs than I perceive they have. But, I will not farther diſpleaſe by contending. I confeſs, I wrote this Play, when I was under great diſorder, not in mind. For I never lov'd much any part of this World, but a Friend, and merit in a Friend or Enemy. I never ſought more than the bare conveniencies of life. But want of health makes life it ſelf an inconvenience. I have for ſome few years been diſorder'd with a Diſtemper, which ſeated it ſelf in my head, threatned me with an Epilep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and frequently took from me not only all ſenſe, but almoſt all ſigns of life, and in my intervals I wrote this Play. Therefore if it have any Wit or Poetry in it, I wonder how they came there. But many of the firſt rank, both for Quality and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, have ſaid they were pleaſed with it, and therefore I value it. Now I will ſay one word in defence of my Morals.</p>
            <p>I cannot but take notice of ſome lines I have read in the Preface to the Poem call'd <hi> King Authur,</hi> where the World is told, that all who have written before the Author of the <hi> Mourning-Bride,</hi> may be aſham'd, ſince for want of a Genius, they have depended on bawdy for their ſucceſs on the Stage. I much commend that Gentleman's deſign of Reforming the Stage from Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenity, Immorality, and Profaneneſs; But I wiſh he had taken more care of his Pen: I mean not in his Poem. I will not quarrel with that, if it gave me cauſe. In my notes on a Play call'd the <hi> Empreſs of Morocco</hi> (I call 'em mine becauſe above three parts of four were written by me) I gave vent to more ill-nature in me than I will do again. But I am ſorry that the Learned Author of <hi> King Authur,</hi> who labours ſo commendably for Vertue and Morality in Plays, ſhould ſet an ill Example, and injure Truth and
<pb facs="tcp:48241:5"/>
the Reputation of his Brethren. Many of my Plays have been very ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and yet clean. <hi> Sir Courtly Nice,</hi> was as fortunate a Comedy, as has been written in this Age; and <hi> Sir Courtly</hi> is as nice and clean in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, as his Diet and Dreſs. And Surly, though he affects ill manners in every thing elſe is not guility of obſcene talk. I have fallen, (I confeſs) in other Plays of mine, into a worſe fault. I have, in my <hi> Jeruſalems,</hi> made too beautifull an Image of an Atheiſt; and Atheiſm appears too reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and lovely. I am ſorry there ſhould be any thing under my hand, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of ſuch a falſe, pernicious, and deteſtable an opinion: Some endeavour to clear me of the guilt, and wou'd perſwade the World they were written by a Noble and Excellent Wit, the late E. of <hi> R</hi>—But they were Printed long before my Lord died; his Lordſhip in his Poem, call'd <hi> the Seſſions of Poets,</hi> charges me not with theft, but my Scenes with dulneſs and want of Wit and Poetry, which he wou'd not have done, if they had been his own. But ſince there is too much Atheiſm in thoſe Plays, I am content they ſhou'd be thought not mine, or not good. I had rather have no Wit, no Being, than employ any part of it againſt him that gave it.</p>

            <l>In Comick humours he takes moſt delight,</l>
            <l>And yet he rants in Tragedy to night;</l>
            <l>And ſtrives to give diverſion for an hour,</l>
            <l>With a young Prince, mad with exceſs of power.</l>
            <l>He had that mighty power you all deſire;</l>
