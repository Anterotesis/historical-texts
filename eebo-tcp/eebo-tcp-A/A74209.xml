            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>The humble Petition of the Lay-Catholiques Recuſants of</hi> England.</head>
            <opener>Sheweth,</opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat the chiefeſt and moſt glorious Attribute of power, being Mercy, the ſafeſt addreſſe thereto muſt be Submiſſion, which makes us in all humility offer unto the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Honourable Aſſembly, the great and heavy burthen under which we grone, and though to Lawe; we humbly ſhall ſubmit, yet ſuch is the weight of ſome that lye upon us, that nothing leſſe then linity can let us live, nor can we any way find our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, but by applying our ſelves unto this High Court, whereas Fathers and ſupreame Judges, you reſide, retaining ſtill full Power to frame, or change, according to the exigency of times, and occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and being prudent and mercifull, can afford us patience, and favour in this ſhort Petition, wherein we ſhall yeeld our ſelves fit Subjects for your mercy, or obedient Submittees to your wills and reſolutions.</p>
            <p>The many penall Lawes in force-againſt your humbleſt Petitioners are to this Honourable Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly knowne, as is the ground on which they firſt were made not out of memory, haveing had their Birth but under Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> when partly extraordinary proceedings from the See of <hi>Rome</hi> againſt her Perſon, and partly the claime our dread Soveraigns Grandmother, wholly devoted to that Religion, layd to the Immediate ſucceſſion of the Crowne. Occaſioned ſeverall deſtractions, and even caſt jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies and ſuſpitions upon all, that in Religion had relation to that See. Whereupon from emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent reaſon of State. And by way of prudent cautions, and preventing future diſobedience (and not to put reſtraint upon the conſcience of the Subject or to puniſh contrariety of opinion or beliefe) theſe Lawes as we conceive were made, and afterward much aggravated and made more heavie to us all, by occaſion of that ever moſt deteſtable plot of thoſe few decayed, turbulent, and deſperately diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented perſons, indeed Profeſſors of the ſame Religion, but quite neglecting and tranſgreſſing, and moſt inhumanely therein forgetting all duty and obligation.</p>
            <p>If thus (Right Noble Gentlemen) theſe Lawes originally were oppropriated to theſe times, and no ſuch reaſon now (we hope) appeares, and ſtil theſe Lawes overwhelmes us, It is either for the perſonal offences of other men, whoſe wicked facts we (are no way guilty of) with all good Chriſtians utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abhorre, or for ſuppoſed errors of our underſtanding and beliefe, which as in it ſelfe (according to all Divines) is an effect immediate of Grace, and therefore not to be enforced: So in its tenents, there is not any thing forbids, invites, or hinders the profeſſors of it, from their due obedience to their Prince, and faithfull preſervation of their Countries liberties. In proſecution of which truth, wee here objure as falſe and moſt erronious, both aſſaſination of Princes, and Faith is not to be kept with all ſorts of people, and do deteſt them both, as moſt oppugnant to humanity, and not to be allowed by any Religion whatſoever. We alſo ſhall and will be ever ready to maintaine and defend with all our power, lives, and fortunes, all our Countries liberties, the Right and Priviledges of the Parliaments, the Subjects lawfull Rights, liberty and propriety, the peace and unity of his Majeſties three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and in all juſt and honourable waies, endeavour the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all that ſeeke to worke the contrary: as dutifull, obedient, and Loyall Subjects are obliged, and as true borne lovers of their Countries good are bound; All which (under favour) as the Lawes now ſtand we no waies are permitted, as having neither freedome, or fortunes of our own, for ſtrictly are our actions, Judgements, and our Tongues tyed up.</p>
            <div type="petition_proper">
               <p>But the approaching ſtorme that ſeemes to threaten her, moves us to take ſhelter under your mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies wings, moſt freely ſpread to comfort all agrieved, where we doe hope for ſhadow and protection. And humbly are Petitioners, that you will be pleaſed to eaſe our ſufferings, by mitigating the rigor of thoſe penall Lawes, that either ruine us and our poſterity, or caſt a thraledome on our Conſciences, ſo as we meekly walking in our forefathers ſteps, aſpiring unto nothing but poſſeſſing our ſelve in peace, as people that ſeeke eaſe, not honours, and that the crime of <hi>Catholiques</hi> before this Horourable Aſſembly now appeares, but onely different waies in ſerving the ſame God you ſerve, the ſame Chriſt which you beleeve (for whoſoever in any other ſort offends, <hi>qui peccaverit ipſe moriatur</hi>) we moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in your prudence and your goodneſſe truſt, in this publique <hi>Jubilee</hi> (when all's intended to be joy and conſolation) we ſhall not be the onely Subject of ſorrow and deſolation, nor that the Lawes made for offenders in one time, ſhould lay upon the innocent in another. And therefore humbly beg, you will caſt your eye upon the Schedule of theſe Lawes annexed and then your mercifull repeale of what your wiſedomes and mercy finde, ſhall give the Conſcience reliefe that is afflicted, and not the minde content that is ambitious, and a thing we thirſt not after.</p>
            </div>
            <closer>And for ſo great a charity your humble Petitioners ſhall ever (as in duty bound) pray for Your continuall proſperity and eternall happineſſe.</closer>
