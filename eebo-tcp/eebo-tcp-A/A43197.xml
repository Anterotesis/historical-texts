            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Our Men immediately ſeized the Bridge, threw into the River their Barricadoes of Stones, Cart-Wheeles, and the like; took a piece of Canon they had, and followed them up the Hill; but their Number being very ſmall, the Rebels rallied, and faced them, but had not the Courage to come down upon them; Our Men came down again to the Bridge, and one Shot more of Canon made the Rebels flye to their upper Line, where they ſtood again. In the mean time my <hi>Lord General</hi> paſſed the Army over the Bridge, and drew up upon the Riſing, which took up ſome time; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we were quite in order, the Rebels advanced upon Us, and to appearance, in very good Order.

<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Epiſcopacy ſpoken against.</hi>
                     </note> the great <hi>Hatred</hi> theſe ſort of Men, have had, and now have againſt <hi>Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy,</hi> as well as <hi>Monarchy.</hi> For as in thoſe late Times, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops were ever an Eye-ſore to the <hi>Scots,</hi> and the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Faction here; and therefore, the <hi>Church of England</hi> in its <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Liturgy, Common-Prayer,</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> was termed <hi>direct Popery,</hi> and could not be entertain'd as any thing elſe; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to throw down this <hi>Rome,</hi> as they called it, deſtroy the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of this Church, and, at the laſt, the Head too, was what was ſuitable to a <hi>Good Conſcience,</hi> and conſiſtent with the <hi>Liberty of the Subject,</hi> and the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> (alias <hi>Presbyterian</hi>) Religion. So now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes Men are ſo bold to call it the like, and will not ſtick to ſay the <hi>King</hi> is a <hi>Papiſt;</hi> and the Profeſſors of this our Religion of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> Romiſh, or Popiſhly affected. Nay, it is publickly aſſerted, That there is not one Biſhop in <hi>England,</hi> who was advanced to their Epiſcopal Dignity by any <hi>Protestant,</hi> but Popiſh Hand. And therefore, ſay they, They muſt needs have a great reliſh of that <hi>Leaven.</hi> And as the <hi>Parliament</hi> in thoſe times, began to throw their Bolts at the Biſhops, and to ſhew their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to that Reverend Apoſtolical Order, and to that Authority, and Honour which is due to them, and their Right of Sitting in that <hi>Auguſt</hi>-Aſſembly; they Vote, That no <hi>Biſhop ſhould have any Vote in</hi> Parliament, <hi>nor any Judicial-power in the</hi> Star-Chamber, <hi>nor be concerned in any Temporal Matters,</hi> &amp;c.

<note place="margin">

                     </note> diſown their Right of Sitting there upon Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital Cauſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They Diſpute their <hi>Right</hi> of Sitting at that time, and at all times of Seſſion; and divers Papers flew about, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the <hi>Right of the Lords Spiritual, to Sit in the Lords Houſe, or Vote in matters Judicial;</hi> and others, <hi>è contra,</hi> were diſperſt abroad, to the vilifying their <hi>Reverence,</hi> and beating down their undoubted <hi>pretenſions.</hi> But the Wiſdom, and Prudence of Our Gracious <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign,</hi> knowing well enough (by ſad Experience) That they were Treading in the ſame Steps with their Old Fathers, who began at the <hi>Church,</hi> in order to the better ſubverting the <hi>State,</hi> put an end to the Seſſion. After which, we have but little News of them; the <hi>Anti-Epiſcopates</hi> or <hi>Presbyters,</hi> holding their Fingers in<pb n="28" facs="tcp:94677:16"/>their Mouths, and ſtanding as mute as Metamorphoſed <hi>Niobes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>SINCE the Mutterers againſt <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> were thus ſilenced, the <hi>Clergy</hi> have been pretty quiet, tho ſometimes we meet with a little Piece or two of <hi>Controverſial Points,</hi> thrown into their <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets,</hi> or ſent to them by the <hi>New found way of Diſpatch;</hi> and that's the moſt they can do now. They would have their Old <hi>Darling</hi> bear ſway, and would be dancing to <hi>Weſtminster,</hi> to the <hi>Aſſembly of Grave Divines;</hi> of which, ſome <hi>Hugh Peters</hi> or <hi>Faringdon</hi> may be Preſident; I ſhould ſay, <hi>Moderator:</hi> But here's the Plague, They have no long <hi>Triennial,</hi> nor meet with ſuch Conceſſions (tho in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, they have had too many very gracious and great ones of late, which have been too much abuſed, as we ſhall take Notice of hereafter) as their Fore-Fathes did; nor have they a <hi>Durante Voluptate Parliament,</hi> elſe you would find they would do glorious Things, for the <hi>Good People of the Land, and the Lord's Cauſe.</hi> In Truth, had theſe great <hi>Antagonists</hi> of the Biſhops, but what they Merit, for either their ſcandalous ſtigmatizing them in private, in their <hi>Converſations,</hi> as well as in <hi>expoſing</hi> them to the World, with their ſpiteful Cenſures, the Puniſhment which their Patrons <hi>Pryn,</hi> and <hi>Burton,</hi> and <hi>Bastwick</hi> Suffered in the late Times, is too great a Favour, and too mild a Reſentment.</p>
                  <p>AND now I muſt haſten to Generals, only I cannot chooſe but take Notice, That theſe Times, or the Men of them, as if they were driven by the pure Dictates of a ſincere <hi>Conſcience;</hi> or elſe that they held it as an Article of their <hi>Faith,</hi> ſhould think, That within <hi>Forty</hi> Years, by a neceſſary Conſequence, the ſame, or like Occurrences muſt needs happen to a Nation; and therefore, if they acted never ſo contrary to <hi>God</hi>'s Word, Nature, nay, Common Honeſty; ſtill it muſt be look't upon, as flowing from the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Cauſe, or thoſe concurrent hidden Cauſes, which uſually attend the Revolutions of States.

                  <p>THAT tho 'tis true, <hi>the Soul</hi> of every Man (as well Prince as Subject) is in the Hand, or at the <hi>Diſpoſe of the Supream Power,</hi> God; and both <hi>Lyable to a Minutes Summons:</hi> yet let me tell you, according to the <hi>Natural Concluſions of Humane Underſtandings,</hi> if we examine how little the <hi>Diſproportion of Age</hi> is betwixt the <hi>King, and the Duke His Brother;</hi> and what <hi>Hopeful Appearances</hi> there are,

A <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> is the <hi>Magnum Anglie Concilium, The Great Council of the Land, called together by the</hi> King, as the proper, and moſt genuine Means for the <hi>Conſulting</hi> or adviſing of, and providing againſt publick Evils (wherein e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very private Man is concerned) and in order to the Adminiſtring neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Remedies. And therefore, to pretend that their <hi>Priviledges</hi> enable them to <hi>Act contrary to what their Head the</hi> King <hi>ſhall propoſe</hi> to them, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Regulating Miſunderſtandings, Compoſing Differences;</hi> and the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing Peace and Order,</hi> is (if it may be ſo ſaid) a <hi>Caſting off that Supream Power,</hi> which gave them thoſe <hi>Priviledges;</hi> and a <hi>Breach of the King's Prerogative.</hi> And if once <hi>Regal Prerdgative</hi> is invaded, the <hi>Regal Power</hi> will be in great Danger. (This we have lately had notorious Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of, and I hope, and pray we may never ſee the like again.)</p>
                  <p>THE laſt Diſſolution of the <hi>Parliament</hi> met at <hi>Oxford,</hi> perhaps doth, and may Amuſe the World exceedingly, and drive them into a profound Admiration: <hi>Unde hoc?</hi> Whence proceeded His Majeſties Diſpleaſure? But the Papers called <hi>Intelligences,</hi> pretended to ſatisfy Us with a great deal, and every <hi>Coffes-Houſe</hi> Whiſper'd out Reaſons, or at leaſt Suſpicions, and Surmiſes upon it. For my part, I do, and ſhall ever continue my Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution in this particular, which I mentioned but a little before, That I think it mine, and every Honeſt Man, and <hi>Loyal Subject's Duty to Acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſce in the Pleaſure of my Prince,</hi> and not to <hi>Cenſure the Authority or Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs</hi> of His Proceedings in the leaſt (I mean, ſo far as my <hi>Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> ſhall give me leave.) I ſhall not therefore any further dilate on this point, but Conclude with the ſaying of a Wife <hi>States-Man,</hi> viz. <hi>Many things</hi> (ſayes He) <hi>in the world reſemble</hi> Smoak; <hi>their</hi> Beginning <hi>is but</hi> ſmall, <hi>their</hi> End great: <hi>And many things reſemble the</hi> Wind, <hi>whoſe Reginning is</hi> Boiſterous, <hi>and End</hi> Weak. <hi>He ſaves himſelf from the</hi> former, <hi>who ſuffers them not to</hi> Increaſe: <hi>from the latter, He who ſuffers them to</hi> Blow over. Progreſs of Time, <hi>may be expected in the One, where the Other ought to be</hi> Smother'd in the Cradle.</p>
                  <p>HAVING thus far run thro Our propoſed Parallel under thoſe <hi>Three</hi> Heads of <hi>Religion, Liberty,</hi> and <hi>Priviledges of Parliament;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſhewn how dangerous they are to a <hi>Common-Wealth,</hi> when miſ-un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, and miſ-applyed. (As GOD knows they have been too much of late here in <hi>England;</hi> the more is the pitty, and Our ſhame) I ſhall therefore in this place look back on the large Conceſſions, and bountiful Condeſcentions of the late <hi>King,</hi> which was ſo much abuſed, and made as ſo many Helps towards the ſubſequent Evils, and Ruine to this poor <hi>Kingdome of England;</hi> and ſee how Our Times have met with the like, and what unſutable Returns have been made to the <hi>Royal Grace and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</hi>

            <head>THE CONCLUSION.</head>
            <p>THUS (<hi>Dear Countrymen</hi>) I have endeavoured to lay before you, a plain and impartial Relation of the preſent Condition and State of Affairs, as they now ſtand in this <hi>Juncture of Time;</hi> and what Meaſures, and Steps we take, to haſten that Ruine which hangs over Our Heads; and which will inevitably fall upon Us, if we do not endeavour with the utmoſt Diligence and Induſtry, <hi>Chriſtian Prudence,</hi> and our Happineſs, and Peace oblige Us to. I have ſhewed you in the <hi>Opening of this Diſcourſe,</hi> what Meaſures our <hi>Fathers</hi> took in the late <hi>Rebellion,</hi> towards that Ruine and Deſtruction, which they brought upon themſelves, and their Poſterity. How furiouſly <hi>Blind Zeal</hi> hurried them upon, and and <hi>Miſtaken Liberty</hi> plunged them in <hi>Blood and Miſery!</hi> How great a ſway <hi>Parliaments</hi> bore (under the Notion of <hi>Priviledge</hi>) amongſt the unruly Multitude, even to the diſowning the <hi>Regal Power;</hi> nay, <hi>Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Our Prince;</hi> and at laſt, to bring Him to the <hi>Block!</hi> I have alſo ſhewed you how little the <hi>Diſſimilitude</hi> is, betwixt our, and their <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings,</hi> and how near we Tread in their Foot-ſteps: I pray <hi>God</hi> divert Us from ſuch like <hi>Practiſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE Read of <hi>Romulus</hi> (that <hi>Famous Founder of Rome</hi>) when the <hi>Sabins</hi> had Waged War againſt Him, and had got by Stratagem into the City, and had poſſeſt themſelves of the <hi>Capitol;</hi> and joyning Battle, had Slain a great Leader and Captain of the <hi>Romans,</hi> named <hi>Hoſtilius;</hi> and by this means had cauſed them to Retreat, and give Back: <hi>Romulus</hi> Born along by them that Fled, made a ſtand at laſt upon the <hi>Palatine-Hill,</hi> and ſeeing the great Succeſs the <hi>Sabines</hi> had, and that now the <hi>Honour of the Romans</hi> was dwindling; He Vows a <hi>Temple to Iupiter,</hi> and there prays to him for <hi>Victory:</hi> But to ſhew, that <hi>Man's Induſtry</hi> was to go along in <hi>Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> with the <hi>Divine Power; Romulus</hi> is not wanting in his own En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, by his perſonal Courage and prudent Conduct, like a Valiant Captain, and brave Leader; and thus at laſt obtained Victory. An Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of a <hi>Heathen:</hi> Alas! for Us <hi>Chriſtians!</hi> 'Tis this alone which can ſave Us, I mean a <hi>Recourſe to the Divine Power,</hi> to implore its om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent Goodneſs, to <hi>Diſpel</hi> thoſe dark Gloomy <hi>Clouds,</hi> which hover over our Heads, and threaten Ruine and Miſery. To do which, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, nay aſſur'd, our <hi>Church</hi> hath no way been backwards, both by Her dayly <hi>Summons and Calls,</hi> and by the Preaching of Her Learned, Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Miniſtry:</hi> The <hi>Church Doors</hi> are alwayes open, and as it were by their <hi>Dumb Signs</hi> invite Us to enter there, and Commune with our <hi>God</hi> by <hi>Prayer,</hi> to intreat His <hi>Removal of His Iudgments</hi> from Us. But A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las! In vain do Men call to <hi>Heaven;</hi> many do <hi>Invoke</hi> it, and yet do <hi>Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> it; they require <hi>help</hi> from <hi>Heaven,</hi> and do <hi>Abandon themſelves;</hi> and by their <hi>Deeds</hi> contrarying their <hi>Words,</hi> they ſhew not to <hi>Deſire</hi> what they have intreated, and to have <hi>Intreated,</hi> that they might not be heard. This is a Truth too palpable, <hi>God</hi> knows, and too notorious among Us now a-dayes!

            <p>AY, but ſay the People, if we are like to have bad Times; and if E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils are like to come upon Us, and Deſolation and Ruine threaten Us, The Fault lyes not at our Doors, nor are our Miſcarriges the occaſion; but it is the Male-Adminiſtration of thoſe at the <hi>Helm,</hi> from whoſe Influences alone we receive or Good, or Detriment, which brings upon Us, thoſe Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs that preſs the Nation. And thus like the <hi>Mileſian Phyloſopher</hi> [<hi>Thales</hi>] who gazing up to behold the <hi>Stars,</hi> and conſider their Aſpects, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting the Way wherein he walked (thro his Intention, or ſerious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation) fell into a Pit or Lake; and there ended his Life, and Speculation together. Would Men but look into themſelves, and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Private Cloſets of their own Hearts; they will there find Work enough, and ſufficient Reaſon for <hi>wondring Contemplation,</hi> when their <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences</hi> ſtand ready to Salute them with <hi>Nathan</hi>'s Parable, <hi>Thou art the Man,</hi> Or 'tis for thy Sins that the Land Mourneth, that the <hi>Angel of God</hi> ſtands with his Sword drawn in his Hand, ready to Cut it off in the midſt it 'its Sins, and leave no place for Reconciliation.</p>
            <p>BUT Alas! Men now a-days are grown to that Degree of Impiety, that they are ready to Murther a Man for telling them the Truth. To be ſure if the Blaſting a Man's <hi>Credit</hi> be a means to Ruine him, they will not ſtick to do that; and tho a near and intimate Friend with all the Mildneſs, and Complacency in the World, indeavour to inſinuate a Senſe of their miſerable, and deplorable Eſtate, by all the methods Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Piety and Charity can ſuggeſt; yet if he touch them too hard upon the Wounded Part, they are apt preſently to throw back his <hi>Admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> in his Face; and with the ungodly Man the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>Tuſh</hi> ſay they, <hi>what? Telleſt thou me of Conſcience, or a Pious Life.</hi> They are good Trades for a <hi>Leaden Spirit</hi> that can ſtand bent to every Frown, and wants the <hi>Brains</hi> to make a higher Fortune, or <hi>Courage</hi> to atcheive that <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> which might Write their Names in the <hi>Chronicles of Fame. Piſh,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>Civil Honesty</hi> is but a fair pretence for him that has no Wit to play the <hi>Knave,</hi> and makes a Man capable of a little higher <hi>Stile</hi> than <hi>Fool.</hi> Come, come, if my Conſcience check me, I'le correct my ſawcy Conſcience, till ſhe ſtand as mute as <hi>Metamorphoſed Niobe,</hi> I'le fear nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Frowns of Princes,</hi> nor the Mighty <hi>Hand</hi> of various <hi>Fortune:</hi> I'le paſs my ſlow-paced Time in Melancholy-Charming <hi>Mirth,</hi> and take the Advantage of my <hi>Youthful Dayes;</hi> I'le Baniſh <hi>Care</hi> to The Dead Sea of <hi>Phlegmatick Old Age.</hi> A <hi>Deep Sigh</hi> ſhall be <hi>High-Treaſon,</hi> and a <hi>Solemn Look</hi> adjudged a <hi>Crime</hi> too great for <hi>Pardon.</hi> And thus they go on in Sinning, having as the <hi>Apostle</hi> ſayes, <hi>Seared their Conſciences with a Hot-Iron.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IF a Pious Miniſter Preaching in the Church, touch them to the quick, by laying open the uglineſs of Sin, and the diſmal Conſequences of it, and the Judgments which will inevitably fall upon Sinners, Reprobate and Obſtinate; and perhaps occaſionally Harangues againſt particular Sins; of which, they are too much inclined, and prone to; They hear Him whilſt they are in the Church ſeemingly with great Attention, tho they are impatient to be Diſmiſt, that they might be at their venting their opprobrious Cenſures of his Perſon and Doctrine; and no ſooner have they reach't their Houſes, but as ſoon as ſat, preſently have at the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> or as they uſually ſtile him Mr. <hi>Doctor,</hi> ſayes One, His <hi>words con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce not at all to Edification, nor are the Motions of his Heart Sanctified. He Adores Great Ones for Preferment, and ſpeaks too partially of Authority. A
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:94677:24"/>ſober Language in his mouth, but the poyſon of Aſpes is under his Tongue.</hi> Ah, cryes a Second, <hi>He feares God for his own ends. He can hear an Oath from his Superiour, without reproving him, and ſad Curſings without Rebuke. He paints Devotion upon his Face, whileſt Pride is ſtampt upon his Heart.</hi> 'Tis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed true, ſayes the Third, <hi>He is quick-ſighted to the Infirmities of the Saints, and in his heart rejoyceth at our failings. His ſtudied Prayers ſhew him to be a high Malignant, and his Jeſu-worſhip concludes him Popiſhly affected. He cryes up Learning, and the Book of Common-Prayer, but ſayes nothing of Reformation. He cringes, and makes an Idol of the Name of Jeſus, and leans wholly to a Church-Government, not honouring a Preaching Miniſtry. He places Sanctity in the Walls of a Steeple-houſe, and adores the Sacrament with a Popiſh-Knee.</hi> Ah! ſighs a Fourth, <hi>Have we not a great deal of reaſon to ſeparate from theſe Men, and turn, and abſent our ſelves from their Congregations; Ah! tis a great Mercy, and Unſpeakable Goodneſs of the Lord, That he hath called us unto Him, to know the Church of God in Truth, and hath given us a Sin-killing, Heart-hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, Soul-convincing, laborious Miniſtry, to teach us the Wayes of Righteouſneſs, and hath ſeparated us from theſe Idolatrous Worſhippers, theſe Sons of</hi> Belial, <hi>and Children of Darkneſs,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thus they aſperſe the <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> and endeavour to draw an Odium upon the <hi>Clergy,</hi> which is the readieſt means to induce men to have a low re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of <hi>Religion</hi> it ſelf; for (as a wiſe Writer of late times ſaid) when once the <hi>Diſpenſers</hi> of Religion fall into Contempt, it muſt be a ſtrong Arm, and more than that of Fleſh, that can bear up <hi>Religion</hi> it ſelf, and keep that from falling too. [I hope, and pray with a Reverend <hi>Prelate</hi> in a late learned Sermon upon this Subject, <hi>That God will not remove our Candleſtick from among us,</hi> as he threatned the Church of <hi>Epheſus;</hi> tho 'tis too much to be feared, our Impenitency, and the diſregard we have of Gods Miniſters, and the Diverſity of Sects and Opinions amongſt us, may be ſufficient enough to occaſion it. What Judgments the Angel denounced againſt thoſe Four Churches in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> Chap. 2. I deſire every Son and Daughter of our Church to conſider; Read the Severals, and I doubt not but you'll ſoon find, how little a Diſproportion there is betwixt Us and Them: Tho I fear the laſt (<hi>viz. Thyatira</hi>) may be too much our lively Image.]</p>
            <p>The ſeveral <hi>Schiſmes, Sects,</hi> and <hi>Diviſions,</hi> which have been broach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, fomented, and continued about <hi>Religion</hi> in this Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> have been (as I ſaid before) the immediate Reaſons, that brought men to have a low regard of Religion it ſelf, and the Cauſes of the great <hi>Decay of Chriſtian Piety</hi> in the Land. We may attribute what we will to the <hi>State,</hi> and ſay what we pleaſe of the Government; when it is the <hi>Immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality and Vice of the Cymes,</hi> which makes the Almighty angry with us, and threaten to cut us off.</p>
            <p>And now <hi>Impiety</hi> &amp; <hi>Irreligion</hi> rides Tryumphant, &amp; <hi>Immorality</hi> ſways its Scepter in the Hearts of men; and therefore, let the <hi>Charmer charm never ſo wiſely,</hi> men lend but <hi>Adders Cares,</hi> and will not regard. And therefore, <hi>Admonitions</hi> are but vain, and <hi>Advice</hi> but Bubbles, <hi>Correption and Rebuke</hi> piſht at, and reckoned but as <hi>Childiſh Flattery,</hi> or <hi>painted Mask;</hi> Nothing can be then expected but ſuch like <hi>Reparties;</hi> which I will take from the to-be-admired

               <hi>Boanerges,</hi> and ſo conclude.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Tell not me of Hell, Devills, or damned Souls, to enforce me from thoſe Pleaſures which they nick-name <hi>Sin.</hi> 'Tis true, I have not led my life ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Phariſaical Square of the Opinions of God's Miniſters, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:94677:25"/>have I found Judgments according to their Prophecies; whereby I muſt conclude, that God is wonderfully merciful, or they wonderfully miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: How often have they thundered Torment againſt my <hi>Voluptuous life?</hi> and yet I feel no pain. How bitterly have they threatned ſhame againſt the Vaunts of the <hi>Vain-glorious?</hi> Yet find they honour. How fiercely have they preach't deſtruction againſt my <hi>Cruelty!</hi> And yet I live. What Plagues againſt my <hi>Swearing?</hi> Yet not infected. What Diſeaſes againſt my <hi>Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs?</hi> And yet ſound. What danger againſt <hi>Procraſtination?</hi> Yet how often hath God been found upon the Death-bead. What Damnation to <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites?</hi> Yet who more ſafe? What Stripes to the <hi>Ignorant?</hi> Yet who more Scot-free? What Poverty to the <hi>Sloathful?</hi> Yet they proſper. What Falls to the <hi>Proud?</hi> Yet ſtand they ſureſt.

What Vengeance to the <hi>Prophane,</hi> the <hi>Cenſorious,</hi> the <hi>Revengeful?</hi> Yet none live more unſcourged. Who deeper Branded than the <hi>Lyar?</hi> Yet who more Favoured? Who more threatned than the <hi>Preſumptuous?</hi> Yet who leſs puniſh'd?</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus they run thro a Catalogue of the ſeveral Kinds of Enormous Sins, which are moſt predominant in our depraved Natures, and believe not what the Church doth pronounce on each of them, but as <hi>Bugbeares;</hi> and therefore, ſay they, thus we are fool'd, and kept in awe by the ſtrict fancies of theſe <hi>Pulpit-men,</hi> whoſe Opinions have no Ground, but what they gain from <hi>Popularity.</hi> But let theſe bold bluſtring Sinners but read the fifth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Iſaiahs</hi> Prophecy, and there they will find the miſerable <hi>Woes</hi> entai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led on the Wicked; as likewiſe, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4. <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 34.</p>
            <p>Perhaps, I have played the Divine too long, and have tired you with theſe ſad Reflections; I ſhall therefore enlarge no further, but only add one word by way of Admonition, and conclude. Let not, <hi>O England,</hi> an impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident Careleſneſs caſt out all Fear of approaching Danger. Haſt thou not for theſe many years nuzzled in the Boſome of Habitual Peace, when thy Neighbours were in the Flames of War. Be not deceived, a long Peace makes a Bloody War, and the Abuſe of continued Mercies makes a ſharp Judgment. The ſtalled Oxe that wallows in his plenty, and waxes wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton in his Eaſe, is not far from ſlaughter. Didſt thou not laugh <hi>Invaſion</hi> to ſcorn, and was not affrighted at Conſpiracies. Didſt thou want good Laws, or did thoſe Laws want Execution? Didſt thou not ſtand the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the World, and the Envy of all Nations? Did not thy Prophets give lawful warning, and like true <hi>Baptiſts</hi> preach Repentance? How haſt thou lived, that now theſe Prophecies are fulfilled, and that now thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeſt the Vialls of thy angry God ready to be powred forth? Didſt thou think that Pride could not demoliſh the Towers that defend thee? Nor drunkenneſs dry up the Sea that Walls thee? Nor the Flames of Luſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the Ord'nance that protects thee. <hi>O England,</hi> Since mercies could not allure thee, let theſe threatning Judgments now at length enforce thee to a true Repentance. Quench the Firebrand which thou haſt kindled. Turn thy Mirth to true Mourning, and thy Feaſts of Joy to Humiliation; and pray with thy Church, That from all <hi>Sedition, privy Conſpiracy, and Rebellion, from all falſe Doctrine, Hereſy, and Schiſme, from Hardneſs of Heart, and Contempt of His Word and Commandments; God would deliver us.</hi>

            <p>SINCE the Compoſing the foregoing Diſcourſe, the <hi>Parliament of Scotland</hi> was Convogued; where the <hi>Duke of York</hi> ſat Commiſſioner, impoured to touch thoſe Acts with the <hi>Royal Scepter,</hi> which paſſed there, Voted by men of unbyaſt Principles, and Loyal Intentions. No ſooner do we find them pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in their <hi>Seats,</hi> but ſatisſyed with the <hi>Royal Pleaſure</hi> in the Commiſſioner, and undiſturbed with the daily Murmurings about Excluſion, Excluſion; the <hi>Engliſh-man's Character of a Popiſh Succeſſor,</hi> no way ſympathizing with Their <hi>Loyal Minds.</hi> They preſently Vote the publication of thoſe <hi>Memorable Acts</hi> for the <hi>Lineal Legal Succeſſion in That</hi> (and conſequently This) <hi>Kingdom.</hi>

            <p>Oh Brave <hi>Scots!</hi> Now you have quitted your ſelves like <hi>Men,</hi> and have ſhewed this to be the <hi>Year of Regeneration,</hi> and (conſequently) <hi>Salvation.</hi> Now you ſhame our <hi>Pretended Loyalliſts,</hi> who make the world believe that their <hi>Zeal</hi> and Devotion for the <hi>Royal Family</hi> deſerves <hi>Admiration,</hi> and merits the name of <hi>Unparalle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Now it is that you have played the true antient <hi>Scot,</hi> not filled with Anti-monarchy and Rebellion, or influenced by the Factious Spirits of Diſaffected Engliſh, nor moved with the malicious Thunder-bolt of Seditious and Rebellious Meroz; but a <hi>Legal Succeſſion,</hi> according to the <hi>Proximity of Blood,</hi> the <hi>Liberty and Freedom</hi> of <hi>The true Kirk of God, as now eſtabliſhed,</hi> is and ſhall be your <hi>Uninterrupted Reſolve.</hi> What doth, or will this do, but eternize your Names, and make you memorable in the <hi>Chronicles of Fame.</hi> Now you have quitted your ſelves like true <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> proſper all your Conſultations.</p>
            <p>AH!
