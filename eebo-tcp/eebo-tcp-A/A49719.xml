            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His is an uncomfortable time to Preach, yet I shall begin with a Text of Scripture, <hi>Heb</hi> 12. 2. <hi>Let us runne with Patience that race which is set before us, looking unto</hi> IESUS <hi>the Author and finisher of our Faith, who for the Ioy that was set before him, endured the Crosse, despising the shame, and is set downe at the right hand of the throne of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have been long in my <hi>Race,</hi> and how I have <hi>looked to</hi> IE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS <hi>the Author and finisher of my Faith,</hi> He best knowes: I am now come to the end of my <hi>Race,</hi> and here I find <hi>the Crosse,</hi> a death <hi>of shame,</hi> but <hi>the shame</hi> must be <hi>despised,</hi> or no comming to <hi>the right hand of God</hi>; IESUS <hi>despised the shame</hi> for me, and God forbid but I should <hi>despise the shame</hi> for Him: I am going apace (you see) towards the Red-Sea, and my feet are now upon the very brink of it; an Argument, I hope, that God is bringing me to <hi>the Land of Promise,</hi> for that was <hi>the way through which he led his People</hi>: But before they came to it, He instituted a <hi>Passeover</hi> for them, a <hi>Lambe</hi> it was, it must be <hi>eaten with sowre Hearbs.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 12.8.</note> I shall obey, and labour to digest the <hi>sowre Hearbes,</hi> as well as the <hi>Lambe,</hi> For I shall remember it is <hi>the Lord's Passeover</hi>; I shall not think of the <hi>Herbs,</hi> nor be angry with the hand that gathereth them; but look up onely to Him which instituted that, and governes these; For men can have <hi>no more power over me then what is given them from above.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 19.11.</note> I am not in love with this passage, through the Red-Sea, for I have the weakenesse and infirmities of flesh and bloud in me; And I have prayed, as my Saviour taught me,<note place="margin">Luk. 22.42.</note> 
               <hi>ut transiret Calix iste,</hi> that <hi>this Cup</hi> of Red-wine <hi>might passe from me</hi>: But if not, <hi>God's will (not mine) be done,</hi> and I shall most willingly <hi>drinke
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62619:3"/>
of this Cup</hi> as deep as He pleases, and enter into this Sea, yea and passe through it, <hi>in the way that he shall lead me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I would have it remembred (Good people) that when Gods Servants were in this boysterous Sea, and <hi>Aaron</hi> among them, the <hi>AEgyptians</hi> which persecuted them (and in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner drove them into that Sea) were drowned in the same wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, while they were in pursuit of them; I know <hi>my God whom I serve,</hi> is as able to deliver me from this Sea of bloud, as he was to deliver the <hi>three Children</hi> from the Furnace;<note place="margin">Dan. 3.</note> and (I most humbly thank my Saviour for it) my Resolution is now as theirs was then; They <hi>would not worship the Image the King had set up,</hi> nor I the Imaginations which the People are setting up; I will not forsake the <hi>Temple and truth of God,</hi> to follow the bleating of <hi>Ieroboams</hi> Calfe in <hi>Dan</hi> or in <hi>Bethel.</hi> As <hi>for this Peo<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ple,</hi> they are at this day miserably misled, (God of his mercy open their Eyes that they may see the right way) for now <hi>the Blind doe lead the Blind,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 6.39.</note> and if they goe on, <hi>both will certainly fall into the ditch.</hi> For my selfe, I am (and I acknowledge it in all humility) a most grievous sinner many wayes, by thought, word, and deed, and I cannot doubt, but God hath mercy in store for me (a poore Penitent) as well as for other sinners. I have now, upon this sad occasion, ransacked every corner of my Heart, and yet (I thank God) I have not found (among the many) any one sinn which deserves death by any known Law of this Kingdome; And yet hereby I charge nothing upon my Judges; for if they proceed upon Proofe (by valuable wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses) I or any other Innocent, may be justly condemned; But (I thanke God) though the weight of the sentence lyes heavy upon me, I am as quiet within, as ever I was in my life. And though I am not only the first Archbishop, but the first man that ever dyed by an <hi>Ordinance of Parliament,</hi> yet some of my Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors have gone this way, though not by this meanes; For <hi>Elphegus</hi> was hurried away &amp; lost his head by the <hi>Danes; Symon Sudbury</hi> was beheaded in the fury of <hi>Wat Tyler</hi> &amp; his fellows; &amp; long before these, S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> had his head danced oft by a lewd woman; And S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Cyprian,</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Carthage,</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted his head to the persecuting Sword. Many Examples
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62619:3"/>
(great and good) and they teach me patience; for I hope my Cause in Heaven will looke of another dye then the colour which is put upon it here. And some comfort it is to me, not onely that I goe the way of these great men in their severall generations, but also that my Charge (as fowle as it is made) looks like that of the <hi>Iewes</hi> against S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> (<hi>Acts.</hi> 25.) For he was accused for the <hi>Law</hi> and the <hi>Temple,</hi> that is, the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi>; And like that of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Stephen</hi> (<hi>Acts.</hi> 6.) for breaking the <hi>Ordinances which Moses gave,</hi> that is, Law and Religion, <hi>the holy place and the Law</hi> (<hi>vers.</hi> 13.) But you'l say, doe I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare my selfe with the integrity of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> and S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Stephen?</hi> No, farre be it from me; I onely raise a Comfort to my selfe, that these great Saints &amp; Servants of God were laid at in their severall times, as I am now. And it is memorable, that S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> who helped on the Accusation against S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Stephen,</hi> did after fall under the very same Accusation himselfe. Yea, but heres a great Clamour that I would have brought in Popery; I shall An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer that more fully by and by; In the meane time you know what the Pharisees said against Christ himselfe,<note place="margin">Joh. 11.48.</note> 
               <hi>If we let him alone all men will beleeve in him,</hi> Et venient Romani, <hi>and the Romanes will come and take away both our place and Nation.</hi> Here was a Causelesse Crye against Christ, that <hi>the Romanes would come</hi>; And see how just the Iudgement of God was; they crucified Christ for feare the <hi>Romanes</hi> should come, and his death was it which brought in the <hi>Romanes</hi> upon them, God punishing them with that they most feared: and I pray God, that this Clamour of <hi>Venient Romani</hi> (of which I have given no cause) help not to bring them in; for the Pope never had such a Harvest in <hi>England</hi> since the Reformation, as he hath now upon the Sects and Divisions that are amongst us. In the meane time <hi>by Honour and dishonour, by good report and evill report, as a deceiver and yet true,</hi> am I passing through this world, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.8. — Some other particulars I thinke not amisse to speake of.</p>
            <p>And first, for His Sacred Majestie, the King our gracious Soveraigne; He also hath bin much traduced for bringin<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

(according to the Religion by Law established) as any man in this Kingdom; And that He will venture His Life as farre, and as freely for it; and I think I doe, or should know, both His affection to Religion, and his grounds for it, as fully as any man in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second particular is concerning this great and Populous City, (which God blesse.) Here hath been of late, a fashion ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up, to gather hands, and then goe to the Great Court (the Parliament) and clamour for Justice; as if that great and wise Court, before whom the Causes come, (which are unknown to the many) could not, or would not doe Iustice, but at their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poyntment. A way, which may endanger many an Innocent man, and pluck his blood upon their own heads, and perhaps upon this City also: And this hath been lately practised a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst my selfe; the Magistrates standing still, and suffering them openly to proceed from Parish to Parish without Check; God forgive the Abetters of this (with all my heart I begge it) but many well meaning People are caught by it. In S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phens</hi> case, when nothing else could serve, <hi>they stirred up the People against him</hi>;<note place="margin">Act. 6.12.</note> and when <hi>Herod</hi> had killed S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Iames,</hi> he would not venture on S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Peter,</hi> till he found how the other <hi>pleased the People.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 12.3.</note> But beware you that cry so much for <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,</hi> lest when you cry for your selves you have nothing but <hi>Iustice</hi>; Take heed, take heed of having your <hi>hands full of blood,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 1.15.</note> for there is a time (best known to Himselfe) when God (above other sinnes) <hi>makes Inquisition for blood,</hi> and when that Inquisition is on foot, the Psalmist tells us,<note place="margin">Ps. 9.12.</note> 
               <hi>That God remembers</hi> (that's not all) <hi>He remembers and forgets not the Complaint of the Poore,</hi> that is, him whose blood is shed by op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, <hi>vers.</hi> 9. take heed of this;<note place="margin">Heb. 12.</note> 
               <hi>It is a fearfull thing to fall into the hands of the living God,</hi> but then especially, <hi>when he is making Inquisition for blood</hi>; And (with my Prayers to avert it) I doe heartily desire this City to remember the Prophesy that is expressed, <hi>Ier.</hi> 26.15.</p>
            <p>The third particular is the poore Church of <hi>England.</hi> It hath flourished and been a shelter to other neighbouring Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches when stormes have driven upon them. But, alas, now 'tis in a storme it selfe, and God only knowes whether, or how it shall get out; and (which is worse then a storme from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out)
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62619:4"/>
it's become like an Oake cleft to shivers with wedges made out of its own body, and at every cleft, Prophanenesse and Irreligion are entring in, while as <hi>Prosper</hi> speaks (in his second Book <hi>De vitae contemptu, cap.</hi> 4.) <hi>Men that introduce prophanenesse are cloaked with the name of Imaginary Religion</hi>; for we have lost the Substance &amp; dwell too much in Opinion, and that Church which all the Iesuits could not ruine, is fallen into danger by her owne.</p>
            <p>The last particular (for I am not willing to be long) is my selfe; I was borne and baptized in the bosome of the Church of <hi>England</hi> established by Law; in that profession I have ever since lived, and in that I come now to dye; what Clamours and Slaunders I have endured, for labouring to keep a Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in the externall service of God, according to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Discipline of the Church, all men know, and I have abundantly felt.</p>
            <p>Now at last I am accused of <hi>High Treason</hi> in Parliament: a Crime which my soule ever abhorred; this Treason was charged to consist of two parts, <hi>An endeavour to subvert the Lawes of the Land,</hi> and a like <hi>Endeavour to overthrow the true Protestant Religion Established by Law.</hi> Besides my answers which I gave to the several Charges, I protested my Innocency in both Houses.
