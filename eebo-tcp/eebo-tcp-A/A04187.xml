            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He imputations, which from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of more learned writers late miſhaps, I ſee now readie to befall mee, will be eſpecially two: The one, my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming to augment the ſuperaboundant number of bookes written in this age: The other, my not writing more exactly. I muſt requeſt your <hi>Lordſhip</hi> to ſtand betwixt mee and the later, that I may deale the better with the former; whoſe force, if it come but ſingle, I can eaſily put off, thus: Did I not ſee ſuch men as holde all <hi>additions</hi> to the number of bookes formerly extant altogether needleſſe and ſuperfluous, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
<pb facs="tcp:7895:5"/>
ouerlading themſelues with heapes of ſuperfluities harme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to themſelues and others; I ſhould gladly entertaine this their diſlike of theſe, or former labours, as a good oportunity to eaſe my ſelfe of future paines, and to aduiſe my fellow Miniſters hereafter to ſpare their pens. But whiles theſe cenſurers, after the example of moſt now liuing, daily manifeſt their incredulity to our ſauiours approbation of <hi>Mary,</hi> by ſolicitous imitation of <hi>Martha:</hi> a <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie</hi> is laid vpon vs that be his meſſengers, and a woe will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall vs, if we doe not, as well by writing as ſpeaking, by all meanes poſſible, diſſwade this erroneous and ſiniſter choice. I may, in this regard, ſafely affirme, that the argument or drift of this preſent Treatiſe, cannot (iuſtly) ſeeme either idle or impertinent; becauſe it teacheth (as the Reader in the iſſue will perceiue) the extirpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thoſe impertinencies, or ſuperfluities, wherewith moſt in our daies wilfully intangle themſelues, to be altogether neceſſary to the ſure <hi>rooting,</hi> right <hi>taking,</hi> or iuſt <hi>growth</hi> of that faith which onely brings forth the fruites of life. And this aduantage theſe preſent Comments, otherwiſe weak, haue of more accurate labours directed to the ſame end they are: Theſe, as they diſcouer the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of many incumbrances which vſually beſet the waie of life, to be much greater then it is ordinarily thought; ſo they giue inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations withall of meanes more immediate and effectuall for their auoidance; in as much as they deriue, as well our alacritie in all good performances, as all preſeruatiues againſt wicked practiſes, more directly and more neceſſarily then commonly a man ſhall find their deriuance, from the eſſence or internall conſtitution of ſuch faith as they deſcribe. That I handle not theſe points ſo accurate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as I my ſelfe could wiſh, much leſſe ſo exactly as a iudicious Reader would require: The beſt Apologie I can make muſt be bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
<pb facs="tcp:7895:5"/>
from that I haue already made for the vnripenes of my firſt fruits, publiſhed, vpon the ſame occaſion theſe are, before their time. Others, beſides my ſelfe, haue taken notice of your Honourable fauours, and kindneſſe towards mee: and ſecret conſciouſneſſe how ſlow I am in priuate teſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of my dutie, either by my pen, or preſence, haſtened the conception of this more publicke and durable pledge. Which notwithſtanding (as if <hi>haſte</hi> had maymed <hi>ſpeede</hi> by ouerrunning it in the ſtarting) hath beene now twiſe as long in bringing foorth, or rather in comming to publique <hi>light,</hi> as it was in comming to the birth. So long it hath been out of my ſight, that the blindneſſe of ſuch affection as Parents vſually beare to their owne broode newely brought foorth, is quite abated. To ſay it were ill fauoured, or miſhapen, is more then anie Parent will conceiue of his owne off-ſpring. Of ſuch defects, or blemiſhes, as the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſpectator will diſcrie in it verie manie, diuerſe, I muſt confeſſe, it naturally takes from the Father; but manie withall from ill hap not to haue a Mid-wife neerer to ſet it ſooner, or at ſuch time as he that gaue it ſuch ſhape and forme as it first had, might haue looked on. But theſe are faults which I muſt ſeeke to amend when God ſhall bleſſe it with more brethren. This, as it is, I muſt humbly intreate your <hi>Lordſhip</hi> to accept, as an vndoubted pledge of my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuours to make my ſelfe, and others, ſuch indeed, as wee are in Name, altogether <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> of my ſincere and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie deſire to ſhew my ſelfe thankefull to your good <hi>Lordſhip</hi> as to an Honourable fauourer, and chiefe furtherer of my ſtudies.

Now the auoidance of theſe inconueniences, as in the preface to my firſt labours is ſpecified, was amongſt others, one principall occaſion of my writing after ſo manie learned writers of this age. What then I purpoſed concerning this Argument, and ſome what more is at large exhibited in the Treatiſe following. For thy better direction to trace my foote-ſteps through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the principall paſſages thereof, otherwiſe not ſo much beaten as many of the like Argument are, may it pleaſe thee firſt to view my progreſſe in this ſhort map or draught.</p>
            <p>Aſwell of our owne as forraine writers, auncient and moderne, I found the moſt more forward to vrge a certainety of beleefe, as alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather neceſſarie vnto ſaluation, then clearly to teach how this cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainety could posſibly faſten vpon obiects not euident to the beleeuer: ſuch, notwithſtanding the obiect of Christian ſaith are held by them that hold it morl certain, then the principles of any humane ſcience.
<pb facs="tcp:7895:8"/>
In the diſcuſſion of this difficultie <hi>(Section 1. Chapter 34. 5,)</hi> I doe not much differ from that graund light of the Engliſh Church, whoſe opinion (had I been aware of it, before this Treatiſe was concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued) might happily hane faſhioned my conceipt vnto the form of words wherein he expreſſeth his, from which my phraſe or dialect doth ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what differ. In the maine point we well agree, that Faith is an <hi>aſſent</hi> as well vnto the <hi>goodneſſe</hi> as vnto the <hi>truth</hi> of matters diuine. That which hee with ſome auncient Schoole men tearmes <hi>certainty of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence,</hi> is in my dialect, <hi>ſtability o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

All of vs by nature adhere more firmly to things of great and knowne worth, then wee could doe vnto the very ſame, if their worth, either were in it ſelfe, or by vs eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, leſſe, albei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> their certainty were equall. The next leſſon which reaſon will hence learne is, That vnto ſome truths our adherence may be more firme then vnto others of greater euidence and certaintie, in caſe the former excell the later more in goodneſſe then they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exceeded by them in euidence and certaintie.</p>
            <p>But ſeeing with the Romaniſt we admit the nature of faith to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in <hi>Aſſent,</hi> we might perhaps be thought to confine it wholy (as hee doth) to the vnderſtanding; an error iuſtly abandoned by moſt in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches, who, in this reſpect (for the moſt part) either define it not by <hi>Aſſent,</hi> or elſe to make vp one entire and compleate definition, match <hi>Aſſent</hi> with other tearmes not ſo well conſorting with it as the rules of art in my occaſions require. To this purpoſe rather in defence of mine owne, then any waie to preiudice other mens methods, which muſt be meaſured by the end at which they aime, the firſt and ſecond Chapters are premiſed. But ſome perhaps would reply, that <hi>Aſſent</hi> being terminated vnto truth, can haue no greater alliance with good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, then with thoſe differences aſsigned vnto it by other writers, reiected by vs, not as falſe, but as not formall. And the obiection (to ſpeake the truth) could not be put off as impertinent, did we follow the Romaniſt in another erroneous principle, not diſcouered, much leſſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed by ſuch as moſt oppugne them; from which principle notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the worſt inconueniences can in this argument be obiected to their doctrine directly follow, and are not ſo cleerely or fully auoided by thoſe that contradict them, as by vs that aſſent vnto them in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining Chriſtian faith by <hi>Aſſent.</hi> Not with the moderne pontifician

Moſt proteſtant writers acknowledge them to be of entire blood, yet ſomewhat farther remoued then in my opinion they are. The principall reaſon whereof as I coniecture is, that they eſteeme more of ſchoole-philoſophy then ſchoole-diuinity, and with the ſchoole-men, ſpecially <hi>Aquinas</hi> and his followers, imagine the will and vnderſtanding, from which faith and good works in their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rauldry ſeuerally diſcend, to be faculties really diſtinct, like brother and ſister, being indeed but two names, or titles of one and the ſame intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuall nature; as <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>goodneſſe</hi> (their ſuppoſed really diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent obiects) in matters morall differ onelie in degrees of apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; as one and the ſame perſon knowne a farre off vnder the common notion of a man, is oft times cleerely diſcerned by his approach to be an honeſt man and our louing friend. Sutably to this true Philoſophie, learned out of the beſt profeſſors of that facultie, and to omitte other Schoole-men out of the wiſe and learned <hi>Gerſon,</hi> I place faith neither in the wil nor vnderſtanding, but in the intellectual nature, as ſubiect to both theſe titles or appellations. The inference hence taken is, that <hi>faith,</hi> although it be formally an <hi>Aſſent,</hi> may be as imediately termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto the goodneſſe, as vnto the truth of reuelations diuine. And theſe being of all the matters that can be reuealed or knowne, both in themſelues, and in reſpect of vs, far the beſt: I make that faith which primarily diſtinguiſheth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> true Chriſtian from an hypocrite, or fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe profeſſor of orthodoxall religion, to bee an aſſent or <hi>adherence</hi> vnto reuelations diuine, as much better then any contrary good the world, the diuell, or fleſh can preſent to peruert our choice of what they preſcribe for our ſauing health, or habitually to interrapt or hinder the proſecution of their deſignes. By theſe deductions drawne forth at large in the ſixth Chapter, the Reader may eaſily perceiue the linke betweene faith and works, to be moſt immediate and eſſentiall.</p>
            <p>This maine concluſion whereon the moſt of the Treatiſe following depends, is further confirmed <hi>(Chap. 7.)</hi> by inſtances of ſacred wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, aſcribing all the victories of Gods Saints ouer the world, Diuell, or fleſh, vnto faith, or apprehenſion of diuine promiſes, better then ought could come in competition with them; all backſliding into euill, or backwardneſſe in good courſes, vnto want of faith, or apprehenſion of Gods iudgements, or threatnings, as more terrible then any tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb facs="tcp:7895:9"/>
which man can deuiſe againſt his fellow creatures. Briefely the whole drift or ſcope of the Apostle from the later part of the tenth Chapter to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> vnto the end of that Epistle, iumps fully with the former concluſion. Whereunto likewiſe the vſuall dialect of the holy ſpirit, when he ſpeakes abſolutely, not with reference to the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leciſmes of hipocrites, or ſuch as haue diuorced <hi>truth</hi> from <hi>honeſty,</hi> or ſet <hi>words</hi> and <hi>works</hi> at variance, is exactly conſonant. It is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally obſerued by all interpreters of ſacred writ, that the termes which it vſeth to expreſſe the proper asts or exerciſes of ſence and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, ſtill include thoſe affections or practique faculties, which are moſt homogeneall to them. The true reaſon whereof is not becauſe hee who ſees the heart, and inſpires it with faith, ſpeakes more vulgar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie or groſly, but rather more metaphyſically then many Diuines or Philoſophers doe; as ſuppoſing the truth before ſpecified, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the identity of the wil and vnderſtanding, with the eſſentiall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination of truth and goodneſſe in matters practicall. The conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces hence inferred and exemplified at large in the eight and ninth Chapters are in briefe vnto this purpoſe. As the apprehenſion of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine infalibility breeds an infallibility of perſwaſion, or ſure reliance vpon his promiſes: ſo aſſent vnto his goodnes or imitable attributes aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulates our ſoules to them. Euery obiect rightly apprehended or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood imprints it ſimilitude vpon the apprehenſiue faculty. The diuine nature therfore muſt leaue an impreſsion or ſtampe in our ſoules as well of his goodneſſe, as of his veracity: otherwiſe wee apprehend him who is eſſentially as good as true without any liuely apprehenſion of his goodneſſe. This ſtampe or character of goodneſse diuine, is as a touch to drawe the ſoule, as the Adamant doth the iron after it ſelfe: and in this adherence of the intellectiue nature (once touched with grace) vnto the celeſtiall promiſes the definition of ſauing faith is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed <hi>(Chap. 9.):</hi> whoſe generall or cheefe properties are ſet foorth <hi>(Chap. 10.).</hi> For concluſion of the firſt Section <hi>(Chap. 11.).</hi> I notefie the principall errors of the Ramiſh Church, partly becauſe method ſo required, partly for more commodious ſolution of ſome dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties obiected by them in the point of inſtification, but principally for expugning their doctrine of merits by works, which as it is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely falſe, ſo it is more abhominable in them then in vs it could bee, becauſe their workes can bee but dead being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The iſſue of the fourth Chap. wherein the qualification required to Martyrdome with other like points are hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at large, is that the ſincerity of our faith &amp; loue muſt be tryed by an vnpartial and vniform obſeruation of all Gods commandements, as is proued in the Chap. following; firſt by the anthorities of <hi>Siracides,</hi> a man well ac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <hi>Paules</hi> diſputes, within whoſe limits is included that vniformity of works, which Saint Iames requires vnto iuſtification or ſaluation; by whoſe Apoſtolicall authority the former concluſion is refortified. In peruſing of this firſt Chapter recall to minde, or haue recourſe vnto the points ſet downe <hi>(Chap. 8. Sect. 1.)</hi> and vnto thoſe paſſages of the eleauenth, wherein the different value or diuerſe acceptions of faith in Saint <hi>Paul</hi> and Saint <hi>Iames</hi> are diſcuſſed.</p>
            <p>Others againe faile of the former end of faith. i. (vnion with CHRIST, or reconciliation with God by his mediation) either by inuerting the vſe of faith, or by miſtaking the meaſure of ſanctifying graces neceſſary to ſaluation. The former error is peculiar to the Romaniſt, who labours to miſperſwade himſelfe and others, that faith is giuen him as a bare foundation of other graces, or as a talent for fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will to traffique with, vntill he obtaine ſuch a full meaſure of inherent righteouſneſſe, as ſhall immediately acquite him of all reckonings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene his Creator and him, by expelling all reliques or ſlaine of ſinne as vtterly out of his ſoule as the water doth the ayre out of the veſſell which it filleth vp to the very brimme. The dangerous conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of this errour are handled at large (<hi>Chap.</hi> 6. and 7.) And vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the vſe and meaſure of faith and other graces inherent I reduce the controuerſie of iuſtification, here inſerted, contrary to my firſt intent; leaſt otherwiſe I might haue miniſtred ſome offence vnto the Church wherein I liue, or left ſome ſcruple in the Readers minde, how faith ſhould iuſtifie without works; the linke or bond betweene them being ſo ſtrict and eſſentiall as I make it, almoſt identicall. The ſame doubt naturally offered it ſelfe from the diſcuſsion of Saint <hi>Iames</hi> his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, partly in the Chapter precedent, partly in the laſt Chapter of the the firſt Section. Out of ſundry other paſſages of this diſcourſe it likewiſe apeares, that the works required to iuſtification by Saint <hi>Iames</hi> are virtually included in the faith whereto Saint <hi>Paul</hi> aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth iuſtification: whence, it may ſeeme to imply a contradiction in the very tearmes, to ſay we are iuſtified by faith alone without workes, if in iuſtifying faith works neceſſarily he included.</p>
            <p>As the Trent Councels doctrine which vpon penalty of damnation exacts a meaſure of inherent righteouſneſſe, whereof mortality is not capable, nurſeth finall doubting or deſpaire, ſo others in oppoſition to it, miniſter occaſion of careleſneſſe or preſumption either by not vrging ſuch a meaſure of perfection as Gods word requires, or
<pb facs="tcp:7895:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by deeming that ſufficient enough to ſaluation, although it bee ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent to iuſtification. Whereas hee that can once fully perſwade himſelfe he is actually iuſtified, will not eaſily bee brought to doubt whether he want ought neceſſarie to ſaluation. All of vs that haue forſaken the Romiſh Church rightly acknowledge the end and vſe of faith to conſiſt in calling vpon the name of the Lord in the daie of euill and temptation, and that all ſuch as call vpon him faithfully ſhall bee ſaued. But many of vs are either much miſtaken by our hearers, or elſe deceiue our ſelues in imagining faithfull inuocation of Gods name through Chriſt to be one of the eaſieſt points or operations of faith, being indeede the moſt difficult, becauſe the finall ſeruice, whereunto all other obedience to his Lawes, and daily wreſtlings with fleſh and blood doe but inure vs, as ſouldiers in the time of peace and truce are trained againſt the day of battell. All perſecutions or exerciſe of our patience are in reſpect of this last conflict with hell and death, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in victory is obtained, onely through faith in Chriſt, but as playing at foiles in a fence ſchoole to better skill and courage in triall of maſteries at ſharpe. Theſe and like points are handled in the two laſt Chapters of this ſecond ſection not ſo fully as theſe times require but large e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for hints to popular ſermons.</p>
            <p>The third and laſt Section ſhewes the neceſſity and vſe of humane induſtry for attaining vnto the faith, whoſe nature and properties are ſet forth in the firſt; notwithſtanding that ſuch faith is the ſole gift of God, not wrought in part by vs but wholy created by him. The points whereto our endeauours muſt bee addreſſed, thou ſhalt eaſily perceiue by the titles of the Chapters; onely let mee requeſt thee to beare in mind Chap. 6. of Section 1. whi eſt thou readeſt the fowrth of this third: as alſo to compare Chap. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Firſt, whether in men neuer attaining vnto ſaluation, there may not be faith, for eſſence, quality, and degrees one and the ſame with that which ſaueth others, onely different in want of radication
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:7895:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
or durability: as many men are not ſo long liued, as others of the ſame complexion or conſtitution of body.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond, whether any faith, though ſuppoſed to continue vnto the laſt end of life, be ſufficiently qualified for iuſtifying by the bare eſſentiall nature or quality, or rather a competent meaſure or quantity be neceſſarily required with theſe vnto ſo weighty a buſineſſe. Omitting theſe queſtions for the preſent, it ſhall ſuffice to ſearch the true nature and properties of that faith which doth iuſtifie, or which primarily diſtinguiſheth a true Chriſtian from an Hypocrite.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Such faith queſtionleſſe is not oppoſite, but ſubordinate, or rather coincident to hiſtoricall aſſent: whoſe latitude, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of intenſiue perfection is commenſurable to the different eſteeme of authority in hiſtorians. He ſhould much diſparage <hi>Tacitus, Liuit, Dion,</hi> or <hi>Halicarnaſſenſis,</hi> that made no better rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning of their hiſtories then of <hi>Dictys Cretenſis,</hi> or <hi>Cteſias:</hi> ſo ſhould he much wrong the memory of Sir <hi>Thomas Moore,</hi> that gaue no more credit to his hiſtory of <hi>Richard</hi> the third, then to diuers paſſages in <hi>Hector, Boetius,</hi> or in ſome other writers of Engliſh or Scottiſh affaires. But much greater indignitie ſhould he offer <hi>Moſes,</hi> or rather the bleſſed Spirit, that would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue the booke of <hi>Geneſis</hi> much better then the former, or anie domeſtique ſtory. Finally, ſeeing hiſtoricall beliefe is but an aſſent to hiſtoricall narrations, whoſe ſtrength increaſeth accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our better eſteeme of the Hiſtorian: I ſhould ſuſpect my hart of prophanenes, if I did not beleeue the ſacred ſtory by that ſacred faith, by which I hope to find ſaluation. Yet beſides this different eſteeme of Hiſtorians, whoſe latitude, as it compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends as well diuine as prophane, is as great as the altitude of the heauens aboue the earth: Many other grounds or motiues there be, whereby our aſſent to diuers narrations in the ſame au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor may be much ſtrengthned, &amp; yet the title it had, not therby abrogated it may continue hiſtorical ſtil.

V.</hi> The ſeuer all kinds of euidences whereof ſome are appliable vnto Faith in reſpect of certaine Articles, others in reſpect of other: That the certainty of Faith in reſpect of diuine truths not euident, is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon an euident certainty of others: the properly naturally ariſing from this difference of Aſſent, as it is of obiects partly knowne aud partly vnknowne.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Concluſion laſt inferred as I maintaine not either againſt any lawfull authority that ſhall commaund, or learned diuine that will inſtruct me to the contrary; ſo, left herein to my Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian liberry, I would aduiſe men of mine owne profeſſion not to content themſelues with ſuch generall eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence or certaintie; albeit perhaps ſufficient to ſome of their flocke honeſtly minded, but dull in apprehenſion of particular diuine truthes. Wherefore, as well to encourage ſuch as are come thus farre to goe further, as to occaſion the learned to looke more narrowly into theſe points; it will not be amiſſe to ſet downe the ſeuerall kindes of euidence, and which of them may in this life be had of points belieued.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Euidence, according to the Etimologie of the Latine word, includes a cleere, diſtinct and full apprehenſion of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects preſent, and is moſt properly applied to the objects of ſight. Amongſt them, ſuch are moſt euident, as are moſt viſible, or apt to inforce their apprehenſion vpon the eye: whence the <hi>Sunne</hi> of all viſibles is held moſt euident: becauſe ſuch as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee it can ſee nothing, and hardly canany ſight be ſo diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered, as to be miſtaken in the apprehenſion of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:7895:30"/>Hence is this appellation tranſlated to obiects of the ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue vnderſtanding, becauſe that faculty hath moſt affinity with ſight. And with reference to it, thoſe things are ſaid to be moſt euident that are of eaſieſt apprehenſion, or moſt apt to imprint their truth vpon it. Such for the moſt part are mathematicall principles, common notions, or <hi>maxims,</hi> generall to all ſciences. For ſcarcely can any diſtemper of body, or minde, phrenzy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, worke any diſtruſt, <hi>whether the whole be not bigger then it part, whether all right angles are equall, or whether ademption of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual portions from things equal, leaue not ſuch equality betwixt them as it found.</hi> And in this ſence it will be impoſsible to aſſigne any obiect of chriſtian faith ſo vniuerſally euident as theſe <hi>maxims</hi> are: for vnto the meere naturall man, moſt diuine t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>uthes are diſtaſtefull, none ſo euident as to enforce their apprehenſion vpon his heart, vntill he be cured of his naturall diſtemper.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But as light to the eie, ſo to euery other ſenſe the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per obiect within iuſt diſtance is moſt euident, albeit diſtempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in them may more eaſily breed either a dulneſſe in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, or an error in the compoſition: as cold in the head either obſtructs or corrupts ourſmel, albeit odoriferous obiects be preſent: bad humors either dead the taſte, or by imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting an apprehenſion of themſelues, make meates ſweete and pleaſant, ſeem bitter, ſower, or loathſome, according to the ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, vngrateful noiſome qualities, which they communicate to the organ. Vnto this laſt kinde of euidence all <hi>Aſſent</hi> to mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters morall is more properly reſembled; and vpon this, ſuch as write of myſticall Theologie, for the moſt part ground their diſcourſes.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Beſides theſe ſorts of euidences, ariſing from exact pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion betwixt the paſſiue capacities of particular ſenſes, and the actiue force of the obiects to imprint their ſhapes vpon them, an euidence there is of bodily impulſion or motion; whereunto in the minde is anſwerable an euidence of inſtinct, or working, alwaies manifeſt in the effect, though the cauſe oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times be hidden or doubtfull. An euidence likewiſe there is of bodily ſtrength, eyther paſſiue to ſuſtaine contrary force or vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, or actiue to repell it by oppoſing the like. Proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall hereunto there is an euidence of conſcience, vpon iuſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:7895:30"/>
alwaies witneſsing, either our ſtrength, or weakneſſe to reſiſt temptations; or our vigour, alacrity or dulneſſe in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of good. But this kinde of euidence belongs rather vnto the triall of faith inherent, or our perſwaſions of it after we haue it, then vnto the obiects or grounds whence it ariſeth.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Ieſuite hauing defaced the image of his <hi>Creator,</hi> (as <hi>eſſentially</hi> good as true) in his heart, and out of the reliques of it erecting an Idoll in his braine to repreſent the viſible Church or Pope; (both which he adores as gods for their veracity, though not for ſanctity) imagines no euidence poſſible in matters di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine, but meerely ſpeculatiue: and hence argues Faith to be an <hi>Aſsent</hi> ineuident or obſcure, becauſe not euident: after the ſame manner Mathematicall theorems, or <hi>common naturall notions</hi> are to the ſpeculatiue vnderſtanding, or the <hi>Sunne, Moone,</hi> or <hi>Starres</hi> of the firſt magnitude to ordinary ſights. As if an Engliſh-man, Dane or German, ſhould conclude Italians, French-men, Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards, or generally all forreiners to be Blacke-moores, becauſe not of the ſame complexion they themſelues are. The like looſeneſſe we finde in ſome more ancient Schoolemens collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that the obiects of faith are neither euident, nor properly intelligible, but only credible, becauſe neither of ſuch propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>as euery one that heares will approue,</hi> nor of euident deducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from ſuch. But the queſtion is not of the vniuerſality or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, but of the intenſiue perfection of euidence: and no man I thinke will denie, that manie Truths altogether vnknowne to moſt, may be as intenſiuely euident to ſome particular diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as generall <hi>maxims</hi> are to all. Otherwiſe S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould haue had no exact euidence of ſpecial reuelations made to him, no Prophets of their cleereſt viſions, not CHRIST IESVS himſelf of his fathers will, in whoſe boſom he was; ſeeing he did not make that enident to the Iewes. Euery mans thoughts are as manifeſt to himſelfe, as the principles of any ſcience, though he cannot ſo certainly manifeſt the one as the other to his audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours. None of reformed Churches, I thinke did euer auouch, that he could make the Articles of faith euident to all endued with naturall reaſon: but that the ſpirit of God, which firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed and cauſed them to be written in Characters viſible vnto all, cannot as euidently imprint them vpon the hearts of all
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:7895:31"/>
his children, what reaſon haue we to deny? <hi>Becauſe faith is the argument of things not ſeene?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. A worke it were worth his paines that is not fit for very great, nor neceſſarily engaged to other good emploiments, to obſerue how many opinions, which could neuer haue been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued but from a miſconceit of Scriptures, haue been faſtened to the Temple dore, as more certaine then Propheticall oracles. Firſt, by continuall hammering of Schoolemen; afterwards by inſtruction giuen from the <hi>great Paſtor</hi> to the Maſters of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh aſſemblies, which for the moſt part do but riuet the nailes the other had driuen, or driue ſuch faſter as they had entered, not without diſturbance of their oppoſites. What a number of ſuch opinions, as the Trent Councell ties our faith vnto, as Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles neceſſary to ſaluation, were in ages laſt paſt meere ſchoole points held <hi>pro, &amp; con,</hi> by the followers of diuerſe factio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in that profeſſion? And though theſe Trent Fathers doe not expreſly teach vs, that beliefe is an <hi>Aſsent</hi> ineuident and obſcure: yet doth it bind vs to belieue it to be ſuch as none euer would haue conceiued, but from a miſtaking of the Apoſtles words lately cited, which notwithſtanding he vttered not anie waies to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parage the euidence, but rather to ſet forth the excellency of that heauenly vertue.

Hee that ſaid faith is the argument of things vnſeene, did neuer deny it to include an euident know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or apprehenſion of ſome things preſent, which the world ſees not: yet ſuch as he there deſcribes, it is to the regenerate only, or vnto them whom God hath giuen this heauenly trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure as a pledge of his future fauours.

But when God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to open our hearts, that we may ſee our naturall miſery; it is with vs as it was with ſuch as being born blinde were reſtored to ſight by our Sauiour, (as for illuſtrations ſake we may ſuppoſe) in the beginning of ſome diſmall night ſome howers before the moons a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

At the firſt opening of their eies they might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue an euident diſtinction betwixt the greateſt darkenes inci-dent to night, by tempeſts, ſtormes, or ouer-caſting, and their wonted blindneſſe; an euident difference againe betweene ſuch darkneſſe, and light ſhortly after enſuing vpon the remooual of cloudes or apparition of ſtarres. And albeit they did heereafter expect a cleerer diſtinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> betwixt this time, &amp; that which they had often heard others call the day; yet eaſie it had beene to haue perſwaded them the Moones apparance had brought the morning with it, vntill the dawning had cleered the doubt: du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring which, as the Sunne did neerer and neerer approach, the diſtinction betwixt day and night grew cleerer and cleerer. Eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent it was now vnto them that the Sunne ſhould in time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, although it ſelfe were yet vnſeene, whoſe actuall appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion could onely terminate the former expectation, and leaue no place for further errot, the brightneſſe of it being able ſo ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſatiate the capacity of the viſiue facultie, and ſo all ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for preſenting other viſibles as diſtinctly and cleerely as their hearts could deſire to their view.</p>

Of errours incident to the intermediate ſtate beetweene the ſonnes of darkeneſſe, and the ſonnes of light, (if any ſuch there

be,) or to our firſt apprehenſions of this change, and of the meanes to auoide them, the Reader ſhall finde ſomewhat in the two next Sections of this Booke, but more particularly in the Treatiſe <hi>Of the triall of Faith,</hi> or <hi>Certainety of inherent grace.</hi> In this place wee onely ſuppoſe, as there is no liuing creature indued with thoſe animall ſpirits that quicken the organs of bodily ſenſe, but euidently feeles paine or pleaſure: ſo is there none truely partaker of the Spirit of God, but hath or may haue an euident feeling of this ioy and griefe of conſcience; which is to other obiects of knowledge truly ſpirituall, as is the <hi>touch</hi> to the reſt of our ſenſes: yet may we not thinke this feeling to bee alike euident in all. For one liuing creature excelleth another in apprehenſion of proper ſenſitiue obiects, all alike e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident in themſelues, but ſo are not the ſenſes, or apprehenſiue faculties of ſeuerall creatures, alike nimble quick or ſtrong.</p>

But for mine owne part, the opinion generally receiued amongſt the ſchoole men and other learned Clarkes, that faith in reſpect of ſpeculation or diſcourſe ſhould bee an <hi>Aſſent</hi> vne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident, hath made mee often to ſuſpect my dull capacity in matters of ſecular knowledge, <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> Philoſophy I had read ouer, and yet could I hardly call any concluſion in it to minde, that might with greater euidence be reſolued into cleere vnqueſtionable principles, then moſt effects or experiments, reuolution of times affoord, may bee into the diſpoſition of a prouidence truely diuine. And conſidering with my ſelfe how groſly hee ſhould often faile, that would vndertake to ſet forth a comment of my inward thoughts, by obſeruation of my outward actions, when as no alteration of times, of perſons, or places, euer ſwarued from the rules of Scripture: I reſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that the ſame diuine prouidence which guides the world, and diſpoſeth all the actions of men, did ſet foorth theſe euerlaſting comments (which neuer change) of his owne conſultations or decrees concerning them. Againe acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging this eternal diuine power, alike able to effect his wil &amp; pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe by ordering the vnruly wils of this preſentage, though their pollicies be of a contrary mould, to ſuch as heretofore we haue heard hee hath defeated: the former inference as it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med more religious, ſo more euident then our aduerſaries

make; when, from a ſuppoſition onely of ſome infallible autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie in ſome preſent Church, they preſently aſſume, it muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide in the viſible Romiſh Church repreſentatiue: yet this col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection they hold euident by the habit of Theologie, albeit they admit no diſcourſe in <hi>Aſſent</hi> of Faith, which is their ſecond fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall errour in the doctrine of life, another maine roote of Romiſh witchery. For thus farre at leaſt all the Sonnes of God make faith to bee diſcurſiue, that fom euident experience of Gods fauours paſt, or preſent, they alwaies inferre a certainetie of the like to enſue. To the moſt of them in their diſtreſſe it was euident deliuerance ſhould be ſent them; although the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance it ſelfe were not ſo, although they diſtinctly apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not by what meanes, or in what manner it ſhould bee wrought.

In all which reſpects they are more apt, as to begin, ſo to continue a longing after that which is behinde. But I know not how, the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers fields looke like gardens, and the Paradiſe which wee are ſet to dreſſe, like an heath or wilderneſſe. The theoricall part of Theologie becomes loathſome vnto many, being for the moſt part wholy attired in ſlouenly tearmes of triuiall Arts, whiles the beauty of the practique is thought chiefely to conſiſt in the flouriſh of Scripture phraſes, or embelliſhment of popular diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, with diuine ſentences, moſt admirable (I muſt confeſſe) in themſelues, but like <hi>Scanderbegs</hi> ſword in a weakelings arme, vſually looſing their edge and ſtrength, whileſt not mannaged by that affection or diſpoſition from which they ſprung.

                  <p n="5">5. But Truth (I hope) ſhall not be worſe entertained by the ingenious and courteous Reader, becauſe a ſtranger. Rather then it ſhould, it ſhall learne the common language after ſome briefe aduertiſements for auoiding the errors thence occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, or for diſcouering the originall of the former vnneceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diſtinction; which doubtleſſe was for want of another, more needfull betwixt our intellection, or approbation of <hi>good,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt ſimply conſidered in it ſelfe; and whileſt compared, either with ſome other more familiar <hi>good</hi> we muſt forgoe, or ſome e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill which would befall vs, if we ſhould continue or accompliſh our former choiſe or approbation. For as a candle, though as truly bright as viſible, remaines only viſible, and rather obſcure then bright, while actually compared with the mid-day Sunne: ſo our vnwillingneſſe to purchaſe the good which we late ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued, appearing moſt cleere and euident from actuall refuſall of it, and free choiſe of the contrarie, when we come to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the termes or conditions vpon which it is profered, doth quite ouerſhadow and drowne all former acts of our will, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to haue it as ſimply conſidered, and leaues only a conceit of it, as true, in the braine. Yet that both are properly acts of the <hi>will</hi> or deſires, is moſt apparant in matters of ſecular vſe or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity. For euery man knowes it is one thing to deſire a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity ſimply, another to accept it at ſuch a rate. A mans vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſſe to giue fiue hundred pound for a Farme, doth not argue his vnwillingneſſe to haue it <hi>gratis;</hi> or if hee perfectly knew another purchaſe to be as well worth a thouſand, his willingneſſe would be the ſame to haue it for fiue hundred, as to haue the former <hi>gratis.</hi> Thus many diuine truths are in our firſt apprehenſions aſſented vnto as good, and therefore tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly willed whileſt ſimply conſidered: which yet we euidently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe, or <hi>will,</hi> when we come to queſtion about their price. And this later act obliterating all impreſsion of the former, we vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally appropriate <hi>that</hi> vnto the vnderſtanding, though as much belonging vnto the wil. For I neuer knew any ſo idle or diſſolute

but would diuerſe times wiſh hee were like ſome godly men, whom he will not imitate, and yet his wiſh to be like them is as proper an act of the will, as his vnwillingneſſe to imitate them: this later notwithſtanding wee vſually appropriate to the will, though equally appertaining to the vnderſtanding; would wee make an equall compariſon. In the former we cannot but will diuine truths ſimply, becauſe ſimply conſidered wee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them as good: in the later we do not therefore truly will them, becauſe wee doe not at the inſtant of choyce apprehend or vnderſtand them as good, being compared either with ſome entiſing ſenſuall good, or much ſeared euill, their proſecution would depriue vs of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or procure vs. For, as in the Article of euerlaſting life, by Gods aſsiſtance ſhall be ſhewed, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſsible the intellectiue nature ſhould will, or chuſe a leſſe good before a greater, vnleſſe there be a defect in ſuch acts as are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined vnto the vnderſtanding, euen by ſuch as diſtinguiſh it from the vvill: as, either the repreſentation of the <hi>good,</hi> in groſſe acknowledged for greater, is not formall, diſtinct or cleere; or becauſe the approhenſion is dull, or the impreſsion weake.

As the repreſentation of a winged horſe,

For prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice or right compoſall of affections, being the end (as the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher teacheth) of all morall diſcipline, knowledge in that ſubiect is imperfect, vnleſſe it bring foorth good actions with ioy.

And ſeeing experience, as he elſewhere notes, ariſeth from many memories of the ſame obiect, all preſuppoſing diſtinct apprehenſions of its truth: Impoſſible it is youth ſhould either haue experience, or true knowledge of moralities vntill affection or paſsion bee aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaged.

their logicall truth, or correſpondencie, includes an impreſsion of their eſteeme, vpon that part wherein the affection is ſeated. The want of diſpoſition to receiue ſuch impreſſion, or rather the temper moſt oppoſite to it, is that, which in Scripture is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led hardneſſe of heart.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. From theſe grounds of true Philoſophy we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the reaſons, why the naturall man ſo hardly aſſents to mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of his owne ſaluation, vnto theſe two heads. The one, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are ſo directy oppoſite to the chief obiect of his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt deſires; the other, becauſe theſe are ſo ſtrong and deeply diffuſed throughout the ſubſtance of our ſoules. For all affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſet on matters contrary to theſe we ſhould affect, according to the degrees of their ſtrength more or leſſe, either muſſle or ſheath the edge of our wits, that they cannot pierce into truth or goodneſſe, or weaken that intention of mind which ſhould (whether actiuely or paſsiuely) worke the mutuall penetration betwixt truths propoſed, and the apprehenſiue facultie. Thus we ſee by experience, that men proue moſt expert in thoſe arts or ſciences, whereto they are moſt inclined by nature; and are, though otherwaies dull oft-times, very witty in that ſubiect whereon their deſires are chiefly ſet, their conceits in others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vſually but forraine and borrowed from their delightful ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of matters moſt familiar. Our readineſſe againe to belieue whatſoeuer is pleſant to our nature, or lies in the way to our eſpeciall purpoſes, plainly argues the backwardneſſe of our beliefe in diuine miſteries, to be vſually if not wholly, from na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall propenſions to ſenſuality or ſecular contentment. And that the former vnaptnes in youth, eſpecially to perceiue truths morall or theologicall, doth not ſpring from any inherent dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the Intellectiue faculty, were the motions of it towards ſuch points propoſed free, &amp; vnfettered, is euident, in that their wits are in that age, for the moſt part ſharpeſt, and able with eaſe to perceiue the truth of ſuch Mathematicall concluſions, as will hardly enter into riper iudgements: much leſſe doth this incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenience ſpring from any faintneſſe in their endeuours, for their ſpirits are moſt liuely; therefore onely from the abundance of affection or heat of paſsion, which ſecretly diſſwade their vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings from all acquaintance with ſuch obiects as are repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant

But then they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more docile auditors of ſacred lore then men of mature age are; (vnleſſe formerly accuſtomed to penitency, or long trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the ſcholle of Chriſt) becauſe the affections of youth, though more violent in their motion, are not ſo ſtiffe or ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne in the habit, and young mens hearts euen becauſe vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant or leſſe ſetled, are more apt to repent then old mens are, oft-times hardned by affliction, through too much conſtancy in their wonted courſes. No man I thinke hath either ſo much or little acquaintance with ſuddaine paſsions as to be ignorant, that their violence for the time being, quite blinds the ſoule, in ſuch matters, as at other times it ſees moſt cleerely, and drawes it oft-times to a liking of what it otherwiſe hath condemned.

For ſuddaine or violent paſsions differ from ſtrong habituall affections or deſires, but as actuall motions do from inclinations or propenſions.</p>
                  <p n="11">11 From theſe conſiderations we may gather, that the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall diſtinction betweene the ſpeculatiue and practique vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and the will, ariſerh not from any diuerſitie in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, but onely in the obiects willed or vnderſtood: For of them ſome haue affinity or repugnancy to affections, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſions to their obiects; and with referrence to theſe the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectiue nature is denominated practique, and is ſaid to <hi>will</hi> or <hi>nill:</hi> Theſe termes in vſuall ſpeech including alwaies a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition betwixt ſeuerall goodneſſes propoſed.

A ſcholler might make ſhew of curious skill in metaphiſicall contemplations, as many yeers together, as <hi>Scotus</hi> is ſaid to haue ſtudied the <hi>naturall motion of bodies,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any practicall wit or polititian, did either enuie or contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict him, vnleſſe it were to make himſelf ſport: whereas ſhould he but defend ſom paradoxes of the like ſubiect in the Schools, or ſeeme to know more of ſuch matters then others of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion doe, he ſhould quickly perceiue that he had ſtird a waſps neſt. Now as in the ciuell conuerſation abroade, or in publique ſocieties, a man may profeſſe skil, or inſight in diuerſe matters without emulation or corriualſhippe, but ſhall bee inſtantly croſſed and thwarted, if he ſeeme but deſirous of acquaintance of ſome others, or knowledge of the ſame truths in different companies: ſo may our intellectiue faculty within this little world, or domeſtick common-weale euery one of vs carries a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with him, affect ſome obiects without check of any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie deſire or inclination; but others he cannot ſo much as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly think vpon without ielouſies, diſcontents, reluctations, or diſtractions. The obiects whoſe contemplations exaſperate no oppoſite propenſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, either to obſcure their apprehenſions, retradate their aſſent, or dull their impreſſion, are matters moſt abſtract from vſe of moral, or religious life, eſpecially the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematiques, whereunto many Gentlemen are happily there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore moſt addicted, becauſe the moſt curteous ſtudies they could conuerſe with.

Knowledge of generall Theorems breeds a longing after more particular corrolaries, or concluſions; which from the higheſt to the loweſt, as little controule any ambitious thought or wanton purpoſe, as the moſt vniuerſal principles in that faculty: So is it not in moral <hi>diſcipline,</hi> no not in the moſt vſeful Poets or Hiſtorians: in which many things wil often apply themſelues: and ſuch as delight in the general, wil be loath to diue too farre into particulars, leaſt
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:7895:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they find the pictures of their owne paſsions or reſolutions tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken, or ſuch characters of their manners, as ſeeme ill-fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red whiles they behold others, ſtigmatized or branded with them, All truth notwithſtanding is in it ſelfe delightfull, euen <hi>pabulum animae, the ſoules food,</hi> as the heathen obſerued: and the knowledge of particulars rightly detiued from the generals in euery faculty, in it ſelfe moſt pleaſant. But vnto diſtempered ſoules the apprehenſions of ſuch ſlender abſtract truthes, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperate no internall humours, reliſh beſt: as doth ſmall drinke or water to ſicke, or aguiſh bodies; although the chiefe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or profit either bring, is onely mitigation of preſent paine: But whiles we deſcend to particular applications in moralities; <hi>obſequium amicos, adulation</hi> (which is but a branch of falſehood) <hi>findes beſt entertainment:</hi> becauſe corrupt affection would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend its owne praiſes true, and all true imputation falſe: <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritas odium parit, Truth</hi> is excluded as an vnwelcome gueſt; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe diſtaſtfull vnto ſenſuall in-bred humours or deſires, which like wanton Strumpets hauing gotten poſſeſſion of the mariage bed, bring our ſoules out of loue with ſuch obiects, as they haue been affianced vnto by yeelding ful <hi>Aſſent</hi> vnto the generalities, whence they naturally and lineally deſcend.

                  <p n="12">12. Hence if it be demanded whether this <hi>Aſsent</hi> of faith do eſpecially belong to the ſpeculatiue or practique vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, or vnto the will (ſuppoſing the vſe of this diſtinction late ſpecified:) the demaund, if generall, is captious. For in reſpect of ſome obiects it may be referred to the wil, in reſpect of others to the vnderſtanding, or in reſpect of the generals to the one, in reſpect of the particulars to the other. As our <hi>Aſſent</hi> vnto the Article of creation and reſurrection ſcarce admits any poſitiue repugnancie of affection, or inbred deſire; the onely cauſe of mens diſtruſt to them is a meere natural imperfection of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, or a ſpeculatiue error ſpringing from broken and impertinent inductions, as ſhall hereafter be declared. But our <hi>Aſſent</hi> vnto the Articles of the laſt iudgement and eternall life,

with the particulars concerning Chriſts death and paſsion, is vſually aſſaulted by oppoſite affections. <hi>So when</hi> S. Paul <hi>reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of righteouſneſſe, temperance, and iudgement to come; Felix</hi> trembled and anſwered; <note n="a" place="margin">

                     <hi>Goe thy way for this time, when I haue a conuenient ſeaſon I will call for thee:</hi> the reaſon of this reſolution is plaine: For if the roote of this former diſtinction be properly in the obiect onely, not in the faculty; we cannot abſolutely aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe faith ſo to the ſpeculatiue as to exclude it from the practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que vnderſtanding, or ſo to the vnderſtanding at al, as to bereaue the wil of its preſence; ſeeing all theſe make but one faculty: But well may one and the ſame habit, or it acts though all ſeated in one and the ſame indiuiduall or indiuiſible faculty receiue di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers denominations from references vnto obiects of different nature. This imagination of plurality in cauſes or faculties, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned onely from extrinſecall denominations, giuen vnto them from diuerſities proper onely to their obiects or effects (as we often miſtake in thinking bodies to be in the place of their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,) is ſuch a tranſcendent perpetuall error, as he that will take warning of it in his yonger daies, may in contemplations morall, naturall, or theologicall, haue immediate and free acceſſe to truth, into whoſe preſence others ſeldome are admitted, but after long windings and turnings by vnneceſſary diſtinctions or diuiſions, and yet after all ſcarce euer ſee her but masked in terms of art.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. But euen in matters either by nature ſo abſtract, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe ſo generall, that our apprehenſion of them, or <hi>Aſſent</hi> vnto them cannot be directly hindred by any contrary naturall inclinations, we may often finde great incumbrances from indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect or accidentall oppoſitions. Thus deſire of glory, or hope of victory in ſcholaſtique encounters, moues men often to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime the truth which others haue found out, or well illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; whereunto notwithſtanding they would quickly yeelde their firme <hi>Aſſent,</hi> might the glory of the inuention be reputed theirs, or were it no preiudice to their high eſteeme of their owne wits to learne of others. For this reaſon I haue knowne of good ſcholars, ſome out of iealouſies leaſt their diſcoueries ſhould be publiſhed in anothers name, ſome out of charitie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraine diſcourſe, amongſt ſuch as too much delight or glory in
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:7895:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that faculty, for the moſt part ſo willing to contradict others ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruations, that a man can hardly put forth a truth before them without danger of thruſting them into the oppoſite error. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neither was it deſire of gaine nor loue of pleaſure, nor any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther carnall affection beſides this fooliſh hope of vaine-glory or delight ariſing from curioſity of ſpeculation, that of late hath tempted ſome to misbelief in the Article of the bleſſed Trinity. The admirable vnity of perpetuall <hi>Aſſent,</hi> to which great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, amongſt ſuch bitter diſſentions as are this day maintained by diuers Churches in moſt other points of Chriſtian ſaith: I haue euer more aſcribed to want of direct oppoſitions, vnto any carnal affection or reſolution much beneficiall to the chiefe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagers of affaires through Chriſtendom; then vnto poſitiue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion or true feare and reuerence of that great maieſty, which all haue ſo long profeſſed to be one in Three. For, did this vnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous conſent in that graund miſtery amongſt parties otherwiſe diſcordant, ſpring from theſe liuely rootes of true religion; all ſorts would be afraid ſo grieuouſly to diſhonour his name by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hereſies, and ſuch vnchriſtian reſolutions, as to maintaine with profeſſion of allegeance vnto Chriſt is worſe, then once for all to renounce him. Could the abridgement of honour, due either to the Sonne or holy Ghoſt, haue brought as great reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes to the Papacie, as toleration of ſtewes, or filthy practice of Indulgences: the acknowledgement of either perſon as God, had been held long ſince a ſinne more grieuous then fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, adultery, oridolatrie. Euen we of reformed Churches, as many as ſincerely adore <hi>that glorious Vnity in the power of Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie,</hi> haue iuſt cauſe to ſing daily prayſes to Him; that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of three perſons in one Deitie was not ſo grieuous an e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But vnto me (as to our Apoſtle) it euer hath bin and euer ſhal be matter of ioy &amp; conſolation, that the doctrine of Chriſt and of his Goſpell, whether of pretence, or ſincerely is euery way maintained, though by the pouerty and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:7895:44" rendition="simple:additions"/>
affliction of his true diſciples. For vnleſſe hope of worldly gaine, or other reſpects had moued Chriſtian Princes, and their Stateſ-men, to ſhake off the yoke of Romiſh ciuill tyranny: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer had her blaſphemous poſitions been publiquely held in ſuch deteſtation, as now they are. Whence, hardly could anie doctrine of diuels haue beene diſtaſtfull to our diſtempered ſoules, which had vnaware ſucked deadly poiſon with our firſt nurſes milke. If Princes againe or Potentates, had not held the doctrine of the Trinity as an ancient religious cuſtome, no way preiudiciall, but rather aduantagious to their ſtates, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore religiouſly to be obſerued: either diſcontented Prelates croſſed in their ambitious hopes of honour, or ſuch curious contemplators as hold ciuil honour in contempt, out of vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious affectation of fame amongſt poſterity, by new inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions had wrought the <hi>maior</hi> part of Chriſtendome to their fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo as Arrianiſme or ſome worſe hereſie, had long ere this been eſtabliſhed by nationall conſtitutions.</p>
                  <p n="14">14 The neceſſitie of theſe collections depends vpon the vnqueſtionable truth of this <hi>maxim,</hi> which in the ſequell will manifeſt it ſelfe: that carnall deſires, or reſolutions of equall ſtrength are alwaies a like forcible to weaken, alter or inuert our <hi>Aſſent</hi> to any one point of beliefe, as to another, if the oppoſition be a like direct; and our beliefe is of it ſelfe ſooneſt miſ-led, or infeebled in matters moſt remote from light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as is the Article of the Trinity. This obſeruation of diuerſe coniunctions, or oppoſitions betwixt mens carnall affections and ſeuerall points of beliefe, is the chiefe part of Sathans aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie; whereby he forecaſts the fall of moſt in ſundry ages, by meanes in ſhew moſt contrary, in iſſue the ſame. <note place="margin">

It is a rule againe as cleere and indeficient, that either ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bituall neglect of particular duties enioined, or indulgent prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of euill forbidden by Gods word, do as euidently euince
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:7895:44"/>
want of true faith in profeſſed Chriſtians; as oppugnation of the whole frame of Chriſtianity doth in infidels, or of ſome principall parts in Arch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>heretiques. Difference there is betwixt them, none in the internall conſtitution of the minde, onely the doctrine of faith by alteration of times, publicke conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or references to ſom priuate ends, gets a coniunction with the ones predominant carnall affections, retaining oppoſition with the others.. The reaſon of both aſſertions is perſpicuous to the intelligent: for ſeeing ſupernaturall obiects compared with others, exceed them further in worth then in certainty or credibility; we muſt if rightly, both certainly and firmly <hi>Aſſent</hi> vnto them, not onely as truer then any arguments can bee brought againſt them, but as much better then any profit, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, or other good, the world, fleſh or diuell can profer vnto vs. Both parts of this certaine and firme <hi>Aſſent</hi> muſt be vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſal in reſpect of the obiect, and perpetuall in reſpect of time: for as he is not to be held an orthodoxal profeſſor that acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth the ſpeculatiue, or general diuine truth of all the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles in his Creed, or matters propoſed by the word of God, whiles none gaine-ſayes, but doubts or recants while the aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary oppugnes them: ſo is he not to be reputed a ſincere faithful chriſtian, but rather tainted with hypocriſie that aſſents vnto the goodnes of diuine precepts whiles temptations are far off; but diſeſteems them in the choice, whiles they come in competition with ſenſual pleaſure, worldly goods, ciuil honour, eſtimation or the like. And if we could perſwade our ſelues to a liking of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture phraſe, which doubtleſſe hath a more freſh and liuely form of wholſome doctrine then <hi>Aquinas ſummes,</hi> or his followers <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes:</hi> this <hi>Aſſent</hi> vnto diuine matters, (eſpecially ſuch as pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly concerne mans ſaiuation), as perpetually <hi>good,</hi> is a more eſſentiall part of Chriſtian faith, then the acknowledgement of their truth, which is a difference proper to an orthodoxall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor of Chriſtianity, but remote to a faithfull man or true Chriſtian as he is diſtinct, not onely from Infidels or Hereticks, but from Libertines or Hippocrites. Thus defect in practice is cenſured by the ſpirit of God for vnfaithfulneſſe, albeit euery omiſſion of good, or commiſſion of euil doth not conuince the delinquent of abſolute infidelity; nor is euery intemperate, or
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:7895:45"/>
incontinent act, a iuſt imputation of incontinencie, or intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rancy. But as euery partiall defect is a degree, or portion of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſſe: ſo if the delinquencie bee habituall without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe, or ioined with indulgence, it truly denominates the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquent an Infidel in his ſight that knowes his heart. So the Pſalmiſt vſually ſtiles the wicked and obſtinate <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> by the name of <hi>Heathens;</hi> albeit they renounced not the profeſsion of the true God.</p>

The fundamentall act, or radicall qualification of Faith for the formall generall ſeruice, is the ſtedfaſt acknowledgements of Gods Being and Bounty. <hi>For he that commeth to God muſt belieue that he is, and that hee is a rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him.</hi> This is a tranſcendent <hi>maxim,</hi> wherein <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>goodneſſe</hi> are ſo apparently coincident, that to <hi>Aſſent</hi> vnto it as <hi>true,</hi> and not as <hi>good</hi> to the party aſſenting, implies an euident contradiction.

Euery child of <hi>Adam</hi> is an old man from his birth, iuſt of <hi>Barzillahs</hi> temper, without all taſt of ſuch dainties as the <hi>great</hi> King hath prouided for him. All of vs by nature herein worſe then his decrepit age, that we neuer had any true relliſh of them: but ſoit is with vs (vntill regenerated) as if we ſhould imagine one grieuouſly diſtempered from his cradle; to whom others may truly commend ſundry meates for ſweet and wholeſome, which notwithſtanding prooue diſtaſtfull &amp; bitter to his palate, albeit, from a good opinion of their loue and honeſty, that vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon experience commend them to him, ſtill retaining a confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed aſſent to ſuch goodneſſe in them as he cannot perceiue but gueſſes at; as many well diſpoſed naturall men doe at the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the bread of life, not diſtruſting the reports of others that ſo much magnifie it, yet erring as much in their conceipt of it, as he, that had neuer ſeene houſe or towne better built then the thatched cottages of that poore village wherein hee was borne, ſhould in his imaginations of <hi>London, Venice,</hi> or ſome like famous Citie: whoſe error beſt appeares when hee comes to compare his former fancies with the diſtinct view or ſight of their greatneſſe, their ſtately and magnificent buildings. Now as our naturall life beginnes and is maintained by bodily taſt: ſo is the <hi>new man</hi> framed and nouriſhed in vs by this taſt ſpirituall; which onely rightly apprehends the nature, worth and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of heauenly myſteries, it ſelfe conſiſting in a temper of mind ſymbolizing with diuine goodneſſe, or with the heauenly mind of the ſecond <hi>Adam.</hi> Our ſoules and affections thus affected, haue the ſame proportion to the ſeuerall branches of Gods will reuealed, that euery ſence or faculty hath to it proper obiect; and this apprehenſion of our ſpirituall food by a proper, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, ſymbolicall conceipt of it goodneſſe, is the laſt, and moſt eſſentiall difference wherein the nature of faith, as Chriſtian conſiſts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which cannot poſſibly be wrought but by the ſpirit of God. For as the obiect is, ſuch muſt the aſſent be, ſupernaturall;

otherwiſe it cannot haue that proportion to food ſpirituall, that bodily taſt hath to naturall. The particular manner of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits working this alteration in our ſoules, is a myſtery, at the leaſt to my ſimplicitie, inſcrutable. To the capacity of the vulgar we may reſemble his working in generall to a Phiſitian, that reſtores one deſperately ſicke, and vtterly deſtitute of taſt, to a right rel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh and appetite of his meate; partly by remouing the diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered humours, wherein that ſence of life lay buried, partly by reuiuing his dead ſpirits, by inſuſing of ſome pretious water. Anſwerable to one of theſe meanes is the infuſion of ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall grace, which quickeneth vs vnto life, making vs <hi>new men</hi> in CHRIST IESVS; anſwearable to the other is practice of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary meanes, appointed by God for mortification of the <hi>old man;</hi> all which without the operation of the ſpirit are nothing auaileable. What is required on our parts that are patients, is handled in the third ſection of this Booke. Whether ability by nature we haue any, or any cooperatiue with Gods ſpirit in this cure, ſhall (by the diuine aſſiſtance) be diſputed at large in the ſeauenth Booke of theſe Commentaries. Here at length we may define, <hi>the faith by which the iuſt doth liue,</hi> to be a <hi>firme</hi> and <hi>conſtant aſſent</hi> or <hi>adherence,</hi> vnto the mercies and louing kindnes of the Lord, or generally to the <hi>ſpirituall food</hi> exhibited in his ſacred word, as much better then this life it ſelfe and all the content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments it is capable of, <hi>grounded</hi> vpon a <hi>taſt</hi> (or reliſh) of the ſweetneſſe, <hi>wrought</hi> in the ſoule or heart of man by the <hi>Spirit of Chriſt.</hi> The termes for the moſt part are the <note n="*" place="margin">

Nor doth this argue the meanes or pledges of ſaluation ſhould be leſſe euident then matters ſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificall, ſo long as this habit or conſtitution of mind is not eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by interpoſition of carnall luſts, or earthly thoughts; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto our euidence of ſpiritual matters is more obnoxious, then our ſpeculatiue perſwaſions of abſtract entities: ſo is our bodily taſte oftener corrupted then the ſight, and yet that <hi>Aſſent</hi> wee giue in perfect health vnto the diſtinct quality of wholſome food, no leſſe euident or certaine, then that wee giue vnto the true differences of things ſeene. The minde once thus illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated with grace, and renewed by faith, whiles not darkned by exhalations from our naturall corruptions, whiles free from paſſion or motion of bad affection, actually moued and aſſiſted by the ſpirit; hath the ſame proportion to truth ſupernaturall of this inferiour ranke, that the vnderſtanding without ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall concourſe, or illumination of grace, hath to Obiects meerely naturall; nor can it diſſent from the truth, whiles this temper or conſtitution laſts, as the Ieſuite imagines. Howbeit, ſo great euidence of matters ſpirituall, as others haue of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſciences, is not required in all. Onely this I dare affirme, that although it be in ſome as great, or in ſome greater: this doth not exempt their knowledge from the former definition of faith. For who would queſtion whether S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>Paul</hi> had not as great euidence of miſteries, as either <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> had of philoſophicall, or Euclide of mathematicall princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples or concluſions. And yet what they ſo euidently knew, they belieued and aſſented vnto by the ſupernaturall guifte or habit of faith: and it was the greater euidence of things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieued, which made their beliefe more firme and ſtrong then ours is, and enflamed their hearts with loue of God, and zeale of his glorie, more ardent, then our weake faith is capable of.</p>

But nature, without further alteration or qualification of any other faculty, immediatly teacheth vs to like that beſt, which beſt we relliſh and finde moſt good in. Nor skils it whether this loue, or liking of meates beſt reliſhed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide in the ſenſe of taſte it ſelfe, or from approbation of it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly reſult in ſome other faculty by way of ſympathie: both wayes this internall ſenſe or apprehenſion of want, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digence of carnall nutriment, is ſtill the only <hi>Mother</hi> of loue to bodily meates. Thus hath the folly of man, which wilfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued himſelfe of celeſtiall food, ſet forth the loue and wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, who hath made this want or indigence of ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all meate, whoſe apprehenſion is the firſt roote of our ſpirituall ſenſe, a meane to quicken our taſte or reliſh of his mercies, and louing kindneſſe, which is the principall obiect of that faith, by which we liue.

Alwaies the better opinion we retaine of this paſſiue fidelity, or faithfulnes, the greater is our actiue faith, truſt, or repoſall in it; but truſt or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in fallible, or abſolute, wee cannot haue in any mortall man. For beſides that his heart or intention is vnknowne to vs, ſuch abilities as now he hath are obnoxions to change, ſo is his purpoſe and reſolution.

And vnto faithfull reliance and repoſall on his promiſes, wee are tied by a triple bond of faith, which cannot poſſibly breake or vntwine, once ſurely fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened.

Albeit I hold it not worth the inquirie, whether the name of <hi>Faith</hi> in the Hebrew, Greeke and Latine, were propagated from the obiect to our apprehenſion, or <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent;</hi> or from theſe vnto the obiect: for in all three tongues faith is taken as well for that which deſerues credit, as for the credence we giue vnto it. More pertinent to our preſent occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions it is that beliefe, euen in ſcriptures is ſometimes applied to the very firſt, and loweſt degree of <hi>Aſſent</hi> vnto truths diuine; and they are ſayd to belieue, that acknowledge any article of faith, or part of Chriſts doctrine, as true; albeit the ground of their <hi>Aſsent</hi> were not ſincere or ſound, but rather humorous. So it is ſayd in the ſecond of <note n="b" place="margin">Joh. 2. 24</note> 
                     <hi>Iohn, that many when they ſaw his Miracles belieued in him: but</hi> IESVS <hi>committed not himſelfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their hands; becauſe hee knewe them all:</hi> ſo did hee their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours to bee like theirs, that vpon like beliefe of his power would haue made him king.

The ſame analogie the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers retaine in the vſe of <hi>beliefe</hi> or <hi>faith.</hi> That the <hi>Pontificians</hi> can alledge their teſtimonies, to proue faith may bee ſeparated from works or charity; is as little pertinent to the point in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion betwixt vs and them, as it would bee in the ſchooles to vrge the authority of late Philoſophers, that ſtones and mettals did not growe, or that trees and plants had no locall motion, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him that out of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> did maintaine, all bodies endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with life were capable of growth and diminution, or all with ſenſe, of locall motion. He that holds the former concluſions, would account ſtones and mettals amongſt bodies inanimate, and trees and plants amongſt vnſenſitiue. Now our queſtion is not of euery ſort, or degree of faith, but of that by which the Iuſt doe liue. That no Father did affirme it ſhould be without fruites, or workes of holineſſe, is more then my ſmall reading in them can ſecure me to affirme; albeit reaſon I haue none to thinke otherwiſe: but iuſt cauſe ſo to preſume, by the places our aduerſaries alleadge, ſo idle they are and impertinent.

Eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one was giuen to magnifie the guifts wherein hee excelled, whence (as the oratour ſaith of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Socrates</hi>) each de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in his owne faculty, deſpiſed, or which was worſe, hated and enuied his brother, as appeares from the firſt and twelfth chapters of that epiſtle. To men thus affected what duty more neceſſary to be inculcated, then loue and vnity of ſoules and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits? which for this reaſon the Apoſtle ſo forcibly preſſeth vpon them, from the vnity of that ſpirit, whence they had receiued their ſeuerall graces. Their faith was fruitfull enough in wonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous workes, in healing, in excellency of ſpeeches, diueiſitie of tongues and learned diſplaies of diuine myſteries. What was the reaſon? Becauſe they were deſirous of fame and glory, by mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of their skill in theſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and faith, though of it ſelfe but weake, works ſtrongly when it hath coniunction with ſtrong na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall affections, or is ſtirred vp by vehement deſires:</p>
                  <p n="5">5. But that their faith was not fitly quallified for the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of life and ſauing health, not ſuch as could iuſtifie them in the ſight of God, though able to magnifie his name before the heathen, and declare his wonderfull power, is euident, in that it

did not commaund, but rather ſerue their vainglorious deſires or hopes of praiſe amongſt men. The ſtronger it was the prou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der were they, and more ambitious, and the more ſuch, the more diſſentious, ſo as the ſtrength of faith, whiles it ſwaied this way; did ouerbeare the naturall inclination to brotherly loue and kindneſſe: the vertue and praiſe whereof not with men on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but with God, had they knowne or rightly valued, it would haue enflamed their hearts with greater loue of it, then of that popular oſtentation they ſought after.

For this was a diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſo well reſembling the nature of God, and ſuch a peculiar gift of his ſpirit, as the naturall man could not poſſibly diſcerne the vertue of it. If by the ſame faith that they already had; then the ſame faith which with loue doth iuſtifie, did really exiſt without loue in theſe Corinthians vntill this time; which no proteſtant muſt grant.

[That faith which iuſtifies cannot poſſibly be without charity,] we may interprete our ſelues thus; faith, if it be in ſuch a degree as is required for iuſtification, or right apprehenſion of Gods mercies in Chriſt, is alwaies neceſſarily attended vpon with a correſpondent meaſure of Chriſtian loue, yet <note n="*" place="margin">If the Reader well obſerue the nature and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of faith before explicated he cannot poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly bee ignorant that euery leaſt degree of faith brings forth a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rreſpondent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of loue, that it is as impoſſible loue ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe without a correſponde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of faith precedent, as that inequality betwixt two ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects ſhould grow greater without any variation of their quantities<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

For may not hee be ſaid to profit in learning, that brings his opinions to perfect ſcience: albeit the eſſences of opinion and ſciences be diſtinct? Or who would denie him to be a good proficient in moralities, that brings the ſeed of chaſtitie vnto continency, continencie vnto the habit of temperance. The matter in all is but one, the progreſſe moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, yet not without ſome reſts or ſtations, by which the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall inclination or affection remaines neither ſo altogether the ſame, nor ſo quite different: but the old diſtinction of <hi>materially</hi> and <hi>formaly</hi> might reſolue the doubt. Euery new addition of v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities to numbers, or of Angles to figures, alters their formes, but aboliſheth not the vnities or Angles prae exiſtent.

Theſe Couſeners made the people ofttimes thinke ſome Saint had moued or ſpoken, when a knaue did ſtirre the image, or vent his own vnhallowed breath through it or about it: and Satan makes them beleeue they are moued by the ſpirit of God, in ſuch actions as are not enſpired by faith, but thruſt vpon them by his wicked Angels. Workes of charity they eſteeme all ſuch as outwardly reſemble the actions of Chriſt or his Saints, though conceiued not by faith but vpon other motiues; as motion infuſed by art may to the eye of man exactly counterfeit motion naturall. This is a maine branch of that great miſtery of iniquity; For by this error, as their faith is neuer reuiued, ſo their workes though faire and pompous in outward ſhew, and ſuch as would be moſt pleaſant vnto their God, did they ſpring from minds and affections renewed by liuely faith, being ſuperadded onely to this dead faith, neither can perfect it nor receiue perfection from it, but become like ſweet flowers, vſually put vpon dead corps, the <hi>ſent</hi> of whoſe corruptions, hinder they may for a time, but ſurer at length to participate thereof then communicate their fragrancieto it.</p>

Thus much the word of God will warrant, that the portion of hypocrites ſhall be the bittereſt in the life to come. And yet hypocriſie, if it be of that ſtampe which our Sauiour ſo much condemnes, is alwaies moulded in

that deepe notice, or ſtrong perſwaſion which men haue of their owne loue, and others oppoſition vnto diuine truthes; of their owne diligence, and others negligence in performance of ſundry duties expreſly required by Gods lawe. And this is a miſerie of miſeries peculiar to the hypocrite; that, whereas the height of others impiety ariſeth from their oppoſing the way of truth and godlineſſe; this monſter the more he deteſts falſehood and error, or the impietie, whether of others practiſes or opinions, the more ſtill he increaſeth his owne corruption, and warres vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wittingly againſt his owne ſoule. For ſeeing loue to himſelfe, indulgence to his deare affections, or carnall glorying in prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiues, perhaps ſpirituall, is the common roote, as well of his imaginary loue vnto ſuch points of truth as haue ſome kinde of coniunction with his humours, as of the deteſtation he beares to others obliquities, that in life or profeſſion ill conſort with him; the oftener he lookes, either on their knowne tranſgreſſions, or his owne preciſe obſeruance of ſuch duties as by nature hee is addicted, or otherwiſe accuſtomed to, by both meanes he more pampers and nouriſhes that vicious habit, whence the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned bad fruites did growe.

of this diſeaſe was moſt conſpicuous in the fall of Gods choſen people, whom wee may without ſuſpition of ſlaunder (ſeeing the holy Ghoſt hath written the obſeruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) ſafely charge with the infection: yet the danger of it, amongſt all profeſſors of true religion throughout euery age and nation, continues the ſame, as hauing a perpetuall cauſe in nature. For whether wee ſpeake of contraries morall, or phiſicall, the enmities of the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treames</hi> is alwaies greater, then betwixt them and the <hi>meane;</hi> from which they alwaies ſo much further decline, as they more eagerly entend their force each againſt other. The greater ſtrength heate and cold from their vicinity gather, (whether by mutual irritation, or a ſecret kinde of daring each other to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, or by a ſtricter vnition of the materiall parts wherein their forces lodge) the more both diſagree with the luke-warme tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.

And as the mutuall diſcord of <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treames,</hi> grows greater by the increaſe of their ſeueral ſtrengths; ſo the haſtie, or violent introduction of the one into a ſubiect capable of both, makes waie for the others entertainment, and excludes the meane, which findes no entrance but where it is v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhered by moderation. So water, too much, or too violently heated is more apt to freeze then to retaine the middle temper. Young prodigalls we often ſee turne old niggards, ſeldome li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall, vnleſſe their education haue been exceeding good, their naturall diſcretion extraordinary, or the ſeeds of vertue in them very ſtrong. And what more vſuall, then for a niggards feaſt (becauſe not agreeable to his ordinary diſpoſition) to ſmell of waſte and prodigalitie? Buzzards, by naturall conſtitution, through extreamity enforced to take heart and turne againe, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerrunning valour, boiſterouſly ruſh into fury.

For contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie exſtreames alwaies ſpring from one roote, and though the natures, wherein they are, be much different in reſpect of their maſſe or ſubſtance; yet the forme of contrariety is the ſame, euen in materiall and immateriall entities, conſiſting in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>competibleneſſe betweene the actuall motions of two oppoſite inclinations, both in a ſubiect capable of both, ſo faſtened in one center, that the depreſſion of the one is the eleuation of the other. Whence it is, that the violent, or intenſiue agitation of the one, once come to the point of reflexion, breedes a like motion in the other, as the ſharper froſt by night makes more ſlippery waies by day; ſofteſt waies in moiſt winters ſurbeate the ſoreſt in dry Summers: the farther or ſwifter we mooue one part of a ballance one way, the farther and ſwifter it moues it ſelfe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the oppoſite point at the rebound.

The conſonancy of their morall precepts with the ſacred rules of the lawe, the Prophets, and Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, was ſuch, that had they conuerſed with our Sauiour, and ſeene his doctrine ſo truely acted in his life, they could not, without contradiction of their owne principles, but haue admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his wiſedome and magnified his conſtant vnaffected con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of all applauſe from men, or of ſuch vaine faſhions or cuſtomes, as the gentry of that world highly eſteemed, but theſe Philoſophers vſually derided; not without iuſt ſuſpicion of ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter or prepoſterous deſires of catching that glory at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound, which they ſeemed to neglect whiles it naturally fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their hands, or mooued it ſelfe directly towards them; as if they had held the ſtelth or vnderhand receipt of it more lawful or pleaſant, then the purchaſe of it in the open market.

To ſuch as looke vpon the profeſſors themſelues, or meaſure their goodneſſe by their locall vicinity vnto truth, there is great difference in ſhew, none in ſubſtance to ſuch as obſerue the identitie of their motiues to embrace oppoſite religions. He that ſhould a farre off ſee three men of equall ſtature walking together, the firſt in the ordinarie path, the ſecond on a bench twelue inches higher, the third in an alley as much below it, not acquainted with the aduantage or diſaduantage of ground which one had of another, would think there were great difference in their height, which notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding would be the ſame if they changed walkes, or none at all if they ſtood all vpon one leuel.

All the differences betwixt them, is in the lawes or cuſtomes of their countries, none in the internall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution or qualification of their ſoules, which, though one and the ſame, may incline the heart of the <hi>Iew,</hi> the <hi>Turke,</hi> the <hi>Papiſt</hi> and the <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> alike firmly to embrace the religion wherein each hath beene brought vp, and proſecute contrary obiects with equall ſtrength of the ſame corrupt deſires.

Were wee but as well acquainted with the fundamentall points of our profeſſion, as other profeſſors are with theirs we mighted eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crie, it was the politician that fooliſhly dreames hee can mould ſtates in his braine, and Paracelcuſ-like giue life immortall to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane bodies polliticke, which ſtill ſpoiles the faſhion of the Chriſtian world by taking vpon him to be a grand Phyſician where he ſhould be but Gods Apothecary, or to be architect or chiefe plotter of thoſe edifices, wherein he ſhould be but a labourer or handworker, continually expecting the direction and inſtruction of that Maiſter builder, which laid the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in <hi>Sion.</hi> We our ſelues often know the matter or ſtaffe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as alſo the tooles wherewith we ſee Artificers worke, yet can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not learne their skill or cunning, but ſhould be ill fauouredly ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued if wee tooke vpon vs to make thoſe vtenſiles our ſelues, which they doe for vs. Thus albeit the inſtruments or inferiour agents God vſeth to effect his will bee conſpicuous and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; his wiſdome notwithſtanding in their diſpoſall or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triuance is incomprehenſible to fleſh and blood, and it is a mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to thinke the like ſecondary meanes ſhould alwaies pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the ſame effects.

Nor is it (as ſome haue either erroniouſly taught, or others conceiued from their writings) the goodneſſe of the end whereon our intentions or deſires are ſet, but the ſemblable grounds or like proportion thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, which rightly diſtinguiſheth them from heathen, naturall or meerely morall, and denominates them truely good and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. <note n="*" place="margin">Vide Sect. 3. ca. 2. parag. 2. &amp; cap 8. parag. 40.</note> All wiſdome or policy imploied in Chriſts cauſe or with intention of good vnto his Church, is not truely Chriſtian, but that onely which begins in the vnfaigned feare of God, and is vertually moued in the ſtrength and feruency of faithfull prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for his direction and aſſiſtance, who thus ſued vnto, neuer failes to proſper the endeauours of men otherwiſe weake and ſimple; not at all or negligently conſulted, alwaies delights to confound the wiſdome of the wiſe, and bring to nought the Counſell of the crafty Politician, or mighty ſtateſ-man.

For this cauſe as in the laſt diſcourſe was obſerued, that good affection which men of diſpoſition candide and ingenuous alwaies beare vnto the memorable vertues of men deceaſed or farre abſent, well deſeruing of the world or them, adminiſtring no occaſion of diſlike, doth preſently ſeeke vpon the firſt ſight of his legend to faſten it ſelfe vpon our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, in whom nothing truely admirable or praiſe worthy, but is ideally abſolute and perfect.

But, as was inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated, the forme of this temptation is in diuers well minded, the ſame.

but rather from a ſecret working of the ſoule, conſcious of it eternall want and penury of works beſt pleaſing God, which ſhe thus ſeekes to recompeaſe by extraordinary di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence in ſuch duties as ſhall not much diſpleaſe herſelfe, or preiudice her ſweet delights, or alter her moſt familiar purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Thus did the <hi>Iewes,</hi> from whom this diſeaſe deſcends, hope to repaire their want of mercie with multitude of ſacrifices, no leſſe neceſſarily required by the lawe then ſermons are by the Goſpell. And the ſtomacke, when it either hath no ſolid food, or is vnable to digeſt it, wil naturally deſire to fill it ſelfe though with water or ſuch light meats as breed nought but winde.

Or would we be as obſeruant of our demeanure to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward God, as we are of it towards men, or their deportment to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward vs, we could not long remaine in ignorance, that our <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent</hi> vnto generall principles of faith, or future practiſes of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties enioyned, doe oft-times appeare greater, then indeed they are, from our proneneſſe inſlantly to tranſgreſſe in ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, which to proſecute without checke or incumbrance we hardly could without making our ſelues faire promiſes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation in time to come. For apprehenſion, or feare of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, either finall or totall, cannot but curbe the vnruly appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites of fleſh and blood in ſuch as haue any touch of conſcience or religion. In theſe allurements we intreat our conſciences, as men intentiue vpon waighty buſineſſe do cumberſome gueſts or importunate ſollicitours (if ſuch as in ciuility they muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect) making faire proffers they will bee for them againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time, to be quit of them for the preſent.

The reaſon in this and the former caſe is the ſame: eager deſire of proſecuting what they had in hand without interruption or delay made them more hearty then otherwiſe they would haue been in their proffers; becauſe the vnkindneſſe which might be taken, or vnciuill tearmes that might grow vpon an vncourte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous diſmiſſion, might breed vexation of mind, or vnaptneſſe to diſpatch their inſtant affaires. In like ſort, many put off their Creditors with earneſt proteſtations and ſerious purpoſes to giue them contentment ere long; but if contrary occaſions in the meane time meete them, they take vp with their promiſes and recall their purpoſes: both now are conditionall. They would bee as willing as any man liuing if they had it, and can heartily wiſh they had wherwith to giue euery man full ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. The ſame proteſtations we vſually make vnto our God, and relent from them vpon like occaſions: when new tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions do aſſault vs; we requeſt him, as <hi>Naaman</hi> did, to be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull vnto vs in ſome one or all, or if not ſimply for the ſinne, yet for the act at the preſent, and perhaps vow double diligence in his lawes for times enſuing; yea oftentimes apprehend this experience of our tranſgreſsion, and the ſting of ſinne thence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing, as a motiue to make vs more earneſt ſolicitors for grace. When as (God knowes) by ſpending the time, allotted vs for repentance, in ſuch trifling pleaſures, wee caſt our ſelues more and more behinde hand, entring further into Satan that cruell extortioners bands, alwaies diſenabling our ſelues as much to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the next temptation, as our delight hath been in yeelding to this. At length we come to deſperate debtors laſt proteſtations: If we could a baſe our ſelues in ſtooping vnto a vulgar life, or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine from ſuch pleaſures as nature and education hath made vs more capable of then others are, we could be as willing to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme anie Chriſtian duty, as the beſt: that now wee are more backward then moſt are, muſt not be thought to proceed from any leſſe eſteeme of CHRIST and his kingdome, but from multitude of great and waightie occaſions to withdrawe vs. Some againe perſwade themſelues they beare great inward af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection towards God; but yet whiles they outwardly tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe his lawes, or, at leaſt, ſhew not their loue vnto him in the practiſe, the blame muſt be laid vpon others, which indiſcreetly

croſſe them: let them haue their wils, and it ſhall be made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt vnto the world, they are both as willing and able to doe God any ſeruice, as the moſt forward profeſſor lluing. This is a temptation incident to braue minds, (ſo euery proud man thinkes his owne) paralel to <hi>Caeſars</hi> proteſtations of loue and loyaltie to <hi>Rome,</hi> when he came in armes againſt it, for thus hee deifies it amongſt the other gods.</p>

Now euery action, whereto that faith, by which we are engrafted in Chriſt, is concurrent, is in it ſelfe ſincerely and truely, though imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly good. Euery action without concurſe of ſuch faith, is in it nature bad, though of an obiect truely good; or, at the beſt, but indifferent, if the obiect be vncapable of morall good or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, and fall not within the precincts of any diuiuine comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement or prohibition. As the workes of nature depriued of influence from their proper and principall cauſes become de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectiue,

or, if the materiall or paſſiue be not ſubordinate or faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable to the formatiue or actiue cauſes, monſtrous: ſo are our moral actions either altogether deficient from the rule of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or prepoſterous and contrarie to it, vnleſſe the faculties, affections, or inclinations, whence they flow, be inſpired dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and moderated by a true and liuely faith.</p>

God commands all without exception to <hi>glorifie his name both in body and ſpirit,</hi> as well as to honour father and mother, or to abſtaine from ſtealth. Many can ſtand at open defiance with the world for any touch of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience in theſe latter, which yet if out of faith they did ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue, they would be as chaſt of their bodies, as honeſt of their hands, and equalize their diligence in duties towards their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents with deuotion towards Gods, vnto whom zealous and religious praiers from out a chaſt and pure minde, are more pleaſant then honoring of father and mother, then abſtinance from theft and coozenage. Faultineſſe or negligence in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer argues a faulty diligence in the latter; that honour ſo giu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to parents though in abundance, was but the fruite either of ſuch goodneſſe of nature as hath beene in many heathen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which neither knew God nor his lawes, or of ſome carnall hopes to get a better portion by pleaſing them: that ſuch abſtinence from theft or performance of honeſt actions were but the ofspring ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of ſecular feare to be diſgraced, or of a deſire to be well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted in the world. And whoſoeuer is either kept backe from euill, or drawne to good vpon no better motiues then theſe, wil when oportunitie ſerues, be as much emboldened by them to tranſgreſſe diuine precepts of greater conſequence. As what ſonne is there which much reuerenceth his father out of anie affection or inclination not ſeruiceable to faith, but at his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance would aduenture vpon ſuch actions as much diſhonour God, and are moſt diſpleaſant to his Sauiour? Or who is hee that refraines to defile his fingers with theft or cozenage onely becauſe they are vncleanely ſinnes, and moſt obnoxious to ſhame and diſgrace by humane lawes, but would pollute his heart with legitimated ſacriledge for maintenance of his credit, or hope of eſtimation with them whoſe applauſe or ſauour he muſt glories in?</p>

Here then is the triall of our faith, if it haue taught vs wholly to ſubmit our wils vnto his will, to like whatſoeuer hee likes, to hate whatſoeuer he hates, to loue that beſt which his word tells vs he loues moſt; and likewiſe to hate that moſt which hee moſt hates, though otherwiſe either pleaſant to our naturall diſpoſition, or not ſo diſpleaſant or diſtaſtfull as many other matters would bee, did wee follow the fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

that it is much better at all times to obey the lawe of God, than our owne affections, the luſts of the fleſh or the lawe of ſinne.

That faith is as immediately apt to do good vvorkes of euery kinde as to iuſtifie. Of the diuers acceptions of iuſtification. That the iuſtification by workes mentioned by Saint <hi>Iames</hi> is preſuppoſed as ſubordinate to Saint <hi>Paules</hi> iuſtification by faith without workes. The true reconcilement of theſe two Apoſtles contrarie ſpeeches in appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from the contrarietie of their ſeuer all ends or intentions.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Aint <hi>Paul</hi> (as is declared at large before) includes workes in faith, which Saint <hi>Iames</hi> takes as hee found it in vnfruitfull hearers deſtitute of good workes. This difference notwithſtanding alone conſidered doth no way ſalue, but rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooue the ſeeming contradiction between the one auouching and the other diſclaiming iuſtification by faith without workes, and cauſe it wholy to ſettle in Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> aſſertion, or in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Proteſtants thence deriued. For whether iuſtified we be by workes and faith as Saint <hi>Iames</hi> expreſly ſpeakes, or by a working ſaith as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> implies, this faith workes ſuch righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes, as Saint <hi>Iames</hi> requires not in others but in our ſelues. Seeing then both faith and the righteouſneſſe it workes, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent in vs, how are we not iuſtified by inherent righteouſnes, if iuſtified by ſuch a working faith as Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> commaunds, and we haue hitherto deſcribed? This which we conceiue by way of doubt, our Sauiours doctrine ſeemes to put out of all controuerſie <note n="a" place="margin">Math. 5. 20</note>

of all the Commaundements, as Saint <hi>Iames</hi> doth. The Scribes and Phariſes did as it euen ſeems then calumniate him, as they afterwards did Saint <hi>Paul</hi> (and the Pontificians do vs ſtil) as a deſtroier of the Law becauſe he reprooued their confidence in workes, and ſought to eſtabliſh the doctrine of faith which we now reach. Needfull in this reſpect was that eaueat: <note n="b" place="margin">Math. 5. 17</note>

                  <p>If by the kingdome of heauen he meant the kingdome of grace, the argument is more ſtrong then otherwiſe it would be, howſoeuer ſtrong it is, and not impeached by this reply: That ſuch obſeruance of the Commaundements, as is here required is neceſſarie to ſanctification or ſaluation not to iuſtification. That it ſhould be more neceſſary to one of theſe then to another implies a contradiction in the termes well expreſſed and equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly compared; as it doth vnto our Sauiours purpoſe, to ſay that workes are leſſe neceſſarie before iuſtification then after it. A man in that he is iuſtified is the immedia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Or if faith without workes obtaine iuſtification, hauing iuſtified vs, ſhall it not much more without them lay ſure hold on ſaluation, and all the degrees of ioy that do accompanie it? Suppoſe a man ſhould die in the very inſtant wherein he is iuſtified: none would doubt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of abſolution or ſaluation. Is he then ſaued with workes or without them? If without them our Sauiours rule doth faile vs, for this man enters into the kingdome of heauen without more ſtrict obſeruance of the Commandements then the Scribes and

Phariſees vſed, without any part of that righteouſneſſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they in ſome meaſure were partakers: If with them, their preſence is neceſſarie to iuſtification, and in order of nature before it, becauſe neceſſary ere he can be capable of entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the kingdome of heauen; as performance of euery conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is in nature precedent to the accompliſhment of what is not promiſed without it. Againe, no man denies but faith inherent in order of nature goes defore iuſtification in that ſence we take it; yet iuſtifying faith neceſſarily includes ſuch workes in it as Saint <hi>Iames</hi> requires, at the leaſt a preparation or immediate promptneſſe of minde to do them, and more then ſo was not in the worke of <hi>Abraham</hi> which he commends, ſeeing <hi>Iſaac</hi> vvas not actually facrificed but offered vp by faith vnfaigned to bee ſacrificed, and this worke or rather thus much of it did goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore iuſtification, <note n="d" place="margin">VVhat man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of caſualtie this ſpeech in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, ſee § 7.</note> either as the cauſe doth before the effect, or as the meanes before the end; for (as Saint <hi>Iames</hi> ſayth) he was iuſtified by it.

For who can thinke he reputed them for iuſt whom hee called vaine men in that they had faith without workes; the ſame faith notwithſtanding ſeconded with workes had (as our aduerſaries contend) made them iuſt, not more iuſt then before, for now they were firſt to become iuſt being before vniuſt and tranſgreſſors of the Lawe, as the Apoſtle prooues in that they had reſpect vnto perſons.

Now it is graunted by all, that he held faith without workes to be altogether vaine and vnable to iuſtifie in the ſight of God; if with them it were in his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment not ſufficient, he had denied all iuſtification in Gods ſight either by faith alone, or by workes and faith; ſo as no meanes of

Know ye not that all we which haue beene baptized into Ieſus Christ haue beene baptiſed into his death? wee are buried then with him by baptiſme into his death.</hi> All perſons baptized may be accounted iuſtified in the ſame ſence they are dead to ſinne: and dead all ſuch are to ſinne, not really or actually, but by profeſsion, in as much as by receiuing this outward ſeale of Gods couenant, or other like pledges of his fauour, they binde themſelues to abrogate the ſoueraigntie of ſinne in their mortall bodies, and to giue their members weapons of righteouſneſſe vnto God. Thus when the Apoſtle ſpeakes indefinitely of all their ſaluation or iuſtification, to whom he writes, his meaning can be no other then this, that all of them haue receiued vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted pledges of Gods mercy and neede doubt of iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion actuall, or finall abſolution, ſo they walke worthy of their calling. Their error whoſe rectification Saint <hi>Iames</hi> ſought, did conſiſt in holding theſe outward ſeales or conſpicuous tokens of Gods fauour, whereby their <hi>Aſsent</hi> vnto his promiſes as true was confirmed, ſufficient to finall approbation or admiſsion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the inheritance of <hi>Saints,</hi> albeit they did not conſent vnto e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery part of the Law as good in the practiſe. Concerning iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication thus taken, there is at this day little or no controuerſie, vnleſle betweene the ſpirit and the fleſh, or betweene our owne conſcience and Sathan, who ſtill labours to perſwade vs this kinde of iuſtification might ſuffice. Thirdly, in as much as God decreed to iuſtifie man by faith which euen in ſuch as are ſaued by it is not ordinarily perfected in a moment, we are ſaid ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to be iuſtified, when the firſt ſeeds of that faith, which by taking firme roote by fructification or perfection, added by the immediate hand of God becomes ſaluificall, are firſt ſowne in our hearts. Hee that hath but a reſolution, for the preſent, ſyncere, though variable, to walke in all the waies of his God, is in ſcripture often inſtiled iuſt or righteous, and may by this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution or purpoſe be truely ſaid iuſtified in the ſight of God, not abſolutely, but in reſpect of oppoſite prophaneneſſe or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe diſsimulation. <note place="margin">

of God; and ſeeing they teach remiſſion of ſinnes to conſiſt in the extirpation or expulſion of them they may in congruitie affirme that ſinne is formally, at leaſt immediately, remitted by habituall grace or righteouſneſſe inherent, and remitted by CHRIST onely as the efficient cauſe which meriteth this mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of grace, in the ſame forme of ſpeech that the ſchooles tell vs that <hi>cold</hi> is expelled out of the <hi>water</hi> by the <hi>fire</hi> as by the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, but formally or immediatly by the heat which the fire produceth in the water. Although perhaps it may be a queſtion whether the expulſion of cold out of the water or of ſinne out of our bodies (conſonantly to their doctrine) can haue any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per formall cauſe or onely an efficient by reſultance; but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund of vs what is the formall cauſe of iuſtification by which our ſinnes are formally remitted, is as if we ſhould aske one of their young pupils what were Latine for <hi>manus. Iuſtification</hi> taken, (as we doe it) for remiſſion of ſinnes not by inherent righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe or ought within vs immediatly incompetible with them, but by the externall merits of Chriſt, is a forme or entity as ſimple as any formall cauſe can be, and ſimple or vncompoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded entities can neither haue formall cauſes or ought in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion anſwearing to them. Wherefore as I ſaid it is either the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie or knauery of our aduerſaries to demaund a formall cauſe of their iuſtification that deny themſelues to beformallie iuſt in the ſight of God. For ſo to be iuſt and to bee iuſt onely by accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance or non-imputation of vniuſtice are tearmes as oppoſite as can bee imagined.

To be formally iuſt we for theſe reaſons attribute onely vnto Chriſt who alone hath ſuch righteouſneſſe inherent in himſelfe as by the interpoſition of it betweene Gods iuſtice and ſinfull fleſh doth ſtop the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding of his iudgements, as <hi>Phinehas</hi> zeale did ſtay the plague, otherwiſe ready to deuoure the hoſt of <hi>Iſraell.</hi> Our aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in that they acknowledge inherent righteouſneſſe to be the ſole formall cauſe of iuſtification doe by the ſame aſſertion ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily graunt it to be the ſole true immediate cauſe of remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion

                  <p n="2">2. When we teach iuſtification by faith and not by workes, our meaning is, by the doctrine of faith wee are bound to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge and confeſſe that CHRIST IESVS by his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Prieſthood (whoſe offices in their ſeuerall places ſhall bee expreſſed) is not onelie the ſole meritorious cauſe of all graces or righteouſneſſe inherent, requiſite to finall abſolution but theſe ſuppoſed in the party to bee abſolued hee is likewiſe the ſole immediate cauſe of finall abſolution or iuſtification.

In this ſort doe ſinfull men drawe life from CHRIST by faith alone, by which likewiſe and not by workes, wee are ſayd to abide in him as being vnited in ſpirit to him, albeit by abiding ſo vnited our other faculties are ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened and viuificated to bring forth the fruits of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. The former inſtance, notwithſtanding, doth not exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifie the firſt part of our Aſſertion, for muſicke only continues life naturall which is ſuppoſed to haue another originall. But if we ſpeake of life ſpirituall maintained by ſaith (and of which faith it ſelfe is a part) it was originally and wholly deriued from CHRIST, on whom faith and all other graces whatſoeuer, <hi>tam in fieri quam infacto,</hi> as well in the firſt production as during the

Either becauſe he neuer had any true pledge of Gods fauour, or did not vſe ſuch as hee had aright; becauſe as his workes haue been, ſuch now are his prayers, preſumptuous, vnfaithfull, or hypocriticall; ſuch as cannot obtaine any other anſwere of God then that, <hi>depart from mee I neuer knew thee.</hi> It ſhall not boote him to make proofe that hee hath giuen his goods to the poore, or his body to the fire; that he hath healed the ſicke, caſt out diuels, and wrought other wonders in CHRISTS name, vnſeſſe his faith haue quelled all truſt, all pride or glory in theſe gracings, wholly ſet on Gods mercies in CHRIST; from whoſe apprehenſion vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe theſe other acts or exerciſes (though of mercie) ſprung, they are not truely done in faith; but ſpringing thence, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſo ready to doe them as hauing done them to renounce all truſt or confidence in them. For whiles we compare theſe ſlender, yet ſincere effects of our loue and thankfulneſſe to him, with his infinite loue and mercie towards vs, (wheron true faith alwaies lookes whiles it conceiues them) the ſight of them cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth greater humilitie for the preſent, &amp; more hearty ſorrow for ſinnes paſt, then we could haue conceiued, if wee had not done them; as the ſight of <hi>Zorobabels</hi> temple finiſhed did make the auntients of <hi>Iſraell</hi> weepe, becauſe the perfection and glorie of the former was more liuely repreſented to their ſenſes by this viſible and ſemblable model, then by the ruines, meere abſence, or imperfect reparations of it. To be able to ſound the depth of many concluſions better then others can, giues ſtayed and ſetled iudgements a more diſtinct and compleat meaſure of the knowledge they wanted, then fantaſticke or ſhallow wits can haue.

The growth of theſe particulars is like the growth of twins: the more firme and liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faith we haue, the better and more ſincerely we worke: the bettter and more ſincerely we worke, the more vnfaignedly and faithfully wee renounce all confidence in our workes and our ſelues: the more faithfully we renounce all confidence in theſe, the more ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="241" facs="tcp:7895:140"/>Some in their Chuch of no meaner note then the famous <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoria</hi> and <hi>Melchior Canus,</hi> with other of <hi>Aquinas</hi> followers (publique profeſſors too) were not aſhamed or afraid to teach, that grace inherent did not make vs iuſt or acceptable in the ſight of God by it meere entity or quallity, that the value or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimate of it did depend vpon the will and pleaſure of him that gaue it, content to accept or pronounce vs once partakers of it as iuſt and holy, though not ſuch in our ſelues, or though the inherent vertue of it, as money is valuable, not for the nature, phyſicall properties, or the quantitie of the mettall, but for the princes eſtimate, whoſe image and ſuperſcription it beares. One corallarie of this concluſion, gathered by theſe authors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, was, that the entitie, or qualitie of grace might increaſe without any neceſſarie increaſe of the value or eſtimate of it with God, as the kings maieſty if it ſhould pleaſe him, might make the ſame portion of ſiluer which now goes for a ſhilling, to be currant but for nine pence, or rather make that peece as large as the ſhilling, though retaining the ſame value &amp; inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it now beares. We ſhall perchance no way croſſe theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours tenent, but onely better illuſtrate our owne, if we ſay: As it is not the legall inſtrument (though bearing the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ale or inſcription royall) but the princes will and pleaſure thereby authentiquely teſtified, which frees the malefactor from ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of condemnation: ſo neither is it grace or righteouſneſſe inherent, (though theſe be the image and character of our righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Iudge) but the mercy and free pardon of our God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed indefinitely to all the penitent, but ſealed to euery faithfull ſoule in particular by thoſe pledges of the ſpirit, which finally abſolues vs from the curſe laide vpon vs by the Law, and enſtates vs in the promiſes of the Goſpel. In both pleas the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified ſoule vſeth ſaith &amp; all other graces or parts of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes inherent, no otherwiſe then a penitent malefactor would doe the inſtrument wherein the princes pleaſure is contained, if he were to plead his cauſe before the prince himſelfe, in whoſe preſence (though with ordinary Iudges they will ſometimes be too bold) I preſume no malefactor would ſtand vpon tearmes of integrity or preſent innocency becauſe he had his pardon vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſeale, ſeeing that was giuen him to plead for mercy not for
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:7895:141"/>
iuſtice. Not altogether different from theſe exemplifications of our aſſertion ſome ſchoolemen, though ſeeking to come as neer the Romiſh Church preſent tenents as they could, thought it no inconuenience to hold, that the grace wherby men become truely and inherently iuſt, was not of it owne nature abſolutely incompatible with all degrees, or reliques of ſin; in reſpect of which we might ſtand in need of Gods fauour and mercy after communication of grace. But this and the like opinions are vtterly deſtroyed root and branch by the thunderbolt of the former decree, and their authors and followers cenſured by <hi>Vaſquez</hi>

the time it was celebrated, did in this point better accord with the <hi>Auſpurge</hi> confesſion then with it.

Nor doth this argue, as ſome captious reader will perhaps imagine, that a man may fall either <hi>finally</hi> or <hi>totally</hi> from the ſtate of <hi>grace,</hi> but rather that all imposſibility he hath of not ſo falling, eſſentially depends vpon a like impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of not continuing his indulgence to knowne offences, or negligence in repeating or bewailing his ſecret ſins. Euen af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the infuſion of faith moſt perfect, faithfull repentance for ſins committed, is as abſolutely neceſſarie to ſaluation, as the firſt iuſuſion was.

                  <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>Eaſt the end of this diſcourſe ſhould miſſe the end and ſcope wherto the whole was purpoſely directed; I muſt intreate the Chriſtian Reader, to pardon my feare and iealouſie (which from the reaſons mentioned in the firſt chapter of this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction too well experienced in the temper of this preſent age is alwaies great) leaſt diſputation againſt Romiſh hereſie, caſt vs into a relapſe of that naturall careleſneſſe or hypocriſie whereof all, more or leſſe, haue participated. But for whoſe auoidance hereafter, if thine heart be affected as mine now is, and I wiſh it alwaies may continue, let this meditation neuer ſlip out of thy memory: <hi>That</hi> ſeeing the laſt and principall end of all graces beſtowed vpon vs in this life, is rightly to belieue in CHRIST this cannot bee, as the drowſie worldling dreames, the eaſieſt, but rather the moſt difficult point of Chriſtianity. The true reaſon why vnto many not otherwiſe miſaffected, it ſeems not ſuch, is, becauſe in this time of his abſence from earth, our ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary loue of his goodneſſe, wanting direct oppoſition <note n="b" place="margin">Reade chap. 3</note> of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſtrong deſire or reſolution to manifeſt the leuitie or vanity of it, fancieth a like affection in him towards vs. And ſeeing loue is not ſuſpicious, but where it is perfect <note n="c" place="margin">1. Ioh. 4. 18.</note> excludes all feare, the very conceipt of great mutuall loue betwixt CHRIST and vs not interrupted, expels all conceit of feare or diffidence. Hence wee vſually reſt perſwaded, our aſſent vnto Gods mercies in Him is more ſtrong then vnto moſt other obiects of Faith,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:7895:155"/>
when as indeed theſe being the higheſt it would appeare to bee in reſpect of them the weakeſt; had it as many daily temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to encounter it, as wee finde in practices of other duties whoſe habituall performance is the neceſſary ſubordinate meane to ſupport it. All the difficulties we daily ſtruggle vvith, are but ſtraglers of that maine armie, with whoſe entire ioint force we are to haue the laſt conflict about this very point which vntill the hower of death, or other extraordinary time of triall, is ſeldome directly or earneſtly aſſaulted. But then, whatſoeuer breach of Gods commaundements, loue either to the world or fleſh hath wrought in our ſoules, will affoord Sathan ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage and opportunitie for more facile oppugnation of our confidence. For as euerie leaſt ſinne in it owne nature deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth death, ſo doth the conſciouſneſſe of it more or leſſe, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell the minde to diſtruſt of life. Yet euen the greateſt will be content in theſe dayes of peace and ſecuritie to ſleepe with vs, and lie quiet in hope to preuent vs in the waking, and with the ioint force of leſſer to ſurpriſe the ſoule or gaine the ſtart or firſt ſway of the ſpirit, an aduantage much preiudiciall to ſtrength otherwiſe more then equall.</p>
                  <p>Much harder it is to retract a bodie after actuall motion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, then to reſtraine propenſions or inclinations from bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting out into actuall motions. Our often yeelding vpon fore<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Yet if wee did duely conſider the vniformity of ſtrength betweene the ſeuerall branches of faith, or as it reſpects diuerſe obiects; the very conſciouſneſſe of any one ſinne whereunto wee haue been indulgent will be of like force to withdrawe our aſſent from Gods mercies, as the delight or pleaſure we tooke in the obiect of it, was to cauſe vs tranſgreſſe any part of his will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed. The ſame ſtrength beautie had to allure vnto adulterie, will that fowle ſinne vnrepented of haue to diuorce our ſoules from CHRIST. Nor could wee faile in practice of this or other commaundement vvithout a precedent defect of that faith which onely can firmely vnite vs vnto CHRIST,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:7895:156"/>
whereby likewiſe, were it firme it ſelfe, we would aſſent vnto euery precept of God as much better then any incompatible good. And ſeeing our preſent faith or truſt in God is but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſurable to our fidelity in his commandements, (then which, through ſcrupuloſitie of conſcience or Chriſtian modeſty, it may be leſſe, but cannot be greater without hypocriſie or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption) it muſt needes want ſtrength to lay ſure holde on CHRISTS merits, vntill it be able to ſubdue thoſe deſires of the fleſh to which it yeelded in the former temptations. To ſay, <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> cannot ſuffice, ere we can truely reſume our woonted confidence, if any we had, or make a faithfull plea for mercy; Gods will neglected muſt be executed either in the act, if the obiect be preſent, and may be proſecuted, or in ſincere and conſtant reſolution, if abilities or opportunities, required to execution of what we reſolue vpon, be altogether wanting or our indeauours vpon ineuitable occaſions hindred.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For our better preparation againſt this laſt and terrible conflict with the world, the diuell and fleſh; let vs imagine the next thunder-clap or vncouth ſound we heare did ſummon vs to finall iugement; or if our imaginations bee ſo quicke and liuely as to awake themſelues without external noiſe or clamor, or able as of matters ſecular, ſo of diuine that certainely ſhall be, to frame repreſentations as if they were already preſent: let vs contemplate CHRIST; not as farre abſent or ſoliciting our cauſe before his father, but now appearing in maieſtie and great glorie, accompanied with infinite legions of holy Angels for his Aſſeſſors, or attended by Satan and in his infernal troops deſirous to be emploied in the execution of his ſentence. Were the eyes of all our faith as firmely ſet vpon this ſight as ſome mens are vpon his merits and perſonall loue to them, ſo as the obiects of terrors yet vnſeene, but which we ſtedfaſtly belieue ſhall be manifeſted, might haue as full a ſtroake vpon our incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations vnto dread of that laſt day (which in this life no man can want vnleſſe his righteouſnes be angelically perfect) as dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cogitations of Gods mercies and fauour to vs in particular haue vpon our hopefull apprehenſions or deſires of glory: all viciſſitude of feare and trembling in our ſoules thus equally poiſed, by contrarie impulſions, would not be taken for ſignes
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:7895:156"/>
of infidelirie or hypocriſie. Nay my conſcience aſſures mee (but herein I preiudice no mans perſwaſions in particular) that a multitude of ſuch as condemne all without exception which cannot apprehend the truth of their owne ſaluation (though a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las who is he that deſires not ſo to doe?) as ſurely as any other article belieued, would bewray tokens of feare and dread more euident to others then their former apprehenſions were vnto themſelues.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Or were wee in CHRISTS preſence, though not ſo terrible as in that day it ſhall be, but rather as amiable and familiar as his Apoſtles did enioy it, ſet to compare either his precepts generall to all Chriſtians, or peculiar to our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall vocations, with our daily practiſes or performances: who is he that would not more ſhame at his owne nakedneſſe, then ioy in his Redeemers righteouſneſſe? who is he that would not bee more readie to conuey himſelfe out of his ſight, then with confidence to approach his preſence? who is he would not wiſh his former ſeruice might paſſe without account, or anie certaine hope of reward eternall, rather then aduenture to take his finall ſentence without ſome reſpite for amendment? Yet thou O CHRIST, my Redeemer and Iudge moſt righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, beſt knowes, I propoſe not theſe ſcruples to diminiſh, but rather with purpoſe to increaſe and fortifie all true confidence in thy merits and thy Fathers mercies: but that (I know and thou much better knoweſt) it oft-times weakens it ſelf by ſhoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vp before it time, or too faſt, and in this forward age had much neede to be lopped, that it may grow as well in breadth and thickneſſe, as in length; ſeeing growth in height without ſoliditie correſpondent, is but a mounting in preſumption, the period of whoſe aſcent is proneneſſe to fall headlong in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Or if any man can drawe the inference here intended from other premiſes more commodious, I ſhall bee willing to relinquiſh mine. But the beſt method, as yet I knowe, for eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing of true confidence will be this: As oft as we thinke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that fundamentall oracle of life <note n="g" place="margin">Rom. 10 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But as the Apoſtle tells vs, hee doth all things <hi>according to the counſell of his owne vvill,</hi> which is fully commenſureable to his power and doth modifie it in working. Some things then he createth in an inſtant, not becauſe his power is infinite and admits no impediment, but becauſe his wil is it ſhould ſo work: others though as immediately created by him are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed by little and little after many interpoſitions or delaies, not that either his will or power can be croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but that his pleaſure is to haue them ſo wrought. Such is the creation of true &amp; liuely faith in our ſoules. For who is hee liuing that can aſsigne mee the very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant yea the ſet hower, day, weeke or moneth where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:7895:159"/>
his regeneration was fully wrought? As life ſpirituall is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then temporall, ſo for the moſt part it is longer in concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing. Nor doth regeneration conſiſt onely in the firſt infuſion of grace or ſeede immortall; but alſo in the rooting or taking of it: both are the immediate workes of God, both in Scripture phraſe eſſentiall branches of creation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Notwithſtanding, if wholly both bee his ſole workes, the former difficulty ſtill remaines, and may bee increaſed by a poſition of Proteſtants in it ſelfe moſt true, but too much, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe more watily preſſed, or more skilfully applied then a man ſhall vſually finde it. For what is more often inculcated in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Sermons, or in that controuerſie about free-will, then that man is altogether as dead to ſpirituall life, as <hi>Laza<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>us</hi> was to life naturall, till the ſame power of God raiſe him vp? But vvhat hence followes? that God before the infuſion of grace requires no actions or operations at our hands, more then CHRIST did of <hi>Lazarus</hi> before he reſtored his ſoule vnto him? then let ſuch as are deſtitute of the robes of righteouſneſſe cloath them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues with the image of death, and ſpend their liues in a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ſlumber, or get themſelues downe into the graue, vntill God crie vnto them by his powerfull voice, as CHRIST did to <hi>Lazarus, come forth, or, awake thou that ſleepeſt, for</hi> CHRIST <hi>is now made thine euerlaſting light.</hi> I maruell not if vulgar audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors make ſuch inferences to countenance their ſloath and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligences, when as many vnpartiall ſchollers can hardly conceiue what other can be made of many zealous Paſtors doctrine, wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting the meaning of the Spirit by too much wringing the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tet, or miſapplying the former proportion betwixt ſuch as are naturally and ſpiritually dead; whoſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>earmes, if ſet aright ſtand thus. As God required no vitall motion or operation, of ſuch as his <hi>Sonne</hi> did raiſe from naturall death: ſo dooth hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire no operation or aſſent ſpirituall, before he infuſe the life of grace. But in as much as we enioy the benefit of life naturall, or meerly morall, ſome paſſiue capacities are equired in vs, wherewith they whom CHRIST raiſed were not qualified, whiles naturally dead: nor were they capable of renouation in life ſpirituall, but by reaſſuming life naturall with it properties. Nor doth it imply any ſhewe of contradiction, that the actuall
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:7895:159"/>
endeuours of life naturall, or meerely morall in vs, or the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification reſulting from them, ſhould be as meerely paſſiue in reſpect of life truely ſpirituall, as the ſtate of death, or vtter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priuation of all ſenſe or motion in ſuch as CHRIST raiſed vp, was in regard of life naturall: The proportion then will holde beſt thus. As CHRIST infuſed not humane life into trees, ſtocks, &amp; ſtones, but into bodies paſſiuely organized and figured for the fit habitation of the humane ſoule: ſo neither doth hee ordinarily beſtow ſupernaturall grace on euerie one that hath a reaſonable ſoule, but on ſuch only as are paſſiuely prepared for it. Wherein this preparation conſiſts, or what our endeauours can adde vnto it, is the point now in queſtion; partly to be diſputed in this preſent, more fully in diſcourſes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. To the aſſertion laſt mentioned this obſeruation well ſutes, that in the firſt workes of creation the omnipotent pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er did obſerue the orderly progreſſe afterwards appointed vnto nature, and proceeded not <hi>per ſaltum,</hi> but firſt created a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon maſſe out of which he made the heauen and earth, not trees, plants or liuing creatures immediately. For though theſe receiued life from their maker, after another manner then indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiduals of the ſame kinde now do, yet the earth and ſea affoor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their matter and ſubſtance meerly paſſiue. Man he made of the earth, but firſt, as is probable, externally figured or propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned: the woman likewiſe was his immediate workmanſhip, but had her bodily or paſſiue beginning from the man. Thus euen the moſt immediate workes of God preſuppoſe (ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) ſuch a ſub-ordination of paſſiue capacities as is vſually ſeene in matters producible by humane labour, wit or induſtrie.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 That grace then is not generated, or educed out of the ſoule, but properly created in it, ought not in any congruitie of reaſon to exclude all actiue, though but humane endeuours precedent, for the better attainment of it. Nor haue I euer read of any Proteſtant or Papiſt, which held mariage, as either vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſarie, or ſuperfluous for the propagation of mankinde, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the moſt and beſt Diuines in both religions be of opinion, that the reaſonable ſoule is not generated, but immediatly cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated by God.</p>
                  <p>And notwithſtanding the ſuppoſed truth of this opinion,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:7895:160"/>
vnleſſe the parents of our bodies had been as carefull for our bringing foorth, as bruite beaſts are ouer their broode, few of vs this day liuing had euer enioied the light. Now for the auoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of <hi>Pelagianiſme,</hi> or iuſt imputation of popery in this point, it is enough to diſclaime all ſuch diſpoſitions, preparations or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauours, as actually cooperate or concurre to the production of faith, as temperate carriage or behauiour doe for producing the habit of temperance, or naturall qualities of moiſture heate and cold doe in the education of formes meerely naturall, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of bodies totally generable. So ſhall he neuer be able to acquit himſelfe from the error of the Stoicks or Manichees, that accounts it indifferent what workes we doe, or how we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meane our ſelues before regeneration. For as God creates not the reaſonable ſoule in euery matter, ſo doth he not create grace in euery ſoule. And, as this inference is good [vnleſſe the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of our bodies had beene before vs, God had not created vs theſe ſoules; in whoſe creation our fathers had no fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger:] ſo likewiſe in this [vnleſſe before our regeneration we ſo demeane our ſelues as God in his word preſcribes, he ordinarly creates not grace in vs,] to whoſe creation neuertheleſſe our beſt endeauours conferre no more, then our parents doe to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our ſoules, or the redd earth did to the making of <hi>Adam.</hi> This fully remoues the former difficulty, which ſeemed to dull our endeauors; and from this inſtance of the reaſonable ſoules creation I would rather commend this meditation to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. As greater care is to be had of a woman with children, of Queenes and Princely mothers eſpecially; then of bruite beaſts great with yong, albeit the fruit of their wombes be the more immediate worke or bleſſing of God: ſo ſhould our care and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry for conceiuing faith, euen in that it is the ſole gift of God, be much greater, then we vſe for the attainement of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer can by meanes naturall or ordinary be immediately at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieued.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N that it hath pleaſed the ſpirit to write ſo much for mens directions in the way of life, (yet not ſo much to inſtruct the faithfull what they ſhould doe after their regeneration fully wrought, as the vnregenerate what he ſhould doe that it might bee wrought in him:) to conceiue it but as doubtfull, whether his ſacred rules were not more ſufficient ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall and complete for attaining true and liuely faith, then any Philoſophicall methods for planting morall vertues, were to derogate as much from Gods wiſdome, as he ſhould doe from his power that maintained man without direction or aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance ſupernaturall might worke out his owne ſaluation. Yet ſhall he much wrong both himſelfe and me that ſtretcheth this ſimilitude further then thus, As he that duely obſerues philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicall praecepts of morality ſhall certainely produce morall ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, and become truely iuſt and honeſt by often practiſing acts of iuſtice, temperance and ſobriety: ſo he that circumſpectly followes rules giuen by the ſpirit of God for attaining <hi>faith,</hi> ſhall haue it more aſſuredly produced in him, euen becauſe it is not produced by him but by his God, who is more able to create new hearts in vs, then the naturall or vnregenerate man to worke any morall reformation in himſelfe or others. All that is required of vs is onely to ſubmit our knowledge to our Creators wiſdome, our naturall deſires to his moſt holy will,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:7895:161"/>
our weake abilities to his omnipotent power. But is it not a worke of the ſpirit to be thus perſwaded or reſolued?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the naturall man ſhould rightly perceiue the things of the ſpirit of God implies as euident a contradiction, as to ſay a blind man ſhould be able to ſee things viſible. For as things in themſelues moſt viſible cannot be ſeene without the viſiue fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty; ſo is it impoſſible matters ſpirituall ſhould otherwiſe then ſpiritually be diſcerned. Notwithſtanding I ſcarce haue knowne any man ſo blind but might eaſily haue beene per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that he could not ſee, or induced hartily to wiſh he were as other men are, though in what ſtate they were, or what plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures there were in ſight hee were altogether blind and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. And I thinke it would be hard for any man to prooue that all ſuch as our Sauiour reſtored to ſight had ſauing faith before he opened their eyes; or that <hi>Naamans</hi> condeſcending to his ſeruants counſell [<note place="margin">2. <hi>Kings</hi> 5. 12</note> 
                     <hi>my father if the Prophet had bid thee doe ſome great thing wouldeſt thou not haue done it? how much more when he ſaith to thee waſh &amp; beclean,</hi>] was an aſſent of iuſtifying faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet were all theſe cures as immediate workes of Gods power as is the illumination of the minde by faith. What God hath wrought in them we know, but if <hi>Naaman</hi> had beene ſo wilfull as not to haue waſhed himſelfe ſeauen times in <hi>lorden<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> or thoſe blinde men ſo wayward, as vpon the conſtant fame of former miracles not to haue beſought CHRIST to worke the like in them: all of them, for ought we know or can imagine to the contrary, had remained ſtill in their former miſery. Thus if we graunt that a man altogether vnregenerate, vpon the hearing of Gods word, or the report that others, whom he hath no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to diſtruſt, doe make of the vertue thereof; may haue a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall apprehenſion of his naturall miſery, and a deſire (meerely naturall) to bee like them whoſe eſtate hee knoweth no better then he that is borne blind doth the light; or, that as well his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion as deſire is but a qualification meerely paſſiue, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding onely to this purpoſe, that aſcribing the worke of faith to Gods power alone, hee may be a ſubiect not vncapable of this creation; we ſhall auouch nothing contrary to reaſon naturall or ſupernaturall. For knowledge naturall and ſpirituall differ not in reſpect of the materiall obiects knowne, but in the manner of
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:7895:161"/>
apprehending their truth and properties. What ſubiect is there whereof we may not logically diſpute? albeit demonſtration, or ſcientificall concluſions, we can haue none but from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per principles of that ſcience whereto it belongeth, firſt diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and infallibly apprehended. And what doth hinder vs to conceiue a naturall or morall aſſent vnto truths diuine, as not impoſſible, though to haue a true taſt or homogeniall appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of them be the ſole and proper effect of faith infuſed or ſupernaturall? Of the ſame Diuine truths or rather of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe annexed to them, there may be a naturall or morall deſire right in it kinde, though not ſuch as Gods lawe requires, or can immediately pleaſe the lawgiuer, yet ſuch as he requires that we may be capable of better. None, I thinke, but would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade a man whom he knew to be as yet vnregenerate, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe his ſinnes, to crie for mercy? how, ſpiritually? ſo to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him were a mockery: but rather to ſue for grace that hereafter hee might ſpiritually deſire what now he naturally doth. Nor doth he amiſſe in praying thus, albeit his praiers in reſpect of the fountaine whence they ſpring, be meerely naturall polluted with the poiſon of ſinne. Abſolutely he praies not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, but in his kinde; in as much as his deſires are ſet vpon right obiects, though not ſo ſymbolized or proportioned to them as they ſhould be. This rectitude of naturall deſires or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauours which ariſeth from the rectitude of the obiects wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they are imperfectly ſet, not in reſpect of degrees or circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances onely, but for the very eſſence or ſubſtance of the act, is the point whereunto this diſcourſe is directed. Whether this right vſe of faculties as yet vnſanctified, be, in ſome degree poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to all that heare the word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or whether, if poſſible to all, any are abſolutely excluded from ſaluation without preſuppoſall of ſome neglect or abuſe of naturall faculties, is to be diſputed in the ſeauenth booke. From our aſſertion thus explicated we may inferre the true meane betweene Pelagianiſme and Stoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſme to be this; [Albeit man before regeneration hath no abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of doing any thing in it ſelfe not deſeruing Hell; yet is there a true and reall poſſibility left him of doing that, which being done maketh him capable of grace to be created in him, but which not done by him, he ſhall remaine vncapable of ſuch creation.]</p>

Vpon theſe plaine grounds we hope now to proceed without offence to God or man: It was the meere good will and pleaſure of God to ordaine, his meere wiſedome to reueale thoſe meanes of mans ſaluation, vnto which now reuealed the naturall man may ſo farre aſſent, as to make ſome triall of their truth as <hi>Naaman</hi> did of the Prophets words. The deeper ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, though but naturall, man hath of his naturall mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, or want of ability to raiſe himſelfe, the more apt hee is, not to lay but to haue the ſure foundation of faith laid in his heart by CHRIST IESVS (who is the foundation and chiefe corner ſtone in the ſpirituall Temple,) ſo he will but frame his life by his maſters precepts and example.</p>

And though the ſpirit alone worke faith in our hearts, yet the rules giuen for our direction how to demeane our ſelues as true pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents in this cure, are more methodicall and compendious, then any art vnder the ſunne, the principles of Chriſtianity ſuppoſed, could inuent; but ſuch as euery true artiſt muſt of neceſſitie ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire, the more he meditates vpon them.

For this againe is a fundamentall rule, whereof there may be perſwaſions, either right onely in their kinde, and but natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall; or truely ſpirituall; That great eſtates, worldly dignities, or plentifull matter of carnall contentments, can neuer be rightly managed or morally well vſed without great morall wiſdome, good education, ſobriety of life and diſcretion. Much more neceſſarie, (as naturall reaſon rightly perſwaded of Scriptures truth will acknowledge) is an abundant meaſure of faith to vſe abundance in any kinde, or ſuch prerogatiues as fleſh and blood are prone to delight in, to the glory of God, the good of his Church, and ſaluation of our owne ſoules. Hence as we right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier reckon mens wealth, or competence of eſtate, by the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus of their certaine incomes, compared with their neceſſary outlayings, then by the largeneſſe of annuall reuenues without ſuch allocations, or deductions: ſo muſt we meaſure the ſtrength or efficacy of true faith, not by the multitude of degrees, or the intenſiue perfection of the perſwaſion, or aſſent in it ſelfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, or with reference to it poſitiue obiect, but by the exceſſe which it hath in reſpect of contrary deſires, or temptations inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to our courſe of life. If the aſſent of faith be as <hi>twelue,</hi> and any naturall delight in prerogatiues though ſpirituall, ſuch as the Corinthians had, be as <hi>thirteene;</hi> that mans faith is worſe then nothing: whereas if ſix degrees of the ſame aſſent ſhould in ſome other match with three or foure of the like naturall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, or affection, the ſoueraignty of his faith is much greater then the formers, becauſe better able to quell all contrary mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or rebellions of the fleſh.

But he that had no minde of earth, nor longed not after this bright
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:7895:168"/>
clay might eaſily be aduanced to heauen by faith; not able to worke any externall effects halfe ſo wondrous. Lucifer and his wicked confederates haue perſwaſions of ſome diuine truthes ſo firme and ſtrong as would almoſt enforce any man liuing vnto goodneſſe, which notwithſtanding no way benefit but rather exaſperate them to miſchiefe, becauſe ouermatched with mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious helliſh inclinations. That excellent knowledge which was the ground of their firſt ſtation, though more firme by much then the faith whereby we ſtand, was ouerturned by delight or pride in this their proper excellency. The name of grace or faith in ſcriptures includes beſides the quality infuſed, this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of exceſſe, or ſoueraignety ouer the deſires of the fleſh. But whether it be poſſible that grace ſhould be the ſame, as well for quallity as degrees, in the carnally minded, and truely ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied I diſpute not. Howſoeuer, let the nature or entitatiue perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of it be neuer ſo great, vnleſſe it can thus conquer affection and bring the body in ſubiection to the ſpirit, it is not the grace we are finally to pray for, nor hath it that faith, whoſe right plantation we ſeeke, for it aſſociate. In this ſence we may ſafely admit the <note n="d" place="margin">Cited Sect. 2. chap. 6. parag.</note> opinion of <hi>Canus</hi> and <hi>Victoria,</hi> [<hi>That the entity or qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of grace may encreaſe without any encreaſe of Gods fauour or good acceptance</hi>] not onely as approueable and free from <hi>Vaſquez</hi> cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, but as neceſſary and vnqueſtionable, vnleſſe our loue vnto the world and fleſh, or eſtimate of all delights and proffers they can preſent, vniformely decay as the entity of this infuſed qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, or our habituall aſſent vnto diuine truth, encreaſeth.

His mercy is many times greateſt to ſuch as he endowes with leaſt bleſſings of art or nature, in that as their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are vſually ſlow, their capacities ſhallow and abilities weake, ſo their conqueſt ouer delight or pride in their own good parts, in which the ſtrength and vertue of faith conſiſts eſpecially, is the eaſieſt, their aptitude to delight in ſpirituall goodneſſe the greateſt, and their alliance to true humility moſt immediate. His mercies againe many waies appeare moſt towards ſuch as excell in gifts of nature. Firſt, if they ſeriouſly addreſſe their beſt faculties to contemplate the fountaine whence they ſlow, or to eſteeme of their Creators goodneſſe by his good bleſſings beſtowed on themſelues; they haue a perpetuall ſpurre to ſtirre vp their alacrity in good courſes, a curbe to reſtraine them from falling into ordinary and vulgar ſinnes, whereinto others vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſlide through deiection of minde, or opportunitie of their obſcure place, and low eſteeme with others. The beſt leſſon I remember in old <hi>Chaucer,</hi> and for ought I can perceiue the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly right vſe can be made of a mans notice of his owne worth is, to thinke euery offence of like nature more grieuous in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, then in others whom he accounts his inferiours. Againe, as eminencie of naturall or acquired worth expoſeth men to more then ordinary ſpirituall danger, ſo, no queſtion, rightly emploied it makes them capable of great reward; and few of this temper if free choice were left vnto themſelues, but would rather deſire to get honour though with aduenture of an auoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable danger, then to be aſſured of ordinary recompence for ſafe emploiments Briefly as their ſtocke or talent is greater, and through indiſcreet or vnthrifty courſes may bring them into great arrerages at their finall accompts: ſo watily and faithfully emploied, it alwaies yeelds greater encreaſe to Gods glory, who will not ſuffer the leaſt exceſſe of good ſeruice done, to paſſe without an ouerplus of reward. That which turnes all his bleſſings into curſes is an ouerweening conceipt of our owne worth, and a perſwaſion thence ariſing that wee are ſit for any fortunes whereunto induſtrious practices authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

To be able not to affect their pleaſures is a point of Chriſtian va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, highly commendable amongſt the wiſer ſort of men, and immediatly approueable with God: nor is there any that much deſires to taſt them, but is obnoxious with all to be ſo bewit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched by them, that he ſhall thinke himſelfe free enough from their entiſements, when his heart and ſoule are indiſſolubly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troathed to them.</p>

Such hearts our Sauiour compares to ſtony ground, wherein ſeed caſt ſhootes vp a pace, but withers as faſt for want of root. Rootes, though of trees, can goe no deeper then the rocke or ſtone, nor can the word of life ſinke deeper into the heart of man, then vnto the rootes of his naturall deſires or affections; theſe vnrenounced either ſtifle it in the growth, or prohibite the ſpreading of it any farther, then where it can be no annoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance vnto their propagations. Such as apprehend the tidings of

And ſuch warineſſe is a point of wiſdome, whileſt practiſed towards ſuch as we are tied vnto onely in the common bond of ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry curteſie, or humanitie, or of whom we expect no greater good then vſuall delight: but it ſhould be odious and deteſtable, if it were ſhewed towards ſuch as haue engaged their liues, lands or goods for vs, or vnto them in whoſe defence or main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance our very liues and ſubſtance are due; as to our Prince, our parents or country. But for the euerlaſting kingdome what can be too deare? Not the whole world if we had it, and all the holdfaſts it can lay vpon vs. The paſſiue incapacity or bad quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the vnregenerate, which in proportion anſweres to ſtony ground, is in generall impatiency of aduerſity, and that but a veine or ſeame of mans hard and ſtony heart, before it be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enſtamped with that fundamentall precept <hi>of denying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and looſing life for</hi> CHRISTS <hi>ſake,</hi> which in effect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines as much as <hi>Moſes</hi> tables and the Prophets. The branches of this generall aduerſitie, which, though in the purchaſe of ſo glorious a Kingdome, doth offend vs, are of diuers kinds, not all alike apt to endanger euery nature or diſpoſition. To be croſt in ſuites of honor or preferment, is vnto ſome as bitter as death: but many there be who haue wained their thoughts from great matters, and yet can hardly brooke a broken eſtate or places far below their education, or merits in mens eſteeme that be indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent.

BVt many as was intimated in the former para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that can hold the armor of faith cloſe about them in ſtormes of aduerſitie, are often enticed to put it off by faire countenance of the world, or ſmiling graces of blind fortune, wooing them to follow the vnlawfull faſhions of her Court. Many Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:7895:174"/>
in time of perſecutions, haue prooued apoſtataes and facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſchiſmatickes after long peace and proſperity. Now it would be, I thinke, leſſe grieuous for a traueller to die in a farre Country in his ſetting foorth, then to be drowned within ken of ſhore at his returne; a miſfortune more ful of miſery then can be expreſſed, to haue eſcaped <hi>Sylla</hi> and <hi>Charibdis</hi> rage, or ſafely to haue paſſed the ſtreights of <hi>Magellan,</hi> and afterwards through careleſneſſe to caſt away both ſhip and paſſenger vpon the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ſands of <hi>Tagus, Orinoque,</hi> or <hi>Riodel plato.</hi> Much harder not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding is their miſhap which begin in the ſpirit and end in the fleſh, not that they were at any time actuall participants of the ſanctifying ſpirit, but that they had a reſolution in it kind truely anſwerable to his preſcriptions, vntill ſome aduentitious contagion of the fleſh did pollute and corrupt it. The imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of theſe mens conſtitution our Sauiour exemplifies by ground in it ſelfe not bad, but wherein good ſeed well ſowne comes to no proofe, by reaſon of thornes, brakes or ſuch other weedes, or traſh as vſually grow vp in the fields of ſluggards, or men ſo detained with other buſineſſes that they cannot intend their huſbandry. The meanes whereby weedes hurt the corne, are eſpecially two; either by ſtealing away the ſtrength and vigor of the ſoile, which ſhould nouriſh it, (for which reaſon trees too cloſely ſet cannot thriue,) or by a kind of antipathy, or ſecret en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, which may bee either in the eſſentiall properties of the very ſeeds or roots, or in the cumberſome vicinitie of the blades or ſtalkes, each according to their ſtrength apt to ſtifle other. That which in reſpect of our ſpirituall growth in faith anſweres in proportion to thornes or tares amongſt corne, is in generall worldly care, or ſollicitude, eſpecially the deceiptfulneſſe of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, or voluptuous life. It is hard to handle pitch and not to be defiled with it, it is harder for the ſoule of man to be much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſant in any matter, and not take ſome touch or tincture from it; whence all acquired inclinations, good or bad, vſually ſpring according to the different qualities of the obiects whereto wee are much accuſtomed. From this aptitude of the ſoule to receiue impreſſion from externals, it fals out, that as men ſet to wooe or deale for others, take often oportunitie to beſpeed themſelues: ſo theſe things which are firſt ſought for onely as ordinarie
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:7895:175"/>
meanes for attaining ſome good end, vſually intercept the deſire or loue we beare vnto the goodneſſe of it; which is ſucceſſiuely infinite. For things in themſelues good, admit no ſtint of deſire, but the more we poſſeſſe of them the more we ſeeke, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire or inclination, once alienated from the end vnto the means, makes vs exorbitant in all ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This miſcarriage of our intentions is the ſourſe of all idolatry, of ſuperſtition, of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, of all inordinateneſſe in moralities: and is hardeſt to be preuented in the moſt ordinary or neceſſary meanes of life, as in meates and drinks, in gathering riches and worldly ſubſtance. The reaſon is obuious, in as much as our ſoules are as apt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue impreſſion from theſe obiects, as from others, and yet muſt of neceſſity be moſt conuerſant in theſe.</p>

More ſecret by much, and more inſenſible is the gathering of this ſpirituall diſeaſe, for whoſe auoidance we now aduiſe, euen in men that make great conſcience by what meanes they encreaſe their wealth, and will not aduenture on any bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine though neuer ſo good, without particular warrant from the word of life, or ſome peculiar preſcriptions from the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Phiſitians of their ſoules.

The framing notwithſtanding of this diſpotition ſuppoſed precedent to the infuſion of liuely faith, may not be aſcribed to our abilities, but to the ſpirit of God, directing our thoughts, and enabling vs for conceiuing a kinde of preuiall faith more then naturall, by ſome externall or inferior grace, ſo proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to theſe effects, as ſanctifying grace is to the fruits of true holineſſe.

But as theſe workes are wrought immediately by faith, though principally by the ſpirit which infuſeth it: ſo likewiſe is the heart organized by ſuch morall or imperfect faith as they ſometimes that had afterwards ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt, but by it as the ſpirits inſtrument, vſually preexiſtent to the faith which neuer failes, or vnto the life of grace. VVhatſoeuer may bee rightly aſcribed vnto the man already regenerate in production of true fruits of the ſpirit, as much I thinke we may giue without offence to our endeauours in framing this paſſiue capacity or diſpoſition. In the former (after our regeneration) wee are by conſent of moſt diuines coworkers with the ſpirit of God, albeit the works be of a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural quaility; and ſo whatſoeuer we are, we may without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience be thought in the other, it being of a nature as far inferior to the former works, as the grace wherby it is wrought is to the ſpirit of ſanctification.

Such as ſubmit themſelues to ſacred diſcipline, and heare the VVord preached with intention, though but morral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſincere, to profit by it: are in this like little children, or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices in good literature; that, as theſe abſtaine from ſport or play for feare of chiding or whipping, and follow their bookes ſometimes onely for like motiues, ſometimes for ſhame leaſt their equals ſhould outſtrippe them, ſometimes in hope of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation or other childiſh reward: ſo hee that is not yet, but deſires to bee regenerated, eſchews what Gods Lawe forbids, but with difficulty and reluctance, oft times for feare of eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtique or humane cenſure, ſometimes vpon ſuſpition, rather then religious dread of plagues from Heauen: hee addreſſeth himſelfe likewiſe to the practiſe of affirmatiue precepts, but vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheerefully and with diſtraction, moued thereto, either becauſe he would not be vnlike thoſe men whoſe vprightnes his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence cannot but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend, or from ſom ſurmiſe rather then ſure hope of diuine reward for ſo doing; neuer from vniforme and ſincere delight in the good it ſelfe enioyned, or in the fountaine of goodneſſe, whence the iniunction was deriued. Yet thus to be held in compaſſe, and as it were bound to good outward abearance, much auailes for bringing vs to our right mindes, or for our recouery from hereditary madneſſe; from which our ſoules in ſome meaſure freed, ſtill take ſome tincture from the goodneſſe of the obiects whereunto they are applyed: and this reſtraint of deſires, or interpoſed abſtinence from luſts of the fleſh, yeild opportunities or fit ſeaſons for heauenly medicines to worke vpon vs; which otherwiſe would proue but as good phiſicke to full ſtomacks, leauing no more impreſſion of their ſweetneſſe in our mindes, then wholſome foode doth in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempered

or infected pallates. The temper of the heart once ſeaſoned with habituall grace, is, in reſpect of the word of faith, like to a minde come to maturity in choicer learning, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping fruits more ſweet then hony or the pleaſanteſt grape, from ſeedes as bitter as the birch or willow: ſo as now no bodilie paine or griefe, not gout, or ſtone, or other diſeaſe can withdraw him from thoſe ſtudies, vnto which ſmart of the rod in his yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger daies could hardly driue him. To enforce or allure him to them vpon any other reſpects, then onely for their natiue ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, were as ſuperfluous and impertinent, as to threaten an ambitious man with honour, or hiring a miſer to fill his bagges with gold. The fruits precedent and ſubſequent to true faith, are in ſhape or outward forme (as often heretofore hath been implyed) the ſame, but different in their taſte or reliſh, as alſo in their manner of production. To abſtaine from wrongs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall or reall, from all pollution of the fleſh, to abiure ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous proiects, to miſlike reuengefull, wanton, or couetous thoughts, are fruits that may vniformely ſpring from that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty and goodneſſe of heart, vſually precedent, as we ſuppoſe, to the internall renouation of the minde, but muſt bee enforced as it were by art or externall culture.

But howſoeuer our finall victory ouer the fleſh cannot be gotten but by the ſpirit dwelling in vs; yet to entertaine theſe skirmiſhes or conflicts, though out of reſolutions not inherently ſpirituall, is to verie good purpoſe.

But before the light of the heauenly kingdome be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated in our ſoules (though after the habituation of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reſolutions right and good in their kinde) we haue vſually many tranſient gleames, or illuminations, which inſpire our hearts with ſecret ioy, and rauiſh our ſpirits, whoſe repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions notwithſtanding as quickely vaniſh, as the ſight of our owne bodily ſhape in a glaſſe: Here then is a point of true wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, accurately to obſerue the circumſtances, or meanes vſed by the diuine prouidence for their introduction, and vpon no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of them to eſtrange our ſelues from all other occaſions, for purchaſing the like opportunities as were then affoorded vs. Some mans heart perhaps hath beene thus illuminated, in his retired thoughts or vacancy from ſecular diſturbances: vacan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy then is to him the field wherein this treaſure lies hid, which

Vpon what occaſions ſoeuer the leaſt earneſt of our enheritance is proffered, it ſtands vs vpon out of hand to make vſe of that aboue all other, for better entertaining the like, or ſpeedier going through with offers made. Seeing by grace we can doe all things, and without it nothing, or to no purpoſe: our hearts ſhould be alwaies ready, as to watch when the Lord doth knocke, or giue any ſigne of his preſence; ſo to be doing what he commaunds vpon the firſt ſignification of his will, for then we may be ſure the Lord, who is our ſtrength, is with vs, how long to continue, we cannot tell, <hi>Et ſemper nocuit differre paratis:</hi> eſpecially, when as well the preparation or furniture, as the oportunities are not ours, but wholly at an others diſpoſall, who vpon iuſt contempt or diſlike may retract or with-hold them at his pleaſure.

Now as there can be no want of fire vnleſſe to creeples or chimney-corner ſluggards, whileſt the ſame heate or warmth which it yeelds, may bee as good cheape borrowed from the Sunne, or better procured from proper motion or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation of our blood and ſpirits: ſo can it be no loſſe to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of friends, wealth, or honour, ſolong as the flower and quinteſſence of all the contentments which theſe could occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, may be more plentifully reaped from the peaceable fruition add free exerciſes of our owne ſoules, or right emploiments of their beſt faculties, eſpecially from the excitation of Gods gifts in vs, whereby we are vnited to CHRIST, who is more to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry faithfull ſoule then was <hi>Elkanah</hi> vnto <hi>Hannah</hi> not only much better then many ſonnes, but one in whom, though we had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing beſides, wee may by iuſt title of dominion poſſeſſe all things.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. But if wee muſt affect the former change with all our hearts, with all our ſoules, with our whole intention and reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, no man, it ſeemes, may intend any other matters, ſecular eſpecially. Yes, euen ſuch ſecular buſineſſes as we are ſaid who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or ſolely to intend or minde, abſolutely exclude not all, but onely incompatible cogitations of others matters, though of like kinde. The mutuall compoſſibilitie of actuall particular co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations with vertuall continuance of ſome maine purpoſe or intention, was <note n="d" place="margin">

Our deſires of it ſhould bee as the maine bulcke or truncke, out of which firſt well growen, and throughly ſet, other intentions or reſolutions may ſpring as twigges or branches, or be engrafted in it without annoyance.

This ſhould teach vs alwaies to increaſe our deſires of grace, and moderate our delight in tranſitories: howſoeuer, continuing ſo affected as <hi>Salomon</hi> in his firſt choice was, we may poſſeſſe all things in the Lord, and the abundance of riches, honor or other worldly bleſſings ſhall be truely ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied vnto vs. For not the poſſeſſion of them, or delight in them, but their poſſeſſion or delight with preiudice or interruption of our maine intention or reſolution, is vnlawfull. Ordinarie vinteners haue more wine then moſt noble men in their cellars; ſo haue apothecaries greater choice of delicates in their ſhops, then can be found in Princes palaces: yet are neither vſuallie more peſtered then other men of their rancke or meanes, with ſuch diſeaſes, as exceſſe of wine or ſweet meates engender, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe to fare deliciouſly euery day was no part of their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at their aſſignement to theſe trades, but rather to encreaſe their ſtocke, and gaine ſome perpetuity of Lands or leaſe for themſelues and their poſteritie, by abſtinence and wary dealing with theſe commodities, whereof others either ſurfet or are too licoriſh. Were the kingdome of grace thus primarily and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entended, and the practice of meanes ordained for our ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion conſtantly and fully reſolued vpon, the increaſe of Riches, honour, or other materials of voluptuous life would breed ſmal preiudice to our faith or calling; rather their abundance cauſed more by Gods meere bleſſing, or diſpoſition of his prouidence then by our ſollicitous care or affectation, would bring forth a more heroicall contempt of them then their want can nouriſh,

and, as it vſually comes to paſſe in like caſes, quite take away all delight or pleaſure in them: Vſe them with their excreſcence men thus affected might, yet not as vſurers doe their money for their owne encreaſe, but rathor as a ſtocke to traffique with, for the finall purchaſe of an enheritance not ſubiect to ſuch change or chance as the greateſt and ſureſt worldly poſſeſſions are.

                  <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Rom the former and like parables put foorth by the Author and finiſher of our faith, wee are taught that faith, if perfect, muſt be ſeated in the heart or fountaine of mans vaine ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, whence euill thoughts ſtill iſſue in great abundance, vntill it be cleanſed by infuſion of this purify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace. Moſt fitly doth that parable of the leauen exemplify aswell the vſe of faith, as the truth of this obſeruation. Thus much at leaſt it directly and neceſſarily implies, That our aſſent vnto the Goſpell of the kingdome muſt bee in ſuch a part as the vertue of it may bee diffuſed thence vnto the whole maſſe which it is ordained to ſanctifie: For it muſt ſeaſon our inbred affections, alter the taſt of euerie appetite, qualifie and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then our naturall inclinations vnto good. Now if wee conſult true Philoſophy, no other member in the body beſides the heart, can be a fit ſeat for ſuch abſolute commaund. But whether it be poſſible for <hi>Aſſent,</hi> euery way the ſame with that which thus renewes the minde, and hath ſuch ſoueraignty ouer all our faculties, to lodge els where then in this palace or chiefe manſion of the ſoule, were curioſity to diſpute. Yet admit the ſame faith ſhould els where reſide, it could not exerciſe the like ſouerainty as there it doth: for euery deſire or concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence deepely rooted would in temptations ouerbeare it. Nor is it the greatneſſe of the good propoſed, if our conceipt of it be but ſuperficiall, or our deſires of it admitted onely into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of our ſoules, that can ouerſway ſuch naturall propenſions to a farre leſſe, as ſpring from the heart or center. The reaſon whereof as of many other aſſertions in this ſhort treatiſe,
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:7895:192"/>
ſhall (God willing) at large appeare in the article of euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting life, where iuſt occaſion likewiſe will bee offered to reſcue the heartleſſe imaginations of ſome late diuines more then half yeelded to the authority of <hi>Galen</hi> (though forſaken in that point by the moſt exquiſite moderne profeſſors of the noble ſcience hee taught) that the <hi>head</hi> is the principall member; as if <hi>Solomon</hi> or our Sauiour had ſpoken more vulgarly then accurately or philoſophically, when they aſcribe this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipallity to the heart: How bee it the very ground of their arguments ſuppoſe this vulgar opinion (if ſo men will haue it) to bee an vndoubted truth in nature. But referring phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophicall or ſcholaſtique diſputes of this point or the like, to their proper place, the Gymnoſophiſts deuice to repreſent the peace and quiet ſtate of a temporall monarchie by the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs preſence in the Metropolis, and the diſturbance likely to enſue his abſence may ſerue as a vulgar or popular illuſtration of that ſoueraignety, which faith once ſeated as hath beene ſaid, may exerciſe ouer euery, affection at it pleaſure, but not ſo ſeated ſhall euer want; whileſt hee trod the corners or vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt parts of his buls hide, the depreſſion of one did <hi>raiſe</hi> an other, but, ſtanding once ſtill in the middle, all lay quiet. Thus while our aſſent vnto precepts diuine floats onely in the braine, or keeps reſidence in the borders or ſuburbs of the ſoule, it may perhaps ſuppreſſe ſome one or fewe exorbitant paſſions, but the expulſiue or expugnatiue force which in this caſe it vſeth, being vnweldy, neyther vniforme, nor well planted, will oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion others as bad to ſtirre or mutinee. Vſually whiles men ſtriue to beate folly or vanitie of youth by the ſtrength of Gods Word (not well rooted) out of the fancy, they let in coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe into the heart; oft times ſeeking to keepe out coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouſneſſe, popularity, ambition, or other affection, whoſe helpe faith w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="4 letters">

And if I erre, it is rather charitable feare leaſt others wrong their owne ſoules, then any iealouſie leaſt they ſhould diſparage our profeſſion by proouing Prophets, that makes mee thinke one principall reaſon why the word of faith doth not fructifie or take better roote in the hearts of many indefatigable hearers, is becauſe it ſhootes out too faſt in their mouthes: <hi>they are</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly <hi>as ſwift to ſpeake as to heare:</hi> which kinde of humour <note n="e" place="margin">Iames 1. 19.</note> Saint <hi>Iames</hi> in his time much diſliked, as knowing perhaps this luxuriant flouriſh of words did partly hinder the fructifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of his hearers faith in deedes and workes.

The words, though of God, whileſt vttered by man, vſually want weight to make entrance for themſelues into hearts not well wrought in tender yeeres by good diſcipline: but yet might eaſily ſinke euen into ſuch, being firſt thus pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and as it were ploughed vp by reall accidents, eſpecially by ſtrange and ſad occaſions, as ſickneſſe of body, or other grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous croſſe or calamity, without which neither the threats of the Law, nor ſweet promiſes of the Goſpell, make any great impreſſion vpon many in our daies.
