         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

graue wryters, are wonte darckly to
insinuate thynges of greate weyght,
thynges very necessary for the quiet
and honest leadyng of mannes lyfe,
thynges worthy to be of all men en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced,
worthy to be set fixed and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted

set out in feate colours of wyttie
phantasies, both crepe faster into out
bosomes, and also tarye there with
muche more delectation and profite,
than they wolde, beyng playnly spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.
wherfore as you nowe see, what
they mente by those three ladyes, soo
you muste also nedes see, howe I am
bounde, to owe you my harte, my ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyce,
with al that they bothe may do
<pb facs="tcp:19921:4"/>
for you. For how can I, my lord your
father, beyng so far in amours, with
that louely ladye <hi>Eurydomene,</hi> leaue
myne attendance vpon the other two
damoisels, before life leaue me? How
canne I, beyng enuyronned with soo
many and ample his benefites, not
desyre <hi>Thalia</hi> &amp; <hi>Euphrosyne,</hi> that they
bothe reporte me, to lacke power, but
no good wyll, I trust they bothe shal
haue good cause, so to do. Certes, if I
had sene, where either my lyttel wit,
or poore harte might better haue ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
his lordeshyp, then in openynge
vnto you, his dere and entierly belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
sonne, suche preceptes of vertue,
as may make you most lyke your no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
father, there are noo peynes that
coulde haue kepte me from doyng of
it. Assure your selfe, mayster Crum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,
if labour, and harte may paye
the tribute, that loue oweth, you shal
neuer nede to areste me. This boke,
was gathered by Ludouicus Uiues,
a man greatly conuersant in all good
authores, and excellently wel sene in
all kyndes of learnyng. The booke
hathe vndoutedly, muche more lieng
<pb facs="tcp:19921:4"/>
in his bosome, than the tytle promy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
in the forehed. It is not onely an
Introduction to wysedome, but if ye
goo as it leadeth you, it introduceth
wysedome into you, rootyng the loue
and desire of vertue in your harte, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrping
from it al maner of vyce, and
all vncleannesse, furnishing you with
generall preceptes, for all kyndes of
lyfe, for all ages, for all degrees and
conditions, whiche preceptes, if you
harbour in your breaste, muste nedes
be a greate stay, helpe and comforte
vnto your te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dre age. They shal bring
to passe many thynges in your lyfe
tyme, with greate pleasure, and no
payne at all, whiche otherwyse expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
ofte tymes poudred with byt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
repentance, shulde sease at length
teache you. It is as wyse Socrates
sayeth: Preceptes of learnyng were
inuented at the fyrste, as a nedefull
staye and succour vnto mans mynde,
wanting knowledge and experience:
euen as a staffe is gyuen of necessitie,
to staye vp a feeble bodye. Assuredly,
I knowe no one booke vntranslated,
that hath halfe so many holsome do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumentes
<pb facs="tcp:19921:5"/>
as this hathe, none that
may so well leade you the ryght way
to true honour, none where ye maye
eyther with more delite, or more hope
of your game, trace trewe nobilitie.
Folowe your leader, go on with your
guyde, you shall fynde all the steppes
and grices, wherby not only my lord
your father, honourably hathe clim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to nobilitie, but al other, that in
dede are or were at any tyme noble.
You shall fynde many thynges here
that maye be to men in wealthe and
worshyp an ornament, many that are
to men assauted with the surges of
sower fortune, sure cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sailours, brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyng
with them, besydes ryght and
honest consolation, muche delectable
doctrine: finally, many that are a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerayne
medicine al moste for al dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases.
The booke is nowe youres, I
truste as the Iewels, whiche it offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
vnto you, be great, rare, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouse,
that so ye wol se them layd vp
in place mete for suche ryches. Locke
them faste in the cheste of your harte,
gyue the keye to remembrance, that
she may let them out, and carye them
<pb facs="tcp:19921:5"/>
home agayne, at suche tymes as ye
shall thynke conuenient. If ye make
these preceptes yours, by vse of them
speaking as they teach you, working
as they aduise you, who shall haue
more cause to reioyse of it, than you
your selfe? wherin can you more plese
my lorde your fathers mynde? what
thynge can more satisfye his desyre?
what greater comforte can come to
his lordshyp, then to se you most lyke
him in conditions? What greater
worshyp to you, then to treade in his
steppes? what hygher pleasure to all
them that loue bothe? your countrey
knoweth, what noble feates my lord
your father hathe wrought by wyse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
lady gouernour of all vertues?
who knoweth not, howe honesty may
reioyse, howe truthe &amp; religion maye
holde vp theyr handes to heuen, that
god hath sente to so gratiouse so pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
&amp; wyse a prince, so good so wyse
and so faythefull a councellour? to so

to so hyghe couragiouse and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouse

an harte and stomacke? I must leaue
<pb facs="tcp:19921:6"/>
of, I am entred iuto to longe a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for a shorte epistle. Wherfore I
can no more, but with al harte, desire
god, that it may please hym, longe to
preserue noble <hi>HENRY</hi> the <hi>VIII.</hi>
styll in all wealthe, in all honour to

that ye may be heyre of

               <p>ANd for as moche, as in this

soule, inclosed within our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
greate treasure in brickle vessels,
we may not vtterly refuse, and caste
awaye al regarde and respecte to the
bodye. Yet we must so entreate, and
ordre the same, that it may not take
it selfe, to be a mayster or a felowe,
but rather a seruannte, and that, Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

for Soulles sake.</p>
               <p>The more cherisshyng that the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>case

vpon, the more delicately the bodye
is handled, the more stubbornelye it

dothe caste it of, as an horse to well

The heuye burden of the bodye soore

               <p>Meate, slepe, al maner of exercise,

rather wronge, not to consider, what

               <p>Thou oughtest not, to moche to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyse,

or fierce of harte?</p>
               <p>And for as moche, as this lyfe is
none other thynge, but a certayne
pylgremage, wherby we styll be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trynge
in to an other lyfe eternall,
and seinge also, we nede very fewe

               <p>For what eude or purpose shulde

<pb facs="tcp:19921:30"/>

               <p>He is a very free man, whiche de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syreth
onely those thynges, as be in

he a bondman and slaue, that dothe
the contrary.</p>
               <p>Nowe I praye you, what other
thynge is it, to be replenysshed with
the giftes of Fortune, than a foote
man to be combred with diuers and
many fardelles.</p>
               <p>There is no man so dulle, no such
lacke wytte, but he rather prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
and fytteth hym selfe for the

than stylle seeketh thynges for his

               <p>Sythens this our lyfe is of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
droupyng and fleinge, the moste

we can not say, we liue all the

and in especiall, whan the feare
of death troubleth vs. And where as
death may come to vs, by an infinite
<pb facs="tcp:19921:30"/>
sorte of wayes. It is greate folye, to
feare, that it shulde come this waye
or that way: and seing that it shal of
necessity come, we may not committe
any great mischiefe or wickednes, to
auoyde it, nor we ought to mourne,
though it chaunce.</p>
               <p>Our lyfe beynge oppressed with
so many diuers myseries, what nede
we to kepe it with suche anxietie? to
sette so moche by it, seinge also we
go to an other, whiche is a life euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastynge?
Let vs so order our selues
that we haue redy passage to that
lyfe, whiche is replenyshed with all
goodnesse, full of ioye eternall, ful of
myrth euerlastyng.</p>
               <p>Our errours oppresse vs, rather
than thinges them self: where as we
ofte tymes thynke them to be great
euyls, that are none in dede and gret
goodes, that of trouthe are worthe
nought.</p>
               <p>The nature, condition, and true
value of thynges be those, whiche I
haue reherced in the begynnynge,
wherby it may be plainely gathered
that there is nothyng fayre, nothing
<pb facs="tcp:19921:31"/>
of pryce, fynally nothynge to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
ours, but only vertue.</p>
               <p>Where as delyberation is taken,
we beinge in doubte, to which parte
we may most inclyne, the loue of our
bodye, and the desyre of thynges
here in this lyfe, that is to saye, the
loue of our selfe, is chiefe councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
and one that we all togyther
folowe.</p>
               <p>This weakeneth the strength and
manhod of our myndes, so moche
that nothyng can be so lyttell, but it
is easely able to penetrate them, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
so sklender or smal, but it may
be able to disturbe them.</p>
               <p>This blyndeth the eyes of the
mynde, and whan affections haue
ones gotten the vpper hande, we flat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter,
we yelde, we obey them, as our
lordes and rulers.</p>
               <p>Thus we hold thynges with tothe
and nayle, that are alien from vs, as
they were ours: and if they be with
drawen from vs, we lament, tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentynge
our selues, as though we
had great losse.</p>
               <p>We neglecte our owne, as none
<pb facs="tcp:19921:31"/>
of oures, and do shonne thinges pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fytable,
as very hurtefull to vs, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brasynge
thynges hurtfull, as very
profitable.</p>
               <p>The harmes of the folkes seme
small, but we thynke our owne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge
northynge so great as theyrs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable:
neither content with that
we wyshe our selues, nor yet pleased
if we myght obteyne that that other
men moche desyre. We lyke not our
selues, this world, the condition and
estate therof, doth not satisfie vs: we
wold haue the natures of al thinges
turned, such is the impaciencie, that
groweth of deyntie fantasies.</p>
               <p>What punyshement may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
with these? trewely the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes
amonge damned spirites be
none other. The dyuels them selues
haue none other punyshement, than
that they be vexed with enuy, hatred
and wrothe.</p>
               <p>A man may se the counteuaunce
of them, that be inquieted with these
affections, howe variable, how care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
howe pantyng, how cruell, how
fearefull they be, and in lyke trade
<pb facs="tcp:19921:32"/>
be their mindes racked and tourmen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted
within them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>ANGRE,</hi> whiche is the sorest of al
other perturbations, and worst of al
other, becommeth not a man, for it
turneth his nature into a cruel beast,
and althoughe euery trouble dothe
obscure and darken the iudgement
of the mynde, yet moste of all Ire, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerwhelmeth
it with darkenes soo
sore, that it seeth neyther Truthe,
profytte, or comlynes. It eateth vp
the harte, and drynketh vp the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
bloud of the body, constraining
man to do that thing, wherof Repen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tance
shortly ensueth.</p>
               <p>How shameful a chaunge is there
in the face, what sodeyn tempestes
aryse there, what burnynge eyes,
what snuffynge of the nose, what
grennyng of the tethe, what foming
of the mouthe, what palenes, what
stuttynge of tonge, fynally, what
terryble and vncomely cryinges be

               <p>All humayne wisedome, compared

               <p>Thou shalt scorne no man, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring,

               <p>It is a token of a dogged harte,

               <p>Ageine thou canst do nothing more

               <p>The chyefest and happyest of all

               <p>No treasure is of so great certayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,

               <p>The redyest way to be loued, is
fyrst to loue. For loue is allured by
nothyng so moche as by loue.</p>
               <p>Loue is gotten also by Uertue,
whiche of her self is so amiable, that
ofte times she inuiteth, and in maner
constraineth men to loue her, whiche
neuer knewe her.</p>
               <p>Loue is also allured by tokens of
vertue, as by demure softnesse, by

by gentyll and fayre speche, spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
if thou neyther say ne do any
thyng, that sauereth of arrogancy,
insolency, or malopert vncleannesse.
Let al thy actes be sweete, softe, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyll,
and pure.</p>
               <p>The venome of loue and amitie is,
to loue thy frende so, that thou yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
vpon occasion to hate him, or so
to take him thy frend, that thou thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kest
he may be thyn ennemy.</p>
               <p>This sayeng is godly, I hate, as
one redy to loue.</p>
               <p>Let no remembrance of displeasure
be, where loue is, nother thinke, that
he, whom thou takest for thy frende,
<pb facs="tcp:19921:49"/>
can be thy ennemy, for els shall thy
loue be very weake and brickle.</p>
               <p>In frendshyp must be such fayth,
constancy, and symplicitie, that in
no wyse, thou haue any suspition in
thy frende, or gyue eare vnto them
that suspecte hym, or shall euyll re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porte
hym.</p>
               <p>Lyfe is no lyfe, to suche as lyue in
suspition or feare, but rather suche
lyfe is a continuall death.</p>
               <p>Be not inquisitiue, howe other
men liue: for they that passe to moch
of other mens affayres, ofte tymes
loke vpon theyr owne busynes but
sklenderly. It is a poynt of great
foly, well to knowe other men, and
not to knowe thy selfe.</p>
               <p>Of this thynge ryse many pryuy
grudges, and suche as vse these thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,

to knowe other men so well, and to

Excepte thou thinke thy selfe able to

that as our nature of it selfe is prone

               <p>Be gentle to thy inferiours, lowely

               <p>Disdayne not, to be contempned of

thynke it not forthwith, to be done of

very delicate and impacient, if thou
count small tickelinges, great woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des.
Thou must not suppose thy selfe

it is not lefull for them so muche as

               <p>It is better, to take wrong, than to
do wrong, better to be deceiued, than
to deceiue, whiche thynge naturall
wysedome taught many, as Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,

               <p>Remembre, it is a point of humain

               <p>It is a token of a gentle and noble

<pb facs="tcp:19921:61"/>
anger, whiche thing euen very
nature sheweth in dombe beastes.</p>
               <p>And seyng, god is redy to do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more ofte, or more gladly, than
to forgiue, who is so madde, to deny,
but that the same thing is both most
godly and most excellent, by whiche
we so moche resemble the nature of
that highe and mightie god?</p>
               <p>Deale thou with other men, as thou
woldest Christ shuld deale with the.</p>
               <p>And truely, it is mere, that thou
graunt lyke forgiuenes to thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
as thou nedest at goddis hand,

               <p>There is no prayer more accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
or of more efficacy afore god, than
that his sonne Iesus Christ, our lord,
hath taught vs, whiche is therfore
named, Our lordes prayer: Nowe,
thou canst not saye that prayer with
a pure mynde, excepte thou vtterly
and with all thy harte, forgyue thy

god to forgyue the. A great faute is
forgyuen vs, vnder this condition,
that we forgyue a lyght offence.</p>

               <p>Beware, whan thou arte moued,
that thou auenge not thyne owne

moche lesse in thy felowe ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt.
Thou arte iniurious to thy

               <p>God is lorde ouer all men, we all
his seruauntes, be thou content to

suffereth it. Therfore gyueth he this
commandement, <hi>Leaue the reuengeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t

payed.</hi> For seyng the iniury is in the
hart, and not in the dede, onely god
knoweth, what thy hart was, and
what belongeth therto.</p>
               <p>It behoueth the, not onely to loue
thy selfe, but also to shewe thy selfe
worthy to be had in reuerence, so
that thou mayst be ashamed of thy
