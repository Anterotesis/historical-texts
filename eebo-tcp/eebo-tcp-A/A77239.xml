            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THough I believe you have no Remorſe, yet I ſuppoſe you cannot but be conſcious, how unworthily you have uſed me; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, whenever you do any thing which is injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous &amp; oppreſſive, you are apt to excuſe your ſelf by your <hi>Orders,</hi> in the obſervance of which, eſpecially when they are harſh and ſevere, you pretend to a great deal of care and ſtrictneſs; I deſire therefore to know what <hi>Warrant</hi> you had to commit me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Dungeon,</hi> and to detain me there four dayes, under ſuch Rigorous and Unchriſtian Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that none could have been guilty of doing, but one, who, together with his Religion, had put off all ſence of common Humanity. You have told me indeed, and it is a Poſition, not only falſe and damnable in <hi>Divinity,</hi> but utterly deſtructive of our <hi>Engliſh Liberty,</hi> that <hi>The King hath a Prerogative above the Law, by which he may puniſh Whom and How he pleaſeth:</hi> But were I willing ſo far to unman my ſelf, and to deny both my Religion and Reaſon, as to admit of that, yet I am ſure, His <hi>Jaylor</hi> hath no <hi>Prerogative,</hi> but <unclear>ſtands</unclear> upon the <gap reason="illegible: damage" extent="1 word">

               </gap> Level with the reſt of his Brethren: And therefore it is my purpoſe to call you to an Account for that <hi>barbarous,</hi> and, in a Chriſtian State, never ſufficiently to be <hi>abhorred</hi> Action, unleſs you have the <hi>King's,</hi> or his <hi>Secretaries</hi> Hand to authoririze you for the doing of it.</p>
            <p>But, <hi>Sir,</hi> that ſaying, how unjuſtifiable ſoever, is but part of your Crime, for when I adviſed You not to do any thing but what you could juſtifie by Law: You replied, that <hi>You had nothing to do either with the Law or Parliaments;</hi> and You do daily ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt by your <hi>Lawleſs</hi> carriage, both to my ſelf and the reſt of the Priſoners here, that you ſpake as you thought. But, Sir, ſuch an Aſſertion, in perſons who are entruſted with the Lives of others, is ſo Black and Horrid; and the condition of thoſe who are under your Power, is by it, made ſo Unſafe, that I dare no longer conceal my knowledge, but intend forth with to ſignify unto ſome <hi>Members</hi> of the <hi>Houſe of Commons,</hi> what a Monſtrous and Unnatural kind of Offender you are; of which I thought fit to give you this private Notice, that you might not be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized, but prepare your ſelf, either to defend, or, which I rather wiſh, to expiate your Fault by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
            <p>Sir, It is poſſible you may think, that a juſt and due ſenſe of my own Unmerited and Illegal Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, hath excited me to ſeek for Juſtice upon <gap reason="illegible: damage" extent="1 word">
