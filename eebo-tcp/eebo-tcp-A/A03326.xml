            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>I. Higgins to the Reader.</head>
            <p>AMongst diuers &amp; sondry Chronicles of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Nations, I thincke there are none (gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle reader) so uncertaine &amp; briefe in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge as ours, at which I cannot but mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile sith at all times oure Ilande had as learned writers (some singuler men excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) as any Nation under y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Sunne. Againe those, which now are our best Chroniclers as they report haue great Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but what they publish of late yeares may be enlarged in many places by Chronicles of other Nations: whereby it is manifest they are either ignoraunt of the to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gues, orels not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> study of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which they most professe for if they were, me thincks it were easye for them w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> such Antiquities as they brag they haue, to fetch our Distories from the beginning, &amp; make them as ample as the Chronicles of any other Country or Nation. But they are faine in steede of other stuffe to talke of the <hi>Romaines, Greekes, Persians, &amp;c.</hi> and to fill our Distoryes with their facts &amp; fables. This I speake not to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> end I would haue ours quite seperate from other without any mention of them, but I would haue them ther onelye named wher th'af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres of both countryes by warre, peace, truce, mariage, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique or some necessary cause or other is intermired. I haue seene no auncient antiquities in writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hand but two, one was <hi>Galfridus of Munmouth</hi> which I lost by misfortune, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an old Chronicle in a kind of Englishe Verse, beginning at <hi>Brute</hi> and endinge at the death of <hi>Humfrey</hi> Duke of <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester,</hi> in the which and diuers other good Chronicles I finde manye thinges not mentioned in that great tome engroced of late by Maister <hi>Grafton</hi> and that where he is most barraine and wantes matter. But as the greatest heades, the grayest heyres, and best clarkes haue not most witte, so the greatest Bookes, titles and Tomes containe not most mater. And this haue I spoken because in writinge the Tragedies of the first infortunate Princes of this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, I was often faine to vse
<pb facs="tcp:6488:6"/>
mine owne simple inuention (yet not swaruing from the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) because the Chronicles (althoughe they wente out vnder diuers mens names) in some suche places as I moste needed their ayde wrate one thing: and that so brieflye that a whole Princes raigne, life and death, was comprised in three lines. Yea and sometimes mine olde booke aboue mentioned holpe mee out when the rest forsoke mee, as for <hi>Lanquet, Stowe,</hi> and <hi>Grafton</hi> were alwayes nighe of one opinion, but the Floure of Histories somewhat larger, some helpe had I of an olde Chronicle imprinted y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> yeare 1515. But surely mee thincks and so do most which delite in historyes, it were worthily done if one Chronicle were drawne from the beginning in such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect sort, that all monuments of vertuous men, (to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> eralting of Gods glorye) and all punishments of vicious persons (to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> terrour of the wicked) might be registred in perpetuall reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce. To which thing the right reuerende father in God <hi>Matthew</hi> Archbishoppe of <hi>Canterbury</hi> &amp; Metropolitane of Englande hath brought such ayde as well by printing as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruinge the written Chronicles of this Realme that by his Graces studye and paines, the labour in time to come wilbe farre more easye to them shall take such trauaile in hande. But to leaue with these and declare the cause of my purpose. As I chaunced to reade the <hi>Mirour for Magistrates</hi> &amp; worke by all men wonderfully commended, and full of fitte instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for preseruation of eche estate: takinge in hand y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Chra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles, and minding to conferre the times: mee thoughte the liues of a nomber euen at the beginninge the like infortunate Princes, offered themselues vnto mee as matter verye meete for imitation the like admonition, miter and phrase, and seing <hi>Baldwine</hi> by these woordes moued mee some what thereto: <q>
                  <hi>It were</hi> (sayth hee) <hi>a goodly and a notable matter to search and discourse our whole story from the beginninge of the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting of this Isle, &amp;c.</hi>
               </q> I read the storyes, I considered of the Princes, I noted their liues, and therewith conferred theyr deathes. On this I toke penne in hande, mindinge nothinge
<pb facs="tcp:6488:7"/>
lesse then to publishe them abroade: but onelye to trye what I coulde do if neede were or time and leasure were giuen mee to bestow in such wise. I wrote the two first euen as they now are, and because I would not keepe secrete my first labours in this kinde of studye (though I might well haue blushed at the basenes of my stile) I shewed them to a freiude of mine, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his bufayned iudgement in this matter: which when he had read he neuer left intreating mee to write other, til I had ended all to the byrth of <hi>CHRIST,</hi> and yet not so content: he desired meet'accomplish the residue til I came to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, (which were welnighe fiftye Cragedies) but wearied with those which I had written, I desired him pause on this, till time and leasure were giuen mee. Yet he makinge rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to other his frendes what I had done, left mee not quiet till they likewise had seene them. Whose perswasion, as it seemed without any suspition of assentation or flatery, so bath it made mee bolder at this present then before. <q>
                  <hi>For although</hi> (sayd they) <hi>your Tragedies be simple and not comparable to those which the other before haue written: yet when men consider that many wrote those, but one these: that they are graue writers, you are but yong: the perfection of those sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and th'imperfection of these. Finally the good will you beare to your country, the commendation of vertue, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation of vice, the fall of ambition, the horrible ende of traytours, harlots, tyraunts, adulters, enchaunters, murderers and such like. VVhen men (said they) consider these things they cannot (how simple soeuer your Verse bee) but thincke well of the matter.</hi>
               </q> At length with these perswasions and suche like: I was contente (good Reader) to publishe them for thy behoufe, and the publique weale of my countrye. At which if thou enuye: I minde not therefore to enuye my selfe and staye my penne: but God willing thou shalt as fast as I can prepare them, haue other Bookes from my handes which maye please thee againe, and thus with all my harte I bidde the hartelye farewell.</p>
