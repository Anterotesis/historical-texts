         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

ACCOUNT
OF
What paſt on Monday the 28th. of
October, 1689. in relation to the
Earl of Caſtlemaine, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THE <hi>Attorney General</hi> being (on <hi>Saturday</hi> the
26<hi>th</hi> of <hi>October</hi> 1689.) inform'd, that the
Earl of <hi>Caſtlemaine,</hi> Sr. <hi>Edward Hales</hi> and
other Priſoners of the <hi>Tower,</hi> were brought
by their <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> to the Hall to be bail'd, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd
to know the Pleaſure of the Houſe in that Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair;
who order'd that they ſhould preſently be all
ſent for to their Bar; which was done accordingly;
Only the ſaid Earl was not there; for he remain'd
ſtill in the Tower, having (it ſeems) made uſe of no
ſuch Writ; However the Houſe directed the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to bring him up (as he did) the <hi>Monday</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing;
And then the <hi>Speaker</hi> ſaid to this Effect.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Mr. Speaker to my Lord.</head>
               <p>MY Lord, the Houſe having underſtood, That
You went Embaſſador to <hi>Rome;</hi> and alſo
took your place at the Board as a Privy Councellor
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64690:3"/>
without taking the Oaths (which are great Crimes,
and againſt Law.) They have ſent for you to
know what you have to ſay for your ſelf.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>His Lordſhip's Anſwer.</head>
               <p>IT cannot (Mr. <hi>Speaker)</hi> but put me into more
then an ordinary Confuſion, when I find my ſelf
in this place as a Criminal; eſpecially, ſeeing
(through the whole courſe of my Life) the Glory
and Welfare of <hi>England</hi> has been my chief Aim and
Endeavour. You are pleas'd Sir to lay ſo great a
Charge upon me, that (without ſhuffling or imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence)
I might ask time to conſider it; Yet ſince
I well know how much you value your time, and
ſince time alſo may make what I ſay ſuſpected more
of Artifice then Candor, I ſhall now (without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
delay) let you and this great Aſſembly ſee
(where ſo many of Birth and Quality are met) how
far I am from deſerving either cenſure or reproach.
But (Mr. <hi>Speaker)</hi> before I go further, I muſt humbly
beg theſe few Favours of you. <hi>First,</hi> that you
would Pardon all <hi>Tautologies</hi> or want of Method, as
beginning perchance in the middle, and ending a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
where I ſhould have begun. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That
you would not take any advantage at my Anſwers,
for I ſhall be Ingenuous to the utmoſt, and heſitate
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64690:3"/>
at nothing you ſhall ask. And <hi>Laſtly,</hi> if (through
inadvertency or haſt) I ſhould ſay what might
ſhock you, that you would not ſtand upon the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor
of the Words, but upon the ſincerity and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of my Explanation.</p>
               <p>Be pleas'd then to know, Sir, I was ſo far from
ſeeking this Employment, that I did not ſo much
as dream it was deſign'd me; And when I knew it,
I us'd my utmoſt endeavour to avoid it. My ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
of the Kings Intentions appears by this, that
(in the Year I went to <hi>Rome)</hi> returning out of the
Country (according to my uſual cuſtom) after <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaelmas,</hi>
I found a Proteſtant, a Perſon of Note at my
Houſe, who told me, that before I ſpoke with any Man,
he was to bring me to my Lord <hi>Sunderland,</hi> and from
thence I was to go to his Majeſty; Nor would he
(ſcarce) afford me time to put my ſelf in a tollerable
order to attend them. My Lord <hi>Sunderland</hi> ſoon
hinted to me, what the Kings intentions were; And
when I recurr'd to his Friendſhip, I had this Anſwer,
or Words to this purpoſe; That if Subjects ſhould
refuſe their Kings Service in every thing that was
troubleſom or <hi>Contre-Coeur,</hi> all Kings would be in an
ill Condition; that my requeſt was beyond his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
and that he believed I ſhould find his Majeſty
very poſitive; and ſo I did Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> I'l aſſure you.
Nay to ſatisfie you yet more fully of my backward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to this Journey; can you think, Sir, that I, that
had been at <hi>Rome</hi> more then once; that had ſeen
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64690:4"/>
the Grandeur of ſo many <hi>Roman</hi> Embaſſies; and
knew they exceeded in Splendor and Expence three
times thoſe to any Crown'd Head whatſoever, ſhould
not be extraordinarily concern'd at an Employment,
which had for its Subſiſtance (as the Lords of the
Treaſury well known) no other Eſtabliſhment then
that to <hi>Spain</hi> or <hi>France,</hi> which (being 100 <hi>l.</hi> a week)
amounts only to 5200 <hi>Pounds per. annum?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having thus Sir, ſhew'd you how little fond I was
of the thing, let me now (with Submiſſion) ask you,
what could I otherwiſe do in my Circumſtances?
For firſt I call all that's Good to witneſs, I never heard
of Law againſt it, nor know of any to this very day;
And yet (on the other ſide) I was not only Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by the King, but knew his Royal and Legal
Power of Commanding the Service of his Subjects,
and moſt particularly in Embaſſies, as appears by
many old Examples; Nay, by a fatal one in this very
Century; I mean the Caſe of <hi>Overbury,</hi> to which no
body here (I'm ſure) is a ſtranger. In the next place,
Sir, what did I go to <hi>Rome for?</hi> Why only with a
Letter; with a Complement from a profeſt and open
Catholic King to his Holyneſs, as all Princes of that
Communion do in the beginning of their Reſpective
Reigns. Beſides Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> as I know no Law,
that forbad my Obedience, ſo I muſt needs ſay (and
this without cramping or putting any Bounds to
the Legiſlative Power) that no ſuch Law can be
made; For Sir, the Pope is a very conſiderable Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Prince, whoſe Territories border on two Great
Seas, the <hi>Miditerranean</hi> and <hi>Adriatic;</hi> If then our
Merchants ſhould be by ſtorm or other neceſſities,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64690:4"/>
driven into his Ports; if <hi>Engliſh-men</hi> ſhould be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
by any <hi>Roman</hi> Party as they travel in a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Country, ſhall our Government (not to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
a hundred other greater accidents) want Power
to ſend a Meſſenger to Ranſom and Compound for
them? What Law therefore was there ever yet fram'd,
or can be enacted (let the Commerce or Intercourſe
between Nations be never ſo much broken and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited)
but that a Commander in Chief, a General,
and much more a King, may beat a Parley, diſpatch
a Trumpet, nay, ſend and receive Letters as often
as occaſion does require?</p>
               <p>Now (Mr. <hi>Speaker)</hi> for Religion, I neither had any
Commiſſion concerning it, nor Tranſacted with
his Holyneſs about it; And as no body ever did, or
could lay any thing of that nature to my charge, ſo
for ſome confirmation of it, I will appeal even to the
<hi>Aqua freſca</hi> Houſes of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to all the <hi>Proteſtant</hi>
Gentlemen of our Nation there during my Embaſſie;
for though what I tell you, Sir, be a Wonder, yet the
Honourable Perſons, who have reſided in thoſe
parts, know it to be true, that for a Diſh of <hi>Chocolate</hi>
or a Diſh of <hi>Limonade,</hi> one may know the meaſures
and particulars of an Embaſſy in that City, as well
as we do what paſſes within theſe Walls at our Coffee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes.
I am ſure my under Servants have often ſmil'd
at the <hi>Grimaces</hi> and <hi>Myſteries</hi> which my <hi>Secretaires</hi> us'd
in the beginning to make before my <hi>Audiences;</hi> for
they have told them (within few hours after my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn)
almoſt Word by Word what had paſs'd. Give
me alſo leave, Sir, to add one truth more, which will
aſſure you that I had no dangerous intreague in hand;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64690:5"/>
and this is, that notwithſtanding his <hi>Holyneſs</hi> never
had the leaſt imagination or thought, but that I was
as real and ſincere a Catholic as any Man living;
and the ſame thing alſo I can ſay of all the <hi>Cardinals;</hi>
and in fine, of the whole Court in general; Yet none
of them (and every <hi>Engliſh-man</hi> in Town knew it) but
look't upon me as one, that if any Immunity of the
Crown were in queſtion, or any Temporal Concern
of the Kingdom touch't, would ſtand as much in the
Gap, and be in as Diametrical an oppoſition, as any
Perſon of the <hi>Reform'd Religion</hi> whatſoever.</p>
               <p>You ſee then Sir, both how, and why I went; nor
have I done any thing certainly to merit any Man's
unkindneſs or ill-will; nay, to lay yet further before
you the hardſhip I am under, I ſhall ſtate you a Caſe,
not fetch't out of old forgotten Records, or Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted
in an Age diſparate from ours, but of a Man
attainted in this very Houſe, in the memory of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
now ſitting, and even whil'ſt I my ſelf had the
Honour to be a Member of it. The Caſe Mr. <hi>Speaker</hi>
is <hi>Axtels</hi> the <hi>Regicide;</hi> one whoſe Crime (I dare ſay)
my greateſt Enemies think I abhor in the higheſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
nor do I mention the thing in favour of the Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
but in Honour of his grave and worthy Judges.
<hi>Axtell</hi> you know (Mr. <hi>Speaker)</hi> was Indicted for the
Murther of <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Firſt;</hi> And to ſhew that he
maliciouſly contriv'd and abetted it, the Kings
Counſel urg'd his Commanding in the <hi>Hall</hi> at the
Tryal; his placing the Sentinels all about; And in
ſhort, his performing there the whole Office of <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>
of the <hi>Guard.</hi> The Priſoner anſwer'd; but pray,
Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> let me beg Pardon, if the Interval of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
Thirty Years has made me forget his Words, I
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64690:5"/>
am ſure the ſenſe of them I have not; I ſay, Sir, the
Priſoner anſwer'd; <hi>My Lords I am under great op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
I am hardly dealt with. Has</hi> Charles <hi>the</hi> Second
<hi>been ſo Gracious as to paſs over the ordinary tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of his ſtray'd Subjects, and to look upon the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of Souldiers to their then Superiors, as if the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
had been more Legal? And ſhall I now dye (who was
under Military Diſcipline) for that, which I muſt have
preſently died for, had I not done it;</hi> to wit, <hi>had I not
drawn up my Regiment, kept the Poſt order'd me, and
perform'd the other duties, the Concourſe being great and
troubleſom?</hi> Upon this the Judge reply'd; I confeſs
(conſidering the Kings merciful Reſolutions) that
your Argument is ſtrong; it has great weight in it;
But Mr. <hi>Axtell,</hi> did you do no more? Did you only
perform the Duty of a Commanded Souldier? Who
was it (I pray) that animated the Rabble? Who
beat the Souldiers for not crying Juſtice? Who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd
ſpitting in the Kings Face? And who bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barouſly
revil'd and threatned a Noble Lady, that
in the tranſports of her zeal (when ſhe ſaw her Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
abus'd, when ſhe heard ſuch Blaſphemy againſt
him, and all this Father'd upon the Nation) made
a noiſe or ſtir in the Court? Theſe things therefore
Sir, being prov'd againſt him; He was convicted,
condemn'd, and ſo paid a Debt to Juſtice, and to
the Sacred Aſhes of that great and juſt Man.</p>
               <p>Now Mr. <hi>Speaker</hi> to application; And <hi>firſt</hi> (after
a little glance on the tenderneſs of theſe Judges,
when any necessity could be pretended) let me with
your Pardon ask you, ſhall I ſuffer as a Tranſgreſſor
of the Law, were there any, when I muſt have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64690:6"/>
by the Law, had I refus'd his Majeſties Orders
and Commands? But Sir, if you demand, did I do
no more then carry a Letter, or go with a Ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>how d'ye</hi> from the King? I muſt anſwer yes,
and a great deal more too. For my Houſe was an
<hi>Aſylum,</hi> a Place of Refuge to all diſtreſs't or oppreſs't
fellow Subjects. If Seamen mutiny'd or had any
conteſt with their Captains, here a Reconciliation
was made, and here they return'd to their Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
if the Captains themſelves (fraughted for the
<hi>Camera)</hi> were delay'd their Money, or miſus'd by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Officers, they quickly found Redreſs, and often
(by my intereſt) receiv'd more then they themſelves
expected; And if the queſtion happened about quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,
or how Goods were condition'd at delivery,
the Verdict I am ſure went ſtill on their ſide. Nor was
my care confin'd to <hi>Rome</hi> only, but reach't to all the
Factories of <hi>Italy:</hi> For the <hi>Conſuls</hi> themſelves, nay e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
private Perſon found both an eaſie acceſs to me,
and an indefatigable Zeal in their concerns; ſo that
the Merchants in General that had to do in thoſe
Parts, were far from being behind hand in their
thankful acknowledgments. Nay one of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
Companies of our Nation, I mean that for <hi>Turkey,</hi>
not only return'd me their thanks very heartily by
Letter, but did it again by Word of Mouth after my
Arrival home.</p>
               <p>I am ſure (Mr. <hi>Speaker)</hi> if the Employment I ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to were a fault, I have already not a little ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
for it; for I never put bounds (as our Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
as well as my own Officers fully know) to any
Expence that could be imagin'd for the Dignity of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64690:6"/>
the Nation; And give me leave to tell you alſo Sir,
that though the Name of <hi>Rome</hi> may be harſh and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greatful
to your Ears, yet what I did, was with a good
intention, and like a true and faithful <hi>Engliſh-man.</hi>
For had I been ſent with a Character to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi>
where they are <hi>Mahometans;</hi> or to <hi>China,</hi> where <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles;</hi>
the <hi>Eclat</hi> or Figure which I ſhould have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd
to make, would never be conſider'd by
you as an Honour to their Religion, but our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
therefore ſince it is a Diſparagement and great
Reflection to a Kingdom, to come below or ſhort of
others in any thing that is public and of note, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but have (at leaſt) faint hopes, that you will
have ſome conſideration, ſome opinion of an Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador
(though at <hi>Rome)</hi> that kept up (to his Power)
the Glory and Grandeur of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> not to trouble you longer on the
preſent Head, I'le end when I have told you this;
That if I have done amiſs in obeying the King's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
no <hi>Conſul</hi> that has purſu'd Pirate or <hi>Bandite</hi>
to <hi>Rome;</hi> No private Factor that has follow'd a
Debter thither; Nor in ſhort any Man that has Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
ſo much as one Letter to that City, though it
were to demand his own, but is a far greater Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
then my ſelf, and lyes at the mercy of every Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to be Indicted as a Contemner and Breaker of the
Laws.</p>
               <p>Your ſecond Charge Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> is my being a
<hi>Privy Counſellour,</hi> without taking the appointed
Oaths; To which I can truly ſay, they were never
offer'd me; though I muſt alſo confeſs (for I ſhall be
ſincere with you in every thing) that I believe, nay
that I am certain, I ſhould not have taken them, had
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:64690:7"/>
they been offer'd; So that I do acknowledge the
Omiſſion a fault againſt Law—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Here the <hi>Speaker</hi> thinking that his Lordſhip had made an
End, deſir'd him to withdraw; but being inform'd that
he had not done; He excus'd the Interruption, and then his
Lordſhip went on.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſay (Mr. <hi>Speaker)</hi> I acknowledge this a fault againſt
Law, were there not ſeveral things of weight, that
will (I hope) juſtify me to you; And here, Sir, I muſt
entreat you, not to conceive that I come now to
defend or make good the <hi>Diſpenſing Power,</hi> but only
to ſhew you how neceſſarily I was driven and induc't
to the aforeſaid Omiſſion; for (Mr. <hi>Speaker)</hi> in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies
and diſputes, what can one doe, but recur
either to his own Obſervation, or to the opinion of
learn'd Men, and Profeſſors in the Science?</p>
               <p>In the <hi>firſt</hi> place then, when I began to examine
my ſelf as to the Right the King claim'd and aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
I ſaw <hi>Non obſtantes</hi> deem'd Legal, which ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
to me <hi>Diſpenſing;</hi> I found the Power of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
Sheriffs own'd for many Ages to be undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Law, and yet I knew there was a poſitive Statute
againſt it; Nay I remember'd an Act, which I my
ſelf had in this Houſe given my Vote and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to, <hi>viz.</hi> That about <hi>the Regulation of Carriages
and Waggons;</hi> Or if this be not the exact Title, I
muſt beſeech you to Pardon my Treacherous Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and 'tis I'le aſſure you the only Traytor I ever
yet ſuccoured or ſupported; I ſay Sir, I remember'd
this very Act (almoſt as ſoon as made) ſuſpended by
<hi>Charles</hi> the 2<hi>d's.</hi> Proclamation without the leaſt Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64690:7"/>
or Murmur; and I took ſo much notice of it, as
to make even then this Reflection (and I do aſſure
you upon my Honour 'tis true) That though our
<hi>Monarchs</hi> could not <hi>impoſe</hi> and <hi>abrogate Laws</hi> o
themſelves, yet they had the <hi>Power</hi> (I perceiv'd) to
<hi>reſpite</hi> them.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>ſecond</hi> place (Mr. <hi>Speaker)</hi> if I went abroad;
I mean if I conſulted the Thoughts and Sentiments
of others, I found not only Great Men of the long
Robe, but the Judges alſo themſelves declaring in
favour of this Prerogative; And the interpretation or
determination of theſe Sages was always told me to be
Law, till a new Law or a new Explanation ſhould be
enacted. What would you then (Mr. <hi>Speaker)</hi> have
me to do, who was call'd to the Board by the King;
who could not in Conſcience take the Oaths; and
yet had no reaſon to think I committed (in not
taking them) a Crime; ſeeing the Law was thus
openly expounded and publiſht?</p>
               <p>And now Sir, ſince I have been forc't to mention
my Religion, which I know is a legal Fault, and of
a high Nature; I muſt not forget alſo to celebrate
the Goodneſs of this Houſe, which has pardon'd the
Fault, even in the ſolemneſt Way, and by the ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Act that ever paſt ſince <hi>Magna Charta;</hi> to wit,
<hi>The great Act of Oblivion.</hi> Give me leave Sir, to
ſay this too, for I can juſtly do it; That being ſo
faithful and ſo true an <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> I neither ſhould
nor could (I am ſure) have ever, during my Life,
offended my Country, but in my Religion. Pardon
alſo I humbly beſeech you this digreſſion, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with it the Incoherences and Disjunctions
all along; Nor ſhall I any ways doubt of it, ſince
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:64690:8"/>
you ſo well know how uneaſy and troubleſome a
long diſcourſe (which my Circumſtances have now
required) muſt needs be to one, that wants both
Eloquence and Practice.</p>
               <p>But (Mr. <hi>Speaker)</hi> to return where I left, and ſo
conclude; How Sir, I pray you (and I demand it
again of you with great reſpect) could I think
the Omiſſion (as I ſaid) of the Oaths a breach of
the Laws, when our Guides, who had the Laws in
their keeping, told us explicitely, and without
reſerve the ſaid Oaths were not neceſſary? Shall I
then ſuffer that had neither Buoy nor Mark to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
me? certainly no; for if there were a fault, 'tis
not I muſt ſuffer, but the Judges, and thoſe knowing
and deputed Pilots, that hung out (it ſeems) the
wrong Flag and Signal. I have Sir, but one Word
more to trouble you with, and this I ſpeak in behalf
of all here; Nay in behalf of all the People of
<hi>England;</hi> That if I now undergo your Severity,
and that ſingle Perſons (notwithſtanding the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations
and Judgments of our Courts of
Juſtice) muſt be ſtill reſponſible; No Man can be
ſafe, no Man can be reſt; for no body that
acts can know (as accidents will often happen) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he be Innocent or Guilty.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> I am in great diſorder for impoſing
thus on your Patience; and eſpecially ſeeing I muſt
yet preſume to do it, one thing more occurring to
me (as I hope) for your further Service, or at leaſt
Satisfaction; And 'tis to let you know how I came
to be a Priſoner, and why I continued ſo thus long.
Be pleas'd then Sir, that I tell you, that as ſoon as
the King firſt left <hi>White-Hall,</hi> I thought it decency
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64690:8"/>
to go out of Town; and therefore three days after
I took Coach for <hi>Montgomery-ſhire,</hi> where of late
I us'd to reſide in the Summer time. On the Borders
of that Country, at a ſmall Corporation called <hi>Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſtree,</hi>
I was firſt ſtopt by the Rabble, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
detain'd (with a ſtrong Guard) at my Inn by
the Major; though no body (as he confeſt) made
any Oath againſt me; and tho he had no orders (as
he ſaid) from <hi>London</hi> for it; Nay (after a Months
reſtraint) he deny'd me my Liberty upon Bail not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
two Neighbouring Lawyers (whom I
ſent for) aſſur'd him he could not juſtify the refuſal
by Law. I do not Sir, complain of any Incivility, either
from him or the People; for I was us'd with reſpect
enough; But I judge it extreamly fit to let you ſee
how the Liberty of a Subject was willfully invaded
by a Magiſtrate, and how little conſcious I was of
any Guilt, ſince inſtead of flying, I went to a place
where I was known by every body.</p>
               <p>In fine Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> after a confinement of Seven
Weeks, I was ſent for up, and brought hither by
a Party of Horſe; Nor was I ever queſtion'd or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin'd
by any body, but kept (upon the ſuſpenſion of
the <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> Act) at a Meſſengers Houſe for
Three Months; And when the ſaid Act was ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the laſt time, I was Committed (by my Lord
<hi>Shrewsberry's</hi> Warrant) to the Tower, <hi>for Suſpicion
of treaſonable Practices.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Lordſhip having ended, retir'd with the Serjant
at Arms to his Room, where after a little ſtay, he was
ſent for in again; And then the <hi>Speaker</hi> told him;
That ſince he ſaid his Journey to <hi>Rome</hi> was with a
Letter of Civility to a Temporal Prince, and not
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64690:9"/>
about Religion, The Houſe (to be more fully ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
of it) deſir'd to ſee his Inſtructions. To which
his Lordſhip thus anſwer'd.</p>
               <p>I hope (Mr. <hi>Speaker)</hi> though I ſhall readily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
my own natural Weakneſs, you will not
yet think me ſo imprudent, as that (in a time of
ſuch troubles and diſtraction) I would keep Papers
by me, and eſpecially about <hi>Rome,</hi> to render my
ſelf lyable to every malicious Man's Extravagancy
and Comment. This therefore caus'd me Sir (the
Night before I went towards <hi>Wales)</hi> to burn all Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
that came to hand; and truly ſome amongſt the
reſt, that I have ſince wanted; Nay this I can alſo
juſtly aver, that I remember not now one Word of
thoſe Inſtructions, having (I'm confident) never
read them twice; only this I remember, they were
Things of Courſe; Words of Form; and needed
no further conſideration. Yet Sir, that you may
plainly ſee my Sincerity, and how far I am from any
deſign of illuding and deceiving you, I ſhall ſhew
you how you mayretrieve them, when I tell you,
that Mr. <hi>Monſtevens</hi> brought them me, and that
they were drawn (as I take it) by Mr. <hi>Bridgman;</hi>
For I'm certain they came from my Lord <hi>Sunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>'s
Office.</p>
               <p>But my Lord (reply'd the <hi>Speaker)</hi> had you no
private Inſtructions? None; Anſwered his Lordſhip.
What none at all, ſaid Mr. <hi>Speaker</hi> again. None I'le
aſſure you Sir, reply'd his Lordſhip; unleſs the
Kings Orders, to demand a Cardinals Cap for Prince
<hi>Reinaldo</hi> of <hi>Eſte,</hi> were private inſtructions; Nor do I
certainly know, whether thoſe Commands were in
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:64690:9"/>
my foremention'd Inſtructions, or whether I had
them by Word of Mouth.</p>
               <p>My Lord, ſaid the <hi>Speaker,</hi> I have another queſtion
to ask you; to wit, who of the long Robe told you of the
Kings Power of <hi>Diſpenſing,</hi> and that there was no
neceſſity of taking the Oaths?</p>
               <p>I am Sir (anſwer'd his <hi>Lordſhip)</hi> infinitely troubled,
if I have through want of Care, or by any improper
Expreſſion given you occaſion to miſapprehend
me; For I never askt any particular Man of that
Profeſſion about this Affair; But my meaning was
(and I hope my words are not contrary to my mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
that the ſaid Power was manifeſtly and openly
declar'd to be Law by Judges and Lawyers; So
that I deem'd it no Soleciſm in Diſcourſe to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
it as if they themſelves had told it me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then his Lordſhip retir'd again, and after a long
Debate, the Houſe paſt this Order.</hi> That the Earl of
<hi>Caſtlemaine</hi> ſtand committed to the Tower by a Warrant
from this Houſe for High Treaſon, for endeavouring to
reconcile this Kingdom to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> and for
other High Crimes and Miſdemeanors.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as his Lordſhip was inform'd of this Vote,
he entreated a Member to let the Houſe know, that
he had a Word or two more to trouble them with;
So that being brought in, the <hi>Speaker</hi> told him, that
the Houſe having notice (he had ſomething further
to acquaint them with) was very willing to hear
him.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Speaker</hi> (reply'd his Lordſhip) I have nothing
more to ſay about the former Matters; but under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
your Pleaſure, I thought it my Duty to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:64690:10"/>
let you know, how the cuſtom of the Tower as to
Priſoners is chang'd; for in courſe heretofore (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
there were a particular Order of State to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary)
they had the Liberty of the Tower; that is to
ſay, they could walk about at ſeaſonable hours with
a Warder; But now as ſoon as one is committed
(though it be upon bare ſuſpicion, as I was) he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd
to his Lodging, and hindred from the Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of ſeeing his Friends, till (after much ſolicitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and trouble) leave be granted by the <hi>Secretaries.</hi>
Therefore Sir, being morally certain that I ſhall be
confin'd again aſſoon as I return, I humbly deſire the
Favour of this Freedom; It being alſo what I hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
enjoy'd after I had been reſtrain'd for ſome days
in the aforementioned Manner.</p>
               <p>This ſaid, his Lordſhip went out, and then was
carried to the Tower, where he was made a cloſe
Priſoner, as he foretold, though what he moved, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion'd
the following Vote.</p>
               <p>That a Committee be appointed to bring in a Bill for
the better regulating the Impriſonment of the Subjects
of this Kingdom, and to ſettle the Fees of Goalers;
<hi>And it was likewiſe referr'd to them, to examine
into the abuſes of Goalers towards their Priſoners
which have been heretofore Committed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the 5<hi>th</hi> of the following <hi>Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,</hi>
His Lordſhip mov'd for his <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> and
was brought by the Lord <hi>Lucas,</hi> (the preſent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of the Tower) to <hi>Weſtminster,</hi> on the 10<hi>th;</hi>
So that appearing at the <hi>King's-Bench,</hi> his Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
were read, and Mr. <hi>Attorney</hi> having nothing
to object againſt his being Bail'd, the Court awarded
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:64690:10"/>
it upon the Security of Thirty Thouſand Pounds;
that is to ſay, a <hi>Recogniſance</hi> of Ten Thouſand
from himſelf, and Five Thouſand a piece from his
four Sureties; which were, <hi>John</hi> Earl of <hi>Bath,
Thomas</hi> Earl of <hi>Aylisbury, Thomas</hi> Earl of <hi>Suſſex,</hi> and
<hi>Charles</hi> Lord <hi>Landſdown.</hi>
