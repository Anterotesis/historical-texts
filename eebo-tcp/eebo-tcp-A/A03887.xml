            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>NOt onely are the works of God to be reuerenced &amp; regarded in themselues, but also in respect of the most wise and excellent course &amp; order of the contriuing and disposing of them.</hi> God hath made all things beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull in the time and season thereof. <hi>Eccles.</hi> 3. 11. <hi>And Act.</hi> 15. 18. From the beginning of the world God knoweth all his workes, <hi>saith the Apostle Iames. His meaning is that he knoweth them so, that according to his foreknowledge he hath most wisely disposed euery one of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>It must needs be acknowledged therfore, that it is the dutie of all that desire to be wise in the Lord, to seeke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the knowledge of him, both in his workes, and also in the orderly course of effecting them, according as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe hath in his holy Scriptures reuealed the same.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>To this purpose is that which Moses writeth Deut.</hi> 4, 32. Inquire now of the dayes that are past, which were before thee, since the day that God created man vpon the earth, &amp; aske from the one end of the heauen to the other, if there came to passe such a great thing as this, or whether any such like thing hath bene heard, &amp;c. <hi>And that which we reade in the</hi> 111. <hi>Psal. vers.</hi> 2. 3. 4. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The works of the Lord are great, and ought to be sought out of all those that loue them. His worke is beautifull and glorious, his righteousnesse indureth for euer. He hath made his wonderfull works to be had in remembrance, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And verily, if we weigh things with a right iudgemen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>, we shal find that this is the very end wherefore God hath created time it selfe, and placed the Sunne and the Moon</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:17264:3"/>
               <hi>in the firmament for the distinction of the day and the night, and that they shuld be for signes and for seasons, for dayes and for yeares, for summer and for winter, Gen.</hi> 1. 14. <hi>&amp;c. and chap.</hi> 8. 12. <hi>For these are but the Vshers as it were, to point vs to the word of God, as to the head master &amp; teacher of his schoole<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence we might learne not so much what God hath done in making the world for ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as what he hath done in the world for the praise of his glorie euer since he hath made the same: and chiefly what course he hath taken for the renewing of the world euer since mankind hath corrupted and disordered the same. For want of which obseruation, our Sauiour Christ, the true sunne of righteousnesse, earnestly blameth the Iewes, for that they obseruing the signes of faire and foule wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp;c. altogether neglected the signes of the time, and season of his comming vnto them. Mat.</hi> 16. 1. 2. 3. <hi>All the excellent works of God are so chained &amp; linked together, that we cannot well know the latter without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the former. As a help therfore hereunto, serueth this present Chronologising of the holy Scriptures. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in two things haue bene intended and indeuoured: the one plainnesse, the other shortnesse, and in either of them as much certainty as could be attained vnto for the helpe of the Christian Reader, from the expresse and entier dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Scriptures themselues. God of his mercie vouchsafe his blessing vpon it to all good ends and vses whereunto it may serue thee, to his honor and glory, euen for our Lord Iesus Christs sake.</hi> Amen.</p>

            <p>Now from the 56 yeare of Lamech, in the which Adam died, to the birth of Noah, which was in the 182 yeare of Lamech, as was men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned a litle before out of Gen. chap. 5. 28. there is a surplussage of 126 yeares.</p>

Arpach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shad the sonne of Shem was borne two yeares after the floud, as was said euen now. From Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pachshad to the birth of Shelah were 35 years. From Shelah to Eber 30. From Eber to Peleg 34. From Peleg to Reu 30. From Reu to Serug 32. From Serug to Nahor 30. From Nahor to Terah 29. From Terah to Abram 130, as it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident in that Terah liued 205. yeares. Gen 11. 32. and died in Haran when Abram was yet but 75 yeares old, Gen. 12. 4. For from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this 12. chap. it appeareth that Abram remoued not from Haran till after that Terah his father was dead. And thus also it is plaine that Abram was not the eldest son of Terah, though, for honours sake, and because the holy Storie
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:17264:8"/>
was to be continued from him, he is set before Nahor his elder brother, as was obserued before concerning Shem the second sonne of Noah. Wherefore touching that which is written cha. 11. 26. <hi>(Terah liued 70 yeares and begat Abram, Nahor and Haran)</hi> it must be vnderstood, that at his seuentith yere he began his generation with Nahor or Haran, after the first whereof, Abram was borne manie yeares after.</p>
            <p>Now all these yeares, from the floud to the birth of Abram; that is to say, two yeares before Arpachshad was borne; then 35 of the life of Arpachshad; and 30 of Shelah; and 34 of Eber; and 30 of Peleg; and 32 of Reu; and 30 of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rug; and 29 of Nahor; and 130 of Terah; nine seuerall numbers, as before, they arise to one whole summe of 352 yeares.</p>
            <p>From the birth of Abram to the promise of the Gospell, which God made the first time vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, were 75 yeares, as it is set downe Gen. chap. 12. 5. For this promise was first made to Abram, when he departed out of Haran; &amp; that was soone after the death of Terah, as is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest by the processe of the Storie from the last verse of the 11. chap.</p>
            <p>From this promise of the Gospell to Abram, vnto the birth of Isaak, were 25 yeares, Gen. ch. 21. 5. For adde 25. yeares to the former 75, and they make 100, which was the age of Abram when Isaak was borne.</p>
            <p>From the birth of Isaak to the birth of Iaakob <note place="margin">Iaakob.</note>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:17264:8"/>

            <p>From the birth of Iaakob, to the time he went downe to Egypt for his reliefe against the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, there passed 130 yeares, Gen. chap. 47. 9 And after this, Iaakob liued in Egypt 17 yeares, so that his whole age was 147 yeares, as it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in the same 47. chap. verse. 48.</p>
            <p>From the death of Iaakob, to the death of Ioseph, where with the Storie of Genesis is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <note place="margin">Ioseph.</note> there were 53 yeares; as may be proued thus. For in so much as Iaakob died, when Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph was 57 yeare old; (as may plainely be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered by conference of these places following: Gen. 41. ver. 46. where it is written that Ioseph was 30 yeare old when he stood before Phara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oh. And verse 53 of the same chapter, The seuen yeeres of plentie were ended. And chap. 45. verse 6. Two yeares of the famine were past at the second time of the comming of Iosephes brethren vnto him. And chap. 46. 1. &amp;c. In the third yeare of the famine Iaakob himselfe came downe to Egypt. And chap. 47. 28. Iaakob liued in the land of Egypt 17 yeares. All which yeres, to wit, 30, 7, 3, 17, they do make the age of Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph at the death of Iaakob to be 57.) And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, seeing Ioseph liued 110 years, Gen. 50 22. 26. it cannot be, but he must liue 53 yeares after that Iaakob was dead. And thus vpon the laying together of al the aboue named numbers, in this order following; first, 930, which was the age of Adam: secondly, 126, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the death of Adam to

For Ioram the sonne of Ahab, beginning his reigne in the eighteenth yeare of Iehoshapat; the fift yeare of this Ioram must be the 22. yeare of Iehoshaphat. And from this time, that is, from the fift yeare of Ioram, doth Iehoram the sonne of Iehoshaphat (euen foure yeares before the death of his father) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin his reigne of that 8 yeares, which is menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in the 17. verse of the eight chapter last al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged. For otherwise, how should Iehoram the sonne of Iehoshaphat, reigne to the twelfth yeare of Ioram the sonne of Ahab, whose first yeare was the eighteenth of Iehoshaphat, &amp; the second of Iehorams viceroyship, as hath bene noted before? So then, we haue, beside the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Iehoshaphats reigne (which was foure years from the end of his 17. while Iehoram his sonne was first viceroy) we haue, I say, in the entrance of this second booke of Kings, Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rams more full reigne, for the space of 8 yeares, beginning at the 22. yeare of Iehoshaphat; that is to say, the first foure yeares by speciall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, and thence forth other foure in his sole regencie; to wit, so long as he suruiued his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

               <p>And after her, Iehoash the second king, who reigned 40 yeares, chap. 12. 1. Yet so, as from his 38. yeare, Amaziah his sonne rule as Viceroy in his roome; as may appeare by this, that Ioash king of Israell, beginning his reigne ouer Israel, at the 37. yeare of Ioash king of Iuda, cha. 13. 10. Amaziah is afterward said to haue begunne his reigne, in the second yeare of the same Ioash, chap. 14. 1. which must be the 38. yeare of Ioash, king of Iuda. And the same also, two yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Iehoahaz, the father of Ioash king of Israel died; in so much as the seuenteenth yeare, which was the last of Iehoahaz, touched the last yeare of the reigne of Ioash king of Iuda; seeing he began his reigne in the 23. yeare of the same Ioash of Iuda, and reigned 17 yeares in Israell, chap. 13. 1. So then, the sonne of Iehoahaz was viceroy in Israel, as Amaziah was in Iudah. Three yeares therefore are to be abated, either of the 40 yeares of Iehoash, or of the 29 yeares of Amaziah; vnlesse we could see sufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to say, that Amaziah reigned 29 yeares, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side that time wherein he was viceroy.</p>
               <p>Next vnto Amaziah, was Azariah, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise called Vzziah 2. Chron. chap. 26. whose reigne continued 52 yeeres. But the beginning of Azariahes reigne is not to be reckoned, till the twelfth yeere after the death of his father;
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:17264:15"/>
because Amaziah (as the Storie testifieth) liued but 15. yeeres after the death of Iehoash king of Israel, ch. 14. verse 17. The which his 15 yeeres, could reach but to the 15. yeere of the reigne of Ieroboam, who began not his raigne, till the 15. yeere of Amaziah, as we reade in the same 14. ch. the 23. verse. And hereunto adde, that it is further expreslie set downe, ch. 15. 1. (as hath beene alleadged before) that Azariah began not his reigne, till the 27. yeere of Ieroboam, which was 11 yeeres after the death of Amaziah. We are therfore in this place (for the perfecting of our computation) to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpose eleuen yeeres betwixt the death of Amaziah, and the beginning of the reigne of Azariah, who was but foure yeere olde when his father Amaziah dyed. Neither did he begin his reigne, till he was 16 yeeres of age, as it followeth in the 2. verse of the same 15. chapter. Whence also, it will fall out, that as Iuda was eleuen yeeres without a king, by reason of the nonage of Azariah, or for what other cause soeuer: so was Israel, fifteene yeeres after that vacancie or interregnum of Iuda, for the space of 22 yeeres likewise without a king. That is to say, from the end of Ieroboams reigne, which was at the 15. yeere of the reigne of Azariah. So that Zachariah the next king which succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Ieroboam, and was the fourth from Iehu, 2. King. chap. 10. 30. he began not his reigne, till the 38. yeere of Azariah, as we reade ch. 15. 8.

12. Some, in their Chronologie admit not these yeers of vaca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie, either in Iuda or in Israel, and therefore begin the reigne of Azariah 15 yeeres before the death of his father: yea, and for the same cause also, doo make Zachariah immediately to succeede Ieroboam in Israel, without anie interruption of the royall gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But the former account is to be followed; the rather, because without the former addition, wee shall not finde that number of Ezekiels 390 yeeres, figured by so manie daies, from the time that Israel fell to idolatrie vnder Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat, to the desolation of Ierusalem at the burning of the Temple.

               <p>Ater Azariah, Iotham reigned 16 yeares, 2. King. 15. 32. 33.</p>
               <p>Next to Iotham, was Ahaz, who likewise reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned 16 yeares, chap. 16. 1. 2.</p>

               <p>Manasses succeeded Hezekiah, and reigned 55 yeares, ch. 21. 1. The longest reigne of anie king either in Iuda or Israel.</p>
               <p>Then Amon reigned two yeares, cha. 21. 19.</p>
               <p>And after Amon, Iosiah; whose reigne was 31 yeares, chap. 22. 1.</p>
               <p>Next to Iosiah was Iehoahaz; but he reigned onely three moneths, chap. 23. 31.</p>

               <p>Then Iehoiachin, whose reigne was but three moneths and ten dayes. For so soone after he began to reigne, did the king of Babylon subdue him, and carie him away captiue to Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel, 2. King. chap. 24. 8. &amp;c. and 2. Chron. chap. 36. 9. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Instead of this Iehoiachin, the same king of Babylon placed Zedekiah, who reigned eleuen yeares, 2. King. 24. 18.</p>
               <p>Finally, from thence, to the time that Euil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merodach the next king of Babylon, succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Nebuchadnezzar, restored Iehoiachin to a princely dignitie; there passed 26 yeares. For he was aduanced in the 37. yeare after that he was caried away captiue, 2. King. chap. 25. vers. 27. From the which if we subtract those 11 yeares of Zedekiah, the remainder is 26.

Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus King of Persia, proclaimed liberty to the Iewes to returne to their land; yea he gaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his princely incouragement and furtherance, towards the building of the Temple and citie of Ierusalem, for the worship of the true God of Israell, Ezra, chap. 1. And this no doubt he did with the consent of Darius, who was of the seed of the Medes, and was made King of the Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans. These two kings and their kingdomes being confederate together in one monarchie, Dan. chap. 5. ver. 28. 31. and chap. 6. 1. 2. 3. 8.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:17264:19"/>
&amp;c. and chap. 9. 1. 2. likewise Ester 1. 3. 19. So the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Iewes in the second yeare of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, laid the foundation of the Temple, chap. 3. 8. Neuerthelesse shortly after they had done so, they were forthwith hindred from procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the worke of the Lord, by diuerse mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious aduersaries who laboured their hindrance to the vttermost of that they could any way pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure. The worke therfore stayed, euen from the third yeare of Cyrus, that it could not prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously goe forward, vntill the second yeare of Darius the sonne of Ahashuerosh, of whom mention was made a litle before, Ezra chap. 4. vers. 5. 24. and Zacharie, chap. 1. 1. This second yeare of Darius, was the 32. yeare after the Iewes returne, as may easily be perceiued, in so much as the 19. year of the same Darius (which was the yeare before Nehemiah came in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, for the finishing of the walles and gates of Ierusalem, Nehem. 1. 1.) it was the 49. after their returne; according to the speech of the Angell Gabriell to Daniel, alleadged before.</p>
               <p>The reason of the hinderance of the Lords building, euen so soone after the gratious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of Cyrus king of Persia, and Darius of the Medes, it seemeth to haue bene this; that Darius of the Medes dying shortly after, and Cyrus following his warres abroad; Artashasht the sonne of Cyrus (called of Greeke writers Cambyses) being king or Viceroy in peace at home, was willing to hearken to the accusation
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:17264:19"/>
of the Iewes aduersaries: and so was Ahashue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosh also after him. Ezra. ch. 4. 5. 6. 7. And this seemeth to be the cause of Daniels great griefe, ch. 10. 1. 2. 3. Moreouer the Iewes were too ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily discouraged, &amp; of themselues ouer slothfull, as may appeare by the earnest reproofes which the Lord giueth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by his holy Prophets.

               <p>And thus the Iewes the people of God, were in prosperous estate, and gratiously protected and blessed of God, vnder the reigne of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian kings, as these books of Ezra &amp; Nehemiah

In which history, note these speciall things: first. that God would by the great danger which fell vpon the Iewes,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:17264:21"/>
correct the slacknesse of them in returning to their owne land, out of those prophane nations: Secondly, that Gods mercie was wonderfull, in sparing of their liues.

wayes, and the worship of God (as it is euident by the prophesie of Malachie the last of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, whom God sent much about that time, or not long before, vehemently to reproue their most grieuous and enormious sinnes) they are through the iust iudgement of God, because of the hardnesse and impenitencie of their hearts, heauily afflicted, oppressed, and spoyled by sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie and diuerse heathen kings; specially, by the deuided successors of Alexander, compared to ten hornes, Dan. ch. 7. 24. whom also, in respect of the situation of Iuda, he partly calleth Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne kings (namely those fiue Ptolomies, who successiuely ruled in Egypt) and partly he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them Northerne kings: of the which, three bare the name of Seleuchus, and foure were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the name of Antiochus, with some diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Sir-names, who ruled in Syria, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that which we reade Dan. ch. 8. and ch. 10. and chap. 11. The fulfilling of which prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, is plainely and plentifully testified by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of verie manie heathen Historio graphers, for the space of 149 yeares (whose writings are extant among vs) that is, from the beginning of the Grecian monarchy by Alexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der, to the end of the reigne of that most vile &amp; barbarous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutor Antiochus Epiphanes; with whom Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel endeth his prophesie, touching the speciall afflictions of Iuda, chap. 11. verse 21. &amp;c. to the end of the chapter. Reade also the first booke of Machabees, chap. 1. vers. 1. &amp;c. After that Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:17264:22"/>
the Macedonian, the son of Philip, went forth of the land of Chittim, and slewe Darius king of the Persians and Medes, and reigned for him, as he had before in Grecia, he tooke great warres in hand, &amp;c. and verses 8. 9. 10. 11. So Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander had reigned 12 yeares when he died. And his serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts reigned euery one in his roome. And they all caused themselues to be crowned after his death, and so did their children after them manie yeares, and much wickednesse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased in the world. For out of these came the wicked roote, euen Antiochus Epiphanes the son of K. Antiochus, which had bene an hostage at Rome, and he reigned in the 137. yeare of the kingdome of the Greekes. And chap. 6. 16. King Antiochus died in the 149. yeare.</p>
               <p>Now concerning the last part of the 490 yeares of Daniel; that is to say, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the miserable end of Antiochus in his reigne, to the death of our Sauiour Christ, which was the space of 211 yeares; the greater part was spent in the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and wasting of the Greeke monarchie, partly by the ill successe of their warres against Iuda, and partly by their wars among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, according to the prophesie of Daniel, chap. 2. 41. 42. 43. 44. but chiefly by the Romanes, who altogether subdued them, according as Ezekiel prophesied that they should. Reade ch. 38. and chap. 39. These prophesies were fulfilled about threescore yeares before the seuentie seuens of Daniel were expired. For so many yeares passed
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:17264:23"/>
from the vtter suppressing of the Grecians bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Monarchie, and the end of those yeares. Now therefore, albeit Iuda (strengthened of God) did fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the end of vile Antiochus his reign, recouer their kingdome and gouernment, and obtained the free possession of the citie of God, by the mighty valour of Iudas Machabaeus (read 1. Machab. chap. 3. 1. 2. 3. 4. &amp;c. In his acts hee was like a Lion, &amp;c. and ch. 6. vers. 58. 59. The heathen finding themselues to decrease dayly, they consent that the Iewes should liue after their law as they did afore, and they agree of peace. Read also 2. Machab. chap. 10. 1. 2. 3. &amp;c. Machabaeus and his company through the help of the Lord wanne the Temple and the citie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, &amp;c. and chap. 15. 38. Thus farre concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Nicanors matters, and from that time the Hebrewes had the citie in possession.) And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Romanes after they had gotten the souereigntie, did nothing against the religion of the Iewes; yet their estate, euen at the best, was full of miserie, by reason of the manifold corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Gods worship among themselues, and because of their great wickednes in the course of their life, specially among their high Priests, leaders and guides. For they were of diuers sects both Pharisies and Sadduces, as we reade in the Gospell, yea and Essaei also, as other stories make mention. Wherunto the Prophet Zacharie hath respect, chap. 11. 8. where the Lord threateneth before hand, that he would cut off three Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:17264:23"/>
in one moneth, in so much as his soule lothed them, &amp;c. Which also came to passe, after they had shewed themselues obstinate and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrigible, euen to the reiecting of our Sauiour Christ. For hereby they prouoked God in the highest degree; and therefore he sent the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane armie in his wrath, to take their nation vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly away; as we are herafter further to obserue, concerning the proper time &amp; season thereof.</p>
               <p>And thus we are come to the end of the 490 yeares, comprended in the seuenty seuene of Daniel, chap. 9. 24. &amp;c. Of the which, the first seuen times seuen years; that is, 49 yeares, were spent in the building of the Te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple; three yeares being reckened till the foundation was layd, &amp; the other 46 before it could be finished: by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the great and often hinderances which the Iewes had, as hath bene declared before. Reade also Iohn 2. 20. Fortie &amp; sixe yeares was this Temple a building. From thence were 67 seuens, that is, 434 yeares. And last of all, the Prophet reckeneth one seuen more; of the <note place="margin">The appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation of Christ, as also the time of his death.</note> which the latter halfe, that is, three yeares and a halfe, were appointed by God, to be the time from the Baptisme of our Sauiour Christ, which was at the thirtith year of his age, vnto his death, which was at the 4. Passouer, following after his baptisme. For so we reade, Luke chap. 3. verses 21. 22. 23. <hi>At his Baptisme</hi> (saith the Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>list) <hi>he began to be about thirtie yeares of age.</hi> But
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:17264:24"/>
concerning the Passcouers, in the times wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, our Sauiour Christ went vp to Ierusalem to the celebration of them; we haue only three ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly and by name mentioned, the first and third, only by the Euangelist Iohn, chap. 2. 13. <hi>The Iewes Passeouer was at hand, therefore Iesus went vp to Ierusalem.</hi> And againe, chap. 6. 4. <hi>Now the Passeouer a feast of the Iewes was neare.</hi> Neuerthelesse, the second Passeouer is mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the same Euangelist, chap. 5. 1. <hi>After that there was a feast of the Iewes</hi> (saith S.

And seeing there is no feast commanded in the law, whereunto our Sauiour should go vp to Ierusalem, within the space of foure moneths before haruest, vntil the Passe-ouer it selfe should come about; it sec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth

                  </gap>, that they were the same, of whom mention is made both 1. King. chap. 4. vers. 30. and also 1. Chron. chap. 2. vers. 6. that is to say, if they were the sonnes of Zarah, the neare posteritie of Iudah by Thamar, of whom we reade Genes. chap. 38. vers. 30. then also it is very likely, that they were before Moses; or at least his equalles in time, or short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after him.

his prosperous successe in obteining of the same 300 yeares at the least, before Dauid was born: (like as king Iosiah was by name prophesied of, as touching that which he should do, aboue 300 years before his birth, as we are afterward more exactly to obserue) &amp; also concerning the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the Church bewailed therein, euen such afflictions as fell vpon it in the captiuity of Babylon, which fell out as long a time after that King Dauid was dead.

Chron. 25. 5. &amp; that also in respect of his singing of Propheticall Psalmes such as king, Dauid indited &amp; not because himselfe did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie.)

So it is testified of him, Act. 2. 30. &amp;c. <hi>Seeing he was a Prophet</hi> (saith the Apostle Peter) <hi>and knew before that God had sworne, &amp;c.</hi> he prophesied of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of Christ, &amp;c. yea, hee prophesied of the whole person and office of our Sauiour Christ, touching euerie degree, both of his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, and also of his exaltation, as many of his Psalmes do plentifully declare. Read Psal. 2. Psal. 16. Psal. 22. Psal. 45. Psal. 68. Psal. 110. and many other. In K. Dauids reigne was the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Nathan,</hi> 2. Sam. 7. 2. &amp;c. &amp; ch. 12.

               <p>King <hi>Salomon</hi> was also a holy Prophete, as his bookes, the Prouerbes, Ecclesiastes, &amp; the Song of Songs do excellently declare. In the thirtith chap. of his Prouerbes, the prophesie of <hi>Agur</hi> concerning Christ, vnder the names of Ithiel &amp; Veal is recorded. It seemeth that his time was much about Salomons reigne.

               <p>In the reigne of king Ahaz, prophesied <hi>Oded</hi> a prophete of the Lord, to the reproofe of the crueltie of Israel, at that time committed against Iuda, 2. Chron. 28. 9. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> prophesied in the reigne of many kings; that is to say, in the dayes of Vz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziah, Iotham, Ahaz, &amp; Hezekiah, kings of Iuda, chap. 1. 1. He prophesied so plainly of Christ;
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:17264:35"/>
of his Deitie, of his humanitie, that he should be borne of a virgin, &amp;c. finally, that he should die for the sinnes of his people, &amp; make a conquest ouer all their enemies, for their perfect deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, &amp;c. that he may not vnfitly be called an Euangelicall Prophet.

So he prophesied at the least 41 yeares, if not something more. He prophesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of our Sauiour Christ, that he should be the righteousnesse and saluation of his people.

               <p>
                  <hi>Zephaniah</hi> also prophesied in the reigne of

king Iosiah; but continued not so long as Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia did, chap. 1. 1. He earnestly calleth for the repentance of the people, and foretelleth the calling of the Gentiles, which should come to passe in the dayes of the Gospel, chap. 3.</p>

               <p>The Prophet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> prophesied from the fift yeare of the first captiuitie, which began at the fourth yeare of Iehoiakim, chap. 1. vers. 1. 2. he had manie notable visions, and laboured mightily with the people, both by doctrine &amp; example; that they might humble themselues vnder the hand of God, and profite by so great a visitation and punishment, as their captiuitie was, which most iustly fell vpon them for their grieuous sinnes. He prophesied also many nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things concerning the kingdome of Christ to come.</p>
               <p>In the reigne of Iehoiakim also prophesied <hi>Urijah,</hi> according to the words of Ieremiah: for the which cause Iehoiakim put him to death. Reade Ierem. chap. 26. 20, 21, 22, 23.</p>

He interpreted the dreames and visions of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar

He is that Prophet whom the Lord sent to prophesie vnto Ieroboam the son of Nebat, that it was the purpose of God to rend the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome out of the handes of Salomon; &amp; to make him king ouer ten tribes of Israell. This was the iudgement of God against the sin of Salomon and of the people, in his latter time, for that they forsooke the Lord, and worshipped the idols of the heathen, as it followeth in the same eleuenth chapter vers. 33. The accomplishment of which prophesie, reade in the very next chapter, euen shortly after the Prophesie was vttered to Iero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam, read chap. 12. ver. 15. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In the reigne of this Ieroboam, in so much as he, contrary to the will and commandement of God, set vp idolattie to serue his owne wicked deuise and policie, for the preuenting of the pebples reuolt, which he suspitiously scared: the Lord therefore sent a Prophere out of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah, vnto Bethel in Israel, the chiefe place of his new erected idolatrie, euen at such time as he himselfe was dedicating the altar which he
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:17264:37"/>
had made, chap. 12. 26. &amp;c. 33. And the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete prophesying against his idolatrie, telleth Ieroboam, standing by his altar to offer incense, that a child should be borne to the house of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid, Iosiah by name, who should breake down his altar, and destroy the Priests of his high pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ch. 13. 1. &amp;c. The accomplishment whereof reade 2. King. ch. 23. 15, &amp;c. 20. This Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie did the Prophet giue forth about three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth and thirtie yeares before king Iosiah was borne. This Prophet was he, who harkening to the lye of that old Prophet of Bethel, was for his transgressing of Gods commandement, in that he eat and dranke in the place, wherof God had said vnto him, Thou shalt neither eat nor drink: he was therefore killed in the way, by a Lyon which met him. Neuerthelesse, as it may seeme, for a monument of Gods mercie in forgiuing the sin of this Prophet, he restrained the Lyon from deuouring his body; as it is recorded in the same 13. chapter. Reade also 2. King. 23. 17. 18.</p>
               <p>In the reigne of the same Ieroboam, the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Prophet <hi>Ahijah</hi> of Shilo, who at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning told Ieroboam, that he shold be king ouer the ten tribes of Israel; he is now afterward, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the end of his wicked &amp; idolatrous reigne (euen then when Ahijah could not see, through the decay of his sight by reason of age) the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister of God, to prophesie against Ieroboam and his posteritie, 1. King. chap. 14. 2. 4. &amp;c. 18.
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:17264:38"/>
This was fulfilled after that Nadab the sonne of Ieroboam had reigned two yeares. For Baasha conspired against Nadab, and slew him first, &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> also he smote all the house of Ieroboam, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the word of the Lord, which he spake by his seruant Ahijah the Shilonite.

               <p>In the dayes of king Baasha, who began his reigne ouer Israel, in the third yeare of Asa king of Iuda; <hi>Iehu</hi> the sonne of Hanani prophesied a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Baasha, like as the former two Prophetes had prophesied against Ieroboam, 1. King. 16. 1. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In the dayes of Ahab, who began his reigne ouer Israel, in the 38. yeare of Asa king of Iuda, prophesied <hi>Elijah</hi> that mightie Prophete of the Lord, against Ahab &amp; his posteritie. 1. King. 17. &amp;c. He reduced the people of Israel to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of the true God of Israel. He prophesied likewise, by writing against Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram the son of Iehoshaphat, who left the good waies wherin his father had walked, &amp; followed the wicked wayes of the kings of Israel. For as the holie Storie saith, he had the daughter of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab to wife; and he wrought euill in the eyes of the Lord, and compelled Iudah so to do. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord by his Prophet Elijah, sent a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous prophesie, threatening fearefull diseases and a horrible death against him; which also tooke effect, as we read 2. Chron. 21.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Michaiah</hi> also, the sonne of Imlah, prophesied
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:17264:38"/>
against wicked king Ahab, 1. King. 22. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, another Prophet, whose name is not expressed, chap. 20. 41, 42. But verses 13. 14 22. and verses 28, 29. God sent a Prophete to prophesie vnto him his double victorie ouer the great armie of the Aramites.</p>
               <p>In the reigne of Iehoram the sonne of Ahab. and so forth vnto the reigne of Ioash the sonne of Iehu, prophesied <hi>Elisha</hi> the prophet, who suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded Elijah in Israel, 2. King. chap. 3. &amp;c. and ch. 13. vers. 14. &amp;c. But before Elisha had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of the Spirit of Elijah; the children of the Prophetes, both they of Bethel, and other which were at Iericho, prophesied that God would in extraordinarie maner take away Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaes master, that is Eljiah from him. 2. King. chap. 2. 3. 5.</p>
               <p>In the reigne of Ieroboam the sonne of Ioash prophesied <hi>Ionah</hi> the sonne of Amittai, who was of Gath Hepher, 2. King. 14. 25.

He foretolde the comming of our Sauiour Christ into his Temple, and of the comming of Iohn Baptist before him, vnder the name, and by the mightie Spirit of Elijah, that greate Prophete of God: who (as the Prophete Isaiah had prophesied manie yeares before, chap. 40. verse 3, &amp;c.) was a cryer in the wildernesse
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:17264:40"/>
to call forth the people to come out to him; but did not go to the Temple, as Malachie prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied, that our Sauiour Christ should.

               </head>
               <p>THe Prophesie of the new Testament, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, <note place="margin">The last classis or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie of Prophets.</note> rather a most cleare, lightsome, &amp; full interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of all former Prophesies of the old Testament, then any prediction or foretelling of things to come, except the rising and fall of Antichrist: yet because euen the things hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fore-told, are more clearly &amp; fully reuealed by the brightnesse of the Gospel; therfore in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther respect, both of interpretation, and predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, the new Testament must be allowed to haue the honour of Prophetes, as wel as the old.</p>
               <p>The Prophetes therefore in the newe Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, were first of all, those which prophesied immediately before, and at the birth of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Christ. Immediatly before, first <hi>Elizabeth</hi> conceiued with Iohn the Baptist, Luk. 1. 41, 42, 43, 44, 45. And then the Virgin <hi>Marie,</hi> concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with our Sauiour Christ, by the holy Ghost: in the same chapter, verses, 46, 47, &amp;c. 55. Thus was the conception of our Sauiour honored by
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:17264:41"/>
the spirit of Prophesie. And it pleased God to honour women, as it were with the first fruites of this grace of the Gospell in their hearts, like as it pleased him to vse them as his honourable instruments, to serue for the manifestation of Christ himselfe, the matter and argument of the whole mysterie of the Gospell. Thirdly <hi>Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie;</hi> whom vnbeleefe bereaued of the honour, to be the first: he prophesied both of the high of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Iohn, and of the diuine person of our Sauiour Christ at the birth of Iohn, in the same chap. vers. 67, &amp;c. to the end of the chap.</p>
               <p>The Prophetes which prophesied at the birth of Christ (that we may omit the Angels, whom we cannot properly call Prophets, though at this time they did prophesie; that is, in most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent wise lay forth the singular causes of ioy, which came to the world, by the birth of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, euen Christ the Lord) let vs come to the Shepheards, to whom the Angels appeared, to certifie them of the birth of Christ, whom we may more boldly call by the name of Prophets, seeing no doubt after they had seene Christ, they were for the time indued with an excellent spirit of Prophesie, to publish abroad that which was told them of that child, euen to the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all that heard them. Luke chap. 2. 16, 17, 18. Such were the Prophets more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately before, and at the birth of our Sauiour Christ.</p>
               <p>Now secondly, touching those that prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:17264:41"/>
somewhat longer after the birth of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour: we will not make any great scruple to lend the name of Prophetes to the <hi>Magi</hi> or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and wise men, which came out of the East, to worship our Sauiour, shortly after his birth: For if they had not bene inlightned by the spirit of Prophesie in some measure, they could neuer haue bene sufficiently incouraged by the starre, to haue gone so great a iorney to seeke Christ, as they did; or boldened enough, in a strange nation to inquire of him so vndoubtedly, as they did, in that they asked; <hi>Where is the king of the Iewes which is borne? For we haue seene his starre in the East, and we are come to worship him, Mat.</hi> 2. 2. And much lesse, after they had found him in poore &amp; contemptible estate, would they haue offered their gifts or presents, as testimonies of their spirituall homage; if they had not bin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in their perswasion, by the holy spirit of God. vers. 10. 11. After these Magi, prophesied <hi>Simeon,</hi> at the presentation of our Sauior Christ in the Temple, Luke 2. 25. &amp;c. 35. And imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after Simeon, <hi>Anna,</hi> a verie ancient Prophetesse, vttered her prophesie, confessing Christ, so acknowledged of Simeon, to be in truth the Lord. verses 36, 37, 38. Thus, euen at the beginning of the appearance of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, he was acknowledged by the Spirit of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie.</p>
               <p>When the time came that he should be more fully manifested to all Israel, which was, when
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:17264:42"/>
he was about thirtie yeares of age. Luke 3. 23: <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptist being a Prophet, yea greater then a Prophet, Luke 7. 26. He did not onely point Christ out personally, when hee shewed himselfe; but he preached assuredly, that he should shew himselfe before he had seene him: &amp; therefore baptized the people into his name, who should shortly shew himselfe to be the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, among them.</p>
               <p>As touching our Sauiour himselfe, we know that he was the Prince of Prophets, most migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in word and deed, to whom all the Prophets giue witnesse: and whom God promised to raise vp, as one, of whom Moses was but a certaine figure and type, Luke chap. 24. verse 19. and verses 25, 26. 27. Read also Deut. chap. 18. 15. Act. 3. 22. 23. 24. and chap. 10. 38. 43. He hath reuealed most clearely the secretes of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen, euen from the bosome and counsell of the Father. Isai. chap. 9. 6. Iohn. 1. 18. By his Spirit all the former Prophetes prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied according to that which is written concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Noah. 1. Pet. 3. 18, 19, 20. He foretold the destruction of Ierusalem, which accordingly came to passe: as also, that many Antichrists should rise vp, as since they haue done, &amp; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the succession of the Antichrist of Rome: and finally, that he will come againe at the last day, to iudge the world: which shall as certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be perfourmed in due time by him, as anie thing which he hath foretold, is already accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:17264:42"/>
in the season thereof.</p>
               <p>Finally, after the ascension of our Sauiour Christ vp into heauen; from the which time the gifts of the holy Ghost were aboundantly pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red downe vpon the Church: many were fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with the gift of Prophesie: for so we read Ephes. 4. 11. <hi>He gaue some to be Apostles, &amp; some Prophetes, &amp;c.</hi> See the proofe of it, Act. chap. 11. 27, 28. <hi>In those dayes came Prophetes from Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem to Antiochia. Of the which, one named Agabus, foretold the great famine, which came vpon all the world vnder Claudius the Emperour.</hi> The same Agabus foretold the afflictions of Paule, Act. 21. 10. 11. And in the same chapter vers. 8. 9. Saint Luke reporteth, that Philip the Euangelist had foure daughters which did prophesie. Reade a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine chap. 19. 6. Paule layd his hands on cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine Disciples of Ephesus, and they spake with tongues and prophesied.</p>
               <p>The Apostle <hi>Paule</hi> himselfe, by the spirite of prophesie, foretold the time of the rising of Antichrist; &amp; that he should fall againe, 2. Thes. chap. 2. So doth the Apostle <hi>Iohn</hi> in the booke of the Reuelation, chap. 17. where also, he no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth out the place and seat of Antichrist, by such a descrption of it, as agreeth only to Rome. Yea in that booke he describeth very liuely the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions of the Church, such as should fall vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it, euen to the end of the world. And last of all, how glorious the estate thereof shall be thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth, when Christ shal once haue perfected the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:17264:43"/>
mariage betwixt himselfe and it. And thus the whole Prophesie of the holy Scriptures is with that propheticall booke sealed and shut vp. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel. chap. 22. 18. 19. 20. 21.</p>

               <head>The Conclusion.</head>
               <p>THis constant spirit of Prophesie, as it were the lode-starre or haruenger of time; and the certaine performance of all things in their proper seasons, euen as they were foretold; as well the more particular, as the more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Prophesies, and that also concerning all forreigne and heathen nations, as wel as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Iudah and Israell: according as holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of God spake, not of priuate motion, but as they were moued and guided by the holy Ghost, as the Apostle Peter testifieth, 2. ep. ch. 1. 20, 21. (Inso much as we may say generally, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that we reade, Amos 3. 7. <hi>Surely the Lord hath done nothing but he hath reuealed his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret to his seruants the Prophets.)</hi> And chiefly the constant foretelling &amp; performance of al things concerning Christ Iesus our Lord, and his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; concerning euery part of his humiliation, and the whole glorie which was to followe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the Prophetes are said to haue sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched into these things 1. Pet. 1. 10. 11. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant and certaine spirit of Prophesie (I say) giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the Church, from time to time, for the clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:17264:43"/>
&amp; confirming of that foundation of all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie, which God himselfe had layd from the beginning, as was sayd before, and which wee reade of Gen. 3. 15. &amp;c. in that he hath by his owne voyce published, that <hi>the seed of the woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> should breake the serpents head:</hi> according also to that which is written, that God is the father of Prophetes, and that his Spirit is the Spirit of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie, 1. Sam. 10. 5, 6, 10, 11, 12. and chap. 19. 20. &amp;c. It is an infallible confirmation of the truth of our Christian religion, and of the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie of Gods determinate counsell, and most vigilant prouidence in the continuall ordering and gouerning of his Church, and all the holie affaires and ordinances giuen vnto it, from the beginning to the end; according to that which the Lord himselfe saith, Isai 46. 9. 10. <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the former things of olde: for I am God and there is no other God, and there is no king like me. Who declareth the last thing from the beginning: &amp; from of olde, the things that were not done, saying: My counsell shall stand, and I will doe whatsoeuer I will.</hi> And as the Apostle Iames saith, as was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged before, Act. 15. 18. <hi>From the beginning of the world God knoweth all his works:</hi> that is to say, he so knoweth them, that he hath a care to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish and performe them, euerie one in the time and season thereof, according to his owne counsell and appointment with himselfe.</p>
               <p>And now further, let vs dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly obserue, that the certainty of al things already accomplished,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:17264:44"/>
according to the prophesies formerly giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> forth of them, ought to be a like vndoubted confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of our faith, in the assured expectation of all things foretold, whatsoeuer the holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures certifie vs to be yet vnfulfilled. Such as are the full consumption and abolishment of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist, by the brightnesse of the Lords com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming 2. Thes. 2. 8. That the Lord will from time to time call home his full number, both of the lost Iewes, and also of the Gentiles to the faith and saluation of Christ, euen to the end of the world Rom. 11. 25. &amp;c. and Matth. 24. 31. That there shal be a general resurrection of the dead; &amp; a generall iudgement vpon all men, either to perpetuall woe and misery, or to eternall happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and glorie, Mat. 25. 31.</p>
               <p>The vse of which our faith and perswasion, &amp; of the whole ground &amp; warrantise therof, ought finally, and for our full conclusion, to be this; that we being afore hand made priuie to all these holy secretes of God, &amp; being in vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted expectation of the fulfilling of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; chiefly of the comming of our Sauiour Christ to iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; should according to the most holy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of the Gospell, both learne and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise more and more to denie all vngodlines &amp; worldly lusts, and to liue soberly, and iustly, and godly in this present world.
