         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Ghoſt, and the wiſeſt King that ever was) <hi>Prov.</hi> 21. 1.
<hi>The Kings heart is in the hand of the Lord, as the rivers
of water; he turneth it whitherſoever he pleaſeth:</hi> I, a
poor deſpicable man, (deſpicable becauſe poor) do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume,
out of my ſincere loyal affection, and duty to Your Majeſty, and
my earneſt deſire for the re-uniting of You with Your Parliament and
Subjects of this Kingdom, to offer, or rather to ſacrifice, my weak
Conceptions to Your gracious Acceptance or Refuſal. Sir, We are all
in an Egyptian darkneſs, be You but pleaſed to cauſe the Sun-ſhine of
your Mercy and Goodneſs to break out upon Your poor Subjects of
this Kingdom, and there is great hope we may ſoon be delivered from
this fearful Confuſion whereinto we are faln. For my own part, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,
Your Majeſties not being conſcious of the miſery Your poor
Subjects are in (in regard of the unkingly reſtraint You are for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
unhappily under) is the cauſe You cannot be ſo zealous, as other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
you would, to redreſs it; and that your want of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of the preſent conjuncture of Affairs is that which renders Your
People ſo infinitely miſerable, that they are ready every minute to
precipitate themſelves into the Gulf of Deſpair. It is ſaid of Almighty
God, <hi>There is mercy with him that he may be feared, and his mercy
is over (or above) all his works:</hi> And I beleeve (without leaſt
flattery I ſpeak it) that there is abundance of Mercy and Bowels of
Compaſſion with You, towards Your poor Subjects, that You may be
both loved and feared; and that Your Mercy will ſhower it ſelf down
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52721:3"/>
to the amazement &amp; reproach of thoſe that ſeem not to beleeve it: Did
I ſay, Your Mercy, yea and Your Juſtice alſo, even againſt Your ſelf, in
the voluntary clouding of Your own Princely Royalty; and that
Prince, who ſhadows his own Glory (meerly for the good of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects)
is a rare Pattern: And the firſt giver of ſo great an (unexampled)
Example, muſt needs render himſelf glorious to all Poſterity.</p>
            <p>Sir, in the firſt place, I preſume (with boldneſs enough I confeſs,
yet will I not flatter you ſo much as to ſay, I beg Your Majeſties par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
for it) to remember you, that <hi>Self-Denial</hi> is the only way to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs,
Temporal (here,) Eternal (hereafter:) and had it been but a little
practiſed on all hands (by the three Eſtates of Parliament) at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
or budding forth of theſe unhappy differences, (although Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
it ſelf cannot but ſay, that Your Majeſty acted Your part, and the
very Lepers of <hi>Samaria</hi> ſhall one day riſe up in Judgment againſt ſome
and ſay, that that was a day of good tydings, and they ungratefully
held their Peace, In Your aboliſhing of Monopolies, putting down
the Star-Chamber, diſannulling the High Commiſſion Court, outing
of Biſhops from the Houſe of Peers, Regulating the Councel Table,
granting of Triennial Parliaments, and continuing of This, not to be
diſſolved without the conſent of both Houſes;) Your Majeſty and
Your People had not felt Gods heavy hand, as You and They have done
for theſe ſeven years paſt, and yet do: but for me to preſume to tell
Your Majeſty what <hi>Self-Denial</hi> is, were a moſt unpardonable of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence:
And, yet, for Your Majeſty to beleeve that this <hi>Peace-Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
which You ſacrifice to the good and happineſs of Your People (in
this ſad condition Your Majeſty is in, and the moſt miſerable one They
are plunged into) can be happily begun without <hi>Self-Denial</hi> (on Your
part firſt, and then all the Peoples part alſo) is (ſo far as I can appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
in <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi>) altogether unpoſſible: and by the ſequel
of my diſcourſe I doubt not but to make good the Truth of it at
the Full.</p>
            <p>Sir, look into Your own heart, and ſee whether informer times
You were not more Your own (or others who abuſed you then Your
Subjects univerſally: The word <hi>Proprium</hi> is of a neer relation,
and I doubt whether it ſits not as cloſe to the hearts of Kings as of
Subjects, which your Majeſty well knows is not compatible with
<hi>Self-Denial.</hi> Sir, You are a great Monarch (true) yet You are but a
<hi>Steward (nomine &amp; re</hi>) a Steward of the great Houſe of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth;
and one day it ſhall be ſaid to You, as to the Steward
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52721:3"/>
in the Goſpel, (<hi>Redde Rationem</hi>) Give an Account of thy Steward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip;
And the Accounts of Kings are of a vaſt extent. Sir, You are a
Sheepherd alſo, a Sheepherd of a great Flock, (our Saviour calls him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
a Sheepherd, <hi>the great Sheepherd of Iſrael,</hi>) and he tells you, <hi>a
good Sheepherd will dye for his Sheep;</hi> he did ſo: And S. <hi>Paul,
Phil.</hi> 2. 5. ſpeaking of our Saviour Chriſt, and there deducing him
from all eternity to time, hath theſe words; <hi>Let this mind be in you,
which was alſo in Chriſt Jeſus: Who being in the form of God, thought
it not robbery to be equal with God: But made himſelf of no reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and took upon him the form of a ſervant, and was made in the
likeneſs of men: And being found in faſhion as a man, he humbled
himſelf, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the Croſs:
Wherefore God highly exalted him,</hi> &amp;c. And ſhal I doubt Your Majeſty
will imitate our bleſſed Saviour in all you can? I doubt it not: He
prayed for his perſecutors, (and taught us ſo to do); He forgave his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
that crucified him even upon the Croſs <hi>[Father, forgive them,
they know not what they do];</hi> nay he dyed for them, <hi>[who dyed,</hi> ſaith
the Apoſtle, <hi>for the ſins of the whole world:]</hi> You are not deſired (Sir)
to dye out of the world, or to part with Your Soul, by a Sequeſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it from your body, (for then we were miſerable): Let the
greateſt curſe, that ever fell on the head of any man, fall on that head
that hath but ſuch a wiſh or thought in his heart. All you have to do
or ſuffer, is but to part with a ſillable or two, from one ſingle word, a
few letters cut off from that <hi>Monſter,</hi> as the People call it (although
there hath been held out to them, for a long time, a more <hi>Prodigious
one,) PREROGATIVE,</hi> a little paring off ſome ſuperfluous part of
it, will prove <hi>Balm</hi> from <hi>Gilead,</hi> to heal the whole Nation of the moſt
Epidemical diſeaſe that ever yet ſeized this poor dying Kingdom.
Sir, I ſhall not need to court you, to what you are ſo willing, nor to
inforce this argument, had I never ſo much Elocution, as God knows
(and Your Majeſty doth find) I have none: I wiſh Your Majeſties
People were all of my belief, concerning Your Mercy and Juſtice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I
flatter not, (I wiſh the flattery of a Prince were high Treaſon, and ſo
puniſhed,) and may my ſoul never enter into reſt, if I beleeve not that
Your Majeſty will grant more (if more with Reaſon and Religion
may be deſired) then I have too too audaciouſly preſumed to preſs in my
following Propoſitions.</p>
            <p>Sir, It was ſaid in the beginning of this Parliament, (by M. <hi>Pym,</hi>
if I miſtake not) that the Parliament would make You a glorious King,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52721:4"/>
and who knows whether your Majeſty, when you were in the head of
Your Army at <hi>Edg Hill,</hi> (or elſe where) had not ſome hopes to make
Your ſelf a glorious King? And I have been told, that this Army would
have perſwaded You, when time was, that they (alſo) would make
You a glorious King.</p>
            <p>Sir, You have failed in Your hopes, They in their promiſes; and who
knows whether, what Your Majeſty hoped and ſought for, and They
promiſed and performed not, may not yet be done another and a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
way, if (at leaſt) You will be pleaſed to take him for your guide
(who hath hitherto ſo miraculouſly preſerved you, and I hope ever wil.)
I ſay (Sir) taking God for Your guide all may be made good, and
may (yet) be brought to paſs by Your ſelf, not by fighting any more to
the hazard of Your Royal Perſon, and the Perſons of your Princely
Iſſue, and of Your Nobility, and the deſtruction of Your loving Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;
but by extending and really performing of thoſe two God-like
Acts, of <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Juſtice,</hi> without partiality, to all Your People. And
this is <hi>Via Regia</hi> indeed, and well becoming the Majeſty of King
<hi>Charls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, Sir, behold how wonderful the ways of God are, (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the ways of men) paſt finding out till himſelf diſcover them:
You have long layen under the Croſs, (reſtraint to a King is a great
Croſs, were there no more in it,) You are not free (I dare not ſay you
are a Captive) and yet Your Perſon (with the power that God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
You over Your ſelf, and the Grace he hath endued you with to ſerve
him muſt ſuddenly come forth to the redemption of Your Subjects
out of their Captivity, (Captives in their native Country under their
fellow Subjects) or they are loſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> loſt for ever.</p>
            <p>In this Abyſs of Exigency, no Expedient can be found to ſave Your
People but the preſence of Your ſacred Perſon, armed with <hi>Mercy</hi>
and <hi>Juſtice (Mercy</hi> and <hi>Juſtice</hi> to your People, and <hi>Juſtice</hi> againſt
Your ſelf) nor could You ſo eaſily do it (as I beleeve) had not God
thus fitted, prepared, and quallified You by the <hi>Croſs;</hi> whereby You
have obtained a fellow-feeling of the miſeries of Your Subjects: <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
ſaid of himſelf, <hi>It was well for me that I was afflicted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Great Sir, Let Your Engagements and Promiſes to Your People, for
the time to come, (in Your perfecting of this bleſſed Peace) be like
the Laws of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> irrevocable.</p>
            <p>And ſo God ſhall bleſs You and Your Poſterity for ever: So much
of good towards his People, ſo much of honor to himſelf no King ever
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52721:4"/>
had in his Power to act, as Your Majeſty now hath, by the ſaving of the
effuſion of ſo much innocent blood, and perhaps the Kingdom from utter
ruin. God, I doubt not, will give Your Maieſty a heart to make a right
uſe of it.</p>
            <p>And now, Sir, I will preſume to ſet down what Acts of Grace You
were pleaſed to paſs this Parliament in <hi>Anno.</hi> 1640, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Your Majeſty put down Monopolies.</p>
            <p>Secondly, You put down the Star-Chamber.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, You diſannulled the High Commiſſion Court.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, You conſented to the outing of Biſhops from the Houſe
of Peers.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, You Regulated the Councell Table.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, you granted the Trieniall Parliament.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, You condeſcended to the continuation of this, until diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved

               <p>11. That your Majeſty will confirm the Charter of <hi>London,</hi> and all

otherwiſe, for a ſpeedy ending of all ſuits againſt thoſe wicked Dilem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maes
of the Law, which are the ruin of thouſands, and only the inriching
of the Lawyers.</p>
               <p>19. That the Commons in the Country, in every Pariſh, be ſold, and
the poor allowed it; for many are ſo poor, they can make no uſe of the
Common.</p>
               <p>20. That your Maieſty cauſe all Acts for the benefit of the Poor,
to be put in execution, never more need, never more poor: And upon
complaint made to your Maieſty, your Maieſty to redreſs it.</p>
               <p>21. The Exciſe to be ſetled for the payment and ſatisfaction of all
Intereſts, which it will abundantly do, in ſome years, if it be farmed
out, and ordered as in <hi>Holland;</hi> [the particulars too large to expreſs
here] and no bread, ſmal-beer, fleſh or fiſh, to have any Exciſe ſet on
them, but to be highly advanced on Tobacco, Wines, Sugar, Spices, and
all outlandiſh commodities, Gold and Silverlace, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>22. That Your Majeſty promote the ſetting on foot the great and
moſt neceſſary Trade of Fiſhing, as ſhall be thought beſt, by Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52721:6"/>
or otherwiſe by free Trade for all men; the imployment of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
breeding up of Mariners, &amp;c. it cannot be imagined how much the
Kingdom would be the better for it; often thought on, never ſet on
foot.</p>
               <p>23. An Act to be paſſed for the ſupply of all Poor, young and old,
amongſt whom how many thouſands of maimed ſouldiers, and people
made miſerably poor by theſe Wars, on both ſides; all to be taken
care for in a way, or means, which ſhall be expreſſed; for the effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of which the Kingdom ſhall be at as little Charge as now they are,
and ever have been: and this ſhall be plainly manifeſted when occaſion
ſhall be too large to expreſs here; which will be to the glory of God,
the education of young Children, the maintenance of old decrepid
people, and a proviſion for all and every poor man, woman or child in
the Kingdom, though bedrid, blind, or lame; ſo as this courſe well
obſerved, the reſhall not be a Beggar in the Kingdom of <hi>England:</hi>
—A pious Work.</p>
               <p>24. That Your Majeſty paſs a ſtricter Act, then ever, for the putting
down of Alehouſes, through the whole Kingdom: one for ten that
now is in and about this City, were too much; ſo numerous they are,
that almoſt every third houſe in the Suburbs is an Alehouſe, Victualing-houſe,
Cooks houſe, or a Chandler that ſells Bear and Ale, which ought
to be regulated in a ſtrict manner; ſo highly is God diſhonored by it,
the poorer ſort undone, and ſo many thouſand idle luſtly fellows, and
young wenches and boyes bred up in that way, and the moſt part of
the mony gotten by deocit of meaſure.</p>
               <p>25. That your Majeſty paſs an Act, that thoſe that are not able to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
their Debts, their bodies not to be kept in priſon, giving all they
have to their Creditors (if leſs may not ſerve,) for if this be not done, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the numberleſs number of men that now lie and ſtarve in priſons,
how many thouſands (yea more) who have lived wel, and yet meerly by
theſe Wars on both ſides are utterly undone, not able to pay any thing?
Shall they lie in a priſon, and theirs ſtarve or beg? If this Law be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enacted, no man ſhall deceive or cozen not one of twenty ſhall break,
or be Bankrupts; or if they do, they ſhall gain nothing by it; nor ſhall
any man (as many do) live in priſon and not pay his Debts, if he be
able, but his eſtate ſhall be ſold: This Act, rightly ordered, is of a
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52721:6"/>
great benefit to the State, and ought to be done in <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>26. That all Fees of Lawyers and Phyſitians, Atturneys, Chirurgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and all Fees of all Courts of Juſtice, be brought to a fit rate: It
is a ſhame, yea and a ſin, that a Phyſitian and a Lawyer ſhould have
ſuch great Fees.</p>
               <p>27. That the Eſtates of all Subjects be liable to their Debts, none
excepted: this is rational and religious.</p>
               <p>28. An Act, that none of Your Majeſties Servants be choſen of the
Houſe of Commons, nor no ſervant of a Lord, who takes wages of
him.</p>
               <p>29. An Act, that no Lord or Perſon of Honor, or other, ſhall write
his Letters, or uſe any indirect means to procure any man to be a
Member of the Houſe of Commons, but foly left to the Country; and
if it ſhall be proved that any Member hath ſo tampered, by money or
friends, upon diſcovery to be turned out of the Houſe.</p>
               <p>30. That all the Kings Forreſts and Chaſes be ſo ordered, that the
Poor ſuffer not, but that the King rather ſuffer himſelf for the good
of the Poor.</p>
               <p>31. That your Majeſties Ear ſhall always be open to hear any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint,
and to puniſh it, againſt any Officer that you have placed in
Court, City, Country, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>32. That Your Majeſty paſs an Act, that henceforth Balletting boxes
be uſed in both Houſes as in the State of <hi>Venice,</hi>) the benefit great,
the diſpatch ſudden; and little partiality will be then expreſſed, but
every man will do as his conſcience informs him, without Fear, or for
Favour.</p>
               <p>33. An Act about Gaming, ſome moſt ſevere Act, for it is the
Ruine of the Nobility, Gentry and of the City: It is not hard to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
a way to aboliſh it, ſo as that no man ſhall be prejudiced in his
Eſtate; and if any ſhall break that Law, to be highly puniſhed, to bear
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52721:7"/>
no office in this Kingdom: this may ſeem but of a ſmall conſequence,
but it is upon due examination of a great conſequence; as the State
ſhall approve, ſo a further diſcovery may be made, with the remedies
and limits of Gaming.</p>
               <p>34. An Act for the calling in, and nulling of all his Majeſties Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
againſt both Houſes of Parliament, or any other perſon that
hath offended or ſeemed to offend the King; as alſo a calling in, and
nulling of all ſuch as the two Houſes have ſet forth againſt the King,
or his Friends, as ſhall be agreed on in the Treaty.</p>
               <p>35. That all things paſſed by the Seal, made by the Parliament, be
ſet into a right order, yet ſo as the Honor of the King Majeſty be not
touched upon to poſterity: This is a weighty matter, and requires the
graveſt and wiſeſt heads in the Kingdom to ſettle; and yet it muſt of
neceſſity be ſo, in regard of after-queſtions, I leave it to the Treaty.</p>
               <p>36. That during the Treaty (which doubtleſs, if the People come
with equal hearts to Peace, as the King doth upon theſe Reſolutions,)
his Majeſty will take ſuch order, that none of his Party ſhal come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
ſo many miles of the Court: or who ſo doth, ſhall be by his eſpecial
licenſe, and knowledg given to the Parliament, and his Majeſty to
anſwer for them, for the not diſturbing the Peacè of the Treaty.</p>
               <p>If your Majeſty ſhall be pleaſed to add or diminiſh (as you are free;)
This is far from being by me intended other, then to ſhew the
heads of ſo many neceſſary things, for the good of the <hi>People,</hi>
which I conceive your Majeſty might confer upon your people
according to <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Religion.</hi>

               </p>

for your Maieſty, if you are ſo pleaſed, to paſs through into the <hi>Temple

in the power of no mortal man beſides: your ſacred Majeſty muſt take

of any the leaſt private Intereſt of your own, either of Honor, Profit, or
Revenge; making it ſubordinate to the publike good and welfare of
the Kingdom, your Nurſe and Mother, who expects a ſpeedy accompt
of you; at the preſent, ſhe being wounded all over, from head to foot,
weltring in her blood, ready to give up the ghoſt; as God doth like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
look for a ſtrict accompt, and will do to all Eternity, of your true
and faithful performance of your duty, for the inſtant Peace and quiet
of the Kingdom: To this purpoſe you were choſen, for that end was
your Call by God and Man, and nothing elſe, but that, ought to have
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52721:10"/>
been, from the beginning to the end, your care and ſtudy day and night;
but how you have performed this truſt in your Endeavours, (and eight
years ſitting) and what ſucceſs hath been, let the world, not I, Judg:
This I am too ſure of; the neglect of many in attending their duty at
the Houſes, in the beginning, as if they had not been called to any ſuch
purpoſe, as to wait there daily,) the diviſions amongſt the Members of
both Houſes, from the firſt ſitting to this preſent time; and the abſenting
of others (or worſe, the breaking out of the pale of Parliament, which
ought on no terms to have been done,) hath been no ſmall cauſe of the
Miſeries of this unhappy Kingdom, who hath been ſtill every way
wounded by her own unnatural Children: Then, after that the great E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions,
the differences of opinions in Church and State, the ſetting on
foot of <hi>Self-Intereſts</hi> of ſeveral perſons, and thoſe not mean ones, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting
the <hi>Peace of the Kingdom,</hi> as if it might have been had with
whiſtling for, or at a beck; all theſe put together, were no ſmall addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to our common Calamities: Add to this, the Reproach caſt upon
Soveraignty, the promulgation of contentions and ſtrifes, the proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it to a War, and ſo an engaging of the whole Kingdom
on both ſides, in it; the taking of a Covenant, not of love I fear, to
the extirpation of that Church-Government, that had been ſo long ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by ſo many Acts of former Parliaments, and the inducing of a new
Government, more different in name then in eſſence, and truly, if right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
examined, ſcarcely differing much in either, at leaſt, not worthy the
making of ſuch bloody differences as have been about it, &amp; al this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any good ſucceſs to the Kingdom, or content to many of your own
particular Members, who have varyed, many of them, even from the
Covenant they once took, for what ends or Intereſts I know not. I
cannot forget to put you in mind, or remember you alſo, the ſeveral
Deſign, of the <hi>Army,</hi> and the <hi>Grandies</hi> thereof, under the <hi>Earl of
Eſſex,</hi> though they were put to a nonplus in it; nor of the backward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to make Peace, when it might have been, nor of thoſe whoſe
Counſels modelled the new Army, which yet for all their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes,
(ſucceſſes, I confeſs, many great, and high,) had they made right
uſe of them for the ſettlement of the King and Kingdom as they might,
as they ought to have done; who yet not 18. moneths ſince, when
the <hi>Army</hi> was at <hi>Newmarket,</hi> it was a queſtion, whether they ſhould
have been an Army, or no Army, kept a foot, or disbanded: Nor can
I omit their riſe again, if not upon the head, yet at leaſt upon the
ſhoulders, both of <hi>King, Parliament, City,</hi> and <hi>Kingdom;</hi> what Deſigns
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52721:11"/>
on all ſides, and to what ends, or how the poor Kingdom hath been
ſhaken with this long, and yet terrible Earthquake, through <hi>Self-Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests</hi>
and Diviſions, I preſs not, but this I muſt ſay, If Deſigns were
well meant, and for the good of the Kingdom, (as I hope they were)
there was no bleſſing went along with them, for they have not ſo well
ſucceeded, as was by ſome hoped, and by all wiſhed for: And then
thoſe yet unhappy Votes, of no Addreſſes to nor from His Maieſty;
which I fear God Almighty is not well pleaſed with, or rather highly
offended at. God never denyed Addreſſes to him from the greateſt
Sinner (had he come with true repentance:) to <hi>Cain</hi> himſelf, God ſays,
<hi>If thou doſt well, ſhalt thou not be accepted? &amp;c.</hi> and how amazed
would the ſoul of any man be, (unleſs he were feared up by a total
hardneſs of heart,) if God ſhould from Heaven tell him, <hi>Pray not to
me, come not to me with your Addreſſes, I will not hear you, I will
ſhut my ears, and be deaf to your Prayers!</hi> But we all know the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
of God: <hi>At what time ſoever the wicked man forſaketh his
wickedneſs, &amp;c.</hi> and who knows whether the ſcales may not turn,
<hi>[Let not him boaſt that puts on his armor, &amp;c.]</hi> And then if Addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
were ſought and refuſed; and that the King ſhould ſay, <hi>Did you
not hate me, and expell me out of my Fathers houſe? How is that
you come to me now in the time of your Tribulation;</hi> as <hi>Jephta</hi> did to
the men of <hi>Gilead,</hi>) might not this ſeem to be a juſt Reproach? or as
God in the ſame Book, <hi>Go to the Gods whom you have ſerved:</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member

upon the graſs.</hi> For your own ſakes; for this bleeding Kingdoms ſake,
proceed to a ſudden <hi>Perſonal Treaty</hi> with His <hi>Majeſty:</hi> God treats
with his greateſt Enemies; nay he invites them continually, hourly,

may be repented, not repealed; but a wilful continuance in ſuch hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid

Love and Union; to which end I publiſhed my poor <hi>Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
for Peace and Safety,</hi> in Print, (and I would to God it had an
Impreſſion on all thoſe who are oppoſite to Peace, if there be any ſuch;)
which although for the preſent it be laid aſide, (as not worthy a

Houſes look, in <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> what they can expect
more from the King then he doth, if he will do them, as I am confident
he will, in theſe Propoſitions preceding: can you demand more for the
good of the Subject, he will do it; he that will do ſo much, will refuſe
nothing in <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> and beyond theſe I know theſe Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Houſes will not demand; the honor, and reſtoring of the King,
how many of your ſelves have fought for, and for the ſafety of the
Kingdom, Priviledges of Parliament, and liberty of the Subject, all have
profeſt, vowed it, covenanted it, ſworn it; hold to that, the work is

            <p>SInce I have preſumed to ſpeak to his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> the two Honorable
Houſes of Parliament, and the Army, why ſhould I ſpare to ſay
ſomething to you, O you ſons of <hi>Levi!</hi> You that take liberty to tell
all men of their fanlts, why ſhould not you be told of your own? Sure
I am you have as much need (if not more) to be put in mind of <hi>Self-Denial,</hi>
as any profeſſion whatever; and it had been happy for this
poor unhappy Kingdom, if you, who profeſs your ſelves our ſhepherds,
had practiſed it a little better then you have hitherto done: The Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt
that you of the Clergy of this Kingdom (for I exempt neither
ſide) are to give to God Almighty at the great day, will, I fear, lie
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52721:12"/>
heavy on you: For, ſure I am, had you been (what you would have
the world eſteem you) the Embaſſadors of Jeſus Chriſt, and his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
you would never have added ſo much oyl to this ſlame, as you
have done; but on the contrary, you would have brought the cold
water of patience, humility, love and meekneſs (on all hands) to have
quenced it: And this our Saviour (and your Maſter, as you call him)
taught you, and all the world: How the Clergy of this Kingdom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved
themſelves towards God and the Kingdom, in their duty to
both, before the beginning of this Parliament, I leave to God and the
world to judg; but how unanſwerably, diametrically contrary to
the example and precepts of our Saviour, you have demeaned your
ſelves, both in the Pulpit, and in the Preſs, ſince theſe unhappy diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
between the King and Parliament; and how great Incendiaries
and fomenters you have been, needs no witneſs to teſtifie: Had the
Clergy on the Kings part, and the Clergy on the Parliaments part, plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and truly (without fear or flattery) told both of them the danger
and the devilliſhneſs of a War, both for ſoul and body, the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and unlawfulneſs of it (on both ſides,) and perſwaded them
both, to love, meekneſs, and forbearing one another, told the King
his own, and the Parliament theirs, and yet nothing but truth neither
(according to the Word of God;) I doubt whether it had ever come
to a War at all; I am ſure they would never have been ſo forward on
either ſide, as they were; The truth is, (I ſpeak to the hearts of all
honeſt men) the Clergy on both ſides (had they been of the mind of
Chriſt and his Apoſtles) ſhould have preached againſt it, printed againſt
it; and if that would not have ſerved the turn, ſhould have denyed
both King and People the Sacrament of the Lords Supper; (for with
what conſciences could either ſide give or take it, in the fury and rage of
Blood and War, wherein they were hourly engaged: (I underſtand
it not:) And if that would not have prevailed, they ſhould not have
afforded the Word, nor their Prayers in Publick, if they had continued
ſtill to perſiſt in Bloody Deſigns and Self-Intereſts: and had you of the
Clergy proceeded thus far, you had done but your duty to God, the
King, and the People; and I am confident both ſides would have ſtood
at a gaze, and not have been ſo forward, as they were, perhaps not
at all proceeded to paſs through ſuch a Sea of blood, as they have done:
and how many of both ſides have periſhed in that red Sea, from this
world at the beſt, (I judg not of the next!) But was this courſe taken
by you (or if by ſome, for I tax not all) yet I never heard of any; O no,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52721:13"/>
wo is me, in ſtead of imitating our Saviour in theſe three particulars,
which all good Chriſtians muſt imitate him in, in his <hi>Life,</hi> in his <hi>Love,</hi>
and in his <hi>Doctrine,</hi> (all of them imitated ſtrictly by the Apoſtles.)</p>
            <p>I ſay, in all theſe three, the Clergy (generally to our view) have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
our Saviour Chriſt in a ſtrange manner.</p>
            <p>Firſt, in his <hi>Life,</hi> that was poverty and contempt, all along, from the
Cradle to the Croſs; Yours as full of Glory, Jollity, and Honor,
as you can advance it. Secondly, in his <hi>Love;</hi> he was all <hi>Love,</hi> he
preached it, he practiſed it; <hi>My Peace I leave with you:</hi> That was
Chriſts Legacy; How well have you diſpoſed of it? or what execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
are you of this his laſt Will and Teſtament? He abrogates the old
Law in that particular, where it was ſaid of old, <hi>An eye for an eye,
and a tooth for a tooth &amp;c. But I ſay unto you, it ſhall be ſo no more:
You ſhall love your enemies, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>behold I bring you a new Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,
that you love one another.</hi> This was ſpoken to all the
world of Beleevers; much more to you, who profeſs to be the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors
of Chriſt, as you do: You take Texts out of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in oppoſition to Chriſt, <hi>[Curſe ye Meroſh,]</hi> and you incourage
to fight, and cry, The Cauſe is good, it is Gods; (I ſpeak to both
ſides,) yea and you conjure the people to fight in the name of the Lord,
tell them they are Martyrs, they cannot miſs Heaven, if they dye for
the Cauſe; (ſuch Martyrdom God deliver me from:) The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
not the Cauſe, makes a Martyr; and if that be not purged by
the blood of Chriſt, in true Faith and Repentance, though a man ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
Martyrdom for Chriſt, he is no Martyr: He whom God calls to
be a Martyr, he fits him firſt, and makes him a Martyr to the world,
in crucifying the luſts of it and ſure, men that fight for power, though
Kings, or Subjects for Priviledges &amp; Liberty, are not ſo wel ſeaſoned with
<hi>Self-Denial,</hi> as is requiſite to make a Martyr: And for the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of
Chriſt, it was <hi>humility, Learn of me, for I am humble &amp; meek:</hi> OGod!
have you of the Clergy practiſed this humility and meekneſs? Nay,
have you not boldly, to the world, expreſt the contrary in moſt of your
converſations? Had there been a Palſie in your tongues, (your tongues
ſet on fire from hell, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks) and in your hands, this
Kingdom had been happy: <hi>Ye take too much upon you, ye ſons of
Levi;</hi> Did I ſay you do? You ever did, and you will do, till the
time come that <hi>Malachi</hi> the Prophet ſpeaks of, (I hope) neerer at hand
then you beleeve; were you true Prophets, you would tremble at the
Text, and by the Spirit of Propheſie diſcern the time: <hi>Malachi</hi> 3. 3.

you pretend to; you do but take up the Stone, and turn the other
ſide. It is you that have put us all in a flame: your Tribe hath done,
and doth it all the world over: Is there any evil in a Kingdom, or
rather this great evil in this Kingdom, and have not you done it? You
have either done it, or had the greateſt ſhare in doing it, or not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered

follow you, when you command things contrary to Chriſt? But great
is your <hi>Diana,</hi> and you voyce her high up; ſhe is (for all your roaring) but
an Idol, ſhe cannot ſtand, ſhe is falling, ſhe is falling. Our Saviour
ſays, <hi>He that is greateſt amongſt you, ſhall be the least;</hi> and he that
is leaſt among you in the Clergy, would be greater then the Civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate,
if he could: Oh the ambition of the Prieſthood! (Read the
Prophets of old againſt the Prieſts: and is not the Prieſthood of theſe
times worſe? compare them together.) What <hi>Aaron</hi> before <hi>Moſes?</hi>
it was not ſo of old: Nor will God ever have it ſo, where his Spirit
governs. The <hi>Luciferian</hi> Pride, Ambition, and Covetouſneſs of the
Clergy, is not the leaſt quarrel God hath with this Nation; what
will you ſay, or anſwer, When God comes to make inquiſition for
blood? where is the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> (in <hi>Aarons</hi> breſt-plate it
was) purity of Doctrine and Integrity of Life? I fear, it is not to be
found in your hearts, in your Doctrine, nor Life. Open your eyes, the
time is yet, Repent and amend: Great would be the joy in Heaven for
ſuch ſinners, more then for any; and great would your glory be here<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
hereafter. <hi>Return, O Shulamite, return, return,</hi> and be not aſhamed
to do it: Your example, on all hands, I am perſwaded, (if ſincere)
would ſtrongly build us up in a better way: A worſe then you have
taught us, and a worſe then we are in, out of hell, is not. If the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
ſay, <hi>Contention, ſtrife, debate,</hi> is <hi>carnal, earthly, divelliſh;</hi>
What is Plundering, Murdering, Raviſhing, Robbing, and Confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?
How can a man of God appear in a Pulpit, and not Preach,
and ſpeak againſt it, pray againſt it, print againſt it? and lo, you have done
the contrary: Shall I praiſe you? I praiſe you not. God forgive you,
with my ſoul I beg it.</p>

To conclude, for Gods ſake, inform me, I am a poor weak man,
What warrant in Religion to Faſt for ſtrife, and to give thanks for
Victories, and ſhedding blood? both ſides, King and Parliament
have done it: God have mercy on them for it. How can you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove

            <p>NExt to His Majeſty, the two Honorable Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

peaceful mind, God knows, not wiſhing ill to any man, but deſiring
to have peace with all men) is, to perſwade you (in whoſe hand the
power of the Sword is) that you would remember you are Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;
that we have one Common <hi>Mother,</hi> (the Kingdom wherein
we live) whoſe bowels are dayly ripped up by this bloody unnatural
War. When the Soldiers, in the New Teſtament, demanded of <hi>John,
What ſhall we do?</hi> he ſaid unto them, <hi>Do violence to no man, neither
accuſe any falſly; and be content with your Wages:</hi> If any Soldier
now, high or low, Commander or Officer, ſhould demand of me
what he ſhould do, I ſhould firſt anſwer him as <hi>S. John</hi> did: but in

regard you are Chriſtians (which thoſe Soldiers were not, nor Jews
neither, but Romans) I ſhall take the boldneſs to ſay much more then
S. <hi>John</hi> did there to thoſe Soldiers, and yet no more then our Saviour
left in Command. For your Pay, to begin there, God forbid you
ſhould not have it at the full, and that quickly; You have ventured
hard for it, body and ſoul: My former <hi>Expedient for Peace and Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
expreſſes my deſire in that; As for Liberty of tender Conſciences, I
wrote it not out of Fear or for Flattery; but what I did, and do, beleeve,
ought to be: But I muſt profeſs I am infinitely afflicted to ſee the high
calamity (like to be greater) which by a moſt bloody inteſtine War
this poor Kingdom groans under; and fain I would find an Expedient
for it, at leaſt I would ſpend my poor talent, to make ſome ſtop of
this great iſſue of blood: And therefore I take this boldneſs to ſpeak
to your Excellency (the General,) and all ſubordinate Officers of this
great Army of the Parliament, (not leaving out all thoſe, who have
been, and now are in Arms againſt you,) for my diſcourſe is to all;
but my chief aym and hopes are in you: for I am perſwaded it is in
your power, next to the King, under God, to procure a ſudden Peace,
(if you will have it the right way, who dare oppoſe it?) and ſo
ſuddenly to ſtill the raging and furious fire of this moſt unnatural War.
If you will but practiſe that leſſon (which I have dictated to his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,</hi>
the two honorable Houſes, and the Clergy) of <hi>Self-Denial,</hi>
how examplary will ye be to all poſterity! and how well will it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
you, in the midſt of all your ſtrength and power, to decline it?
I mean not to lay all down inſtantly, and let your enemies (who,
God knows, I beleeve, are far from deſiring peace theright way) cut
your throats or ſubject your ſelves to them: it were folly in you to
truſt them, and wickedneſs in me ſo to counſel you; but you to begin
firſt (though more powerful) and to deſire Peace, and endeavor it: If
therefore you will begin as I ſaid] with <hi>Self-Denial</hi> of all <hi>Self-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts,</hi>
be it honor, or profit, or what ever it be, Peace, I think, may
be eaſily obtained: Why do we fight, kill, and ruine one another?
Are not we brethren? May not Treaties end it better then the Sword?
Remember, I pray you, what <hi>Abner</hi> ſaid to <hi>Joab, Shall the Sword
devour for ever? Knoweſt thou not that it will be bitterneſs in the
end?</hi> And God ſaith, <hi>He will not pardon innocent blood;</hi> and I am
ſure, there can be no War where many Innocents [yea thoſe that know
not the right hand from the left] do not ſuffer: God will not be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
by your ſaying, It is the inevitable fate that accompanies War,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52721:15"/>
it cannot be avoyded: The queſtion will then be, Who bid you go
to War? S. <hi>John</hi> bid you, <hi>Do violence to no man:</hi> and Chriſt he
comes but a very little after the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> with <hi>Forgive your enemies,</hi>
Away, ſaith he, with <hi>an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth,</hi> &amp;c. (that
is, wrong for wrong:) <hi>Bleſs them that curſe you</hi> &amp;c. And ſurely it
were the beſt Chriſtian Courtſhip to appeaſe all differences by Peace:
<hi>The blood-thirſty man,</hi> ſaith the Scripture, <hi>ſhall not live out half his
days:</hi> and if he do grow old in blood here (as few do) yet <hi>ſhall he
never ſee the Lord in the Land of the living,</hi> unleſs he get it with a
hearty repentance; and what hope can he have that dyes in a battel,
killing, and killed? whoſe ſoul in the inſtant of ſeparation, is wrapped
and enveloped with rage, revenge, blood, horrot, and height of fury
againſt his oppoſite; (as the body, for the moſt part, at the ſame time,
is environed with dreadful ſounds, howlings and ſhriekings, with
fire and ſmoak, the very Emblem of Hell it ſelf.) And
what ſayes our Saviour: As the Tree falls, ſo it lyes: I would
to God, every ſouldier would think of this hourly, and beleive it ever:
Suppoſe, I pray you: A common drunkard (whoſe practiſe it is dayly
ſo to be, dyes drunk, by a fall or other accident, as we have had many
ſuch fearfull examples;) doe, or can you in any charity hope well of ſuch
a ſoul? ſhall he be received into the everlaſting joyes? the like of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery
or fornication (I ſpeak of a common adulterer and fornicator)
whoſe God is his luſt, who dyes in the arms of his Dalilah<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> can you
hope well of him? I am ſure it is a high preſumption ſo to ſpeak:
ſure I am his caſe is Fearfull, and by the Rule of Scripture we may be
hold to judge no hapineſſe could arrive that ſoul ſo dying. The Caſe
is the ſame with thoſe that dayly fight battells (nay, who long for it if
but a little retarded;) if war be unlawfull, (I diſpute it not, I take it for
granted:) and I am ſure by the new Teſtament utterly condemned:
Now, if ſo, he that dyes killing, and killed (as I ſaid before;) what a
moſt miſerable condition is that ſoul in? for their works, good or bad<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
follow them, ſaith the ſcripture: doe they ſo? in what a ſtate then is
that ſoul in dog'd and clog'd with ſuch deeds of darkneſſe before, at, &amp;
after the expanſion of it? what time is there of repentance, when the
outward man is in ſuch a Confuſion and horror? for battells afford not
many quiet and calme ſlumbers. Sure I am, he that is lives by the mercy
of God moſt ſtrictly, &amp; with S. Paul mortifies himſelf, and <hi>dyes dayly</hi> to
the world; yet ſuch a ſoul works out it is ſalvation with Fear &amp; Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling,
and finds it (not too) ſcarce well prepared for its ſeperation. Iudge
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:52721:16"/>
then ye Men of war. E. Contra. Remember for Gods ſake, for your
ſouls ſake, what our Saviour ſaith, Matth. 24. 48. <hi>But if that evil ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
ſhall ſay in his heart, my lord delayeth his coming, and ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to ſmite his fellow ſervants &amp;c. The Lord of that ſervant ſhall
come in a day that he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is
not aware of, and ſhall cut him aſſunder, and appoint him his portion
with Hypocrites; there ſhall be weeping, and gnaſhing of Teeth.</hi> Our
Saviour denonneeth all this woe, but for ſmiting of a fellow ſervant:
what would he have ſaid, of Plundering, Murdering, Raviſhing, ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
ruining the poor, the Fatherleſſe, and the widows? This is vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
in a high degree: and how Guilty the Souldiers of this land, (on
both ſides King and Parliament) have been in all this ſeven years war, I
leave to God to judge; and thoſe to lament it, who have ſeen and
felt it. I know will the common queſtion ſhall we ſtand ſtill, and
have our Throates cut? I ſay not ſo. I know offences muſt come:
[Chriſt ſays it] but he likewiſe ſaith, <hi>woe be to them by whom offences
doe come:</hi> And the Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>have Peace with all men, if it be
poſſible;</hi> he doeth not for all that add, but if you cannot have Peace
Peacefully, fight, kill, &amp;c. O no, he could not preach ſuch a doctrine:
how eaſy were it to ſpend ſheets of paper to prove this by very texts
of Scripture, <hi>viz.</hi> the unlawfulneſſe and wickedneſſe of war: [yet I am
no Anabaptiſt:] Are the works of war from the Principles of light and
love, if ſo, well and good, happy your ſouls; if not, and there be ſelf-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
in it, Pride, Malice, Rage, Revenge, Ill yea ill indeed is it with

               </gap>] I am ſure thoſe works come out of the Principle of

Love: <hi>for God,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>is Love:</hi> and for certain the Children
of God are the ſons of Peace. <hi>My Peace I leave with you,</hi> was our
Saviours Legacy: To conclude, no man, I ſay, no Man muſt doe evil
that good may come of it: and I am ſure, our war for theſe eight years
hath done no good in Church or ſtate; [though God knows beſt
where a True Church is, and we poor ſubjects can at the preſent ſcarce
diſcern where the ſtate is, involved on all hands with miſteries and
ruines:] And for any man, be he Emperour or King, State or Republick,
I am confident the ſin as great, yea greater then great in the eyes

of God, to begin a War: and if the hearts of ſuch were ſearched (as
God can, doth, and will.) it would be found, it is <hi>Self-Intereſt,</hi> let
them plead and ſay what they wil; and to fight for <hi>Religion,</hi> for <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,</hi>
be they who they will, they have no true <hi>Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi>
in them: <hi>Religion,</hi> by all Kings, ſince Chriſts time, hath been made
but the ſtalking horſe, to catch up their other ends in the world: <hi>With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
holineſs no man ſhall ſee God:</hi> Is there holineſs in War? <hi>be not
deceived, God will not be mocked.</hi> Let the Souldier therefore lay by
all <hi>Self-Intereſt;</hi> in your Declarations you have profeſſed it, and ſeek
the <hi>Peace of the Kingdom,</hi> the ſetling of the <hi>King</hi> in his juſt Rights,
Him and his Children, the Parliament in their Priviledges, the Subject in
their true Liberties from Tyrannical Government, and Arbitrary too;
You have promiſed it, do it; and the <hi>King,</hi> I beleeve, is ready to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
his part: but do it by Love, by Peace; and God ſhall bleſs you, and
you ſhall find reſt to your ſouls: but if you proceed to do it by blood, on
that you will have a Peace of your own moulding: I pray remember
your own words, <hi>p.</hi> 4. nothing more abhorring to you then a new flame
of War: I fear, that will not diſcover the practiſe of <hi>Self-Denial</hi> to
be yet embraced of you; and had you all your deſires for this world, (as
I am confident the Souldiers profeſſion, Kings and Subjects, have rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
or never obtained their hopes, the reaſon is, the blood that is by them
ſpilt, which God abhors:) Look upon the <hi>King of Swede,</hi> ſee his end,
kil'd in a Battel, by one of his own ſide, it is thought; and ſee yet how his
people fare, and what reſt have they, or when are they like to have any?)
Yet <hi>what ſhall it profit a man,</hi> ſaith <hi>Chriſt,</hi> (beleeve him ye men of
War) <hi>to win the whole world</hi> (thats more then a Kingdom) <hi>and loſe
his own ſoul?</hi> I ſpeak to all who adore and dote on that Heathen God,
<hi>Mars</hi> (War,) rightly interpreted according to the Dialect of the
Holy Ghoſt, by the Apoſtles, in divers places, the very Devil himſelf.
<hi>Now the works of the fleſh,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Paul,</hi> Gal. 5. 19. <hi>are manifeſt,
which are theſe, Adultery, Fornication, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs, Laſciviouſneſs,
Idolatry, Witcheraft, Hatred, Variance, Emulations, Wrath, Strife,
Seditions, Hereſies, Envyings, Murthers, Drunkenneſs, Revelings,
and ſuch like; of the which I tell you now, as I have alſo told you in
time paſt, that they which do ſuch things ſhall not wherit the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God. But the Fruit of the Spirit is Love, Joy, Peace, Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffering,
Gentleneſs, Goodneſs, Faith, Meekneſs, Temperance, againſt
ſuch there is no Law. And they that are Chriſts, have crucified the
fleſh with the affections and luſts: If we live in the Spirit, let us alſo
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:52721:17"/>
walk in the Spirit: Let us not be deſirous of vain-glory, provoking
one another, envying one another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You have held out Reformation in Church and State, take heed of
Deformation in both, or rather utter ruin of all: where is your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
to proceed in blood? <hi>Learn of me,</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>for I am
humble and meek:</hi> Is there meekneſs in War? <hi>He that taketh up the
ſword, ſhall periſh with the ſword,</hi> (ſaith Chriſt.) I know well, he
once asked his Diſciples for a ſword; he was anſwered, there were two;
he ſaid it was enough, and perhaps thought it too much; he did not
bid them uſe it, nor did he ever make uſe of it, or command it, but the
contrary. You are Subjects, as well as I am; remember you are ſo:
and you are (or were) Servants alſo to the Parliament, who employed
you. Act both parts according to <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> and then this
bleeding Kingdom ſhall ow no ſmall ſhare of its happineſs to you; but
if you fail to do it, aſſure your ſelves the end cannot be good: <hi>Love is
the fulfilling of the Law. Now the God of Peace, and the Peace of
God which paſſeth all understanding, keep your hearts and minds in
the Fear and Love of God, &amp;c.</hi> So prays he, (that beleeves no man

forgive them that treſpaſs againſt us,</hi> if he waſh his hands in the

God brought war into your gates, and the ſword into your

it at the firſt, you courted the ſons of Mars, and you diſcovered all

not weary? would you not be made free? Remember thoſe dayes of
peace, when every man did eat of his own vine, and ſate under his
own fig-tree: did you make good uſe of it? no: you grew wanton
with eaſe, and proud with folly, and therefore God ſent war amongſt
you: your hearts were alwayes various from the wayes of God, and
therefore God ſuffered you to be diverſly minded, to make way for
your deſtruction; and now at laſt, for your wickedneſſe, hath ſuffered
the ſpirit of giddineſſe and diviſions, to be even in the midſt of your
citie, yea in every corner of it; and it is juſt with you: for you were ſo
far from <hi>Self-Denyall,</hi> that you denyed your ſelves nothing you had
a mind to; (I paſſe by the exceſſe of pride in apparell, like Princes rather
then Apprentiſes; and for Gluttony and Luxury, the world could not
match you: I ſay nothing of your Epicuriſme every way, with your ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect
of the poor that dayly beg'd at your doors.) I ſpeak not this to
all: I am confident, God hath a Remnant in this Citie, who ſerve him
moſt faithfully, and who are not onely free from thoſe ſins, but
dayly lament them in others; who ſtand in the Gap; and for whoſe
ſake this Citie hath ſtood ſo long, and doth yet ſtand: Great hath
been your <hi>Diana</hi> of profit, and you have ſacrificed ſo long at her
ſhryne, out of hope or fear; that if God open not your eyes, and that
you ſuddenly repent, your deſtruction is at hand: Go into <hi>Self-Denyall,</hi>
or you ſhall have no peace: lay aſide all private and ſelf-intereſts, that
of the Publicke Faith, disburſements for Ireland Biſhops Lands, Exciſe,
Cuſtome houſe &amp;c. and repent; nor upbraid your for wardneſſe at the
firſt to help on the work, had it been holy and pious: The end ſhews
plain [now] and it did long ſince appear, you did it for your own
ends; it was fear or hope of profit put you on, not the Zeal of Gods
Glory, the Honor of the King, or the good of the kingdom: [I ſpeak
not this to all, but to the moſt; and chiefly to thoſe, whoſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
intereſts, engage them, now, ſo hotly in the progreſſe of a war;
that the whole Kingdom is in hazard of utter Ruine:] look
into your own hearts, and ſay, how true or falſe I ſpeak: if true,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:52721:18"/>
make good uſe of it, that is, repent and amend; and that not with
caſt down looks, but humble hearts: You petition for Peace, it is well,
(ſo you did once for War, God forgive you,) but do you deſire and
pray, that God will give you Peaceful minds one towards the other?
Do you endevor it? Have you not (like the reſt of the world) Peace
in your mouths, War in your hearts? I wiſh I could forget, that not

lies: Not in your ſelves, not in your ſtrength, (that is already proved,)
not in your wealth, you do but hoord it up for others, unleſs God give
you open and repentant hearts; your ſafety lies in your <hi>Self-Denial,</hi>
and in your ſuffering, not your doing; away with all warlike and
bloody deſigns, you will be loſt here, and for ever, by them; add not to
your former evils, blood to blood; there is no ill ſo great which you are
not guilty of; you have done like the reſt of the Kingdom, or rather you
were their example: You have ſought your own, and not the things of
God; nay, you have fought for them more then once. And now it is juſt
with God, to leave you a prey to your enemies. Yet let me tell you, your
greateſt enemies are not only within your walls, but within your own
breſts: It is your Treachery to God, and to ſome body elſe, hath betrayed
you to hourly fears: You look down to the earth, you grovel there; lift
up your heads, lift up your hands too, but chiefly lift up your hearts to
God, from whom alone muſt come your ſalvation. Do all you can
for Peace, in a godly way, not by plots and ſtrife: <hi>We muſt not do ill,
that good may come of it:</hi> This City hath a great account to give,
when <hi>God ſhall make inquiſition for blood.</hi> There is no worldly Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel,
meer worldly, can do you good: God alone muſt do it, by
turning your hearts to him, and to your lawful King, and
in your love to your fellow Subjects; but add no more blood to blood.
The <hi>Militia</hi> of good conſciences, is better and ſafer for you, then al your
Arms, or the Army, if it were yours; in the day of Trouble you
will find it ſo: If there be any means or power in you, by Prayers to
God, Petitions to men, or the opening of your purſes in a peaceful way,
to procure Peace; forbear not to do it. <hi>Sero ſapient Thryges.</hi> Do
it, and that quickly, for Gods ſake, for the Kings ſake, for your own
ſake, for the whole Kingdoms ſake, delay not to do it; and beleeve
me, it is better to give willingly, what you may ſpare, then to have
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:52721:19"/>
all you have taken from you: who can give you a better hope?
No man can ſay, who will be the Victor (if Peace end it not:) You
ſee a Forraign Nation come in already; and perhaps many of you
laugh at it in your ſleeve, and rejoyce in it: Alas poor abuſed ſouls!
Do you think you ſhall not be the Spoil, who ever is the Conqueror?
Be not ſo ſottiſh: There is no party in Arms already, or like to come
into Arms, belonging to theſe three Kingdoms, but hath juſt cauſe to
upbraid and reproach you; and will certainly ruine you at the laſt.</p>

            <p>IN order to the Peace of this Kingdom. I publiſhed my firſt <hi>Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,</hi>
for the Peace and Safety of all the People of <hi>England:</hi> I refer
my ſelf to the world, to judg, whether better ſecurity can be had or
hoped for, then is contained in that <hi>Expedient;</hi> and in His Majeſties
Covenant ſet down in this Book: I have (you ſee) finiſhed a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<hi>Expedient for the King:</hi> But I deſire the whole Kingdom not
to miſtake me, (at leaſt, all that ſhall read it,) as if I, in the leaſt, intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that either the Offers which I have ſet down, from the King to his
People, or his Demands from them, ſhould ſtrictly be inſiſted on in this
great work. [Ear be ſuch a preſumptuous thought from my heart.]
No, they are only heads of a few, (ſuch as in my poor apprehenſion
might uſher in more from His Majeſty, as doubtleſs, he will offer and
perform all that he can for the good of his People,) and otherwiſe I
intended them not. It will appear to the whole Kingdom, that His
Maieſty begins with <hi>Self-Denial:</hi> Read his ſecond <hi>Peace-Offering,</hi>
[and paſs not over the firſt, which he offered to you all, 1640.] And
Faithfully beleeve, that for the good of his People, he will, yet, deny
himſelf more then ever any King did: In the name of God try him;
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:52721:20"/>
but ſtill remember, he is your King; and forget not that ſaying of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,
Fear God, and honor the King;</hi> and <hi>give unto Caſar that
which belongs unto Caeſar,</hi> and <hi>Caeſar</hi> will give you more, rather then
leſs, then belongs unto you. If the whole Nation, now, will but
imitate the King, and begin with <hi>Self-Denial,</hi> (without which there
can be no <hi>Peace,</hi> no <hi>Religion;</hi>) How happy ſhall both Prince and
People be! If you are not ſo minded, (chiefly thoſe who ſit at the
helm,) do you hope for Peace by a bloody War? Let no man tell
me, Peace is the end of War: Be not deceived, my beloved Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
if you keep your old hearts, of <hi>Self-Intereſts,</hi> and proceed on to a
new War, you will find the greateſt deſtruction that ever Nation did:
For, as <hi>there is no Peace to the wicked, ſaith my God,</hi> ſo there is no ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,
but helliſhneſs in War. The Apoſtle tels you, whence ſtrife and
contention proceeds, <hi>from below,</hi> ſays he; and do you expect a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
upon War and blood, from above? That any man ſhould dare to
blaſpheme God ſo highly, to pray to God to proſper him in his bloody
undertakings, (daub it over with what ſpecious pretence of Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
or Liberty you can;) what doth that man leſs, then pray to God
to bleſs the actions of the Devil within him? Blaſphemy worthy the
tearing of garments, and for which God will (amongſt other
ſins) ſorely viſit this Nation.</p>
            <p>The King muſt, if he will proſper, begin with <hi>Self-Denial,</hi> (and that
to ſome purpoſe too;) ſo muſt the two Honorable Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
the Clergy ſhould begin to all the Kingdom, they have moſt
need, (I will not ſay they are the moſt backward;) The Army, great
as it is, is under the power of the Lord of Hoſts; and (as they have
long ſince in their Declarations promiſed it) God he expects <hi>Self-Denial</hi>
from them; if not, he will one day deny their entrance into
the Eternal Tabernacles of Reſt, prepared for thoſe only that deny
themſelves: Thoſe bleſſed Manſions are not to be purchaſed, but by
ſtorming of them with <hi>Self-Denial:</hi> Our Saviour ſaith, <hi>The Kingdom
of Heaven ſuffereth violence, and the violent take it by force;</hi> (I
hope no man thinks Chriſt meant by force of arms, by killing, plunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and ruining the bodies and ſouls of men, women and children;)
ſure it was meant, by the violence of the good Spirit of God, moving
in the hearts of his peaceful Children, the earneſtneſs of whoſe ſouls is
ſuch, in reſiſting and oppoſing the <hi>deeds of darkneſs,</hi> and <hi>the fiery darts
of the Devil,</hi> which is in them, in the old <hi>Adam,</hi> that they have a
dayly ſtorming, combat and ſtrife, with all violence within themſelves,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:52721:21"/>
to diſpoſſeſs the old <hi>Adam</hi> of his ſtrong hold, and then the Kingdom of
Heaven ſo much is it can be in this life is gotten and obtained; for
he that gets it not here, ſhall never poſſeſs it hereafter; <hi>as the tree

            </p>
            <p>The Citie alſo muſt go into <hi>Self-Denyall,</hi> my diſcourſe to them tells
them no leſſs; And laſtly, you the whole Kingdom (under whom the
four laſt are comprehended) muſt likewiſe go into <hi>Self-Deniall:</hi> For
all of you in Generall (I exempt not my ſelf) have and do abound with
all ſorts of ſins, yea with the greateſt ſins, and particularly that of
Bloody a fearfull and a crying ſin; which how you will anſwer, <hi>when
God ſhall come to make inquiſition for Blood;</hi> I know not: how will
you anſwer it, you blood, Subjects of this bleeding Nation, who joy
and delight in Blood and Revenge, who regard not the cryes and the
Teares of thoſe poor Innocents, which your ſwords make Widows
and Orphans? whoſe cryes (yet) aſcend up into heaven, and muſt
(without ſudden repentance) bring done a moſt unheard-of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon this Nation. For you the Subjects of this land (who are
not Souldiers,) are equally guilty, in your willing Contribution to
bothſides: and how many of you are ruined by your own party, to
whom you gave aſſiſtance? And it is juſt with God, it ſhould ſo be: A
Land ſo defiled with Blood, that profeſſed ſuch purity of Chriſtianity,
and hath practiſed on all hands, the moſt horrid and barbarous Acts that
ever were read of. The Father againſt the Son, the Son againſt the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
&amp;c. And doe you expect Peace; by going on in Blood? b<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

no Miniſter, that preacheth War, lawfull: (Read my Epiſtle to the
Clergy;) when they preach ſuch ſtuff, that's ſome of the leaven
which thoſe Scribes and Phariſees mingle with their other good Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
and ſo ſpoile the whole Lump.</p>
            <p>Alas! did they not mix ſome good things with the bad, who would
come neer them? Chriſt taught the contrary, viz. <hi>Love one another,</hi> (by
ſuffering, never came ill, but much ill by reſiſting) beleeve Chriſt and
follow his precepts and example: he that teacheth you other, is an Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt.
This Kingdom is highly guilty of all the ſins, that all the Prophets
denounced judgements againſt in the old Teſtament, <hi>Iſrael, Judah,</hi> or
any other Nation. I ſhall not need to name them: Prov: 6. 17. <hi>God hates
hands that ſhed innocent blood.</hi> Iſa. 59. 7. <hi>Their feet run to evil &amp; they
make haſte to ſhed innocent Blood, their thoughts are thoughts of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
waſting and deſtruction are in their paths, the way of peace they
know not, &amp;c.</hi> read on to the end of the 15. verſe: and behold, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:52721:21"/>
ſpeaks what we with our eyes have ſeen, and do ſee daily acted by
Authority, on both ſides, in this miſerable Land: And now, as if that it
were not enough that the Land hath been made drunk with our Blood
(and God knows, how much innocent.) The other Element of Water,
the Sea, that muſt be died of a bloody Colour [Preparations on all hands:]
And for that ſin of oppreſſion of the poor and innocent, never the like
that hath been on both ſides within theſe ſeven years, and yet is. In
a word the crie of the ſins of this Kingdom is gone up to Heaven, like
that of Sodom and Gomorrah, &amp; without ſudden repentance, we muſt
expect the like plagues: had there not been, and were there not ſtill,
ſome righteous <hi>Lots</hi> amongſt us, ſure we had been deſtroyed long
ſince; and when thoſe righteous Souls dye away or depart, Gods wrath
will ſuddenly raine done upon us, (without Repentance) to our utter
Confuſion: Repent therefore and that ſuddenly, and (as I ſaid before) go
into <hi>Self-Denyall:</hi> be quiet, let no man force you to fight on either ſide,
(much leſſs be forward to go your ſelves, as too many have done, and
paid dear for it.] Pray, but fight not, fight againſt your luſts and
worldly corruptions, againſt all ſelf-intereſts whatſoever (that's <hi>Self-Denyall</hi>)
and then all will be well: the Peacefull-minded, their
prayers, with the Widows and Orphans, if they prevaile not with
God to turn the hearts of the wicked, ſhall at one time or other, prove
of ſuch ſtrength, that like the Angel that deſtroyed the hoſt of <hi>Senna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherib</hi>
in one night, ſo ſhall Gods Judgements find, hunt out, and
deſtroy the wicked out of the land, who hate the Children of Peace
[and laugh at them;] for the Children of God, are the Sons of Peace.</p>
            <p>What would you have? would you have a King, a good King, &amp; the
beſt of Kings? and would you have Peace? Behold, he brings you the
Olive-branch of Peace by his <hi>Self-Denyall:</hi> he denies, or will deny
himſelf, for your good, as never King did: [were the beſt of you a
King, it would not be found an eaſy thing; you are Subjects, and yet
you cannot part with your petty private Intereſts, Molehills to the
Mountains of thoſe of a King:] Look upon the <hi>Kings Picture of
Mercy and Love,</hi> in my firſt Expedient, and upon his Covenant in
this tract: you are equally fafe with himſelf. [A better ſafety then
the Militia,] Look every Subject into his own heart, for I write to all,]
and deny himſelf but half as much for a Subject, as the King for a
King; and I dare ſay, we ſhall have Peace, a bleſſed and a happy Peace,
a Pious Peace, [away with a Politick Peace, it will never hold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>]<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we
ſhall have a Confident Peace on all ſides; away with a Jealous Peace,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:52721:22"/>
a diſtruſted Peace. Think of no Peace but what comes by the ſecurity
of <hi>Self-Denial,</hi> on all hands: it is above all your <hi>Militia's,</hi> and caſts
down all Malice: If no Peace muſt be, till the fearful hearts and guilty
conſciences of all men be ſatisfied, then we muſt never look for Peace.
In what a condition are you then in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> O ye Inhabitants of this Land!
I write unto you all: Conſider of it. And let thoſe men
be branded to all poſterity, who will take or receive no ſecurity,
but what is beyond all hiſtory or example, [as this truly is] nay beyond
all reaſon, and thereby render themſelves the progeny of <hi>Cain</hi> himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I
ſay once more, Conſider of it.</p>
            <p>To conclude, if ſpeaking truth to his Majeſty, to the Parliament no
lye, to the Synod orthodox Divinity, to the Army what Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
preached: to the City, what their own Conſciences know to be
true; and to [you] all the Subjects of the whole Kingdom of <hi>England</hi>
(I except none) what you are, moſt of you, highly guilty of, even by
the very Word of God; I ſay, if This be Treaſon, I am a Traytor, a
Traytor againſt all, and let me ſuffer for it; but let my Tryal be at the
Judgment-ſeat of Love, at the Bar of the New Teſtament, my Saviour
my Judg, the Apoſtles my Jury, and then proceed, I fear not: You
have all of you (King, Prieſts and People) purſued your own ends,
your <hi>Self-Intereſts,</hi> and you muſt caſt away your <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and wedg of gold; or God, who can do it, will ſpue you all
out, and give this Land to a more deſerving People; [Not the Scots or
Iriſh; alas! their Graves muſt be digg'd before your Funeral be fully
ſolemnized,] or perhaps to ſome of your poor innocent babes,
who are not old, like you, in ſins and iniquities; they may perhaps
partake of that bleſſed Peace, you would, but cannot have, ſo long as
you wilfully reſiſt God in your abominable ſins of Malice, Envy, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
Hatred, Blood-thirſtineſs, Covetouſneſs, and that which is
the Center of all, and contains all the miſchief that is, <hi>Self-Intereſt:</hi>
the only venom that hath of late years poyſoned this goodly and once
flouriſhing Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Chriſt denyed himſelf, who ſhould not? The King denies himſelf,
and you will not. Oh beloved Countrymen (I ſpeak to the whole
Kingdom, I wiſh every Ear heard me,) look your ſelves in this glaſs that
I have here preſented you with: it is not of ſo pure a chryſtal as it might
have been made, but it will ſhew you plainly the uglineſs of your paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
holineſs, and rotten-heartedneſs to God, your King and fellow-Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects:
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:52721:22"/>
that ſo by a true Repentance [forſaking the evil and doing the
good] you may come to a ſight of your grievous ſins, of Gods infinite
Mercy, of your Kings abundant Love, and your own future happineſs,
which is unceſſantly prayed for at the hand of God, by</p>
