            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Nothing ought to be counted Apoſtolicall, that is not grounded upon, and anſwerable unto the Apoſtles Doctrine. Our Apoſtles Creed is, <hi>That Chriſt was Crucified, dead and buried, he deſcended into Hell: the third day he roſe again from the dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is no Doctrine of the Apoſtles, that Chriſt betwixt his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall and his Reſurrection deſcended into Hell: therefore it is no Apoſtolicall Doctrine.</p>
            <p>Whatſoever is not Apoſtolical, ought not to be made Catholical. The <hi>Nycen</hi> Creed which is counted Catholicall, ſayes, that Chriſt ſuffered for our ſalvation: <hi>deſcended into Hell; roſe again the third day from the dead.</hi> That Chriſt ſuffered for our ſalvation, or rather that Chriſt ſuffered for our ſins: was finiſhed when he had received the vineger, and ſaid <hi>it is finiſhed: Father into thy hands I commend my</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Joh. 19. 30. Lu. 23. 46.</note> 
               <hi>Spirit:</hi> and having ſaid thus, <hi>he gave up the Ghoſt;</hi> or his divine Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit or God-head departed out of his humane body: and then was his full ſufferings finiſhed, as Chriſt himſelfe ſaith. <hi>Jeſus knowing</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Joh. 19. 28</note> 
               <hi>that all things were now accompliſhed that the Scripture might be fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led:</hi> as this <hi>Nycen</hi> Creed ſaith well: Although he be God and man, he is not two Chriſts, but one Chriſt: ſo when his God-head was departed from his man-hood, then hee had finiſhed or fulfilled all Scripture as a ſufferer: becauſe he was a perfect Chriſt no longer
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:38277:3"/>
then he was God and man, no more then a man that is a dead man, is a perfect man; for the dead body cannot ſuffer becauſe it hath no ſenſe: ſo that it was only the humane body of Chriſt laid in the grave that was in Hell: becauſe the grave is the dead bodies Hell: and the grave is called hell in divers Scriptures, and ſo is this <hi>Nycen</hi> Creed to be underſtood.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Athanaſian</hi> Creed ſaith, <hi>That Chriſt ſuffered, and was buried, and the third day roſe againe according to the Scriptures,</hi> and therefore a truth; for what the Spirit of God hath revealed, that only is truth: but the Spirit hath in no Scripture revealed that Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt his buriall and his reſurrection deſcended into hell: as that which is called the Apoſtles Creed doth affirm; therefore it is none of the Apoſtles Doctrine.</p>
            <p>This Doctrine, that Chriſt betwixt his buriall and his reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction deſcended into hell, is a helliſh, Antichriſtian, Romiſh do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, derived from their diabolicall errour, upon that their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interpretation of the Spirit of God, from thoſe words of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> where he ſaith, <hi>That Chriſt hath once ſuffered for ſinnes, the juſt for the unjuſt, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 18, 19, 20.</note> 
               <hi>the fleſh, but quickned by the ſpirit</hi> (the holy Ghoſt) <hi>by which</hi> (Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit) <hi>alſo he went and preached to the ſpirits in priſon, which ſometime were diſobedient</hi> (to God) <hi>when once</hi> (or at that time that) <hi>that the long-ſuffering</hi> (or forbearance) <hi>of God waited in the dayes of</hi> Noah <hi>while the Arke was preparing.</hi> From which Text doe the erroneous Antichriſtian Doctors of <hi>Rome</hi> gather and conclude, that Chriſt betwixt his death and Reſurrection divinely in his God-head, went amongſt, and preached unto the Infernall damned ſpirits: and to this purpoſe have inſerted thoſe their owne diabolicall words and Doctrine amongſt the Apoſtles doctrine, and made the ſame Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall as part of a Church-article, to believe the ſame as faith unto ſalvation. This doctrine &amp; interpretation is antichriſtian, becauſe it doth contradict the Doctrine and words of Jeſus Chriſt himſelfe, who ſaid to the penitent Thiefe upon the croſſe, <hi>To day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe.</hi> To be in Paradiſe, is to be in a place of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: <note place="margin">Lu. 23. 43.</note> this Paradiſe was Gods kingdome of glory, which is Chriſts kingdome, as the Spirit revealed the ſame to that Thiefe, who ſaid, <hi>Lord remember me when thou commeſt into thy Kingdome.</hi> The humane <note place="margin">Lu. 23. 42.</note> bodie of <hi>Jeſus</hi> that ſame day after he was dead, was laid ſafe in <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephs</hi> Tomb or grave which is called hell, where there is no pleaſure,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:38277:3"/>
neither can a dead body take any pleaſure; therefore the humane dead body could not that day be in Paradiſe: and for Chriſts Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Spirit or God-head at all to be, or that day to be amongſt the damned ſpirits, could not then that day be in Paradiſe, becauſe the damned ſpirits are not in pleaſure, but excluded from pleaſure, and reſerved in chaines of darkneſſe unto the great and terrible day of the Lord where no pleaſure is. Therefore it is an infallible truth, that when Jeſus Chriſt ſaid to the Thiefe, <hi>to day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe;</hi> he ſpake of his own divine Spirit or God-head, and of the thiefe's inviſible, internall, immortall, eternall ſpirit or ſoule, which came from God, and not of their mortall bodies which came from the earth, and lay in the earth. And when he ſpake of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, he did not ſpeak of that earthly Paradiſe in <hi>Eden,</hi> into which the man was put after his creation: but of that heavenly Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe into which man ſhould be fetched after his redemption by a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection; in which Paradiſe as Jeſus Chriſt affirmeth, <hi>is pleaſure for evermore:</hi> and ſo are the Romiſh Doctors and their antichriſtian diabolicall doctrine, with their falſe interpreation, confuted.</p>
            <p>The true meaning of the holy Ghoſt in <hi>Peter,</hi> by thoſe words of <hi>Peter,</hi> are thus to be interpreted and underſtood; that <hi>Peter</hi> and all others by God appointed for that purpoſe, into whom the holy Ghoſt was ſent, <hi>and ſpake as the Spirit gave them utterance:</hi> did not ſpeak, preach, or reveale the will or mind of God to the mortall bodies of men, becauſe the mortall bodies of men are to periſh, and ſo cannot for ever retaine the word of God which is to endure for ever, as Jeſus Chriſt ſaith. <hi>Heaven and Earth</hi> (that is the whole mortality) <hi>ſhall paſſe away: but not one jot or tittle of my word ſhall paſs away.</hi> But the Spirit of God doth direct the word of God to the immortall, eternall ſoules or ſpirits of men; becauſe the ſouls or ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of men, and the word of God are to endure for ever: and ſo the ſouls are able to retain the word for ever. And every ſoule of man is an immortall, eternall living ſpirit from God, whoſe Kingdome, habitation and dwelling from whence the ſoule came is <note place="margin">Gen. 2.</note> boundleſſe, endleſſe, and limitleſſe: and therefore a place of liberty, becauſe it is without any reſtraint: and every ſoul while it is in the mortall body of clay is confined and bounded with its mortall wall of earth the body, and chained in by the naturall corruptions of the ſinful fleſh. And ſo every ſoule while it is in the body, is in priſon, becauſe it is by the body reſtrained from its former liberty it had
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:38277:4"/>
in heaven from whence it came into the mortal body, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> former liberty was boundleſs and limitleſs. Therfore it was thoſe ſoules that were in the mortal bodies of thoſe wicked men of the old world, that lived in the days of <hi>Noah,</hi> before the flood that <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks of: <hi>that were the ſpirits in priſon preached unto</hi> by that quickning ſpirit or lively ſpirit of God the holy Ghoſt, by w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> the dead body or fleſh of Jeſus Chriſt, was quickned or raiſed the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> day again to life from the dead.

            <p>This heavenly glory is within the apprehenſion of no corrupted fleſh, further then the things of the fleſh doth behold: &amp; the brigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt glory of mortality is the Sun: and <hi>John</hi> ſaith that that glory ſhall paſſe the glory of the Sunne; inſomuch that <hi>that holy City new Jeruſalem, ſhall not need the light of the Sunne, neither ſhall there be any night in it.</hi> But as in the Land of Egypt there was an exceeding darkneſſe at noone-day: but in the Land of Goſhen there was no darkneſſe: ſo likewiſe during thoſe thouſand years in all the world there ſhall be night as well as day: but <hi>in the new and heavenly Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem there ſhall be no night at all.</hi> And this is all that God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed concerning the fulneſſe of that heavenly glory, becauſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted mortality can apprehend no more: as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>If our hope were only in this mortall life, then we were of all men moſt miſerable</hi> to ſuffer affliction for hope of a better life: if wee ſhould miſſe of it: but ſaith he, <hi>Yet it doth not,</hi> or here it doth not appeare <hi>what wee ſhall be: but when mortality ſhall put on immortality, and corruption ſhall be changed into incorruption, then it will appear; for here wee know but in part: but then ſhall we know as we are known.</hi> That is, wee who
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:38277:8"/>
know Jeſus Chriſt as a ſufferer, and reſt upon the promiſes of God by faith in Jeſus Chriſt for a rewarder: though now wee here with Chriſt ſuffer for the ſame, ſhall then know God and Jeſus Chriſt in a heavenly glory, conqueringly, as they knew us here ſufferingly.</p>
            <p>Secondly, beſides this heavenly glory which will in brightneſſe paſſe the glory of the Sunne. Chriſt will be glorified by <hi>new created heavens and earth,</hi> as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith; That is, by reſtoring of the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall heavens, whereof now the Devill is Prince, into that ſame condition they were by God created in, when God ſaw them to be very good, before man had ſinned: and they therefore corrupted by thoſe evill Inhabitants, the Devill and his Angels. And by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring of the earth with all the creatures created of it by God in the beginning within the fix firſt days: and that God when he had looked: <hi>ſaw them to be very good,</hi> to that ſame condition they were by God ceated in, before man had ſinned: and they therefore and thereby were by the power of the Devill corrupted. This reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion after ſo long a continuance as almoſt ſix thouſand yeares, ſhall by men be ſuch a ſtrange alteration, as though it were rather a creation then an alteration: and they who never did ſee no other but the corrupted heavens, and earth, to ſee an uncorrupted hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth, will be to them as a new created heaven and earth. And none, male nor female, from <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> ever ſaw any but a corrupted heaven and earth: becauſe the heavens and the earth were corrupted before they had any iſſue: therefore doth the Text ſay, that God <hi>will create new heavens and earth,</hi> becauſe the ſonnes of <hi>Adam</hi> never ſaw that very good condition the heavens and the earth were at the firſt created in, and into which they ſhall be again reſtored.</p>
            <p>Thirdly; God, Chriſt on earth, will be glorified by a <hi>a holy City, a new Jeruſalem from God out of heaven;</hi> which ſhall in largeneſſe ſo farre paſſe that old Jeruſalem builded by the Jewes, though it was in <hi>Solomons</hi> time, the greateſt City in the whole world, as a <hi>Citie of twelve thouſand furlongs ſquare;</hi> which is by eight furlongs to a mile, fifteen hundred miles ſquare, can paſſe the largeneſſe of that old Jeruſalem: and this City ſhall ſo far paſſe the old Jeruſalem in glory, as precious ſtones can ſurpaſſe in glory ordinary ſtones, wood, bricke, morter, iron, ſteele, and braſſe, in the foundations, walls and gates thereof: and the pavements of this City ſhall ſo far ſurpaſſe in glory the pavements of the old Jeruſalem, as poliſhed

And the Temple in this City ſhall ſo <note place="margin">Rev. 21. &amp; 22.</note> far ſurpaſſe in glory <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple, that was the glory of the old <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as the glory of God and Jeſus Chriſt doth ſurpaſſe the glory of fine gold, which was the glory of that Temple, as the Text ſaith, <hi>The gold beautified the Temple.</hi> And this holy and great City ſhall be the refiding place of GOD and Jeſus Chriſt on earth with all the faithfull members of Jeſus Chriſt from <hi>Abel</hi> to that day.</p>

            <p>Now the reaſon why theſe things of the Devils confinement or impriſonment for a thouſand yeares; and the glorious new <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> with all its glorious accommodations promiſed, are not belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by us <hi>Gentiles,</hi> is this; As the Devill by his power in mortality deceived the Jews of the ſuffering comming of Jeſus Chriſt for mans redemption, though promiſed and prophefied of by the only loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king for Jeſus Chriſt a conquerour, and King of Kings, according to the promiſes of a conquering Saviour by the Devils deceit, eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſteeming his ſuffering Redeemers condition to be too mean a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition for the Sonne of God: and ſo therefore did not believe him to be the Son of God: but upon the Croſſe ſaid unto him, <hi>If thou be the Son of God, come down from the Croſſe, and then we will believe thee.</hi> And ſo the Devill deceived the <hi>Iewes,</hi> from their benefit of Jeſus Chriſt, his redeeming condition. And ſo alſo the Devill by his power in mortality goes about to deceive us <hi>Gentiles</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt his glorious, conquering, Princely condition, by putting on this mask of infidelity upon us <hi>Gantiles,</hi> notwithſtanding all the ſure promiſes of God, that for Chriſt to come downe out of heaven, and on earth to dwell in a walled Citie that is bounded, is too glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious a condition for man to behold, and for the earth to bear; and therefore through unbeliefe and the Devils deceit doe ſcoffingly ſay, <hi>where is the promiſe of his comming.</hi> Expecting no other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, but his comming to judgement: and ſo doth the Devill goe about to deceive us <hi>Gentiles</hi> of our benefit of Chriſt his glorious conquering reigne and condition here on earth in that great and

The one was 1656. yeares; and the other will be 1666. yeares, according to this collection.

For he that breaketh but one commandement, although he could keepe or perform all that is commanded in all the reſt but one, he is guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of all: And ſo no man as he is of the ſeed of <hi>Adam,</hi> according to the luſt of the fleſh can poſſibly keep or perform all the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God; therefore none of the ſeed of <hi>Adam,</hi> according to the luſt of the fleſh, can deſerve or merit for doing of a duty, that reward which is promiſed for the duty.</p>
            <p>But inaſmuch as God hath promiſed a reward for doing of a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the reward is a due reward to him that can doe all the duties that God hath commanded, and to none elſe. And ſo no man but <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> only, and alone, ever did, or could keep &amp; performe all the commandements of God; therefore none but only <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> could deſerve or merit the reward promiſed for doing the duty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. And no man was, but <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> alone of the ſeed of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> and not according to the luſt of the fleſh. Therefore in the firſt place, that man in whom God doth worke both the will and the deed, to enable him to will, and alſo to doe a duty. And in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place, that man whoſe duty is accepted of God in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> In the third place, that man may by and for the perfect obedience of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> expect the promiſed reward, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the recompence of reward,</hi> becauſe hee looketh not for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed reward in, and for his own, but in and for the perfect righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> As for example, <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> hath promiſed a Diſciples reward to him that ſhall give a cup of cold water to a <note place="margin">Mat. 10. 42.</note> Diſciple in the name of a Diſciple. The duty commanded, is but a cup of cold water to be given. The party to whom the water is to be given, muſt be a Diſciple, or child of God, that wanteth the ſame. Now he that will, or ſhall expect to receive the reward, muſt not think to receive it for the richnes of the gift, neither becauſe he hath
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:38277:12"/>
done the duty; For neither of theſe, nor both theſe are of a valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conſideration, to deſerve ſuch a reward, becauſe a Diſciples re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is eternall life, as the Text ſaith, <hi>Maſter we have left all and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed thee, and what ſhall we have.</hi> Saith <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> not only you, <note place="margin">Mat. 19. 27. 29.</note> but alſo <hi>whoſoever ſhall leave father, mother, wife, children, houſe or lands for my ſake, ſhall receive in this world an hundred fold, and in the world to come life everlaſting</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But he that for ſuch a ſmall duty as the giving of a cup of water, and for ſo ſmall a value as a cup of water is of, muſt find out a more valuable conſideration why he ſhould receive ſuch a great reward as Everlaſting life, before he doe receive the ſame: And that muſt be, if it be aright, thus, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is God, <hi>unto whom all power was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven both in heaven and in earth.</hi> And thereby was <hi>Chriſt</hi> made able to perform whatſoever he ſhould promiſe, both in this world, or the world to come. And <hi>Chriſt</hi> is <hi>God,</hi> in <hi>whom all the promiſes of God are yea and amen,</hi> as the Text ſaith, <hi>who hath found God a lyar at any time?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now that man that will or ſhall expect ſuch a great reward for ſo ſmall a duty, and of ſo ſmall a value, muſt doe this; He muſt know that <hi>God</hi> hath wrought that will or good affection in him towards the poore members or little ones of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> for to helpe them in their need. And he muſt likewiſe know, that although a cup of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be but of a ſmal value or eſteem, where there is enough; yet it is the gift of <hi>God</hi> to him, and that he himſelfe doth receive the water from <hi>God,</hi> before he can give the water to another: and that he doth give the water to a childe of God: becauſe hee eſteemes him to be a child of <hi>God,</hi> and that the love of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> conſtraineth him to love the members of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> And when it is ſo given, then may a man expect that <hi>God</hi> will accept of the duty in and through <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> and for his perfect obedience ſake: who hath merited from God ability from God to perform whatſoever he hath promiſed. And ſo will make good all his promiſes, If the duty be done in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and for <hi>Chriſt</hi> his ſake, and the promiſed reward expected; not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the duty is done, nor for the things ſake: but becauſe <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who is an able and a faithfull God, hath promiſed the ſame. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore man ought to yeeld obedience, and to doe the duty comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and to expect the reward promiſed for theſe reaſons.</p>
            <p>Firſt, becauſe God hath commanded the duty as a Maſter, man ought to yeild obedience becauſe he is a ſervant.</p>
            <p>Secondly, becauſe God, (and not man himſelfe) worketh both
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:38277:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the will and the deed in man, to enable man to doe the duty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, becauſe <hi>God</hi> who maketh the promiſe, is able and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and will keep Covenant. And fourthly, Becauſe <hi>God</hi> in a <hi>God</hi> of Juſtice: and as the Text ſaith, <hi>will come in flaming fire, rendring vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the Goſpel of our</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2 Theſ. 1. 8.</note> 
               <hi>Lord Ieſus Chriſt:</hi> who requireth nothing of man towards his owne ſalvation: but <hi>my ſonne give me thy heart;</hi> or believe that thy ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is by the free grace of <hi>God,</hi> and of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> as <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> ſaid to the Jewes; <hi>O Ieruſalem, Ieruſalem, how often would I have gathered you together as a hen gathereth her Chickens under her wings, and ye would not.</hi> That is, how often would I have taken you into my protection out of the ſnares of the world, the Devill and the fleſh by my Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, to take you off of the rudiments of the Ceremoniall law, and have ſaved you by my precious blood and perfect obedience: and ye would not. <hi>Therefore thy deſtruction is of thy ſelfe O Iſrael,</hi> becauſe I offered my ſelfe unto thee, and thou wouldſt not receive me as the Text ſaith, <hi>He came unto his owne, and his owne received him not.</hi>
