            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>GENTLEMEN,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THAT a Letter ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed to you, in this Publick man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, may not ſeem ſtrange; I think my ſelf ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged, in the firſt place, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you with the reaſon of my Writing it.</p>
            <p>Your Title is New. At leaſt, it is not many Years, ſince
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:34981:3"/>
               <hi>Deiſm</hi> has been taken for a Characteriſtical Diſtinction, of any conſiderable Number or Body of Men. But however New that Title be, I confeſs, I eſteem it more honourable, in its true Signification, than any thing can be, upon the account of meer Antiquity. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, I remember particularly, that the firſt time I ever heard it thus uſed, was in a way of Cenſure; Which then did not a little ſurprize me. I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered barely what the Word imported; And could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, with what colour, the Belief or Worſhip of a Deity was thought worthy of blame. For, reflecting upon my ſelf, my own Conſcience told me that I was included in the Senſe
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:34981:3"/>
of the Expreſſion; But it did not upon that account reproach me with any manner of Guilt. I was ſure that my Belief of a God had, by no means, made me a worſe Man or worſe Subject, than I ſhould have been without it: But much the contrary. Next therefore, reflecting upon the Narrowneſs and Bigottry of his Spirit that ſpoke to me, (for he was wedded to a Party) I concluded that his partial Zeal made him miſ-apply the Term, and join an ill Idea to a good thing.</p>
            <p>In this Perſwaſion I remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned long: And was ſatisfied with the Integrity of my own Mind, notwithſtanding the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquy which attended my Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. Nay, it was alſo ſome
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:34981:4"/>
further Delight to me (who am not fond of our ordinary Diſtinctions of Sects) that I had found a Name, however miſtaken by others, which I could ſincerely and heartily own. And I thereupon ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, jeſtingly, compared my Pleaſure in this, to that of the Citizen in the Comedy, who was over-joyed to learn that he had all his life been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to ſpeak <hi>Proſe,</hi> tho' without knowing it: Which Compariſon I thought the more juſt, becauſe true <hi>Deiſm</hi> is in effect as natural and eaſie to Mankind as <hi>Proſe,</hi> or ordinary Speech. For it is impoſſible for us to reflect upon our ſelves, and upon all the Objects that ſurround us, without admiring
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:34981:4"/>
and adoring the Almighty Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor both of them and us. And as I had indeed been long a <hi>Deiſt,</hi> before I was acquainted with the Name; So I conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued for ſeveral Years after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, to cultivate the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of that Principle, in my own Mind, and to inculcate occaſionally the Neceſſity of it to others; Fully perſwaded that it was the only Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, upon which either the true Happineſs of particular Perſons, or any tolerable Degree of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Security in the Conduct of Publick Societies, could be eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>But, Alas, how have I been miſtaken! Is <hi>Deiſm</hi> an ill thing? Or have Ill Men ſhrowded themſelves under that Specious
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:34981:5"/>
Name? Somewhat is in the Matter. For the Out-cry againſt <hi>Deiſts</hi> is now grown ſo ſtrong, that no body can ſuppoſe it to be wholly without ground. I beſeech you therefore, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, give me leave to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulate a little with you; That we may come to ſome clearneſs in the point, and be thereby inabled to vindicate our ſelves from the infamous Aſperſions that are caſt upon us. You ſee that I reckon my ſelf in your Number: And if you are true <hi>Deiſts,</hi> I aſſure you we are Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. Let that Conſideration, therefore, prevail with you to bear with me, whilſt I require, and earneſtly ſollicit you, to aſſiſt me in the Defence of our Common Cauſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:34981:5"/>
This, then, being the Deſign of my Letter, it is abſolutely needful that, in the firſt place, we come to a Scrutiny amongſt our ſelves; And examine ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what it is we mean by the Name; And whether or no we do indeed own the Things that are imputed to us. The word, <hi>Deiſt,</hi> I take to ſignifie no more than One that believes a God; And <hi>Deiſm</hi> the Religion of One that ſo believes. Thoſe words, I am ſure, in their natural ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, do not exclude any other Belief, unleſs it be oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to, or inconſiſtent with this. My Belief that there is a God does not hinder me from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving any other thing, that is not apparently contradictory to the Idea that I have enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:34981:6"/>
of him. If I have not a clear Demonſtration, from that Idea, of the impoſſibility of any thing propoſed to my Belief, I may, and ought to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the probability of that thing (eſpecially if it be Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact) by the Credibility of the Witneſſes that report it. And ſo, in the Hiſtories that we have of the Life of <hi>Moſes,</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> of <hi>Apollonius,</hi> or of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> I may give more or leſs Credit to any of them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the different ſtrength of their Teſtimonials. A <hi>Deiſt</hi> (for any thing that the word imports) may be either Jew or Chriſtian, Philoſopher or Turk; Nay, indeed, all Religioniſts whatſoever muſt neceſſarily be <hi>Deiſts.</hi> Never any Appellation
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:34981:6"/>
was invented more truly Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick. Only <hi>Atheiſts</hi> are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from it.</p>
            <p>How comes it then to paſs that a Word of, ſo great a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, is uſed in ſo narrow a ſence, as to ſignifie a very ſmall number of thoſe that have equal right to it? Nay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to ſignifie thoſe that have no ſuch Right at all? That it is thus uſed, we cannot doubt: Daily Converſation aſſures us of it. The Reaſon of this Abuſe, muſt of neceſſity come, either from thoſe that have aſſumed, or thoſe that have impoſed the Name. Nay, by the beſt obſervation I have been able to make, it ſeems to me that both ſides have contributed hereunto; by fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:34981:7"/>
ſomething Negative to the Signification of the Word, which it does not import. Thoſe that impoſe it, do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by at leaſt underſtand a Denial of the Grounds of Revealed Religion; In which indeed they ſtretch the Word too far: But whilſt ſome of thoſe that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume it, do at the ſame time deny the very Principles of Natural Religion alſo, They plainly abuſe and pervert it, directly contrary to what it ſignifies; And uſurp a Title that no ways belongs to them. For tho' the Belief of a God do not neceſſarily imply the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of Supernatural Revelation; (many having acknowledged a Supream Being, infinitely Wiſe and Powerful and Good, who
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:34981:7"/>
have been altogether unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with any Manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Will, otherwiſe than by the Uſe of their own Faculties in the contemplation of his Works) Yet it does ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily carry along with it a Reverential ſenſe of Duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him: Which is the ground of Natural Religion. And, therefore, tho' the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial of Revelation do not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly make Men <hi>Deiſts,</hi> in the ſtrict ſence of the Word; Yet the total want of Natural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion does abſolutely hinder them from being <hi>Deiſts,</hi> in any ſence whatſoever. Let us then, who inſiſt upon a Right to that Title, in the firſt place diſcard thoſe who are wholly deſtitute of this ſenſe, from our Frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:34981:8"/>
And let us afterwards conſider, as we are able, what our Fundamental Article, (the Belief of a Deity) does, or does not, oblige us to.</p>
            <p>It is not ſimply the word, <hi>God,</hi> but the Idea fixed to that Word, which is capable of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any Influence, either upon Men's Minds or Converſations. And it is not impoſſible, but ſome Ideas of a Deity may have a worſe Influence upon them than none at all. Wherefore it highly imports us to obſerve, whether ſome Perſons, that own the Name, do not yet take away the thing; Or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps even ſubſtitute a worſe in the ſtead of it. Thoſe that ſay directly there is no God, are not <hi>Deiſts,</hi> but <hi>Atheiſts.</hi> It is
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:34981:8"/>
neither of ſuch, nor to ſuch, that I write. For in theſe Parts of the World, the Notion of a Deity is ſo univerſally ſpread and received, that no man dares own the open Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of down-right <hi>Atheiſm.</hi> So that this ſort of Men (if perhaps there are any few ſuch) are the leſs dangerous. But thoſe that retaining the uſual Word, endeavour ſlily to infinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate a Corrupt ſence of it, ought ſo much the more carefully to be watched, by how much the more their Title and Outſide is leſs apt to give any ſuſpicion of their Deſign.</p>
            <p>My Intention yet is not to inquire into all the ſeveral ſorts of Gods that theſe Men frame to themſelves. It has been done
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:34981:9"/>
in a great meaſure by others; And the inconſiſtency of their Notions very accurately expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. To do it thorowly were an endleſs Task: For I much doubt, whether any two of them agree intirely in any one Syſtem. But if, in purſuing ſome of their Principal Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſes, I ſhew the miſchievous influence that all ſuch like Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions muſt needs have upon the whole State of Mankind, in this World; I hope I ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade you, Gentlemen, my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, who are true <hi>Deiſts,</hi> to concurr with me in owning your deteſtation of ſuch perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Principles.</p>
            <p>Which of them ſhall I then chuſe? It is very indifferent. For all their ſeveral Schemes
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:34981:9"/>
do equally lead to Irreligion; And conſequently to the utter ruin of Humane Societies. Some Men, becauſe Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> rel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed not the ſound of Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Subſtances (without ever conſidering whether they are able to frame to themſelves any more diſtinct conception of the ſubſtance of Matter) fear not, upon his Authority, to ridicule the Notion of Spirit. Theſe, without trying their Skill upon particulars, reſolve in general the Structure of the whole Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, and of all the Animate Beings which repleniſh it, into the unexplicable Powers of Matter and Motion. Let it be ſo. For I enter not into the Abſurdity of their Philoſophy, which has been ſufficiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:34981:10"/>
by others. I will only conſider ſome Conſequences of it, with reſpect to our ſelves. If there be nothing but Matter in the World; Then Thought is either a Property neceſſarily belonging to, and inherent in Matter; Or the Reſult of ſome particular Figure and Motion impreſs'd upon it. The firſt they will not ſay: Becauſe the Parings of their own Nails convince them it is falſe. But the ſecond, for any thing they know, may be: And therefore they ſay it is. I paſs over alſo this precarious <hi>May be,</hi> which others have fully demonſtrated <hi>cannot be:</hi> And admitting their Concluſion, That it is; <hi>(viz.</hi> That the Principle of Wiſdom which diſcovers it-ſelf in the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:34981:10"/>
Frame and Government of the Univerſe, is only an Effect of the Poſition and Motion of its Parts) Then, however, I ſay, amongſt infinite other Abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, they muſt allow that this Principle, this Effect, this God (as they would call it) muſt be liable to all the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that happen in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Maſs of Matter. For if it conſiſt only in ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Syſtem, that can receive no impreſſion from the reſt; Then neither can it make any impreſſion upon the reſt: And ſo there is an End of all its Energy. But if they will ſay that Matter moves always uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly, and that therefore the Wiſdom of their God is ſtable; I anſwer, that the uniform Mo-Motion
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:34981:11"/>
of the Particles of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is either (in empty ſpace) an Eternal Progreſſion of ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Particles in ſtraight lines; The ſuppoſition of which, is the ſame thing, in reſpect of the Energy of every Particle, as I have even now expreſs'd concerning a particular Syſtem remov'd from any Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation with the reſt: Or elſe, (in a mixture of ſeveral Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles) it is a regular Impulſe of one Particle upon another, according to Bulk, Figure, Swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Incidence; Which, beſides that it gives us no Idea of any poſſibility of Thought reſulting from ſuch Variety of Figures and Motions; Yet if we ſhould allow that ſome pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Hit, in an infinite Variety

of ſuch Modifications, might produce it, together with Knowledge and Wiſdom in the higheſt Degree; Nevertheleſs, we muſt of neceſſity allow that every Variation of that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Modification which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces them, muſt not only di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb but utterly deſtroy them. So that all the poſſible Variety of Figure and Motion that we can conceive in Matter, ſhews us either an impoſſibility of any thing like Thought reſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from it, or at leaſt a Neceſſity of the Inconſtancy and Changeableneſs of that Thought, with every change in the Matter which produces it. And thus every way that we can turn the Notion of a Material God, if we do (in
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:34981:12"/>
fiance of all ſence) allow him Exiſtence; Yet we can not avoid to acknowledge him ſubject to Diſturbances, Diſeaſes, Paſſions, and all manner of Alterations that are incident to Matter, and altogether unſuitable to the Perfections which we muſt of neceſſity attribute to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Deity.</p>
            <p>This then is the God which theſe Men frame to themſelves. At leaſt, this is the Idea of the God that reſults from their Hypotheſis, whether they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe him ſo or no. A Worthy God indeed! Not the Creator or Diſpoſer of this Univerſal Frame of things, but the Effect of ſome Peculiar Diſpoſition in it; Poſterior to Matter, and liable (if not to Extinction) at
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:34981:12"/>
leaſt to Inconſtancy, Fluctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Change. If this be He, no wonder if they bear little Reſpect to him. A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent and tranſitory thing: To which whilſt they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to give ſome Solidity, by drawing him out of lumpiſh Matter, they are forced ſo to volatilize their own Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that they deſtroy the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Idea which they pretend to give of him.</p>
            <p>But before we contemplate the Conſequences of this Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis, let us conſider Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And becauſe This plainly takes away the thing that it pretends to conſtitute, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a fundamental Cauſe, puts us off with a very tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitory Effect, let us ſet before
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:34981:13"/>
our Eyes One Omnipotent Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Cauſe of all things. For ſuch an Idea ſome Men are apt to give of God. Without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining any thing about his Subſtance, whether Material or Immaterial; They ſuppoſe it ſuitable to the perfection of his Nature, that (in the firſt Conſtitution of the Univerſe) he ſhould have impreſſed ſuch an Energy into the Texture and Frame of it, as is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for ever afterwards to continue all the Appearances of things; that we are or are not acquainted withal, without his intermeddling or interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing any more in the Produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, Guidance or Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any thing whatſoever. It is (at leaſt) below his Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:34981:13"/>
ſay they, to concern himſelf in the vain Tumults of Mankind, and to co-operate either with or againſt any of our Projects, by his immediate Influx. His buſineſs, if it be any, is about higher things; far remote from our Cognizance. We are pitiful Engines, moved any way by the Impreſſions made upon our Senſes, by things without us; And ſo neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated to whatſoever we do, by the fatal Chain of Cauſes in which he at firſt linked the whole Univerſe.</p>
            <p>I pretend not, in theſe two particulars, to give any exact Syſtem of the Opinions of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Philoſophers. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitous jumblings of <hi>Democri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tean</hi> Atomes, The Idle Deity
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:34981:14"/>
of the <hi>Epicureans,</hi> And the fatal Neceſſity of the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> are not the Subject of my En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry. But a mixture of ſuch Thoughts as theſe, I am ſure, fill the Heads of many who now call themſelves <hi>Deiſts,</hi> and make too ordinary a Subject of Modern Converſation. And it is upon the Benefit of this Age, and of my own Country (if I might be able in the leaſt Degree to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute towards it) that my Thoughts are now intent.</p>
            <p>To theſe, therefore, I will add yet another Opinion; that has great Affinity with them. Some Men, without troubling themſelves in any manner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Notion of a Deity, and conſidering only how evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:34981:14"/>
our Thoughts depend upon the Diſpoſition of the Organs of our Body (becauſe we ſee the Diſorders that oft ariſe in our Minds, from the Affections to which they are incident) are apt boldly to conclude, and maintain, that an abſolute Diſſolution of this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganical Texture, (which all Men are ſubject to in Death) muſt of neceſſity extinguiſh the Principle of Thought that we have now in us, and leave no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing capable of any Conſcious Reflections upon our preceeding Life.</p>
            <p>I have ſaid already that I intended not to meddle with the Philoſophical Abſurdity of any of theſe Opinions. They have, I think, been ſufficiently
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:34981:15"/>
refuted by others. My Buſineſs now is to conſider the Moral Influence that they are apt to have upon Men's Lives, and upon Societies; And to intreat you, Gentlemen, to conſider how unworthy a thing it is that the Glorious Name of <hi>Deiſm</hi> ſhould be ſtained with ſuch abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Conſequences.</p>

            <p>But let us, I beſeech you, Gentlemen, that are <hi>Deiſts</hi> in reality, and not in Name only, examine the reality of theſe
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:34981:21"/>
Pretenſions. If there be a God, an intelligent Being, infinitely Powerful, and Wiſe, and Good, (all which he muſt of neceſſity be, if he be at all) I ſay, if there be ſuch a God, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that theſe Affirmations or Inferences (of theſe pretended Deiſts) can be true. The Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of ſuch a God, and thoſe conſequences of Love and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and Duty, which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally ariſe from that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, can by no means be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignificant, and much leſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to his Creatures.</p>
            <p>If Humane Laws alone are ſufficient for the Weal of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in Societies, then it is true that any thing further is ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous and impertinent, with reſpect to that End. But are
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:34981:21"/>
they indeed ſo? I deſire the Aſſertors of that Poſition, to give me ſome Inſtance of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or conſiderable Body of People, ſince the World began, that ever formed themſelves into a Society, and liv'd in any Degree, (I will not ſay of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, but) even of ſuch Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery as we can count tolerable; Who, at the ſame time, denied abſolutely the Exiſtence of a powerful Being, preſiding over the Univerſe by his Providence here; And thought themſelves perfectly ſecure againſt all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being call'd to account by him hereafter. When they have done that, they will have ſome ſeeming ground for their Aſſertion: But if that can not be done, the Authority of all
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:34981:22"/>
Nations, in all Ages, will be ſo ſtrong a Prejudice againſt it, as others will not eaſily overcome; And (if they have any Degree of Modeſty) ought to make them forbear inſiſting upon it.</p>
            <p>But (that I may not ſeem captiouſly to put them upon an inſuperable Difficulty) if they can not find a Nation of abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Atheiſts, let them examine the condition of thoſe that come neareſt to it. Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical, thinking Men are too thin ſown in the World, for us to expect to find any Number of them, that, upon examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Argument, deliberately concluded there is no God, and inſtituted a Form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment amongſt themſelves upon
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:34981:22"/>
that Principle. We muſt be content therefore to conſider the condition of thoſe People, not that deny a God, but that are ignorant of one. And of them we have many Inſtances: Whether perfect or no, is not worth enquiring, but certainly to a very great Degree. <hi>Africa</hi> and <hi>America</hi> abound with them. I will not trouble you with the Relations of Travellers, of this kind, which are in ever body's hands. But I deſire you, upon the view of all or any of thoſe Relations, to examine whether the Brutality of thoſe Nations do not hold exact proportion with the Degrees of their Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religion.

They therefore are reduced to the Condition of Beaſts of Prey: But yet much morſe than them too; Becauſe Nature has not provided Men with any ſuch competent Defence againſt the Injuries of the Air as are the Skins of Bears and Lions; Nor with ſuch Arms as are their Teeth and Claws. Which, by the way, is a manifeſt proof that Nature never intended Men for that kind of Life: For we find unexceptionably throughout all the Species of Animals, that every one is by Nature provided with Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, or Inſtruments, directly ſuited to that kind of Prey which Nature deſigned for
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:34981:24"/>
their ſupport. But naked Man, unaſſiſted with Tools, (which are the Products of Arts and Society) is the worſt provided of them all.</p>
            <p>It may indeed be ſaid, that inſtead of theſe, we have hands, wherewith we can employ eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing that we find about us, to our purpoſe; And a Genius capable to improve all things to our beſt Advantage. 'Tis true. But the ſame Capacity inables us alſo, at the ſame time, to do ſo much the more Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief. And this is the moſt deplorable Circumſtance of all, in the ſtate of thoſe Savages; who having neither any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Government amongſt them here, nor ſenſe of a Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intending Deity, with expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:34981:24"/>
of Rewards or Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments hereafter, can have no other Rule of their private Conduct, than the preſent Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe of every unruly Appetite. By this means (I ſay) it comes to paſs, that, as the Capacity of their Mind is greater than that of Bears, their condition alſo comes to be ſo much the more miſerable. For admitting that a Bear or a Lion were leſs fitted by Nature for procuring the Prey that they ſtand in need of, than is one of theſe Unaſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated Savages; Yet it muſt (in the firſt place) be acknowledged that they are leſs expoſed to be preyed upon themſelves. They reign Soveraigns over the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Herds of Animals, in the Countries where they inhabit;

            <p>This is the plain Matter of Fact. There is no inſtance to be found, from the beginning of the World to this day, of any People wholly void of all
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:34981:26"/>
ſenſe of Religion, whoſe way of living did not expoſe them to more Miſeries than even the Beaſts of the Field or Foreſt. But it will be ſaid, this is for want of Government: Good Laws would have made their Condition more happy. I grant it, in ſome Degree. But then I deſire the Objectors to ſhew me an inſtance of any Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, inſtituted and eſtabliſhed by good Laws, without a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ſome Religion in it. They can not do it. We have ſeen the Opinion of <hi>Cicero</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready upon that Point. I will here add that of <note n="*" place="bottom">

that a Government could either be framed or ſupported without the Belief of a Deity.</hi> Thus, the Effect it-ſelf proves that Mankind is uncapable of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, without Religion.

            <p>Nay, further yet; If enquiry were made into all particular Hiſtories of the World, and eſpecially into all Religions, I do not doubt but it would be found that the more or leſs eaſie

And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, without pretending to define for any body elſe, I think my ſelf obliged (in this place) to explain what I my ſelf under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by both. <hi>True Religion</hi> I take to be an Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Deity (infinitely Powerful, Wiſe, and Good) ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintending the Actions of Mankind, in order to retribute unto every one, either here or hereafter, according to their Doing; Together with the Senſe of an Obligation to all our Duties both to God and our Neighbour, reſulting from that Belief. <hi>Superſtition,</hi> on the other ſide, is an Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Dread of God's ſuper-intending
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:34981:28"/>
Power; Accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with a wrong Opinion of the Ways of pleaſing him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting from falſe Ideas, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitable to his forementioned Perfections. And let me here add, that <hi>Irreligion</hi> I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand to be an utter inſenſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of any Obligation or Duty ariſing from the Idea of a God; Or perhaps (according as the Idol may be framed which they ſet up inſtead of the Idea of the true God) a poſitive per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion that no ſuch Obligation at all can ariſe. Now I muſt needs ſay that, ſo far as I have had opportunity of obſerving, I have always found that the more any People have had of True Religion, with leſs mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Superſtition, they have
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:34981:28"/>
always formed themſelves unto ſo much more orderly Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and lived ſo much the more comfortably. So that I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, whoever takes the pains to examine, will find that the Rule holds true throughout, in exact Proportion.</p>
            <p>But leaving now this Appeal to Hiſtory, to every one's Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination and Judgment; I am deſirous to weigh a little the Reaſon of the thing it-ſelf. Let us inſpect the Nature of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind as it is, and ſee what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability there is that any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Number of Men, (A Nation, as <hi>England,</hi> for Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) wholly void of all ſenſe of Religion, ſhould be able to eſtabliſh and maintain ſuch Laws and Methods of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:34981:29"/>
amongſt themſelves, as could give them any tolerable Degree of mutual Security, Peace and Happineſs. In the firſt place, I am apt to think it very difficult, if not impoſſible, that ſuch a People ſhould ever agree upon any Terms at all. The Natural Impetuoſity of their Paſſions, muſt needs make them very untractable. It can not be ſuppoſed that thoſe who found their Advantage over others, in ſtrength of Body, would eaſily ſubmit their Necks to the Yoke of Laws. They would find themſelves ſecure and eaſie in that natural Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority, and always endeavour to maintain it: So that it would, at leaſt, be very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to bring them to any
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:34981:29"/>
Terms of Compoſition with their Inferiours.</p>
            <p>But let the thing be never ſo difficult, if it be but poſſible, I am willing to admit it. We may imagine that a Combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a great Number of weaker Perſons may have been able to force a leſs Number of thoſe that are ſtronger into a Compliance: From whence ſomething like a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth might in the end reſult. Therefore, without more ado, let us ſuppoſe a <hi>Solon,</hi> a <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curgus,</hi> or a <hi>Numa,</hi> ſprung out of the Earth, to give this Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the moſt excellent Form of Government imaginable. The Suppoſition, indeed, is abſurd; Becauſe thoſe wiſe Legiſlators, all of them, did interweave
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:34981:30"/>
Religion with their Politicks: And I want the Name of any Legiſlator that ever did other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. But ſuppoſing, any way, an Excellent Form contrived: Let Chance, if they pleaſe, the <hi>Epicurean</hi> God, be the Author of it: Where ſhall we find fit Magiſtrates to put this Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Contrivance in Execution? It will not be ſuppoſed that every particular Member of this Society will be ſo exactly Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, as to need no Inſpection into their Actions. That is too contrary to all Experience; And would be occaſion of diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Government it ſelf, as frivolous and uſeleſs. We muſt therefore look out for Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators, to deliberate in Ten thouſand Exigencies that will
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:34981:30"/>
ariſe from without, (tho' we ſhould imagine our Frame ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo perfect within) what Methods may be moſt condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive to our Common Defence and Publick Welfare. We muſt have Judges too, undoubtedly, to determine impartially the differences that may happen between Man and Man. And (to cut ſhort) we muſt have Officers of all kinds, both Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and Military, to execute faithfully and carefully what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is reſolved upon by theſe Senators and Judges: Amongſt which ſort of Buſineſs, the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Publick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue is neither the leaſt nor eaſieſt Task.</p>
            <p>For theſe things, we muſt of neceſſity have Men of Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity.
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:34981:31"/>
Any failure in That, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets Inconveniencies: And the total want of it brings on in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable Ruin. For nothing can be done, great or ſmall, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Truſt: And the Breach of Truſt is always miſchievous to the thing in which it happens. For Example; What can hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der but a Senator that delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates upon the weighty Affairs of War or Peace with Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Princes, may have Overtures made to him of more conſiderable Advantage from ſome ſuch Prince, than he can receive in his own Country; And may thereupon, without any Danger of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, reveal and betray the Secrets of a State? What can hinder but a Judge, biaſſed by
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:34981:31"/>
Affection, or bribed by Intereſt, may, in many Caſes, ſo order the Circumſtances of things (at leaſt the Methods of his own Proceedings) as to condemn the Innocent, abſolve the Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and diſpoſe of the Property of Goods or Land contrary to all Right and Equity; And yet cover his Corruption with a very ſpecious Appearance of Juſtice? What can hinder but a Commander of Fleets or Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, by Debauchery growing Supine, or by Covetouſneſs growing intent only on Profit, may ſacrifice the Publick to his Luxury or Gain? And what can hinder, in the laſt place, (for 'twould be too tedious to go through all particulars) but Publick Receivers, Treaſurers,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:34981:32"/>
and the like, may, by Conſent and Intelligence with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, falſifie Accounts, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert great Branches of the Common Income into their own private Pockets; without any poſſibility of being dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted? Without Integrity in the management of theſe, and ſuch like affairs, all muſt needs go wrong; and Ruin follow.</p>
            <p>But I doubt my Reader is tired with theſe Inſtances; And thinks them frivolous in the particular Caſe that I now exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine; Becauſe they are ſo very frequent, as every Day's Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience tells us, in all Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments whatſoever. Are they ſo, indeed? Then let that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment where they are moſt prevalent, know that it is nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:34981:32"/>
to utter Deſtruction. For no body can doubt but where the principal and ruling Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of a Body (either Civil or Natural) are perverted, and made to operate contrary to the Intereſt of the whole, That Whole is in a very deſperate condition. Let the Application be made where it will.</p>
            <p>And if we may look a little home to our own Caſe; it muſt be acknowledged that we have amongſt us too many Inſtances of ſuch like Miſcarriages as I have repreſented. What is the Reaſon of it? Is it the too deep ſenſe and Awe of an All-ſeeing Deity that cauſes this want of Integrity, and makes Men not fear to tranſgreſs the Ties of any Duty, whereſoever they can
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:34981:33"/>
be ſecure, that He alone is Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Actions? This cannot be pretended: Both Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience and Reaſon contradict it. The Men I write of, and the ſpreading progreſs of their Principles, are too apparent Proofs that we are not at this time in ſuch like Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. But if, abſtracting from our own Caſe, we reflect only upon the Miſchiefs that attend Bigottry, and wrong Notions about Religion, I readily own them to be very great. For not only, ſome of thoſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes may be apt to make Men preſume upon an eaſie way of attoning an offended Deity, by Ceremonious or Devotional Tricks, and therefore leſs fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of the Conſequences of each
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:34981:33"/>
ſingle Tranſgreſſion; But Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition (generally ſpeaking) has often been, and will be, the occaſion of very general Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs and Outrages in the World; Tho' this eſpecially, when it is managed by the cunning of lawleſs, and deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing irreligious Men in Power. So that Irreligion is, very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, the ground even of thoſe Diſorders which Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition produces. For without that, the miſtaken Notions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a Deity, will ſerve indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent well to preſerve Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and maintain Government, amongſt thoſe of this or that particular way. The Fear and Dread (at leaſt) of Inviſible Powers will not make Men more bold in the Contempt of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:34981:34"/>
thoſe Powers, than they would be without it. But the total Abſence of that Fear (which is Irreligion) diſſolves intirely the Ties of Conſcience, which are the ſtrongeſt Bonds of Society, and thereby turns Men looſe from the Reſtraint and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Laws, into all the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders of unreſtrained Fraud and Rapine.</p>
            <p>Let us return therefore to our general Enquiry. We have ſuppoſed that a Nation, wholly void of all Senſe of Religion, may, peradventure, hit upon the moſt excellent Form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Laws imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: And now in looking after fit Magiſtrates, to put theſe Rules and Laws in Execution, we have ſeen in ſome meaſure
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:34981:34"/>
what kind of Officers are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and what ſort of Fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lures thoſe Officers are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to. In ſhort, whatever other Virtues may be uſeful, in the Diſcharge of thoſe Truſts; That, without which all the reſt would become not only uſeleſs, but hurtful, is Integrity. A Man that has not a Principle known and acknowledged by others to be capable of <hi>influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encing him in the</hi>

               <hi>Dark,</hi> is not fit to be intruſted with any thing capable of being hid from Witneſſes: That is, in plain Terms, not with any thing at all, of Moment. For through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the parts of the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of any Government,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:34981:35"/>
there occur frequent Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of perverting the Ends of it, ſecretly, to evil purpoſes. Now what ſecurity can that Man, who makes open Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Principles of Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, give unto the Publick, of his Fidelity in any Truſt, where there is a poſſibility of perverting the Ends of it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Diſcovery? An Oath is the moſt uſual and higheſt Pledge of this kind, that Mankind are yet acquainted withall. But will this Man, who proclaims his Disbelief of the Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of a Deity, pretend to deſerve any Degree of Credit upon account of his atteſting a Name, <hi>(God)</hi> which in his Mouth is an empty Sound, without any ſignification? It
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:34981:35"/>
would be ridiculous either for him to offer himſelf, or for a Government to receive him, to the Solemnity of an Oath. Thus he makes himſelf an uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Member of the Society he is in: And if the whole Society entertained the ſame Principles, it muſt unavoidably diſſolve and fall into Confuſion. For, let us examine further; What is it that can influence any Man in ſecure Secrecy? Honour, and Shame, and Humane Laws of any kind, have there no place: Becauſe no body ſees. Only Intereſt ſticks cloſe to every Man, every where. Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is advantageous, or any way delightful to any one, ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates conſtantly upon every one; And (when nothing inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venes
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:34981:36"/>
to check it) irreſiſtibly. Thus then, a Man ſecure of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Secrecy from all other Men, and having no Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of any Inviſible Being ſuper-intending him, muſt of neceſſity purſue his own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Satisfaction. Natural Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, and preſent Intereſt, prompt him to it: No Proſpect of any Repugnant Intereſt, at a Diſtance, makes him heſitate: No inward ſenſe of Law or Duty reſtrains him: (For what can be called either Law or Duty, where no Superiour animadverts with Puniſhment; Nor does any Natural Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, as a Reward, attend the Action it-ſelf?) Nothing from without interpoſes: (For all Humane Animadverſion is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded:)
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:34981:36"/>
He muſt therefore pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue it: He can do no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. At leaſt, if in thoſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances he neglect to do it; He in that acts not only <note n="*" place="bottom">Nullum eſt jus naturale. Ita<expan>

I ſay again, Integrity: For that
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:34981:37"/>
is the Virtue that I lay the ſtreſs upon. The Neglect, the Fraud, the Corruption, the Treachery, that any where run through all the courſe of a miſ-mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged State, proceed evidently, from want of Integrity. And the Conſequence of that is ſo fatal, that neither Courage nor Skill can bear up under it. Where no body, or but very few, make Conſcience of their Ways; Where a ſuperficial ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſhew is all that is endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured after towards the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, whilſt Private Int'reſt (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>check't by any inward Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe) is the Private Meaſure of every Man's Conduct; What can follow but utter Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction? It is apparent that every where, by the ſame Degrees
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:34981:37"/>
that a ſenſe of the Eſſential Grounds of Religion decay, Men's Virtue vaniſhes, their Morals corrupt, their very Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures degenerate, and their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment tends inevitably to Diſſolution.</p>
            <p>If this Decay of Religion (miſtake me not, I do not mean blind Devotion, or ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Ceremony, but) if the little ſenſe of the Super-inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of a Deity, which is the general ground of all Religion, be not the occaſion of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay of Integrity, I deſire any one to ſhew me what is. Or rather, if the Cauſe of this Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect be too perplex't or hidden, I deſire them to ſhew me what is capable of curing it. That would be a Work worthy not
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:34981:38"/>
only of a true Patriot, but of a Genuine Citizen of the World. Let any one that goes about it, examine the Principles of Humane Nature, and (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving that ſenſe of Religion which I require) tell me what Notion, what Thing it is, that can be of Force enough to ſway all Mankind, in abſolutely ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure Privacy, to deny them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the enjoyment of any offered Satisfaction. Good Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the Love of our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, is the plauſibleſt Offer towards it that I can imagine. Some few, perhaps, having been educated from their Inſancy in good-natur'd Principles, may find ſuch an habitual force of that Love in their own Breaſts as may ſeem natural to them.

But if they will ſay thoſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples have the ſame Strength in all Men, they deny manifeſt Experience, and deſerve no An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. The ſavage <hi>Africans</hi> and <hi>Americans,</hi> who have been o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe educated, (Or rather who, for want of Education, would be the only proper In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in our Enquiry,) are undeniable Demonſtrations of the Contrary. And if theſe few Good-natur'd Perſons ſhould go about to deſtroy the Belief of thoſe things which are only capable to maintain the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Mankind in any tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Degree of Happineſs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſubſtituting any thing at all, either more or leſs, in the place of it; What ſhall we ſay of them? Do they not evidently
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:34981:39"/>
contradict the Character they pretend to? Is That Good Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which is charitable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps to ſome few Perſons in diſtreſs, who lie within the narrow Sphere of this or that Man's Acquaintance; And at the ſame time, breaking the only Reins that are capable to reſtrain the ill Nature of others, let looſe the whole Herd of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, to an unbridled freedom of deſtroying and devouring one another? I bluſh to think, that ſo high a Degree of Good Nature, as I have here ſuppoſed ſome may be endowed withall, ſhould be the occaſion of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing ſuch ill-natur'd Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences. What Tyrant, what <hi>Nimrod,</hi> what <hi>Caligula,</hi> did ever the Ten-thouſandth part of
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:34981:39"/>
Miſchief to Mankind, as would be the rooting out of that only Principle which is capable of maintaining any ſure Amity amongſt them? There is no proportion between theſe Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs. Let theſe Pretenders therefore to Good-Nature either be content with that Principle of Religion, which has hitherto produced whatever is to be found of laſting Union and Conſtancy in the Societies of the World; Or let them fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh us with ſomething better inſtead of it; Or let us, at leaſt, beware of their Principles, as the moſt pernicious Venom that could poſſibly be inſtill'd into any Society, even by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Enemies of Mankind.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:34981:40"/>
If now, upon this whole En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, we obſerve, That where ever the Principles of Irreligion are ſpread, in proportion to their increaſe, Integrity has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay'd; How for want of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity the ſtrength of any Conſtitution of State is weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; What a diſorderly and uneaſie Eſtate Men grow into; And what further Confuſion and even Ruin conſtantly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it; I ſay if this be every where obſervable; And we need not go far to be convinc'd of it, even in Countries where the general Principles of Religion (tho' decaying) are not yet quite extinguiſhed; What can we conclude muſt be the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of a People that is wholly, in every particular Member
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:34981:40"/>
and Part, devoid of any ſuch Principle at all? For that is the Suppoſition we are to take along with us: And our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry is, how a People that believe no Super-intendency of an inviſible Power, nor think themſelves accountable (either here or hereafter) to any Judge but the Magiſtrate, can main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain any ſuch order of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment amongſt themſelves, as is capable in any moderate De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to make their Lives Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, Eaſie, and Comfortable. Amongſt this People, it is plain, there can not be one ſingle vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Perſon, that is ſo upon a Principle ſuited to the general Nature of Mankind. And thoſe that are ſo only by ſome pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Excellency of their own
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:34981:41"/>
Natural inclination, not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to others, are not to be taken into Conſideration: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Their number is every where too ſmall to be of any weight. Their perſonal Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications may be what they will, and deſerve very high perſonal Eſteem: But I think nothing can properly be called Social Virtue (which is the thing we now enquire after) that the main Body of a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety is uncapable of having any ſenſe of. I conclude there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that ſuch a People muſt needs be very unfit to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain any Rules of Society with one another. What? Where there is not one honeſt, one virtuous Man in a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; (For I count none ſo, nor
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:34981:41"/>
will any be found ſo at a ſtreſs, that have not a Principle which all Men own to be capable of making them ſo in the Dark; And that I am ſure Thoſe have not, who are utterly void of all Religion) Can, There, be any Conſiſtency or Stability in that Government? Methinks there ſhould not. But, eſpecially, can a Government, amongſt ſuch Men, be more equal, and more ſecure, than amongſt thoſe who act upon a Principle capable (if followed) to make all Men Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous? This is an Abſurdity unſufferable. Yet this the Men that I write of, thoſe that ſay Religion is uſeleſs, and that Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Laws alone ſuffice to maintain Order and Peace and Security in Humane Societies,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:34981:42"/>
This (I ſay) they muſt aſſert; Or elſe acknowledge, that in undermining the Grounds of all Religion, they themſelves act more contrary to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Int'reſt of all Mankind, than any thing that humane Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation can compare them to.</p>
            <p>If, now, I have given any competent Evidence, both from Reaſon and Experience, that Religion is (not only) no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different thing, inſignificant and uſeleſs to the Ends of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; But that (in Effect) it is ſo highly neceſſary and uſeful, that it is impoſſible any Government ſhould ſubſiſt without it; And that whatever Motives may force Men into Societies (Conveniency, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, or whatſoever elſe they
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:34981:42"/>
be) it is only the Belief of a Deity, and the conſequence of that Belief, Religion, that makes a Ciment capable of uniting thoſe Societies in any manner of Stability; (Which, I hope, I have in good meaſure per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed) Then, methinks, I need ſay very little in anſwer to thoſe that pretend Religion is not only uſeleſs, but hurtful. If it be uſeful, as I have proved; It can not be hurtful: For thoſe Terms are contradictory; And cannot be ſaid, in the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, of the ſame thing. Let us examine therefore if in any Reſpect whatſoever, we can find this prejudicial Tendency of Religion to the Int'reſt of Society. <hi>It is apt</hi> (the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors ſay) <hi>to fill Men's Minds
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:34981:43"/>
with Anxieties, Doubts, and Fears; Which debaſe their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, perplex their Thoughts, and render them unfit for Buſineſs.</hi> But whoever conſiders impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, will find that whatſoever there is of Ill, in all theſe Anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Doubts, Fears, Lowneſs of Spirit, and Perplexity of Thoughts, it proceeds wholly from the neglect of Religion, and by no means from the ſtrict Obſervance of the Duties that it requires: And on the other ſide, that whatſoever Confidence, Boldneſs, and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of Mind, ſprings from Atheiſm or Irreligion, it is only a Boldneſs in doing Evil; Which at the higheſt is ſubject to many Qualms; Or, tho' it were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in its kind, That ſurely can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:34981:43"/>
be pleaded by any one in favour of thoſe Principles. But, however, He that diſcharges faithfully the Duties that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent upon him, cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly, in that, have any Anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety at all. His whole Care is <note n="*" place="bottom">Nihil Opinionis causâ, omnia Conſcientia faciam, Populo ſpectante ſieri credam, quicquid me conſcio fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciam.—Patriam meam eſſe Mundum ſciam, &amp; pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Deos ſupra me circa<expan>

and towards Man. There may happen indeed many Occaſions, in the ordinary Courſe of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Affairs, in which this Man may be fearful, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to proceed. But what are thoſe Occaſions? From whence comes this Fear? The Occaſions are, when he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by Unreaſonable and Tyrannical Superiours, to be the Inſtrument of Violence and Wrong. In thoſe Occaſions, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, he fears: He fears to offend God: And therefore he heſitates; draws back; and is altogether unfit for this ſort of Buſineſs. But imploy him in any thing that makes for the true Welfare of his Country; (and much more, if for the Welfare of Mankind) And ſee
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:34981:44"/>
with what Reſolution and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trepidity he will face the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers of it. No Lion more bold than He, in a Righteous Cauſe. Or if yet it ſhould be objected, that Lowneſs of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, Meekneſs, and Humility, which are the Conſequences of a Religious Temper, are too contrary to this Martial Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage that I now hint at; Then however I reply: So much the rather let us ſtudy to improve that Temper. What will be the Effect of it; ſuppoſe the whole World ſhould become thus religious? No body would injure, no body would hurt one another: We ſhould all live together, as Brethren, in Peace and Friendſhip. And what's the Harm? Is it for fear
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:34981:45"/>
of this Miſchief, that Men en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to deſtroy the Seeds, and extirpate the Roots of all Religion? God forbid.</p>
            <p>Another Objection againſt Religion (the laſt that I inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated before, and all of any moment that I can yet think of) <hi>is, That the Dread of an Avenging Deity inclines Men to Superſtition:</hi> And Superſtition, of ſome Kinds and in ſome De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, I have allowed may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce as ill, or even worſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences than abſolute Irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. How ſhall we anſwer this? Very eaſily. The Root of Superſtition lies in the falſe Ideas that Men frame to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of God: Not in the true ones. Thoſe that conſider his Power, may indeed think it
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:34981:45"/>
reaſonable to fear him: But thoſe that conſider alſo his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Goodneſs, muſt of neceſſity love him. From the mixture of theſe two Effects, proceed Reſpect, Reverence, and Adoration. And when the grounds of all (infinite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Goodneſs, and Power) are ſtedfaſtly kept in mind, it is impoſſible that thoſe who are deeply penetrated with that ſenſe, can condeſcend to any way of expreſſing it (which is outward Worſhip) unſuitable to his Excellencies; And much leſs, to any Practice towards their Neighbours (wherein lies the danger of Society) directly contrary to his Laws. Thus, true Religion ſecures all. It is falſe Religion only that breeds
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:34981:46"/>
any Danger. And even that Danger too, tho' it may be very great in ſome particular Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, yet it does not oft extend it ſelf (as Irreligion) to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpating and utter Ruin of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, in the Nations of the World. I have hinted already at the dreadfulleſt Effects of Superſtition that I could think of: Humane Sacrifices, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution. 'Tis the laſt of theſe that, in this Age of the World, it moſt concerns us to enquire into: And I am far from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about to extenuate the Hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſneſs of that Practice. But yet I think I may truly ſay, that the Root of Perſecution does not lie very much in bare Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition. Take away the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t'reſt, I mean the worldly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t'reſt,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:34981:46"/>
that Irreligious Men have in perſecuting others; Let not thoſe Incendiaries blow up the Zeal of Bigots into a Flame, againſt thoſe that differ from them either in Opinion or Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, and their Heats will be tempered without coming to Fire and Faggot. Superſtition alone, if ill-natur'd irreligious Int'reſt were not interwoven with it, would no more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb the Peace of Societies, at this Day, than it did in the Days of Ancient Paganiſm. Not at all. That is too obvious to need any further Illuſtration. But take it at the worſt; That Superſtition is the ſole Cauſe of Perſecution, and of all the Miſchiefs attending it: What is the Cure of this Evil? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:34981:47"/>
not to root up the Grounds of all Religion; But to cultivate the true ones.</p>
            <p>If therefore it ſhould be found that any Set of Men, even tho' they were Prieſts, (of whatſoever Form) induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly applied themſelves to delude Mankind, with Notions ſuitable to their own particular Int'reſt; but contrary to the general Welfare of Societies; Let thoſe that have the Talent declaim againſt their Villainy, expoſe their Hypocriſie, and by all imaginable Arts render thoſe that are guilty as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, ignominious, and even odious in the Eyes of the World, as ſuch combined Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Mankind deſerve to be. In this, my Heart, and Hand
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:34981:47"/>
too (if it were able) ſhould go along with them. Only let no body involve the Innocent with the Guilty. In that, there ought to be great ſcrupuloſity, and exact Care. For ſuch Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions are hainous Immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralities. But, within this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction, of not involving the Innocent with the Guilty; No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be too ſtrong, nor too ſevere, againſt ſuch Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines and Practices as tend to the Corruption of Men's Minds, the Inſlaving of their Perſons, and the Ruin of Societies. And when I allow this Liberty, in theſe Bounds; I not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine it ſtrictly to theſe Bounds, but extend it indifferently to whatſoever exceeds them. And, that no body may miſtake my
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:34981:48"/>
meaning, I further add, in the firſt place, that (conſidering the Frailty of Humane Nature, and the Shortneſs of our Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties) it ſeems to me highly rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, that All manner of Opinions, even tho' Miſtakes, about Religion, which ſpring from Weakneſs, Tenderneſs, and Simplicity of Heart, and have nothing in them of that Evil Tendency which I have now hinted at, ſhould be indulged and treated with all the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs imaginable. For what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable Right can any one have, to treat thoſe otherwiſe, who are really within the Bounds of this Reſtriction? None at all. And, in the next place, I would have our No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal Deiſts (on the other
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:34981:48"/>
ſide) underſtand, that whilſt they continue to undermine the Grounds of all Religion, They themſelves deſerve all that Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity, which they will think I have with Juſtice allowed them againſt the Perverters of the True; And which they are always ready to take, even in too great a Latitude.</p>
            <p>I think I have now ſuccinctly anſwered the Subſtance of all that is moſt commonly, and moſt plauſibly, objected againſt Religion in general; And may from hence conclude, that the Ideas we entertain of a Deity (and which, if we allow the uſe of our Reaſon, every thing will inforce upon us) are no indifferent thing, even to the Welfare of Mankind in this
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:34981:49"/>
World. A God that either does not, or can not, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in our Concerns, is to us an Empty Name, and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies nothing. And without the Belief of an interpoſing or animadverting God, it is impoſſible that any Model of Government can be ſupported. This the wiſe <hi>Athenians</hi> were ſo ſenſible of, that they baniſhed <hi>Protagoras,</hi> as dangerous to their State, not for denying, but for doubting of it. And the Reaſon (as has been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed already) is plain. For Int'reſt undeniably governs the main courſe of Humane Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. We are ſo framed by Nature, that it can not be otherwiſe. And without that Belief, no Man has any Int'reſt
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:34981:49"/>
to be virtuous, further than in outward Appearance only. The Shew alone, of Benignity and Good-will to Mankind, not only avoids the Reach of Humane Laws, but ſuffices to procure the Good-will of thoſe who ſee nothing but that Shew. Where a private Advantage can be gained, without hazard of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, if Religion be removed, nothing hinders. And is that Man virtuous, who is ſo only in Appearance, either for fear of the Law, or for the ſake of his Reputation? I can not call him ſo. But call him what we will, I think I have made it evident that no Government can ſubſiſt, where no Member of it has any more powerful Principle of Virtue than this:
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:34981:50"/>
And that without Government no tolerable Degree of Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, Peace, and Happineſs in this World can be attained.</p>
            <p>After this, methinks I ſhould need few words to perſwade you, Gentlemen, (who are <hi>Deiſts</hi> indeed) to renounce the Fraternity of thoſe who (lurk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the Cover of that Name) go about ſecretly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermining the Welfare of all Mankind. Whatever Humanity may be ſhewn to their Perſons (as That indeed ought in no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion whatſoever to be omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) there is no Indulgence due to their Opinions. To ſmile at, and take complacence, in the bold ſtrokes, which in daily Converſation they give at the Root of all Religion, is to be
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:34981:50"/>
delighted with the Ruin of all Humane Society. How bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous! I am ſure, none that in reality believes a God can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure it. Let us therefore be always upon our Guard, and in all occaſions diſcountenance and oppoſe their pernicious Principles.</p>
            <p>The Task of oppoſing them is not difficult. Examine but the ground of any one of their Syſtems, and it will be found to be built upon ſuch intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Preſumption, as one would think they themſelves ſhould bluſh to own. <hi>Is it becauſe of any Diſorders they obſerve in the Univerſe, that they conclude it not to have been formed by an Intelligent Workman? What! His bungling, perhaps, is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable</hi>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:34981:51"/>
(as one ſaid) <hi>in placing the Calves of our Legs behind; Whereas they ought rather to have been before, for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of our Shins.</hi> Frothy Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinence! Anatomiſts will tell them the indiſpenſible Uſe of thoſe Muſcles which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe our Calves, in that very place. But, how dare Men be ſo bold to carp at what they are not able to mend; nay, nor in the leaſt degree to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate? <hi>O, but,</hi> ſay they, <hi>an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely Wiſe and Powerful God</hi> (as we ſuppoſe him) <hi>could have framed a more perfect Creature than Man is.</hi> And who has told them that he has not done it? Nay, numberleſs Varieties of ſuch Creatures, ſuited to the various Diſpoſition of thoſe
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:34981:51"/>
Parts of the Univerſe where he has placed them? We have no reaſon, I am ſure, to think our ſelves in the higheſt Stage of Nature. <hi>But whatever be our Natural Condition; Our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Circumſtances (upon the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Grounds of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion)</hi> they will ſay, <hi>ought to have been much otherwiſe. He ought to have given us a greater ſtrength of Mind, to bridle thoſe Appetites, for the Diſorders of which it is pretended he will judge us.</hi> But if he thought fit, amongſt the great variety of Creatures that fill the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, to create us in a ſtate of Indifferency and Freedom, not ſo ſtrongly ſway'd any way, as to be neceſſarily and unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly either Happy or Miſerable;
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:34981:52"/>
What Irregularity is there in this? What Breach of Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry do we make in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe? Eſpecially, if he have given us a ſtrength ſufficient for the working out of our own happineſs (which is the Caſe) and we apply not our ſelves to make uſe of it; What reaſon have we to complain of his Judgment? <hi>Yes; The Judgment ordinarily believ'd, is too ſevere.</hi> Let us ſuſpend our Judgment of That, till we come to it. Our ordinary Ideas of a Deity are, that he is both Juſt and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful: And the temperature that muſt reſult from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination of thoſe two Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, will undoubtedly be ſuch as we ſhall be forced to own proper and ſuitable to our Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances.
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:34981:52"/>
               <hi>No,</hi> ſay they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>all manner of Puniſhment will be then unſuitable: Becauſe it will neither tend to our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, nor ſerve for Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to others: Without which it is no better than meer Revenge, and would be unjuſtifiable even amongſt Men.</hi> All of a piece ſtill. Who told them that we ſhall not be capable of any degrees of Purification in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Life; Or that none of the Inhabitants of thoſe Regions, whither we ſhall be tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, will be capable of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any Benefit by our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample? The ſame Thread of Preſumption runs through the whole Series of theſe Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. The Offer of any (even the leaſt) of them implies a
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:34981:53"/>
pretence to a full and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive knowledge of the whole Univerſe. For That is viſibly one intire Frame, knit together, without the leaſt Chaſm, by continual Relations and Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies. And whoever objects againſt any part, if he really pretend to underſtand the whole, ought to bluſh at his own Preſumption: Or if he object, without pretending to it, He muſt needs (in the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all Men) incur the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of great Extravagance.</p>
            <p>I ſaid in the beginning, that I intended not to oppoſe theſe Opinions, in this Paper, by any Philoſophical Arguments: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that has been ſufficiently done, over and over again, by many others. It is ſufficient to
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:34981:53"/>
me, that I ſhew the ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs of all of them, by the impoſſibility of any Man's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to have a due compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency of Knowledge whereon to build them. And the ſame Preſumption that runs through all the Objections drawn up againſt the Wiſdom of God, from the imperfections and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders that are pretended to be obſerved in the World, will be ſound in like manner to be the root of all thoſe that are brought againſt his Providence. That Great One, <hi>drawn from the Proſperity of Ill Men, and the Adverſity, which oft times at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends the Good, in this Life,</hi> is viſibly of the ſame Nature. For who has aſſured the Objectors that This is not a probationary
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:34981:54"/>

And yet That they muſt ſay, or elſe their Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is vain, The improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and doubtfulneſs of any thing is not a ſufficient Ground for a Poſitive Concluſion. They muſt talk no leſs than of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Knowledge in the Matter, or they talk very imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently.

with Revelation, ſhould not think a thing ſo very impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible which They all believed (at leaſt) to be highly probable. For this I could eaſily bring numerous Authorities: But they are ſo commonly known, that I count it needleſs.

his Workmanſhip) from any poſſibility of ever more inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddling with it? Can they be certain of this? I think not.

            <p>As impoſſible as the Doctrine of Providence may ſeem to them, This alſo is what all the wiſe and virtuous Heathens conſtantly believed; And upon which (as I have ſhewn al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready) they founded both their Morality and Politicks. Yet ſince I am ſaln again upon the Subject, I have a Mind to add one Paſſage more out of <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero,</hi> and to join with That the Authority of <hi>Socrates,</hi> and
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:34981:57"/>
of <hi>Antoninus;</hi> Two Names that (if any) deſerve high Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Concerning <hi>Socrates, Xenophon</hi> his Diſciple, tells us, in the Firſt Book of his <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs,</hi> that <hi>He called thoſe Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who could imagine that all humane affairs depended intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon our Conduct, without any interpoſition of Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</hi> This is the Spirit that runs through all his Philoſophy, and with which he tinctured every thing. <hi>Xenophon</hi> has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us ſeveral Argumentations of his, expreſly to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, which are much too long to be here tranſcribed. And theſe remarkable Words, in his Fourth Book, ſhew us the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement he made of it for
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:34981:58"/>
the benefit of Humane Life. <hi>What Man in his Wits</hi> (ſays he) <hi>can, any other way, hope for greater Advantages, than from the Gods; in whoſe power it is to beſtow on us the greateſt? But he only has Right to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect ſuch things from them who pleaſes them: And He chiefly pleaſes them who moſt perfectly obeys them. Thus</hi> (ſays <hi>Xenophon) whilſt he both taught and practiſed theſe things, he made his Hearers more Pious and Moderate:</hi> And, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently (all Men muſt own) more fit for the Duties of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:34981:59"/>
blind Chance; Or when he does perceive that there are Gods, does not underſtand that the very Origin, Growth, and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of this Mighty Empire are to be aſcribed to their Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Protection?</hi> He goes on, ſtrenuouſly aſſerting that, <hi>However they might flatter themſelves, All their Succeſſes, even the Conqueſt of the whole World, were not to be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted either to their Number or Strength,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Nor even to their Underſtanding and Wiſdom; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it were in this one Point, that they excelled all other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in Piety and Religion, and in a ſenſible Conviction of the Superintendency of the Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Gods, and of their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Dependance upon them.</hi> But
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:34981:59"/>
I will conclude theſe Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, with that of <hi>Antoninus.</hi> He poſitively affirms <hi>(l.</hi> 2. §. 8.) both <hi>that there are Gods, and that they do concern themſelves in the Adminiſtration of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Affairs:</hi> And upon that ground, every where, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains that they ought to be <hi>Pray'd to, and Worſhipped.</hi> And accordingly <hi>(l.</hi> 3. §. 11.) in addreſſing his Reflections to himſelf (as his ſtile runs) He has theſe excellent words: <hi>Prepare and furniſh thy ſelf with Rules, that may be uſeful to thee in the Intelligence both of Divine and Humane things: And in all thy Tranſactions, even the leaſt, remember the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion that is between thoſe two. For neither can any Humane Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:34981:60"/>
be performed as it ought, unleſs reſpect be had to the Gods, in the doing of it: Nor the Contrary.</hi> By which <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,</hi> according to the Currant ſtream of his Philoſophy, it is probable he intended to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate; That as all Humane Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs muſt be allow'd to be very irregular, where reſpect was not had to the Gods in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of them; So all religious performances towards the Gods ought to be accounted as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper, which did not tend to the advantage of Humane So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. I ſay, this I conclude from the Currant Stream of his Philoſophy; Becauſe he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes often <hi>(l.</hi> 9. §. 17. and <hi>l.</hi> 10. §. 6.) <hi>that he had no other ſenſe of Duty, nor even of any
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:34981:60"/>
particular happineſs to himſelf, than in the Tendency of every thing he either ſaid or did, to the Welfare of that General Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity of Mankind, unto which every particular Man is inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably united, as a conſtituent part of the great Whole.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alſo <hi>(l.</hi> 2. §. 14.) he calls that Man an <hi>impoſtumous Boil,</hi> and Excreſcence in the World, who was capable of the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of any ſeparate Int'reſt. Which the Propagators of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions ſo ruinous to Society, as thoſe I write againſt, would do well to take notice of.</p>
            <p>Tis true, indeed, <hi>Epicurus</hi> (in his Doctrine of Providence) was of another Opinion. His buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was to deſtroy all ſenſe of any Dependance upon the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:34981:61"/>
Gods, in any caſe whatſoever. But I beg theſe Gentlemen's Pardon, if I did not reckon upon him, when I mentioned all the wiſe and virtuous Heathens as agreeing in this Belief. Not that I would detract from his Reputation of perſonal Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and Temperance, or any other Excellency that is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of him. But the voluptuous and diſſolute Lives of the main Body of his Followers, proving evidently the tendency of his Principles, makes me look upon him (if you pleaſe) as a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Monſter; If he were ſo, in conſequence of a Belief which did, and naturally muſt, make the Generality of Men, who imbrace it, extreamly vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:34981:61"/>
Now, if the manifeſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modeſty of thoſe Objections, (founded upon vain Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and contrary to the weight of all virtuous Authority) be not ſufficient to check the Spreaders of them in our days; Yet, methinks, the ill Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences that attend ſuch like Doctrines, ſhould not only do it, but alſo make them a little doubtful of their Truth. And if they were once got ſo far as to admit the Miſchief of thoſe Conſequences, and thereupon to heſitate upon the Truth of the Notions which produced them, I cannot yet think ſo ill of my Countrymen, as to ſuppoſe they would continue their Induſtry in making Proſelytes. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences I have repreſented al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready:
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:34981:62"/>
               <hi>The Ruin of Societies.</hi> Now ſuppoſe the Diſquiſition into the Truth of theſe Matters were intricate; (for that is the moſt that can be ſaid in favour of the Incredulous) Which way ought we to incline? He muſt have little Humanity in him that does not find even his Judgment ſway'd by the Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of all Mankind. For my part, who do believe a God and Providence, I cannot conceive it conſiſtent with his Goodneſs, to have put us into ſuch Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, that any Opinion which is abſolutely neceſſary to our Being or Well-being (ſo that we could not poſſibly either be at all, or enjoy any competent happineſs without it) ſhould not be True; Or that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:34981:62"/>
ſhould. This would be to ſuppoſe the Scheme of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe very ill drawn, and the Parts of it ill ſuited to each other; If any real and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Effect were made dependent upon an imaginary and falſe Cauſe. For Inſtance: If our Being, (the Suſtenance of our Life) or the End of our Being, (Happineſs, in any moderate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree) could not be attained without this or that particular Perſwaſion, which ſhould move us to act in this or that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular manner; It would ſeem to me (I confeſs) very abſurd, and inconſiſtent with my Idea of a God, that ſuch Opinion or Perſwaſion ſhould have no real Ground in the Nature of Things, but depend only upon
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:34981:63"/>
our lucky hitting on ſo uſeful an Errour. That is as much as to ſay: If the Belief of God's Superintendency be abſolutely neceſſary to our attaining any competent Degree of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (which he has evidently deſigned us for) it ſeems to me very abſurd, to think that ſuch a Belief can poſſibly be ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and falſe. This would give me a ſtrange Idea both of God and of my ſelf. If every thing that I can obſerve in my own Nature, ſhews me that I am deſigned for Society; And if Society can not poſſibly be maintained without thoſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples that I have been pleading for; I muſt needs think it a very fantaſtical Contrivance in my Nature, if the Author of
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:34981:63"/>
it ſhould have no way to lead me into the Belief of them, but by Deluſion: Eſpecially if that Deluſion be ſuch, (which is the Caſe in the Syſtem of thoſe I now diſpute againſt) as I my ſelf may be able to detect, and thereby fruſtrate the End of him that made me. This (I muſt needs ſay) would make ſo ſtrange a jumble in my Brains, that, rather than admit it, I ſhould fly to direct Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſm, and believe nothing at all. Yet nevertheleſs, I confeſs, All this does not amount to a Demonſtration, to thoſe who do not believe a God, or not ſuch a God as I do; Tho' to me it be not much leſs. At leaſt, I muſt profeſs that, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the Matter of Fact (in
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:34981:64"/>
reſpect of the Conſequences of Irreligion) as I have endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to prove it; The grounds of Religion do, by this very Argument, appear to me ſo probable, that tho' I had no other, I ſhould not ſcruple to venture my All upon them. Nature her ſelf repugns at the Thought of the Contrary. Who is it, that would not abhor any thing that tends to the Ruin of his whole Species? Methinks, therefore, it ſhould create in all Men's Minds a prejudice ſtrong enough to reſiſt even very ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Arguments; But ſurely, to hinder the Belief of ſo ill a thing, without any Argument at all. And, as even now, I called him a Monſter of Virtue, who could be virtuous in ſpight
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:34981:64"/>
of the ſtrongeſt vicious Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; So I would fain know by what Stile thoſe Men will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipher their own Inhumanity, who can (without any relu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctance) entertain and take De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in propagating Opinions which ſtrike at the Foundation of all Humane Happineſs.</p>
            <p>Let this ſuffice to be ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Nominal <hi>Deiſts.</hi> I would now add a few words to you, Gentlemen, that are Real ones; And to my ſelf, in that number. We do believe, That <hi>there is an infinitely Powerful, Wiſe, and Good God; Who ſuperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends the Actions of Mankind, in order to retribute unto every one, either here or hereafter, according to their Deſerts.</hi> Let no body boggle at this Creed: For if
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:34981:65"/>
we do not ſtick to it, I have proved already that we ruin the Foundation of all Humane Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, and are in effect no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than meer <hi>Atheiſts:</hi> And, in the end of the Conſequence ſhall become <hi>Canibals.</hi> If we do ſtick to it, let us conſider what further it leads us to. The Retribution that we have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to be neceſſary, is not made with any manner of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs in this Life: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is to be expected in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. This, indeed, is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Argument: But admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Premiſes, I do not ſee how it can be reſiſted. Thoſe that will oppoſe it, muſt begin with denying the Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of God; And thereby declare themſelves Enemies of
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:34981:65"/>
Mankind. But let us go on. If God ſuperintend the Actions of Men, he does it by ſome Rule. That Rule muſt of neceſſity be Uniform. That is; All Men in the ſame Circumſtances muſt be obliged to the ſame thing, under the ſame Penalty. For Partiality, Favour, and Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, to one perſon more than another, are wholly inconſiſtent with our Ideas of his Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But when Circumſtances alter, tho' the Rule it-ſelf be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the ſame, God's Judgment of particular Actions alters ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. It may then be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, how ſhall we do to know what this Uniform Rule is? I anſwer; It muſt of neceſſity be ſuitable to the Relation that is between him and us. If that
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:34981:66"/>
will not teach us what it is, I ſhall be at a loſs where to look for it. But let us conſider what appears moſt obvious in the General Relation wherein God ſtands to Men; Or Men to God. Whether we call him Creator, Benefactor, Governour, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be, it is one and the ſame thing to All: He is not the God of this or that particular Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try only, but of the whole World. This General Relation, therefore, implies a General Care. His Deſign muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity be the Good of the whole. And as we are Inſtruments in his hand, it muſt certainly be in order to that End. Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever tends to the Good of the whole, is therefore (in every change of Circumſtance) the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:34981:66"/>
Conſtant, Uniform, and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable Duty that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires from every Man; And according to which he will judge every Man. Thus we both find what our Duty is; And that his Animadverſion, to be expected in a Future State, gives it the Strength of a Law.</p>
            <p>I ſay, therefore, Gentlemen, let us that believe and ſee theſe things, be careful to conform our Lives according thereunto. This is no ſmall Advance. If we keep faſt hold of this Thread, there can happen very few Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties that it will not guide us through. The Awe of a ſuper-intending God, if attended to, will make us Sincere. For where is the Man, that whilſt he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that Senſe, dares tranſgreſs
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:34981:67"/>
the Laws that he underſtands himſelf to be in this manner obliged to obſerve? And if we are Sincere, there is no Man of moderate Capacity, but by ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf the Queſtion, on occaſion of any thing that he is going about <hi>(Which way would it be for the Advantage of all Mankind, that all Men in this Circumſtance, ſhould act?)</hi> will be able to ſee, which way lies the General Int'reſt of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; And in that, His own particular Duty.</p>
            <p>This would furniſh Matter for a large Diſcourſe: But that I fear it would be called Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching. Yet what is obvious, and neceſſary, muſt not be omitted. Let us open our Eyes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what a World we ſhould
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:34981:67"/>
have, if all Men were thorowly ſenſible but of this one thing, that I have now Illuſtrated. This one Law, if every Man carried it in his Breaſt, would very much ſuperſede the Uſe of all other. But without that which is the Ground of This, all other Laws are of very little ſignificancy. What the ſtate of the World would be, in that caſe, we have ſeen already. Let us not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore delude our ſelves, or others, with Talk of Reformation. Till this Principle be ſpread, has taken root, and is got in Vogue, 'tis altogether in vain to go about it. This, and this alone, will reach the Decay of Trade and Wealth, (not to mention the higher effects of it) and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Miſcarriages that are
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:34981:68"/>
complained of in Publick Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and Eſtabliſh the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of this Nation. I ſpeak of Government, becauſe I believe many of us do (I am ſure all ſhould) heartily love our Country; The Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of which depends intirely upon the Conſtitution and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of our Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. What Reformation; What Patchings of our ſhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered Frame, can we expect? Nay, <hi>What will any Patchings</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Quid Leges, ſine Moribus, vanae proficiunt? <hi>Hor. Carm. l. 9. Ode</hi> 24.</note> 
               <hi>ſignifie, whilſt our Manners are thus corrupted?</hi> Till a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of True Virtue begin to take Root in Men's Minds, there is nothing more Chimerical than the Expectation of any
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:34981:68"/>
manner of Publick Good. And I think I may well add, that there is hardly any <hi>Cant</hi> more fulſom, than the Talk of Virtue, where there is not a Principle that all Men muſt own capable to produce it. For our Country's ſake therefore, Gentlemen, let us make it our firſt Buſineſs, to eſtabliſh this Principle in the Minds of all our Acquaintance. We may do it in a thouſand Ways, more effectual than the Pedantick forms of Pulpit-ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; And which will disbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>become no body. This were an excellent means indeed of tricking the Prieſts out of their Trade (which we ſo much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim againſt) and would leave them no ground of Complaint. When we have done this, (and
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:34981:69"/>
not till then) we may ſet up for Patriots; And with Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Succeſs. One that was no more Bigot than the beſt of us, ſaw many Ages ago, and told his Countrymen, the <hi>Romans,</hi> that all their <note n="*" place="bottom">Diis te minorem quod geris imperas: Huc omne Principium, huc refer exitum.

               <hi>Succeſſes were to be attributed to their Religious Reverence of the Gods, and their Miſcarriages, to the neglect and decay of it.</hi> And whether we ſeek the reaſon of this Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in the Natural Efficacy of the grand Principle of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, or in the Bleſſing of Providence that attends the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of it, we ſhall find it both ways ſtrong. Let us then make it our Buſineſs

Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more eaſie and more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent is yet wanting. It has been hinted by a <note n="*" place="bottom">

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:34981:70"/>
I would certainly ſollicit him to perform what he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes. But ſince we ſee it not yet done, and muſt therefore ſuppoſe that ſome other thing of no leſs moment imploys his Thoughts (for he has both there, and <note n="*" place="bottom">His Thoughts concerning Education.</note> elſe where, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd too true a Concern for the Welfare of Mankind, to leave us any miſtruſt that he would otherwiſe omit it) I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not refrain from offering to all Men's conſideration the Uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of the Deſign; That ſo whoever finds his Strength e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to the Task, may take it upon him.</p>
            <p>But if the Difficulty of this Work be any Obſtacle to others, as well as to me; And if my
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:34981:71"/>
General Rule be too ſuccinct, for the Variety of Caſes that occur in Humane Affairs; Then I am ſure we muſt all conclude that the generality of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind ſtand in great need of ſome further Aſſiſtance, than that general Capacity which they are naturally endowed with: And that whereſoever that Aſſiſtance can be found, it is not below the moſt ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated Capacity to make uſe of it. Now this, at leaſt, is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, amongſt Chriſtians, to have been done by the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Jeſus Chriſt. The Precepts of the Goſpel are plain, ſuited to the meaneſt Capacities: And, if the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of it be true, the Divine Authority of it can not be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned.
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:34981:71"/>
Thoſe two things, therefore, joined together, eaſe us at once of the trouble of enquiring into the Foundation of the Law of Nature, and into the Particularities of it. For admitting them; We have a fair Tranſcript, in our hands, of the moſt eſſential Points of that Law, and the Authority of the Law-giver ſtampt upon it. This therefore, beſides the Doctrine of Deiſm that we agree in, it highly concerns us to enquire into. For if the pretences of Chriſtianity be well grounded, it can not be an indifferent or frivolous Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>The general Advice that I will preſume to offer upon this account, is only this. Let us
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:34981:72"/>
be very careful not to block up our own way to the Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of any uſeful Truth, by that ſort of Preſumption which I have but even now <note n="*" place="bottom">—Eheu, Quàm temerè in noſmet legem ſancimus iniquam! <hi>Hor. Sat. l,</hi> 1.</note> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in thoſe whoſe Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood I would diſclaim. I hope none that really believes a God, will offer to ſay it is <hi>impoſſible</hi> for him to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the knowledge of his Will to his Creatures, by any other way than that which we are ordinarily acquainted withal: Or that it is <hi>impoſſible</hi> for Him to impower any one, whom he thinks fit to fill with any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary either Degree or Kind of Knowledge, to work things ſo wonderful as may
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:34981:72"/>
juſtly be eſteemed an adequate proof of his extraordinary Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. To pronounce either of theſe, dogmatically, <hi>impoſſible,</hi> implies a preſumption of ſo comprehenſive and univerſal a knowledge, as I am ſure it is impoſſible for any Man to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to. <hi>Impoſſible</hi> for God! Is the thing inconſiſtent with the Scheme of the Univerſe? Who knows it? If it be not; Or that we are ignorant; Who dares ſay it? But if we can not reaſonably pronounce all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of extraordinary Revelation of God's Will to be impoſſible; And can not deny ſome extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Help (conſidering the many frailties of Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) to be highly uſeful; We are certainly bound to examine
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:34981:73"/>
without prejudice, and very impartially, any thing that has but a plauſible pretence to that Extraordinary Character.</p>
            <p>It will not be denied, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, but Chriſtianity has the faireſt Pretenſions to this, of any Religion now in the World. Yet even here, immediately, we renconter a Cloud of Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: Superſtitious Practices; Abſurd and unconceivable Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets; Diſputes; Uncertainties; and Endleſs Difficulties. What ſhall we do? Think not, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, that I am going to adviſe you to enter into all the Controverſial Diſquiſitions that amuze our ſeveral Sects. No: If you are deſirous to know the Truth, avoid them all, and enquire without prejudice into
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:34981:73"/>
the Root of the Matter. The Root I call the plain Hiſtory of Matter of Fact. See what Proofs there are, for or againſt the Truth of what is recorded to have been ſaid and done by Jeſus Chriſt. If you can not deny the Truth of the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory (which I ſuppoſe is hardly poſſible) then obſerve the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of his Doctrines and Precepts; And if you find them all intirely conducing to the Welfare of Mankind; (which is the ſame End with that of the Natural Law of God) Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them not the leſs; (I beſeech you) But think your ſelves a little the more obliged to obey them, becauſe (which you muſt own, if the Hiſtory be true) he was immediately
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:34981:74"/>
ſent from God to teach and give them. In this Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Uſe of our Reaſon is not only Lawful, but Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. God has given it to us, as Men, for our Uſe: And where we apply it to neceſſary Uſes, not to vain Curioſities, it will not deceive us. In that manner we act according to Nature, and ought not to do otherwiſe. And if we examine thus, I am perſwaded we ſhall find that Chriſtianity is the higheſt Improvement of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm: So that we may embrace it, without forſaking our firſt Principles. It muſt needs be ſo, if true. For the Principles of Deiſm are the Eternal and Unalterable Law of God to all Men. He may give further
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:34981:74"/>
Helps (as I ſuppoſe we ſhall find Chriſtianity is) to ſome: But he can not Abrogate or Suſpend the Univerſal Law, which he has given us by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, with reſpect to any. My Counſel therefore terminates, in ſticking conſtantly cloſe to That; And at the ſame time, in making Uſe of all the Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance we can find, for the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of it, any where elſe. In this manner we not only avoid, but anſwer all the Objections that I now hinted at, or that can poſſibly riſe againſt Chriſtianity. The Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Superſtitions is unſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the true Idea of a God. The Belief of Abſurdities is impopoſſible to the Nature of Man. And the Enquiry into
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:34981:75"/>
Uſeleſs Niceties, is a very ill Imployment of that precious time, of which (amongſt other things) God will certainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire an account at our hands.</p>
            <p>How! Will ſome Sectaries, that may chance to ſee this Letter, be apt to ſay; <hi>Are no Syſtems, no Articles, no Creeds, worth enquiring into? This is to ſet up a New Chriſtianity, and to Undermine what is ordinarily called by that Name, inſtead of eſtabliſhing it: The very Fault that you condemned in thoſe who, under the Veil of Deiſm, made it their Buſineſs to propagate the Principles of Atheiſm.</hi> I beg their Pardon. The Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is great. In the firſt place: 'Tis to Deiſts I write. And if upon that account, I
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:34981:75"/>
uſe a Latitude in ſome Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, not ſuited to the Genius of a Sectary, 'tis no more than the nature of the thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires. But I will anſwer them more directly. They may wrangle about Names as much as they pleaſe: 'Tis the thing only that I enquire into. <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi> That Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> and his Apoſtles taught: Not that which Sects and Parties have ſo deformed, or diſguiſed, that it is not at all knowable in their Writings, nor much in their Practice. What! Shall I ſet my ſelf to ſeek out a Syſtem of Chriſtianity, amongſt their end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Diſputes? Let them firſt agree upon it amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. When that is done, it
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:34981:76"/>
will be time enough for me to conſider what they ſay. But if, in the mean while, I can find out any particular wherein they all agree, I ſincerely promiſe them that I will ſtick to it.</p>
            <p>Now one particular, I bleſs God, I have lately found, in a Book, Intituled, <hi>The Reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of Chriſtianity, as deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in the Scriptures;</hi> And there demonſtrated with an Evidence, that I am not able to reſiſt. Yet let no body imagine, by this, that I am the Old Acquaintance of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the <hi>Growth of Deiſm,</hi> who (he tells us) was convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of the Reality of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Religion, by the reading of that Book, and of <hi>The Five Letters concerning the Inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:34981:76"/>
of the Holy Scriptures.</hi> For I neither know him, nor He me. Yet nevertheleſs, I own that I eſteem That Book, and the laſt of thoſe Letters, no leſs than he ſeems to do. Now, I ſay, the thing which I find in that Book, wherein all Sectaries a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, is, <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt is the Meſſiah, the Son of God, the King; Whom all, that believe him to be ſo, are obliged to obey.</hi> And the General Agreement of all Sects in this, gives me, I confeſs, a ſtrong preſumption of its Truth: But the particular Evidence of it, in that Book, is irreſiſtible. The Evidence, I mean, both that the Thing aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted is true; And that (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever elſe may be true and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful) nothing but that alone is
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:34981:77"/>
required, <hi>abſolutely,</hi> to denote and Characteriſe a Man a Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>Since therefore I am forced to own that, for my part, I know no better; And now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair of any help from parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Sects; I hope I may, without the Cenſure of thoſe Sects, reſume the Advice I was preſuming to offer to thoſe to whom I addreſs this Letter; To <hi>Deiſts,</hi> I mean. I would fain perſwade them to look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the True Grounds of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity.</hi> What do I talk of perſwading them to it? They do it already. <hi>Deiſm</hi> it-ſelf is the firſt Ground and Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi> Let them obſerve the Superſtructure: And if any part of That be not ſo
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:34981:77"/>
fitted as to lye even and ſmooth upon this Foundation, let them, in God's Name, reject it. Such ill-hewn Stuff cannot be from him. His Works are all of a piece; And will be always found conſiſtent. But if all Genuine Chriſtianity, All that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> himſelf made eſſential to it, be evidently an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of Natural Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion (which I call <hi>Deiſm)</hi> built upon it, fitted to it, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted with it; So that the whole together makes one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Body, or Syſtem of Laws; Juſt and Reaſonable, Worthy of the Supream Legiſlator from whom they proceed, and all calculated and apparently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived for the Benefit of Man; Then, methinks, I ſhould not
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:34981:78"/>
need to uſe many words to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade any one to embrace it. Neither is that my intention. I only propound, that thoſe who have not yet examined into the Matter, would pleaſe to do it, by that Draught of Chriſtianity which the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Book preſents us withal: And let them reſiſt it if they can. For if they can do it, it is reaſonable they ſhould. Nay, as we are men, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for any one to do otherwiſe; That is, to refuſe Aſſent upon Conviction, or to believe contrary to it. After that Examination, I referr it to themſelves to enter into more particular Enquiries, or deſiſt, as they ſhall then judge neceſſary. But if, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:34981:78"/>
to my expectation, any one of you, Gentlemen, to whom I have addreſſed this too tedious Letter, diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with me (after ſuch Examination) in what I have now at laſt particularly inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted upon; I beg of you, by the Bonds of Humanity, in which we are all united, to aſſiſt me in ſhaking off what you eſteem to be De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion; And to furniſh me at the ſame time, inſtead of it, with ſome other more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Scheme of things; More agreeable to the Ideas we have of God, and more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducive to the Happineſs of Man. Take only thoſe two Conſiderations along with you, and in doing it effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:34981:79"/>
you will oblige, not only me, but all Mankind. I am,</p>
