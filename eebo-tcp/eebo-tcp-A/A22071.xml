            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>VHen I considered with my
selfe (Gentle Reader) of the
sundry kinds of delights; of
the fine wits yeelding, most
pleasant conceipts: of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie
of inuentions, with
the profunditie of euerye
mans iudgement, I find that
(thereby) this is the hardest world that might happen
to grosse heads and greene wits. The redoubling of
phrases running with words beginning all with one
letter, in the amorous discourses of young Gallants,
iointly with the liues of their inamoured Mistrisses:
in Histories liuely desciphering foolish dotage ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
in old men and stale widdowes, with the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniencie
of matching crooked old age, and wilie
youth together are so commonly vsed; as they who
spend their time, dull their heads, and bestowe their
trauell in penning such bookes, are either thought to
steale their inuention from othermens labours, or
else accounted of as wittals, for spending their studies
about such common deuises. But if any man write
louing Songs, and amiable Sonnets, they, as foolish
toyes nothing profitable, are of euery one misliked,
if of famous mens actes done long agoe, they are tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
lyes, and therefore to be reiected, if of things
hapned in our dayes, the euents of those but now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
practises, neede no discourses to cause remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance.
What shall I say, the Booke-hinders shops,
and euery Printers presse are so cloyed and clogged
with Bookes of these and such-like matters, that they
<pb facs="tcp:369:4"/>
are good for nothing (as they say) but to make wast-paper,
whereby it falleth out, that through the mispri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of the <hi>Authors</hi> minds, and misconstruing of their
meanings, with the innumerable swarme of <hi>Momus</hi>
followers, that a man were better to go to plough one
whole yeare, then to toyle his head but one moneth
about publishing any of his studyes. The considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whereof, hath been such an impediment to the
printing of this my Pamphlet (I tearme it so, not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the matter there-in handled, but of the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
thereof,) that when it was (at the earnest request
of one that might haue commaunded) both begun
and finished very neere with-in the space of one whole
moneth, I was after-wards three long moneths stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying,
whether it were better for me to burne it, or to
giue it to the Presse: which the rather happened, for
that my proceedings were crost by diuers backward
euents. For first of all (after the finishing of it) when I
had gone through with the Printer, so that within
two dayes it should haue been ready for his trade,
there fell out a crosse matter, whereby it was dasht for
the space of tenne weekes, then hauing intelligence of
the commonnesse of Ballads, with Bookes to this
purpose, I resolued my selfe to bestowe this my
Pamphlet on the fire. But crabbed <hi>Fortune</hi> (who euer
hinders willing enterprises) through the intreatie of
diuers of my deerest friends, stayed my determinate
purpose, by perswading me that those Bookes and
Ballads did very little touch the matter my Booke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treateth
of, which caused me rather to publish this
my worke (intituled <hi>Elizabetha Triumphans)</hi> truely
and effectually declaring the wicked attempts of the
<pb facs="tcp:369:4"/>
diuelish <hi>Pope,</hi> with his damned adherents practised to
the praise or dispraise of me it <hi>Author,</hi> then to let
such broken tales, told in plaine Ballets, expresse the
vnspeakeable actes, and wondrous ouerthrowes had
against the <hi>Pope</hi> by this our royall Queene and her
(by this made famous) <hi>Island.</hi> Committing therefore
both this Booke my first worke, with my selfe a yong
versefier to your liking, I desire nothing of you
for my paynes, but that you will not condemne
the beginning, vntill you haue read to the
ending, and then of Gods name be
free with your censure.
