            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>seeke,</hi> from which <hi>Caine was cast out.</hi> Not that in such places were any false <note place="margin">Gen 4. 14</note> vizors or formes whereby God might bee remembred: but because his pure worship, praescribed by himselfe, and accordingly by his children performed, is that ordinance, in which his face is seene glorious, and not out of it.</p>
            <p>In this <hi>Court</hi> of God, in this <hi>house</hi> of God, <hi>Dauid</hi> wished hee might alwayes dwell, and that neither 1. <hi>vnaduisedly,</hi> as <hi>Peter</hi> in Christs transfiguration. <hi>Maister it is good being here: let vs make three tabernacles: but hee wist not</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Luk. 9. 33.</note> 
               <hi>what he said.</hi> Neither 2. <hi>formally</hi> or for fashion, but most affectionately: yea so ardently that the very vehemencie of his desire, conflicting with deniall of it,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:7938:7"/>
brought leannesse into his flesh, dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse into his bones, and consumption into his parts; for so much the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in the second verse implyeth; that he was euen wasted with the sighing &amp; groning out these most inward desires of his soule: nor yet 3. doth he propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d his wish in simple forme of speach, for that would not serue him to expresse more then ordinary affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but as one most superlatiuely affecting aboue all other things this one; he instituteth a double comparison. The <hi>former</hi> is drawne from the consideration of the time. <hi>One day</hi> spent in these Courts of GOD, is better then a <hi>thousand</hi> else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where: as though he had said. It were no great difficulty for me being a King and the head of all <hi>Israell,</hi> to passe the whole terme of my life in the Pallaces of the mighty, and in aboundance of earthly pleasure; If I could (with the most of the world) account these the matters of highest honor, and truest happinesse. But might I obtaine <hi>one day,</hi> that is, neuer so little a time of the daies of my pilgrimage within thy Courts &amp; tabernacle: where with the rest of thy
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:7938:8"/>
people I might ioyne in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pure worship of thy name; I would account my selfe more honorable &amp; happy, then to spend thousands of dayes in the company of the prophane, although neuer so great. The latter comparison is drawne from consideration of the estate &amp; condition of men: of whom some are in eminent place and dignity, some in meaner and baser degree. <hi>Dauid</hi> although he had good experience of both: yet with all his soule, hee would make exchange of all his greatnesse &amp; glory, with a meane and contemptible outward estate; so be hee might enioy God in his ordinance with it. And therefore although he was a king, yet all that greatnesse did not so take vp his heart, neither lift it vp: but that he could be conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, nay desirous to be <hi>a doore-keeper in the house of God, rather then to dwell in the tabernacles of wickednesse;</hi> resoluing that he would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hold the meanest roome in the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle; then without it to possesse the highest place of the earth: for where Gods tabernacle is not, there can be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but tabernacles of wickednesse. It may be true here which some lerned ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue, that <hi>Dauid</hi> in mention of a <hi>doore-keeper</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:7938:8"/>
               <hi>in Gods house,</hi> had respect vnto the <hi>Chorits,</hi> to whose custody this psalm was comitted for their incourageme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t against the contempt of lewd men: but whether he had or no, their office being to keepe the doores of the tabernacle, the truth <note place="margin">1. Chr. 9. 17 &amp; cap. 26. 1</note> is, he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> had preferred the very sparrows and swallows aboue himselfe, in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that they might resort to the taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, &amp; make their nests there; did much more account the <hi>Chorites</hi> far more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie then himselfe, because they by their office were tied to be euer, day &amp; night in their courses about the tabernacle: w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> priuiledge himselfe in this his flight (whether before <hi>Saul</hi> or <hi>Absolon</hi>) could not enioy. Thus the Prophet enforceth his request and petition vnto God: that therefore he would please to vouchsafe him a comfortable returne vnto the holy exercises of religion, that he might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take in the publick duties thereof with his people: because hee accounteth this blessing the greatest happines vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> earth, yea next to heauen it selfe, although 1. <hi>neuer so little a while.</hi> 2. <hi>in neuer so meane a condition.</hi> So much of the meaning: the instructions follow.

that stirres vp himselfe to seeke after God. In the want of neuer so base an outward commodity, men can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine, yea and lay their counsels and purses together, to get their want sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in season.

Gods temple in desolation, Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship in contempt, he could not but sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, fast and pray in their behalfe.

that our selues enioying the pretious libertie of our assemblies, we ought to pitty the distresse of our countrymen, who sit still in the shadow of death, &amp; by our prayers and best meanes, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue them, groning out the desires of our hearts, and that all <hi>Israell,</hi> euen in our owne country, might be saued.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, if the want of the word, and exercises of it, be the greatest want of <note place="margin">3.

            <p>Why then doe not such as professe themselues the children of wisdome, fore-cast and prouidently fore-see their future necessities? especially seeing this ouer-sight will cost them so many teares, so much sorrow as their spirits shall scarce bee able to sustaine them.

For we haue seene as bright gleames as ours ouer-cast: yea as cleare sunnes of the Church set and fallen in the firmament, as that in the light of which wee now walke: witnesse the Churches of <hi>Rome, Corinth, Galatia, Ephesus, Philippi,</hi> the seauen Churches in lesser <hi>Asia,</hi> all which were farre afore vs in the Gospell: but now vnder the Turke and Pope are sunke to hell, in the profession of <hi>Mahometisme</hi> and <hi>Anti-christianisme:</hi> yea of golden Candle-stickes which once held out the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Gospell and word of truth, are become the very cells and dennes of diuells. Or if the Lord for his owne name and truths sake, forbeare the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moouing of our Candle-sticke, yet the sorrowes of mine owne soule may come vpon mee, as the trauell of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: the Lord may let loose, and set

my sinnes in order before mee to the breaking of my heart; and vexe mee with fearefull visions: or else sicknesse may assaile mee, and bring mee downe to the gates of death; my owne deaths day, and consequently my iudgement day is at doore, and cannot bee farre off. Let now euery Christian well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinke himselfe, whether in any of these straites hee shall not need oyle in his lampe: whether hee shall haue no vse of faith, of direction, of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, of patience, of sence of Gods loue, of assurance of pardon of his sinne, of strength against such tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as hee (perhaps) neuer buckled withall before. I assure thee that which thy owne experience shall at that time become thy mistresse in: that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer the Lord shall begirt thee, and lead thee into any of these conditions; if the word bee not thy comfort, thou art sure to perish in thy trouble; and that all thy life had beene time little enough, to haue furnished thy selfe against that day, yea if thou hadst be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to bee heauenly couetous, when thou beganst first to breath.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:7938:17"/>
Wouldest thou then be armed against sinne, superstition, heresie, popery in thy life time; and close vp thine eyes in that holy religion of GOD which thou hast learned, and beene brought vp in: yea if times and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion should alter? Wouldest thou not in the day of thy sorrow be found vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furnished, and nakedly layde open to all terrors of conscience, accusations of sinne, and temptations of Sathan? Wouldest thou not bee giuen vp to impatience, to a sence of Gods wrath, to shutte vp thy dayes in an horrible apprehension of an hell in thy soule afore-hand? Oh then now while God offereth his grace in the ministerie of the word, acknowledge the accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble time and day of saluation: laye holde vpon wisdome while shee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth; giue her answer while shee yet knocketh; open the doore of thy heart, to giue the best enterteinment thou canst to this deare Daughter of GOD: Store thy soule with knowledge; but especially with faith and good conscience.</p>

Be dilligent in gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this Mannah while the sixe dayes last, before that day come wherein though thou seekest it, yet shalt not finde it.

            <p>And herein the folly of our nature bewrayeth it selfe that we are wiser in the want, then in the fruition of good things; and that we cannot so rightly prize a present benefite, as sighe after it when wee haue negligently depriued our selues of it.</p>

then too late he cryed out, that he was cast out from the face of God. <hi>Esau</hi> contemned his birth-right and blessing till it was bestowed, and then could seeke it with teares when it was too late. <hi>Saul</hi> forceth not of <hi>Samuels</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for him till the Lord was departed and had cast him off. The Prodigal son careth not for the dainties of his fathers house, till he was driuen to feed among Swine; and then he can desire to bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his fathers herd-men. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane of the world take daies with the Lord: If they can be at leysure to heare him another time with <hi>Festus,</hi> so it is, but for the present they cannot intend it. Many Professors wil not foule their dainty feete now for the word; who I doubt not would afterward seeke the blessing (if God should once deny it) &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> with tears: the case being y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same with vs as somtimes it was with <hi>Israel</hi> when <note place="margin">Number. 14. 40.</note> they had with GODS Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment all the incouragements which <hi>Moyses</hi> could vse to speed them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward vnto <hi>Canaan;</hi> they would not go, but back again into <hi>Egipt</hi> in al the hast: the text saith they refused y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> land, <hi>v.</hi> 21.

But when once sentence was past, that they should neuer see y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> good land. <hi>The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they rose vp early in the morning, &amp; were ready to go to the place which the Lord had promised:</hi> now was there no stay with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: neither y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lords reuealed wil, nor <hi>Moyses</hi> perswasion could so pale them in or preuaile with them, but that they presumed obstinatly to go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. The same people before the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuity, had the Temple, the Arke, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, the Oracles, they cared not greatly for them; it seemes the times were much like ours wherein to call men to the house of God, to speake of Pastors, preaching, Scriptures and holy exercises is to glut and surfet men, and so driue them from the loue of all: but the time commeth on, that the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth this contempt w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> they dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly buy, hee casteth them among Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and Scoffers, by which humiliation <note place="margin">Psal. 137. 1.</note> he bringeth backe things past to their remembrance. <hi>By the riuers of</hi> Babel <hi>we sat and wept in remembrance of</hi> Sion.

now can the harpes hang vppon their willow trees without a finger to touch them; neither their sweet melody of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments, nor their pleasant walks, nor their christall riuers can affect them with ioy, seeing they were now bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed and excommunicate from the publike exercises of religion before the Lord at <hi>Sion.</hi> And it were to be wished <note place="margin">Vers. 44.</note> that euen such as belong to the Lord did not vnderprize such gratious pled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Gods presence in the presence and plentifull fruition of them; who yet can with sighs mourne after them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing withdrawne from their eyes, no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise then when all <hi>Israel</hi> lamented after the Lord when the Arke was in <hi>Kiriath-iearim,</hi> 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 2.</p>

            <p>The second point of instruction out of the word, is this: that it is <hi>a note of a</hi>

And therefore that it is our part with him, to prefer the reioycing and comfort of one day within the Church, aboue a thousand elsewhere, not excepting the Pallaces of Princes: yea and that wee might bee so happy in the fruition of this desire, to choose a very meane estate with it, rather then the most glorious condition of the earth without it.</p>
            <p>But what moued the prophet <hi>Dauid,</hi>

and sanctified desires can only proceed: and yet wee may not conceiue such to bee immediate motions, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded flashes, but such as the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit raizeth by meanes: Both first cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing <hi>the beauty of GODS house</hi> to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare bright to their eyes: and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, reuealing to them <hi>the priuiledges which Gods people there partake,</hi> and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not againe meete with them in any so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety besides.</p>
            <p>The former appeareth, <hi>Psalm,</hi> 27. 4. <hi>One thing I desired of the Lord, and I will desire it, that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the daies of my life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what mooued <hi>Dauid</hi> thus to wish this one thing? <hi>That I might see the beauty of thine house:</hi> and although the beautie of the Sanctuary so farre forth as it was externall, in regard of the matter, of the forme, of the whole ordination of it: yea and all the vten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sils euen to the very pinnes of it, which all were of the Lords owne inuention &amp; institution, and might therefore haue drawne carnall mindes vnto it (as at this day the sensible and plausible splendor and beauty of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:7938:22"/>
ioyfully rest it selfe, then in Gods owne resting place?</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Christ himselfe is heere pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent:</hi>

               <p>Now is not this a greater beauty then any which can else-where bee espied? wherein the second Temple passed the glory of the former: &amp; yet ours exceed the second! For how could the second Temple wanting 1.

of his spirit now with vs, is farre more powerful and glorious, then was his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily presence in that Temple.</p>

               <p>Thirdly, <hi>the holie spirit of GOD</hi> is present in our assemblies; most plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie <note place="margin">3.

               <p>Hence is it that wee reade still of the <hi>VVord</hi> and <hi>Spirit:</hi> and <hi>water</hi> and the <hi>Spirit</hi> ioyned together, because the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ordinarily putteth forth the grace of regeneration in the meanes of the word and sacraments.

The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the Saints of God vpon the earth.</note> themselues in who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>al our delight</hi> ought to be. For as the <hi>Tribes of the Lord vsed to goe vppe to his house,</hi> that they might worship before him in his Tabernacle &amp; temple: euen so now the people of God assemble themselues in our congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the same purpose. Now when I say <hi>the people of God,</hi> I mean not al hand ouer head, who promiscuosly come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; not withstanding they all are his people by right of creation and preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, &amp; yet of them some are openly &amp; professed prophane ones; Neither all those who ioyne in externall profession and exercises of religion: of whom yet many are not inwardly purged: in which sence the old world called them
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:7938:25"/>
sonnes of GOD. That is, all the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity of <hi>Seth</hi> and <hi>Enosh,</hi> opposed to the daughters of men voyde of all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and pietie. But I meane those of GODS election; that are called of his purpose, that haue obtayned mercie, and who proceede on in the waies of sanctification vnto saluation.</p>
               <p>These are called in Scripture an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie people, a chosen generation, a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by purchase, the doue of Christ, his vndefiled, his treasure: and their propertie is described, <hi>that they flye as a clowde, and flocke as the Doues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Isay. 60. 8</note> 
                  <hi>these windowes.</hi> Which prophesie al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it bee properlie to bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of the vniuersall and generall calling and concurse of the Gentiles vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church, who should come with such celerity and swiftnesse as if a cloud were with violence of windes carried from one side and region of heauen to the other; and in such flockes and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes, as if a whole flight of piege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (driuen either by tempest, or by an Eagle, or some other birde of prev) should scoure vnto their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbarie, and rush into the windowes:
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:7938:25"/>
yet this propertie is so peculiar vnto persons once called and conuerted, as by which the holie Ghost pleaseth to expresse them, rather then by any other title, that they are such as flocke to the windowes of the Church, by which the Lord conueyeth to his people his light of instruction, of consolation, of grace, of glory. So else-where, the scriptures note them to bee such as <hi>seeke the Lord</hi> in his ordinances, such as <hi>seeke the face of the Lord,</hi> such as <hi>call one another to the house of the Lord,</hi> and such as cheerfully and couragiously march on, and will not giue out, vntill <hi>they meete the Lord in Sion.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> I answer. That true it is that the best part for the most part, is the least part, if wee consider the truth of the thing: but yet Christian loue bindeth
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:7938:26"/>
vs to iudge the best of all that ioyne with vs euen in the outward seruice of God, for wee cannot enter into their hearts, but must leaue them to stand or fall to their owne Lord, and forbeare to iudge them before the time.</p>
               <p>Secondly, wee must (notwithstanding the multitude of prophane &amp; hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall persons in the congregation,) frame our iudgements vnto Gods, who esteemeth the assemblies fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the better part, and not from the greater; he knew well that many moe who were but Iewes without, and in the letter resor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto the tabernacle; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> those who were Iewes within; yet it still retained the titles of <hi>Gods house, &amp; Gods courts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is a glorious thing to be admitted euen to the outward profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of religion, notwithstanding all are not of the Church that are in it. In which regard <hi>Ioshua</hi> calleth all Israell <hi>the Lords possession,</hi> euen because his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle <note place="margin">Iosh. 22. 19 Num. 23. 9 Zeph. 3. 9.</note> dwelt amongst them. And thus was it prophecied by <hi>Balaam</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, that <hi>Israell should dwell alone, and should not bee numbred among the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for Israell was a people of a pure lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.</hi>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:7938:26"/>
In all which the nation of the Iewes were aduanced aboue all other people, because they were distinct and seperated from all other; both in their religion, lawes, rites and condition of life, all of them appointed and establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed by God himselfe.</p>
               <p>How much more beautiful then and glorious are the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregations of Gods people, in regard of such who are truly the Lords holy ones? allied vnto Christ, Saints by calling, and begin to lead euen an heauenly life vpon earth? What is it that maketh the Court more louely and glorious, then all the rest of the pallaces of the land besides? It is not so much the stately building or other braueries, but the presence of the King, Queene, Prince, Lords, Ladies, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their attendants answerably <note place="margin">Gods courtsmore glorious then the courts of Princes.</note> where the exercises of religion are esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished, are beauties no whit inferiour, but farre passing the former. <hi>Salomon</hi> describing the glorious condition of the church, compareth it to the Courts of Kings and Monarches of the earth, but infinitely aduanceth it aboue them all, euen in this consideration.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:7938:27"/>
                  <hi>There are threescore Queenes, and foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score Concubines, and Damsells without</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Cant. 6. 7</note> 
                  <hi>number.</hi> As though hee had said: If in any Court of the world insteed of one Queene (for ordinarily there are no moe) there were three-score, and all at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance proportionall, though this were such a glorious and beautifull a sight as neuer man saw, yet were it not comparable to the beauty of the Church, euery true member of which is a King ouer his lusts, and heire to the crowne of heauen.</p>
               <p>True it is that this beautie of the Saints which beautifieth the assemblies is partly blemished and stained, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie hidde and couered. The former by many prophane <hi>Esaus,</hi> that thrust themselues into the profession, who a while seeme to bee liuing stones; but after appeare but stubble laid vpon the foundation. These are spots in our mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, who so farre as in them lie, make the Church resemble <hi>Nebuchadnezers</hi> image; whose head was of gold, but the belly and feete of Iron and clay, which will not bee tempered together but fall a sunder.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:7938:27"/>
The latter, partly because this Kings daughter is glorious; but within, her comlinesse is like the Curteines of the <note place="margin">Causes why the beauty of the Saints is not seene of the most.</note> tabernacle, which outwardly were of courser stuffe, but within costly for the matter, and curious for the exquisite workmanshippe, and like to the beauty of Christ him-selfe in whom men sawe neither forme nor beautie, partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause their infirmities cloude their beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and darken them in mens eyes, when yet they remaine most deare vnto God: and partly because the sunne of affliction and persecution looketh much and often vpon them, which maketh them seeme blacker then they are, and thus Christ him-selfe was despised be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause men iudged him as plagued and smitten of God. <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. 4, and <hi>Iob</hi> coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted an hypocrite of his friends. No mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile then it is, that such eyes as are not annointed with the eye-salue can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prie into this inward and secret ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect: no meruaile if eyes thus accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to false glasses be distempered; no wonder if eyes still gazing vpon such clouds bee held from seeing the hidden glory of the Saints, no otherwise then
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:7938:28"/>
                  <hi>Elishaes</hi> seruant was, who could not see the glorie which shone rounde about him. But such as are the Lords must herein expresse the vertue and image of their heauenly father, who delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in his people as in his portion; whom hee accounteth beautifull as the Lilly, and sweete as the Rose. Euen so all our delight should bee in the Saints which excell in vertue: let them be by infirmities, by afflictions blacke, yet in our eye they must bee comely: the shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning graces of God in them ought as by strong cordes to draw our affections vnto them: and if in our priuate course we ought to edifie our selues by this, &amp; by our conuersing with them, partake of their graces and encrease or stir vp our owne: much more should we with all cheerefulnesse partake with them in the publicke worship of God, by whose presence, behauiour and praiers our ioy is more full, and our seruice more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable. Especially seeing this whole Psalme sheweth how our Prophet from this consideration did not a little prouoke his heart and best affections vnto the assemblies.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:7938:28"/>
Now to end this point, seeing wee are taught that here is the Court of the King of glorie, the holy God sitteth here in the holie assemblies, the holy Angels of God are heere present; the holie Saints of GOD stand here vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this holie ground: how is it that wee cannot conceiue these meetings to bee the most beautifull places of the earth? How are wee yet as blinde as Moles, if wee espie not and turne not our eyes vnto such beauties? what a fearefull delusion is befallen them, who are so easily wone to the painted beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of an harlot, and despise the natiue beautie of the spouse of Christ? What a certaine damnation abide such, as by scorning the holy exercises of our publicke meetings, and reproching the Preachers, and Ministers of them, seeke to turne this our glory into shame? but more of this in the vses following the doctrine. Thus much wee haue spoken of the honorable persons present in our congregations, the dutifull respect of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (if we wanted othermotiues) were forcible enough to draw Godly hearts with cheerfulnesse vnto our meetings.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:7938:29"/>
Now the things which are <hi>performed</hi> in the congregation, are of the same qualitie; euen <hi>holy things:</hi> namely the whole publike worship of God, stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing especially in the Ministerie of 1. <hi>Word,</hi> 2. <hi>Sacrament,</hi> 3. <hi>Prayer,</hi> 4. <hi>Keyes</hi> of the Church: of none of which can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that knowes them affirme truly, that it wanteth power &amp; perswasion to draw any godly heart vnto it.</p>
               <p>And first in these meetings it cannot bee denied, but that wee enioy a most comfortable and pretious treasure of <note place="margin">Benefits by the publick reading of the word.</note> the <hi>worde</hi> of God, and that both <hi>reade</hi> and <hi>preached,</hi> the weaker of which meanes wanteth not his fruitfull vse in the Church, that whosoeuer ascribeth not much vnto the publicke reading of the Scriptures: well considereth not the necessity of that ancient ordinance of God, who of olde <hi>would haue</hi> Moses <hi>reade euery sabboth,</hi> and instituted a <hi>lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the law and Prophets.</hi> The which <note place="margin">Act. 15. 21.

                  <hi>into the synagogue on the Sabboth day, and stood vp to read.</hi> And if here it bee asked, what are the speciall benefits reaped by this ordinance instituted out of the wisdome of God: I answer. First, It is a notable meanes to come to the knowledge of the history of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, wherein the chiefe workes that euer the Lord did in the Church are recorded, whether of iustice or of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, especially those of our fall in the first <hi>Adam,</hi> &amp; recouery by the second. Secondly, to confirme our faith in all the points of Christian faith and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: the maine grounds of which we haue fore-prophecied of in the old tes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament, and are fulfilled in the new.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To direct our iudgements in <hi>proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of all things; and holding that which is good,</hi> as the Baereans <hi>searched the Scriptures, to see whether the things were</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Act. 17. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>so</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> preached, which if it bee a fruite of priuate reading (as the rest also are) much more of publicke.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, to traine vs to the more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable hearing of the word preached. Fiftly, to acquaint vs with the phrase of the Scripture; so as wee can both
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:7938:30"/>
vnderstand, and speake the <hi>language of Canaan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But who can speake of the glory of <note place="margin">The bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of the word prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched.</note> our ministery, in regarde of the worde preached: which as a more ordinary and principall meanes leadeth vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long vnto saluation, by a more full manifestation of the promise of life: yea not onely <hi>explayning</hi> things to cleare them to the vnderstanding; but applying them vnto the heart and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and vrging them vpon the life and conuersation of a Christian. The blessed worke of which institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will euidently appeare, if wee consider the obiects vpon whome it worketh; and those bee eyther the <hi>vnconuerted,</hi> or <hi>conuerted,</hi> or <hi>both.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In regarde of the <hi>vnconuerted,</hi> it is the ordinarie meanes to beget them to God, by enlightening their eyes, opening their eares, mollifying their hearts, and working faith in their soules, <hi>which commeth by hearing.</hi> And what a blessed worke is this <note place="margin">Rom. 10.</note> whereby the sonnes of wrath become the sonnes of GOD? whereby those who are layd lowe in hell by sinne, are
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:7938:30"/>
raised vnto the glory of the highest heauen? and whereby the iust heyres of damnation are entituled into the state of saluation, to receiue inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance among those that are sanctified, In this excellent vse is it called a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie of <hi>reconciliation,</hi> of <hi>peace,</hi> a word of <hi>grace,</hi> of <hi>saluation,</hi> and of life. 2. In <note place="margin">2. Cor. 5. 18 Eph. 6. 15. Acts. 14. 3. Act. 20. 32</note> respect of those who are conuerted: It is a powerfull meanes of the spirit; First to encrease their knowledge, by the daily clearing of their iudgements from error, and ignorance; and leading them into all necessarie truths. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, to strengthen and encrease their faith, bringing it with dayly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse from the infancie and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of it, till the beleeuer attaine his tallnesse and strength in Christ.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, to call them from their dayly wandrings and strayings, and settle them in a godly course.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, to preuent their falles, whilest they are heere <hi>partlye</hi> fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with Christian Armour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst temptations; for through the Ministerie of the worde, <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than falleth like lightning from heauen.</hi>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:7938:31"/>
and his <hi>strongest holdes are cast downe:</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Luc. 10. 18 2. Cor. 10. 4.</note> partly while they are counselled in their doubts, finding the word in this Ministerie, especially the <hi>man of their counsels.</hi> Partly while they are admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished of such wayes as are disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to such an high calling as they haue vndertaken. Fiftly, to raise them out of falls, by discouering vnto them the nature and danger of sinne, the working of their owne infirmities, the bitter roote of originall corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: the poysoned fruites of it: and by many motiues continually prouoking their repentance, which was the scope <hi>Christs fore-runners Sermon;</hi> yea of his <hi>owne preaching,</hi> and <hi>of his Apostles.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Math. 3. 2. Marc. 1. 15 Acts. 2. 38</note> Sixtly, most absolutely to direct them through their whole Christian course. If they be alone, it affordeth them mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of holy meditation; that they are neuer lesse then alone, when they are most alone, except those can be alone, who walke with God. And if they bee to deale with others, it enableth them to become great lights; ready and furnished to instruct, and comfort abroade, to bee as eyes to the blinde:
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:7938:31"/>
and feete to bring the lame to Christ: and at home to teach and pray with their family, so as their houses become little <hi>Bethels,</hi> and houses of GOD, in which the Lord is truely and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly worshipped, and both them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues and the Churches in their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, dayly edified vpon their most holy faith.</p>
               <p>Now in regarde both of the wicked who are by the worde preached, more hardened, and of the godly whose number by the same meanes are day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly augmented and accomplished, the appearing of Christ vnto Judgement is hastened, which the Saints ought to long after, as in which they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, and shall attaine their full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in the <hi>Sacraments</hi> wee drinke yet deeper of the Lords boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, <note place="margin">Comfort by the holy sacraments.</note> who contenteth not himselfe to bring his children vnto the faith by the former meanes, vnlesse also hereby hee raise them vnto a full growth in Christ. As a tender mother accounts it not enough to bring forth her child, except shee also nursse and cherish it
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:7938:32"/>
vp vnto mans estate. So hath the Lord in these sacraments to shew the aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant sweetnesse of his loue in Christ, after hee hath in the word preached, made the couenant of grace knowne vnto men; hee also doth most surely seale it vp vnto their soules, by those <note place="margin">Rom. 4. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>seales of the righteousnesse of faith.</hi> The former sealing vp their vnion, ingraft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and fellowship with Christ, from whom as from a roote, they draw and sucke the moysture of grace, without which they are but dead, and withered branches. The latter assuring their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall grouth, and encrease in him, till they become tall trees of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and both of them further help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both our vnderstandings as <hi>glasses</hi> by which we see clearer into the miste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of our redemption; as also our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories, as <hi>monuments</hi> before our eyes, with which sence of learning our God would haue vs taught, as well as by the other of hearing: as in the third place both of them not onely spurring vp euery beleeuer to the performing of the couenant; but also strengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning him to euery good duty, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:7938:32"/>
hee may magnifie this grace of God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly for <hi>prayer,</hi> how vnspeakable <note place="margin">By publicke prayer how God is glorifyed.</note> is the glory of GOD rendred by the Church, gathered together, and how wonderfull are the blessings which are vouchsafed the Church from God, in and by meanes of this holy dutie, especially when they are assembled <hi>in the house of prayer?</hi> In the former re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde <note place="margin">Psal. 65. 2.</note> is it sayd by the Prophet, <hi>Praise waiteth for thee in Sion.</hi> For what grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter honour can befall the Lord, then first in petition to bee acknowledged the giuer of euery good and perfect gift? to bee depended vpon for all comfort, instruction and euery good grace: to bee acknowledged the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and finisher of our faith, the beginner and accomplisher of all our workes, in vs and for vs? and in the confession of our indignity and misery (euen the best) to haue his free grace amplified, and his prerogatiue yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him, whose priuiledge it is to say; <hi>I will forgiue?</hi> Secondly, in prayses to be magnified by his whole Church for
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:7938:33"/>
the fruites of his free loue, manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie shining in his workes of creation, redemption, preseruation, and salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Church: yea and when his people haue done all they can in way of thankfulnesse for them; yet euen the best of them shall acknowledge, that they cannot finde what to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der vnto him for his vndeserued loue: Thus the Tribes goe vppe to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to praise the name of the Lord. <note place="margin">Psa. 166. 18 Psal. 122. 4</note>
               </p>
               <p>In the second respect, what a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular priuiledge is it that wee haue leaue giuen vs by our requests to speake and commune with our God? and where-as the riche treasures of grace and good things are with him <note place="margin">The mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundantly enriched.</note> surely kept as vnder locke and key: how happily may wee by this meanes vnlocke and open them all vnto our selues? Yea that when wee cannot by any thing in vs or from vs demerite the least blessing (wee beeing lesse then the least mercy) yet if wee can but lift vppe one request of faith wee haue preuayled, and ouer-come God himselfe in the greatest.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:7938:33"/>
And if the prayer of <hi>one righteous man</hi> can preuaile so much as the scriptures testifie of <hi>Moyses, Iacob, Elias:</hi> how much more <hi>when two or three consent to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither</hi> in priuat prayer? But when pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like prayer is presented vp by many, yea the whole church; how can that but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in strength? For as in experience we see, many flowers bound together yeeld the stronger sent; and compound water is sweeter the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> simple; many sticks make a great fire; and vnited force more forceable: so euery christian alone and a part in this duty is acceptable vnto God; but when many ioyne in holy so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, they are much more pleasing vnto him, much more ioyfull among them-selues, and much more mutually incouraged to the practises of piety, &amp; loue one towards another.</p>
               <p>Publike breaches are soone made vp if many <hi>Moysesses</hi> stand vp in the gap. Publike peace if it be wanting is spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily and happily procured when many <hi>Eliases</hi> lift vp requests vnto the Lord, <note place="margin">Prayers of the faithful are the vvals and muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a people.</note> euery one of which are as strong as the <hi>Horsemen</hi> and <hi>Chariots of Israel.</hi> Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like blessings are easily obteyned when
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:7938:34"/>
many <hi>Iacobs</hi> wrastle together with the Lord: Fully resolued <hi>not to lette him goe vntill hee haue giuen them a blessing.</hi> The publike ministry is successefully <note place="margin">Rom. 15. 30. 2 Cor. 1. 11.</note> both setled and exercised when the Saints <hi>striue</hi> with their Ministers by <hi>prayers to God for them:</hi> and when the faithfull <hi>labour together in praier</hi> for the same purpose.</p>
               <p>The priuate necessities also of any one priuate member of the Church, are soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner supplied by the instance and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of the whole; and such as cannot come vpon their owne feet (as the <hi>man sicke of the palsie</hi>) are lette downe by the cordes of the churches pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <note place="margin">Luk. 5. 19.</note> and sette before Christ. A power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and preuayling thing is it with the Lord when a number of beleeuers are in one place, and one accord, of one heart, and one soule as it were in many bodies, to whom hee hath giuen one heart and one way, yea one pure lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage to cal on his name and serue him with one shoulder. Fourthly, if vnto <note place="margin">Zep, 3. 9. Act. 2. 46. &amp; ver. 32. Ier, 32. 39.</note> the three former we shal ad the last part of the ministry performed in our holy meetings, we shall see both the glory of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:7938:34"/>
God further inlarged, &amp; the benefit of the church amplified. For here we haue also to our vnspeakable good, the <hi>Keyes of the Kingdome</hi> opening and shutting heauen; the power of binding or loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of sinners. The authority of deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to Satan the obstinate sinners and releasing the penitent. Now what glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is it to the almighty when his iust sentence is before hand denounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the vngodly of the earth? Where by him-selfe is cleared in his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and the sinner more iustlie wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped vp in the bandes of death which he had no care to preuent.</p>
               <p>And on the other side no lesse comfort it is for the humble soule in the same Ministerie of the Word preached to bee fully released from sinne, and absolued from all his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousnesse, and assured that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer such sentence is rightly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced in Earth is ratified also in Heauen.</p>
               <p>These thinges beeing of such an high nature, as in which the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke worshippe of GOD is perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to his so great glorie, and our
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:7938:35"/>
own so great good, no marueil if <hi>Dauip</hi> be so instant in his desire: &amp; yet these things were after a sort vailed and but shadowed in that ministry of the sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary. For the Arke it selfe was with curtaines, and there lay no high way vnto it, no not for <hi>Dauid</hi> him-self: only men must look towards it in their <hi>prayers.</hi> And within that Arke were <note place="margin">1 Kings. 8. 9.</note> hidde and chested vppe the tables of the couering representing the <hi>VVord,</hi> read and preached: In the Tabernacle also was the golden potte of Mannah a speciall type of our <hi>Sacraments:</hi> and the rod of <hi>Aaron</hi> shadowing the rod of the church <hi>Discipline.</hi> How much more should wee (were wee not so blockish as men hewne out of hard okes) reioyce in such an open and glorious face of Iesus Christ? Yea with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet account it our <hi>Blessednesse</hi> to dwel <note place="margin">Vers. 4.</note> in the Lords house, where we may euer praise him: because hereby wee come nearest vnto the life of iust and perfect men in heauen; to the which while wee frame our selues afore-hand, wee haue entred into some degree of their bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sednesse, as also of our owne.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:7938:35"/>
Thus farre wee hetherto discouered those beautyes of the house of God, both in respect of <hi>Persons</hi> present and <hi>holy thinges</hi> performed: which if men could see with bodily eyes, (as they cannot bee perceiued but by such as haue cleared eies) they would excite admirable loue and affection towardes them.</p>
               <p>Now we are to intreat of the <hi>priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,</hi> and benefits which Gods people <note place="margin">The priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the assemblyes.</note> reape by frequenting the same: and the rather that such as perhaps little regard the glory of God, shining in his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, brighter then the Sunne in his strength, might yet for their owne ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage and profitte bee perswaded with diligence and reuerence in this his house to seeke the face of the <hi>LORD.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now although the priuiledges be as manyfold in number, as excellent in their quallity: yet I will content my selfe to note <hi>foure</hi> of them: and these foure rather then any other, because I see them to bee such as moued in the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> aboue all other these holy and ardent desires; as in euery of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:7938:36"/>
them will plainely appeare.</p>
               <p>First, the benefit of <hi>light</hi> and instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The first work that the Lord doth <note place="margin">1 Instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> in these little worlds (as once in the great) is to seperate light and darknes in such as are in Christ created againe vnto good workes. For which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the Lord him-selfe by his spirit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth the Schoolmaister of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, teaching them to know him in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in his Christ: to beleeue, to worke and walke. Heere in his house (setting a coppy to all maisters of fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyes what to doe in their houses) hee openeth his treasures of wisdome, and teacheth no triuiall matters: But first, for their <hi>necessitie,</hi> matters of life and death. Second, for their dignitie such misteries as flesh and blood can neuer attayne vnto; partly concerning God, as the doctrine of the Trinity. Partly concerning Christ, as of his incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, conception, vnion of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and partly concerning our selues. As our resurrection, life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall all which are matters of faith. Third, for their <hi>vse</hi> such as perswade
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:7938:36"/>
the truth, preserue fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> error, raize such as are faine, strengthen those that stand, comfort the afflicted, pacifie the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, confirme the certaine hope of life eternall, and deliuer the deeds of it into our hands: &amp; indeed the benefit of our redemption and whole saluation by Christ were little worth without these holy meanes whereby it is reuealed and applyed vnto vs.</p>
               <p>This is that benefit which our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet expresseth in the beginning of the verse following. <hi>For the LORD GOD is the Sunne</hi> That is look what the Sunne is to the World, that is the <hi>LORD GOD</hi> to his Church the Sunne of the World is not so necessary to lighten the day, as this Sunne of the Church to lighten the darkenesse and dungeon of the soules of men: without w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> (seeing all our heauenly lght is from it) our estate is far more vncomfortable then that of the <hi>Egiptians</hi> in their <note place="margin">Exod. 10. 23.</note> three daies darkenesse: for here no man can all his dayes stirre out of the place where his naturall corruption hath sette him. And where shines this Sun
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:7938:37"/>
but in the church, this is the <hi>Goshen</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Downe go Dagon and <hi>Diana</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Arke.</note> where this light is: In the ministry especially it displayeth the beames of it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, necessary prouision both for <hi>sustenance</hi> and <hi>safety</hi> of soule and <note place="margin">2. Suste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and safety.</note> body. First for the <hi>susteining</hi> of the <hi>soule</hi> heere, is milke, and stronger meat: here wee haue the Lord pouring out all his goodnesse: Here the great King prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth a great supper, killeth his fatlings, prepareth his milke and wine, spreadeth his table, setteth on it Iesus Christ the bread and water of life: whose flesh is meat indeed; whose blood is drinke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed: Here he by his ministers inuiteth and intreateth men to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> banquet: here he filleth the hungry and thirsty soule with good things: worketh new stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth of life and grace; as reioycing in God; peace of good conscience, ioy in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost, watchfulnesse against sinne, comfort in tribulation, quicknesse and strength in good duties, boldnesse in good causes, and a life led and finished in faith and obedience. Here the Lord <hi>clotheth</hi> the naked soule, and putteth on it the Lord Iesus Christ, whose righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:7938:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>
becommeth the costly and comely rayment of it. Heere hee <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richeth</hi> the poore soule with treasures of grace and godlynesse. Heere by the fire of his spirit hee <hi>warmeth</hi> and reui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the staruen soule. Here is the <hi>tree of life</hi> for the sicke soule, the leaues whereof serue to cure the nations. In a word; Christ offered and receiued in the Ministry, is food and Phisicke, cloth and warmth, wealth and health, life and length of daies, yea all in all vnto the soule of all his beleeuing ones. And 2. for <hi>bodily</hi> food and rayment with other necessaries for the life present, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though those who ar without y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church inioy them; yet they haue them not in that speciall blessing and comfort, as the members of the church; who 1. haue them by vertue of that special promise: <hi>First seeke the Kingdome of God, and other things shal be cast on you:</hi> &amp; 2. hold them by a right and title in Christ: and 3. are taught how to imploy them to the glory of the giuer, all which make these blessinges good to them as they are in them-selues.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for <hi>perfection and safety:</hi>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:7938:38"/>
1. <hi>Spiritual,</hi> here is a shadow &amp; sweete <note place="margin">Satan foy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, armies of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfited.</note> refuge against the whole wrath of God appeased by Christ: here we see sin sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, death vanquished, righteousnes purchased, great deliuerance wrought for the soules of beleeuers: here we haue strength in temptation, and victory o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer our selues: for here is Gods grace reueled which is sufficient for vs.</p>
               <p>Now this saluation of God is not els<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wher to be heard off, but in the tidings which we bring; nor reuealed vnto any but the true members of the church. <hi>In</hi> Mount Sion &amp; <hi>in</hi> Ierusalem <hi>shall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance.</hi> As for <hi>temporal</hi> perfection: <note place="margin">Ioel. 2. 32.</note> whereas when men are cast out of the <note place="margin">Icr. 15. 2.</note> sight of God (as vnbeleeuers who are without the pale of Gods protectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) they ly ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto the <hi>sword, famine, cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuity,</hi> to the <hi>dogs to teare,</hi> to the <hi>foules of heauen,</hi> &amp; the <hi>beasts of the field to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour:</hi> so on the contrary the neerer God the surer of safety; for iudgements flye farre fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God. Hence is it that to the members of the church, safety is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised vnder the shadow of the winges of the almighty, especially while they are in the performa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of publick duties before the Lord, and it is worthy our
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:7938:38"/>
obseruing that the Lord in making that law of the three feastes, wherein all the men three times euery yeare must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire before the Lord &amp; continue each <note place="margin">A far iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny daies trauel. A seruice of long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, seuen daies at a time, their wiues might be indange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, their virgins vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, their goods spoiled.</note> time in his worshippe together many daies, preuenteth all their obiections: for they might say, but wil not this giue great aduantage to the enemy to watch such times to win their cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tries again, Which in any one of those three times in our so long absence from our houses, leauing none to defend the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but women &amp; childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they might easily enter vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? Or were it not fit if there must be three such meetings y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the people of one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince should assemble at one of them, &amp; they of another at the second, and so in the third: then to leaue the whole cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try at once without men, and strength exposed to such certaine danger? No saith the Lord: come before me euery man thrise a yeare, for no man shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire thy land, when thou shalt appeare before the LORD <hi>Exodus,</hi> 34. 24, himself would be the strength of it at y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> time, &amp; so watch it as the enemy should not so much as desire it: the like we may obserue in their gathering of Mannah euery day in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> morning w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> was not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce vnto gods co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:7938:39"/>
but a special resemblance and shadow of seeking Iesus Christ in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> parts of his worship. Now herein seemed to lie no smal danger towards them; For either the enimies w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> were continually troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesom vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> might take their camps whilst the whole host was abroad ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering Mannah, or else they might lye in ambush in the wildernes for the host about y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place wher the Mannah fell: yet for al their danger (&amp; notwithstanding they had many skirmishes in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes) wee neuer read y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this was any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduantage vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The Lord so wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched them &amp; theirs, that neuer by their gathering of Mannah nor in that time and place they wer disparaged, no nor set vpon: for the eye of the Lord is most vpon them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ar nearest vnto him. Set thy selfe to gather Mannah in the ministry thou shalt not faile of Gods protection. And this the Prophet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> in the second place teacheth in the vers following. For <hi>God is the Sun and shield.</hi> And hereby he prouoked himself often into the presence of God in the assemblies, and the rather in that now he was so hunted out of euery corner;
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:7938:39"/>
and euery day brought him more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then other, that there was often but a step between him and death; hee had great cause to long after that defence and safety which the Lord reacheth out to such as haue libertye with good heartes to worship before him in his Temple. Thirdly, strong <hi>consolation</hi> for al conditions of life, euen such as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise <note place="margin">3 Comfort for all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.</note> would be most vnco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fortable. For when the people of God are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed with such iudgements and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, whether without or within them, as they cannot tell what way to turne them; when changes of sorrowes come thicke and threefold one in the neck of an other: when whole armies of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations besiege them; so as they see no way of issue &amp; escape: here are they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to set their eies vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord; who pittying them as a father the child which he loueth; wil not suffer them to sink in their sorrow; but holds them vp by the chin, that they perish not in their trouble. For heere come they to know 1. that the Lords manner is first to giue strength, and then the burden w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> shal not bee aboue that strength. 2.
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:7938:40"/>
that the Lord must rule in his house, and necessarily must administer out of his iustice as wel correction as reward, and draw euen his deare ones vnto him as well by the rods of men, as by the cords of loue; which is a singular prop vnto their patience. So as they can be wel contented vnder it. 3. y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> though their troubles be neuer so great, yet he will deliuer them out of al in due seaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 4 that he wil make these afflictions so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraign and wholesom vnto them; and turn euen their sufferings to their best; <hi>all things fall out to the best to them that</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 28.</note> 
                  <hi>loue God.</hi> Thus the Lord maketh good his promise to such as conscionably seeke him in his ordinance, <hi>as one whom his mother comforteth so shall you in</hi> Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem. <note place="margin">Isa 66. 13. Psal. 119. 92.</note> Whereas if the word were not their comfort they were sure to perish in their trouble.</p>
               <p>Besides here the people of GOD reape the comfort of their prayers; for as a King receiueth petitions at the Court; or as a maister of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily is ready to heare and receiue all the complaintes and requestes of his children and seruantes: euen so the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:7938:40"/>
LORD in this house giueth free ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse vnto him-selfe; and for their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement herein freely promiseth, that hee will bee ready to heare their prayers, behold their sighs, put their teares into his bottle, send no man awaie emptie, and cast none in the teeth for his importunity so it bee gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded aright.</p>
               <p>Seeing thererfore that heere are such consolations to bee attayned as the whole Worlde besides cannot giue, nor take away; so certaine, so seasonable, so spirituall, so perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall: Which of vs haue not as much reason to wish the fruition of such a gratious presence of GOD were it but for one day, aboue all other all our dayes as <hi>Dauid</hi> did? This holy man well knewe that one day was but short in comparison of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dayes: But yet their reioycing with the Church in the Church as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblyes for one daie was worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to bee preferred before the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioycing of many dayes without the Church; in that the waight of this ioy recompensed the shortnes of it
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:7938:41"/>
self; &amp; counteruailed the length of the other, being vnspeakably glorious. This third priuiledge is that w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> he in the third place mentioneth as a steele spur to his affection: where in the next vers he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth that the Lord is <hi>(not onely the Sun &amp; shield)</hi> but <hi>grace</hi> in his church, that is, gratiously accepteth in his Christ, 1. the persons, and then the prayers of such as are assembled in spirit &amp; truth to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship him and call vppon his name.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Blessednes and <hi>saluation</hi> w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> is not ordinarily out of these assemblies <note place="margin">4. Eternal happines.</note> to be attained. A true saying it is, that, none can haue God his father, that hath not the church for his mother, neither can any testifie himselfe a childe of the Church; but by the dutiful acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of hir whensoeuer God shewes hir face. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Iacob</hi> was awake out of his sleepe in which the Lord had appeared vnto him: Hee said, <hi>This is the house of GOD, this is the gate of heauen,</hi> in like manner may <note place="margin">Gen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 28. 17.</note> wee conceiue and speake of these pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in which it pleaseth the <hi>LORD</hi> so gratiously to appeare vnto vs; this is no other then the gate; these are
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:7938:41"/>
surely the suburbes of heauen. Out of <note place="margin">

The Lord saue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>th none whom he first <hi>addeth not vnto the Church.</hi> And the Scriptures attribute saluation (but yet ministeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally) to the wombe, brests, and lappe of the Church, which is <hi>the Mother of vs</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 4. 26.</note> 
                  <hi>all.</hi> And of <hi>Sion</hi> is it sayd, that <hi>many are borne in her.</hi> And this last was not the <note place="margin">Psal. 87. 5.</note> least motiue which stirred in our holy Prophet these instant desires. <hi>The Lord is grace and glory;</hi> not onely because the Lord is the glory of his people, here and hereafter; Nor that onely in the Church the Lord reueileth his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, but also because he leadeth his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren vnto it by the meanes there by his wisdome appointed.</p>
               <p>Now considering the places where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our feete stand are holy ground, the persons present holy and glorious; the duties performed holy and spirituall; the priuiledges of Gods people so prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and aboundant in all these re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardes, can we doe lesse then wish our portions and shares in them? and doth
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:7938:42"/>
it not now seeme a most reasonable and religious wish to spend if it were but one day here, rather then a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand else-where? or shall wee still neede many goads to prouoke vs to loue, or rejoyce in Ierusalem, <hi>where wee may thus suck and bee satisfied with the brest of her consolation, where wee may milke out and bee delighted with the</hi>

                  <hi>brightnesse of her glory?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If wee would haue our hearts iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie vs in this holy reioysing, our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour <note place="margin">Vse. 1.</note> must bee to see dayly further into these beauties of Gods house, which may rauish our hearts with the loue of it aboue all other places in the earth.</p>

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:7938:45"/>
the wilde beast of the Forrest to haue broken downe our hedge, throwne our pale to the ground; and with a prophane foote, troden downe and rooted vp all our holy things; they see no beauty, but all deformity and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse in our Churches; which yet they will not vouchsafe that name; but sties of vncleane beasts, cages of filthy birds, and rudiments of <hi>Babilon.</hi> Thus they vexe themselues aboue measure, in seeking Ministers, callings, people of God, and Churches: and because they cannot finde a man in the market, they seperate from our assemblies.</p>
               <p>To which I answer, that though it be <note place="margin">It is inough for thy Church to be without spotte or wrinckle in heauen.</note> not the condition of our or any Church to be free from all blemish and spotte, yet is hee as blinde as a Mole, and pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pably deluded, that can espy no beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie therein. What? is our Mother so black as shee hath no comlinesse? or because perhaps she wants some beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, hath shee lost her face? sure I am, that where there is the face of God in the midst of his people there is a face of the Church: and where God is present, there is the house of God: But in our

assemblies wee haue God present tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching his people: yea wee haue Christ present in the word and Sacraments, euen crucified before our eyes, who is the image of his Father. Wee haue the presence of the blessed spirit of God (which they cannot deny) enlightning the vnderstandings, softning the hearts, comforting the consciences; powring forth his graces of faith, of hope, of loue, and that in aboundant manner in this his owne ordinance vpon many thousand soules which are dayly added vnto the Church: and therefore what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer wee yet want, let vs thankfully acknowledge that wee want not the presence of God, nor the house of God, nor the face of God, before which his people present themselues with liberty, and protection ioyning together in the pure worship of his name, to his end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse praise, and their owne vnspeakable comfort.</p>
               <p>Howsoeuer therefore Sathan work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth according to his accustomed craft to trouble our sight; let vs bee more wise and wary then to bee ledde from the beholding of the face of God, and

               <p>And let such as are so readye to bee mislead, acknowledge with thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse their spirituall father that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat them to God: their Mother the Church that bare them: her brests the Testaments that gaue them milke, and that shee is not since their birthe so weakened, but that shee is as able to preserue them as to bring them forth: and to feede them with stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger meate, so to bring them to their tallnesse in Christ.</p>
               <p n="2">2. An other sorte of them who <note place="margin">Reeusants.</note> wilfully by excommunicating them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues out of our assemblies, deliuer them-selues to Sathan, are <hi>Popish min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded persons,</hi> who because they cannot see neither their little breaden God in our Sacraments; nor their wooden guilded Gods in our worshippe: and because they cannot heare GOD speake Latin in our Churches; nor our Ministers inuocating Saints and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in our Prayers: therefore sure heere are no foote-steppes of GOD:
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:7938:46"/>
nor so much as the rudements of his worshippe and seruice: hence they refuse all communication with vs in <note place="margin">Papists must see their God because they cannot beleeue him.</note> worde, Sacraments, Prayers, and Church seruice; and ioyne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in a worshippe wherein they neede not bee at the paines to seeke a God sitting so high as in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, seeing they can haue him at home in a boxe; who if hee chance to putrifie or corrupt; or bee deuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of Mice, they can haue a new one made by the Priest and Baker toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther euery day.</p>
               <p>A worshipp in which if they haue <note place="margin">Implicit faith.</note> no knowledge, no faith of their owne, the knowledge and faith of the Church will besteede them; nay if they can beleeue as the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeues, although they knowe not what the Church dooth beleeue: a worshippe wherein if they neyther can praye them-selues, nor yet gette CHRIST to bee an intercessor for them: yet they canne procure a thousand Mediatours besides of
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:7938:47"/>
Saints, Angels; and if these should faile, they haue the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> at a dead lift to command her sonne in the right of a Mother to clemencie. A worship wherein if they can neither abstaine from sinne, nor yet repent of it in truth, yet if they can pay well, a little pennance shall acquit them. A worship wherein if they neuer were good, nor did good: yet their Church hath a treasurie, which (vpon another condition,) can supply them of good workes, which some man who in his life time was too good bequeathed to such purposes. Oh vaine worship, and full of delusion, not more plausi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the corrupt nature of man, then dishonorable to the high Maiestie of God!</p>
               <p>And were these things true, who could blame him that hath resolued to liue and dye a Papist? but alas that poore soules should bee held in such chaines of darknesse and death! The Lord in his good time open the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son doores, and strike off the boults from so many as belong to him, that

they may see them-selues set free from such woefull estate, as where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they laye bound by Sathan and his instruments euen vnder damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>And yet more fearefull is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of such of them as haue had their error discouered by the cleere sunne-shine of the Gospell, and yet are setled vpon their lees, vpon no better ground then like so many <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zillaes,</hi>

Dost thou not see this holy Prophet who was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced both in knowledg and holynes aboue the most liuing; and dwelt as an Angell in the World; yet did not he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge himselfe greatly to stand in need of stirring vp by these meanes gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen of God for that end?

               <p>And first I say this is a foolish con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of restlesse spirits, who yet take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them to bee wiser then God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe: who (howsoeuer the word might seeme to carry much more authority in the mouth of an Angell, then of an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Minister, who is but a weake man yet) herein bewraied his infinite. 1. <hi>mercy.</hi> 2. <hi>loue.</hi> 3. <hi>wisdom,</hi> in establishing this holy ordinance, &amp; no other perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually to continue in his church vnto the end of the world.</p>
               <p>His <hi>mercy</hi> shineth out in this; that knowing our infirmity, and wherof we <note place="margin">Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy herein.</note> are made, it pleaseth him to condiscend vnto it. Hee might by terrible voyces, out of lightnings, thunders and earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes, such as would breake the rocks them-selues before him, force our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, or send his Angels furnished with power and strength for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent execution of vengeance vppon all such as deny their present obedience to their word: but in compassion vnto vs hee chooseth to teach vs by a stil
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:7938:52"/>
voyce; by a more familar and fitte in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction for vs, euen by such as our selues, of our owne nature: farre mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for our weakenesse then if he should either in his owne Maiestie teach vs; or by natures fo farre superiour vnto vs as the Angels. And this appeared plainely in giuing the law, when the people once hearing the voyce of God came trembling to <hi>Moyses,</hi> and made request in these wordes. <hi>Talke thou with vs and wee will heare, but lette not</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Exod, 20. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>God talke with vs, least wee die:</hi> and it was generally receiued of old; that if any man did either heare this <hi>voyce;</hi> or <hi>see the face of the great God:</hi> the great <note place="margin">Dut, 5. 26.

Yea <hi>Moyses</hi> him-self could not haue beheld the back-partes of the LORD, if the LORD had not <hi>hidde him in the cleft of a Rocke,</hi> and <hi>couered him with his hand till he passed by.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His loue towards man manifesteth it selfe heerein: that hee vouchsafeth <note place="margin">Gods loue herein.</note> to putte his voyce in the mouth of man, rather then of Angels. What an aduancement is it to the nature of man,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:7938:52"/>
that the high GOD should sanctifie their tongues, to deliuer his good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to the sonnes of men? to be trust them with such high misteries, and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of such blessed and <hi>sauing</hi> vse to <note place="margin">1 Tim, 4. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>them-selues and others?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His <hi>wisdome</hi> discouereth it selfe in this ordinance sundry waies. 1. In that <note place="margin">The wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of god herein.</note> teaching man by man hee preuenteth the danger of deceipt and delusion which wee should lye open vnto if we should bee taught by reuelations, or visions, or appearance of Angels. For Satan is an Angel of light; hee can also assume him a body, and in it by Gods permission broch lies, and as though he were among the sonnes of God, father them vpon God. Blessed be that wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hath deliuered vs a more certain word of the Prophets &amp; Apost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, shutting out al rouing <hi>Enthusiasmes</hi> &amp; reuelations not contained within it selfe; and hath sette vppe a Ministry in which his Church shall bee taught by man, subiect indeed to error but farre lesse dangerous then the former: in that wee haue a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine rule to trye the Spirites by
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:7938:53"/>
whether they bee of God or no: accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to which rule and worde if they speake not, there is no light in them.</p>
               <p>Second, hereby hee sheweth the mighty power of the word which (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it seeme in the hand of a weake man, a foolish meane of mens conuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) yet <hi>by this foolishnes of preaching the Lord saueth such as beleeue:</hi> This <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth. <hi>VVe haue this treasure in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. Cor. 4. 7. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>vessels that the excellency of that power might bee of God</hi> (that is knowne to bee of God) <hi>and not of vs:</hi> and this one thing hath confounded all the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of flesh, to see such <hi>weake</hi> and <hi>vile</hi> and <hi>dispised</hi> thinges bring such great things to passe. <note place="margin">1. Cor. 1. 27.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And thus all the glory of the worke of conuersion, redoundeth vnto God, to whome indeed of right it appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth. Thus the Apostles vsually turned off that praise &amp; glory which men pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posterously would haue fastned vppon them; that all the power of their word and workes might bee ascribed vnto God. When <hi>Peter</hi> had healed a Cripple that lay at the beautifull gate of the Temple, all the people came running, <note place="margin">Act<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3. 12</note>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:7938:53"/>
and gazing on him and <hi>Iohn,</hi> too much admiring their persons from whome they had seene such an euident worke: which when <hi>Peter</hi> perceiued, he check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth their ignorance. <hi>Yea men of</hi> Israel, <hi>why looke you so stedfastly on vs as though we by our own power or godlines had made this man go?</hi> And wisheth them to look vpward to <hi>the God of</hi> Abraham, Isaac <hi>and</hi> Iacob, <hi>who had glorified his sonne Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus; in whose name they had done this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So likewise when <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Lystra</hi> had healed an other lame man: the people <note place="margin">Act. 14. 11. 15.</note> conceiuing that the <hi>Gods were come downe in the likenesse of men,</hi> brought their Buls with garlands, &amp; their chiefe Priest to offer sacrifice to him and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas:</hi> which when the Apostles saw, they rent their clothes and staid them from y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> horrible Idolatry. <hi>Oh men why doe yea these things? VVee are euen men subiect to the like passions that ye bee,</hi> and so proceeded to preach the true God, and his son Christ vnto them. Euen so when men behold such mighty power in that word which is dispenced by men subiect to the same passions with
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:7938:54"/>
them-selues; that it is able to conquer the whole world and bring it to the knowledge and obedience of christ; to subdue nature and corruption of it; yea battereth the strongest holds of satan and destroyeth his Kingdome: easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly may they conceiue there is more power with it then any can bee in such poore men, and that is indeed the power &amp; strong arme of almightie God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The wisedome of GOD here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by would proue and try our obedy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, whether we will heare his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters beeing men like our selues, no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise then wee would heare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, or Christ, or an Angel speaking from heauen.

If wee admonish, exhort, perswade, it is all one as if Christ should do it, who hath said: <hi>he that heareth you, heareth me.</hi> And in euery of these <hi>the sheepe of Christ heare his voyce,</hi> who is the great pastor of the sheepe, and not so much ours, and with <note place="margin">Iohn, 10.</note> the spouse of Christ saith: <hi>this is the voice of my welbeloued.</hi>

               <p>And further as the mercy, loue and wisedome of God hath established this ordinance, so also it will not be amisse in a word to see how hee hath euer

maintained this his owne order in his Church.</p>
               <p>And first the Angels haue another office designed them by God in the Church then to vsurpe the Ministry. And although the LORD imployed them in priuate messages vnto priuate persons; yet I remember not that euer in the publicke Ministry their office was to preach, but to set men on prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, and preserue them in teaching: we read that they were to reueale from God to his Prophets some part of his will: which the Prophets were to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to the Church, but the Church was not to depend on the ministry of the Angels but on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ministry of man. One <note place="margin">Zach. 2.4.</note> Angel commaundeth another to teach <hi>Zachary</hi> a prophecy which he must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer vnto the church concerning the building and repayring of the Citty and Temple, <hi>Go tell this young man.</hi> But nether of the Angels might publish this prophecie vnto the church.</p>
               <p>So the Eunuch sitting in his Chariot <note place="margin">Act. 8. 26.</note> reading the Scriptures and not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what hee read; an Angel sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth <hi>Philip</hi> to teach him. But why
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:7938:56"/>
did not the Angel teach the Eunuch him-selfe? Was it because he could not? Or if he could might not hee in such an extraordinary time haue saued <hi>Philip</hi> that tedious iourney between <hi>Gaza</hi> &amp; <hi>Azotus,</hi> which were distant a sunder a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout six &amp; thirty miles?

               <p>In like manner an Angel in a vision <note place="margin">Act, 16. 9.</note> stood before <hi>Paul like a man of</hi> Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia, <hi>&amp; praied him saying, come &amp; helpe vs in</hi> Macedonia; which was a calling of <hi>Paul</hi> to teach that people in the way of God.

The Lord Jesus him-selfe when he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook that function in which hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared himself the chiefe Doctor of his church; would first take flesh and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come man; and in that flesh declare his fathers name to his brethren. To which purpose the Apostle saith: that God <hi>in these last daies hath spoken by his son:</hi> that is very familiarly by his son made man. Yea further when he was ascended into his glory, hee would from thence shew him-selfe powerfull to <hi>Paul</hi> to the cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him to the ground, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> humbling <note place="margin">Act, 9. 6.</note> of his heart by terror &amp; astonishment, and so to the preparing and fitting of him vnto instructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but when he comes to be taught he <hi>sendeth him into the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:</hi> he leaueth al y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> function vnto <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias.</hi> Wherin he expresly in his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample teacheth that it was his good pleasure that, that ministry of Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and teachers which hee hadde a little before his ascension established in the Church, for the gathering toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his Saintes, for the worke of the Ministry and the edification of the body of Christ should bee inuiolably <note place="margin">Eph, 4. 12, 13.</note>

preserued in the Church till his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming againe, wherein wee shall all meete together in the vnity of the faith and knowledge of the sonne of GOD, vnto a perfect man and vnto the measure of the age of the fulnesse of Christ.</p>
               <p>And lastly as we haue already suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently <note place="margin">Vntrue that those who would bee taught by Angels would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue.</note> shewed the folly of such who wil needs be wise aboue and against God, so also in one word the Scripture shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vs how false that is which they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. For those who haue <hi>Moyses</hi> and the Prophets and will not beleeue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>neither would they beleeue if one shoulde come from the dead.</hi> So we say that those who will not beleeue the Lord spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in our Ministery, lette an Angel come from heauen, lette a diuell come from hell, yet will they not beleeue. And the reason is plaine; because in the begetting of faith wee must not consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the maked word; but as it is ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and accompanied with the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of GOD whose worke properly it is. Now seeing that the spirit ordinarily worketh in the meanes
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:7938:57"/>
appointed by God; it followeth that who-soeuer despiseth the meanes in which the spirit worketh, wanteth that spirit of God which ordinarily work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not without those meanes, which spirit so long as they want, they would not beleeue Angels nor men, dead nor liuing, neither <hi>Moses,</hi> nor the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, <note place="margin">Obiections of idle and lazie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants.</note> neither <hi>Peter</hi> nor <hi>Paul,</hi> no nor Christ himselfe if he were liuing againe vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the face of the earth. And thus ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing somwhat more largely satisfied y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> allegation, we come to take out of the wayes of two sorts of protestants such Lions as they faine, to lye betweene them and the Church. The former sort are idle and lazie Protestants, that are so farre from being at the cost of seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and sending for the worde: that when it commeth to seeke them, and freely offereth it selfe vnto them; yet will they not disease them-selues to stirre ouer their threesholds for it.

For did wee euer heare a man in his wittes reason thus madly? why I hope wee may liue with a great many fewer meales, then two euery day. I hope to eate meate once in a moneth, or once in a quarter were very suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; and one meale well eaten were better then all these meales. Now if wee would thinke him mad that in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest should thus reason against his life: how can wee thinke him any better, that vpon no other ground is resolued to starue his soule being his better part? which yet no lesse needeth his dayly bread then the bodye doth. The Iewes must go forth euery morning to
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:7938:59"/>
seeke Mannah, and to gather it; which they did cheerefully: for although they some-times vnthankfully fell out (like children with their meate,) yet it seemes they grudged not their labour of gathering it dayly: nay whereas they were commanded to gather it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the sixe dayes, and in the sixt day double for it selfe and the seauenth, yet they runne out the seauenth day too, against the commandement to gather <note place="margin">Exo. 16. 27.</note> it. God might haue giuen them an haruest of Mannah once a yeare, as hee doth of graine vnto vs, or once a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or once a moneth: but his wisdome saw it good to put them to more paines to gather it once a day. And wherefore? not onely because hee would haue them depend vpon him for their daily bread: but also because it was a type of Christ himselfe, who is that <hi>true bread which came downe from heauen:</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 6. 48.</note> whome both they and all beleeuers were dayly to hunger after, and dayly to seeke in such means as himselfe hath appointed: as whose obtaining and finding is well worth our dayly paines and industry. And surely the very Iewes
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:7938:59"/>
shall rise vp in iudgement against all such Christians who will bee at no paines to seeke and finde Iesus Christ the true bread of life, of whom who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer tasteth hee shall liue for euer: whereas the other were so painfull, without reasonings to meete with that foode which was but a shadow leading vnto him: and of which our Sauiour saith; <hi>Your Fathers eate Mannah in the</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Secondly consider whether the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <note place="margin">Ancient beleeuers at more pains then vve.</note> beleeuers came to heauen so easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as our daintie Protestants meane to doe. Wee read that those who were to worship in the old Testament, must rise and get them out of their houses, and build altars vnto the Lord: they must bee both at paines and costes in the <note place="margin">Gen. 12. 7. 8 &amp; cap. 26. 25. &amp; cap. 35. 3.</note> seruice of their God. So did <hi>Abraham, Isaac, Iacob,</hi> and the Patriarches: and after them all the while that the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall law stood in force, euery male must thrice a yeare appeare before the Lord at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> were his dwelling neuer so remote or distant from the temple: yea they could goe marching forward with-out fainting through

droughts and droppes, and would not giue ouer vntill they mette the Lord in <hi>Sion.</hi> Now if they tooke so much paines to seeke Christ in shadowes and obscurity in comparison; it is sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worth our double paines to enioy the substance, truth, and shining bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of Christ, as at this day wee doe through the blessing of GOD in admirable euidence and clearenesse. But although the Lord hath granted vs liberty to make shorter cuttes, and neede not so tire out ourselues in wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie pilgrimage to seeke his face, this is our condemnation that wee will not scarce goe out of our doores to meete with our GOD. The Queene of <hi>Saba</hi> that measured so many miles to heare the wisdome of <hi>Salomon,</hi> shall certainely rise vppe in iudgement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst our people, who hauing a greater then <hi>Salomon</hi> here, are so farre from admiring, that they despise and contemne his wisdome.</p>
               <p>But not to goe further in this point where bee the spirits of the faithfull martyrs of the former age, who haue passed the fire and water, and sword,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:7938:60"/>
and banishment, and all to enioy our liberties, which a number of vs (their posteritie) count so slightly of as of the paring of our nailes?</p>
               <p>Yea, where are become our home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne, and ancient professors, who in the beginnings of the Gospell haue accounted foure, sixe, tenne, or more miles, a small Sabboth dayes iourney to heare a Sermon? such sweetnesse they found in the word, such a sweete face of God they beheld in his house, that they would haue gone a foote, nay bare-foote, rather then haue mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of that comfort. Surely the Lord hath either taken away ancient pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors without succession; or else our eyes doe see a fearefull apostacie.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, consider here whether euer any idolaters were so idle and secure <note place="margin">Idolaters more pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in their Idolatrie then we in the truth.</note> in the worshippe of their false Gods, as many Christians professing the worshippe of the true GOD. And heere I might marshall the rankes of olde and latter ones, to whome no labours, no paines, no losses were accounted tedious or bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densome: euen while they offered
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:7938:61"/>
their sweat and bloud also in sacrifice to the Diuell. What shall I speake of those who mingled the pittifull cryes of their tender children with their Musicke, while they were cast into the fire to bee burnt vp in sacrifice vnto the idoll <hi>Molec?</hi> what of the trauells and paines of the Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, that would compasse sea and land to make a <hi>Proselite?</hi> What of Baals Priests lancing and cutting their flesh, before their idoll?</p>
               <p>The blinded Papists at this day whip them-selues, make their faces leane with fasting, waste and consume their bodies with tedious pilgrimages to see some dead and rotten bones, and visit some apish idolls: shall now these sata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall seruices bee so auaileable to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den the vnbeleeuer against any crosses and bitternesse; that they will refuse no paine to goe to hell? and shall not the Lords owne ordinances and true religion carry so much power with them, as to bring those who professe them-selues his people out of their gates to knowe the right waye to heauen?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:7938:61"/>
Fourthly what doth this heauinesse vnto these ordinances argue but hearts out of heart with the best desires? for what we loue and desire, no paines see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth painfull for it. Many of these same persons will bee well content to toyle day by day, fare hard, breake their sleepe, eate the bread of carefulnesse; &amp; all to lay a little money and wealth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; and some-times they scarce knowe for whome: and yet all this paines from day to day, is but a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure vnto them, because their hearts and affections are carryed vnto and set vpon things below. In like manner did the loue of God and Christ take vp the heart of any man (as euery member of the true Church is sicke of this loue) the sweetnesse of the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises of religion, in which it is more and more conueyed into beleeuing soules, would bee sweeter then wine: that is, then most tastefull outward de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights. Nay this loue would shew it selfe stronger then death, nothing <note place="margin">Cant. 8. 6.</note> but death (if death it selfe) can dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue it; much water cannot quench it, many floods cannot drowne it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:7938:62"/>
that is; Many crosses, afflictions, tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls cannot vtterly ouer-come or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish it. Yea a mans whole sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance will bee contemned in regarde of it. This sparckle of heauenly fire and seruencie will constraine a man, to cleaue vnto the Lord in his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and groweth in time to such a burning desire of the glory of God as is able to carry a man beyond himselfe, yea euen to consume him, as <hi>Dauids</hi> zeale to Gods house did consume him.</p>
               <p>And would to God all such secure Christians would at length begin to <note place="margin">A glasse for secure chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians to see their dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</note> conceiue of their danger, which is fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to such eyes as can behold it. For first, they are for the present destitute of the spirit of God, and so of all sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing graces, and lye vnder a fearefull damnation. Which truth is euident, in that wheresoeuer the spirit of God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth to dwell, there hee stirreth vp the heart to some good measure of cheerefulnesse in well-dooing, and kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth it in a readinesse, and prepared<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to euery good worke. For the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the spirit is not onely to enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the eye of the soule, that it can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:7938:62"/>
the beauties of Gods house, which it could neuer prie into before: but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to worke the will, and make it of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing a willing wil. So as if before the presence of the spirit a man were as loth to heare, pray, read, as a Beare to the stake; now he is changed by that spirit which will not be idle: and is become a man wanting often power and abilitie; but to wil that which is good is present with him: the reasonings of the flesh, are partly subdued: the vnreadinesse which foiled his good duties before is in part foiled, &amp; according to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of knowledge and faith, is the measure of his obedience daily increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: which things whosoeuer: hee bee that findeth them not in himselfe, hee hath not the spirit of Christ, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently is none of his.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They are lead by the spirit of sathan who ruleth in the hearts of the disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, whose old pollicie it is by this very perswasion of ease, to keepe such from the pure worship of God, as hee would make seruiceable in all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of vnrighteousnesse. When the Lord had commanded all <hi>Israell</hi> that
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:7938:63"/>
they should appeare before him to worship him in spirit and truth at <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem:</hi> the diuell deuised a tricke, of which hee made <hi>Ieroboam</hi> his instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <note place="margin">1. King. 12. 28.</note> which indeed turned to the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of all the ten tribes with most horrible idolatrie. He pitties the paines of the people; and it <hi>is too much for you to goe up to Ierusalem.</hi> It is a more <note place="margin">Vers. 27.</note> easie course and cutte to make two Calues, and set vp one at <hi>Dan,</hi> and an other at <hi>Bethel,</hi> and worship there. By this argument drawne from their ease, hee wonne all the people of God from their allegeance and seruice of their true GOD, to the worship of two Calues: and yet all was but out of pollicie, for hee feared if the people should <hi>goe to Ierusalem to worship, that their hearts would bee turned to their LORD euen to</hi> Rehoboam. Euen so the Diuell hauing taken captiue vnder his power such as are wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye departed from GOD, hath no waye to keepe them vnder his gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, but by keeping them from sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifizing at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> hee feareth if they should diligentlye frequent
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:7938:63"/>
the holy assemblies, and ioyne with other of the people of GOD in the word, prayer and Sacraments, that by this meanes they would returne to their naturall Lord. And therefore hee dayly suggesteth and perswadeth them to fauour them-selues, it is too great paines to goe to Church, you can pray at home, read at home, goe some time to Church to auoyde danger of lawe, and reproche of men, and it is enough. And as hee then preuailed, that <hi>the people went euen to Dan,</hi> so at this day, a number make Chappels of ease of their owne houses; others can pray as well (as their horses I had like to haue sayd, but) on their horse backes, as in the Church, whom for my part I can easily beleeue.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They haue a seale of perdition vpon them, whosoeuer forsake carelesly the assemblies of Gods people here in earth, they shall certainely bee sepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from them, when too late they shal wish they had been wiser then to haue accounted their wayes foolish. <hi>Let vs not forsake our fellowship as the manner</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 10. 25</note> 
                  <hi>of some is,</hi> saith the holy Apostle.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:7938:64"/>
Why what danger is there now and then to keepe from Church, I hope we may bee good Christians for all that? The Apostle tells vs a reason, because <hi>this is a with-drawing of our selues to</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Verse. 39.</note> 
                  <hi>perdition.</hi> It is to walke in the high waye to destruction. And indeede what other can such sworne enimies of Christ looke for, when cold Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians are sent away with such colde comforte euen from the dooing of those duties, which the other eyther neglect or contemne? for if the Lord threatneth his people, that although they might serue him in some out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward seemely sorte, yet if they <hi>did it not with cheerefulnesse, and a good</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 28. 47.</note> 
                  <hi>heart, they should serue their enemies:</hi> if such shall bee sent away with a cursse on their heads, can such as will neither haue <hi>part nor fellowship in this businesse,</hi> euer looke to bee heyres of blessing? Let them <hi>repent therefore of these their wickednesse, and praye GOD, that if it bee pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, the thought of their hearts may bee forgiuen them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly, what paines takest thou
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:7938:64"/>
here but for thine owne profit? thinke not that thy godlinesse benefiteth <note place="margin">Thy paints in religion profiteth thy selfe, not God.</note> GOD, but thy owne selfe: as thy Atheisme hurteth not him but thy owne soule. Thou hereby bringest thy selfe where thou mayest beholde the face of thy GOD, whereby thy paines is plentifully returned with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence. This face of God when it was yet vayled, did so draw the hearts of ancient beleeuers, that neither di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of place, nor difficultie of way, nor tediousnesse of weather, nor weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse or wearinesse of body could with-holde them from the beholding of in the place where hee had put his name.</p>
               <p>And is the sight of the face of the Lord so happilye vncouered in our Ministerie, not worth the paines of looking vpon? thy paines in this behalfe may entitle thee to all the priuiledges of Gods people before mentioned. And if those were not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough for thee, yet the God whom thou seekest (if thou so seeke him as hee is found of thee) hee is liberall and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing inough to make thy cup to runne
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:7938:65"/>
ouer aboundantly aboue all that wee haue spoken or can thinke, and though all thy seruice is but dutie and farre vnder that, yet the LORD will not take thy labour for naught. Hee challengeth the seruants in his Temple, whether euer any of them did so much as open the doores, or <note place="margin">Malac. 1. 10</note> kindle a fire for sacrifice freely and without wages; no hee allowed them liberallye for such vnder-seruices. How then may wee thinke will hee requite such as are continually about him in his eye, and still behold his face in the presence-Chamber of his Church?</p>
               <p>The latter sorte, which is also the last of which wee propounded to speake, are timerous and fearefull Christians, who thinke it better sleeping in a sound skinne, then in a sound consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: and because this diligent fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting of the Church, which we call them vnto, is not without some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proche among the prophane and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked <note place="margin">Ob.</note> of the world: they are lothe to pull their warme hands out of their bosome to sette to this Ploughe.

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Weerevnto I answer that as it is not amisse to cast our costes afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, yet must wee so lay our counters as that we desist not from building vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon our foundation: &amp; in casting these costes wee cannot say that this course is exempted from reproch: Nay seeing Satans mallice is no whit abated nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in him-selfe, nor in his instruments, wee affirme that there cannot a childe so soone be borne into the Church, but the <hi>Dragon standeth before the woman to bee deliuered, to deuoure her childe so soone as euer it is brought forth:</hi> and if he cannot do that, he casteth <hi>out of his</hi>

And pray for courage and resolution to hold thee on, vndaunted in thy godly course.

Some choose habitations for friends, ayre, waters, woods, walkes, fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and some other speciall commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, and hence commend them and there seate themselues and set downe their staffe, although Gods habitation be not there: the Ministrie is counted as an hang-by: if that bee there they count it neuer the better; if it be absent it is neuer a whit the worse, they care but a little too liue in the common ayre of Gods people, the familiaritie of Gods friends, the pleasures of Gods house, the sweete fruites of the spirit of God are not enquired after, nor tasted. Others retaine to atheists, scorners, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists; swearers, and if <hi>Peter</hi> can warme himselfe still by <hi>Caiphas</hi> fire hee can sweare and forsweare as they doe.

But here is a fearefull brand vpon such who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to make exchange of heauen for earth, and haue resolued that they will be gainers in the world, though it bee to the losse of their soules. Whosoeuer therfore thou art, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hast any care of thy soule; neuer liue if it be possible vnder an idoll, but where the worde is setled, and the ministery duly discharged. Buy the truth whatsoeuer it cost, yea with the losse of many outward things: be a meanes to thy abilitie to procure a standing Ministry to thy selfe &amp; thine: what comfort couldst thou haue to liue and dwell in a wildernesse among wild beasts, without men, or other comforts, in such a barren soile as no paines can ouer-come the inuincible stifnesse of the ground? and yet in such a place were it more comfortable for a godly heart to liue, then amongst a wicked people wanting meanes of grace and instruction. And if thou wouldst dwell in the loueliest part of the earth; choose such a place as which the Lord hath chosen to manifest his presence in, and
