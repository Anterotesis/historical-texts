            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Mr. Speaker,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>EE are called hither as Truſtees and Repreſentatives of
the PEOPLE; and it is our <hi>duty</hi> to repreſent to you
the grievances of any, which are injured, or oppreſſed,
and to be as carefull of them as of our ſelves, being the
eſſentiall part of our priviledges.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Law of the Land</hi> is every Engliſhmans birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
and you are the Conſervators of the Law, in which is wrapped
up our <hi>Lives, Liberties and Eſtates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> without any further preamble, or introduction, I ſhall
acquaint you briefly with the ſufferings of Lieut. Col. <hi>John Lilburne,</hi>
who hath been impriſoned two yeares illegally by the Lords, <hi>who by
Law have no jurisdiction over Commoners in criminall caſes,</hi> againſt
their wills.</p>
            <p>About foure yeares ſince, there was a great falling out betwixt Col.
<hi>King,</hi> and Lieut. Col. <hi>Lilburne,</hi> his Officer; both faithfull men to your
ſervice, and of high Spirits, fierce and reſolute: The difference grew
to ſuch a hight, that Lieut. Col. <hi>Lilburne</hi> complained to his Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in chiefe the Earle of <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> that Col. <hi>King</hi> had betrayed
<hi>Crowland, &amp;c.</hi> and humbly beſought his Lordſhip to call a Councell of
Warre, and he would make good his accuſation: The Earle of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter</hi>
hoping to compoſe the difference, put it off, and Lieut. Col.
<hi>Lilburne</hi> perſiſted; but ſeeing juſtice delayed, he came to <hi>London,</hi> and
divulged abroad that Col. <hi>King</hi> was a Traytor to his truſt: whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Col. <hi>King</hi> ſued him at the Common Law in an action of 2000. l.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:116676:3"/>
and <hi>Lieut. Col. Lilburne</hi> applyed himſelfe to the Houſe of Commons,
and prayed that the whole buſines might be heard and tryed at a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
of Warre, by that Ordinance which was eſtabliſhed in the Earle of
<hi>Eſſex</hi> Articles, they being both ſouldiers, and having ſubjected them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to the <hi>Law-martiall;</hi> for Lieut. Col. <hi>Lilburne</hi> knew by the <hi>let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the Common Law</hi> he was gone, it being Treaſon by the Common
Law to hold a Fort or Caſtle againſt the King.</p>
            <p>It ſeemes this buſines depended before Judge <hi>Reeves,</hi> who was a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
worthy Judge, and never deſcerted the Parliament, but adheared
when we were in the loweſt condition: But Lieut. Col. <hi>Lilburne</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
young and hot, writ a Letter to Judge <hi>Reeves,</hi> wherein he expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
himſelfe in acrimonius language, which had better been forborn; but
in a ſatyricall way he ſhewed how he was hardly dealt withall by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
and the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> and ſpake truth in ſharpe language;
<hi>viz. That the Judges took many extraordinary Fees which they could
not juſtify by Law, and that their proceedings in their Courts were ſo
irregular, that no man knew where to find them; and that the Earle of</hi>
Mancheſter <hi>had delayed him juſtice, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereupon he was convented before the Lords, the Earle of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter</hi>
being Speaker of the Houſe of Peeres, <hi>pro tempore:</hi> his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
asked Lieut. Col. <hi>Lilburne</hi> whether he did not deliveto Judge
<hi>Reeves</hi> ſuch a ſcandalous Paper: Lieut. Col. <hi>Lilburne</hi> anſwered, that
his Lordſhip was Judge and Party in his own cauſe; that he was in
<hi>England</hi> and not in <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Quere put unto him was like the
oath <hi>ex officio,</hi> which proceedings they themſelves had condemned as
tyrannicall and unjuſt, a little before in his own caſe; and by Law no
man ought to be asked ſuch an enſnaring queſtion, whereby he might
condemne himſelfe; and that if he had offended, the Law was open, and
therefore he appealed to the Houſe of Commons, as his competent Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
being his Peeres and Equals, and then delivered his Proteſt againſt
their jurisdiction.</p>
            <p>VVhereupon he was commanded to withdraw, and committed to
Priſon for ſo doing.</p>
            <p>Not long after he was ſent for a ſecond time before the Lords, and
commanded to kneel, which he abſolutely refuſed, as a ſubjection to
their jurisdiction, ſo they remanded him to Priſon to be kept cloſe, not
ſuffering wife, child, or any other friend to come to him for the ſpace
of three weekes, nor ſuffering him to enjoy the benefit of Pen, Ink, or
Paper.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:116676:3"/>
After three weeks impriſonment, he was again forced before the
Lords, into whoſe Houſe he went with his Hat on his head, and being
there, refuſed to heare his Charge read; which was raſhly done, but
you know Maſter <hi>Speaker,</hi> what <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Oppreſſion will make a
wiſe man mad:</hi> but after Lieut. Col. <hi>Lilburne</hi> had made this one fault,
(for I conceive he had committed none before, but that the injuſtice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
upon the Lords) he was fined foure thouſand pounds for his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
and ſeven yeares impriſonment. Vpon the whole matter I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
you judge in point of <hi>Law and Equity,</hi> whether this was not like
a <hi>Councel Table, or Starchamber ſentence?</hi> And I pray obſerve like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
the <hi>Warrant,</hi> which the Judges confeſſed was illegall, when Lieu.
Col. <hi>Lilburne</hi> pleaded upon his <hi>Habeas Corpus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall acquaint you with ſome Preſidents, that you have relieved
<hi>Commoners</hi> committed by the <hi>Lords,</hi> and fined in this Parliament in
the like caſe. Col. <hi>King</hi> having a difference with the Lord <hi>Willoughby</hi>
of <hi>Parham,</hi> the Lords took upon them to heare the cauſe, againſt Col.
<hi>Kings</hi> will, fined him five hundred pounds, and committed him to the
<hi>Fleet;</hi> Col. <hi>King</hi> appealed to the Houſe of Commons, and ſhewed that
the Lords had no jurisdiction over him; and ſo was releaſed by the
Houſe of Commons, and the Fine diſcharged.</p>
            <p>Captain <hi>Mazy,</hi> under the command of Col. <hi>Manwaring,</hi> being on
the Guards, who had opened the Commiſſioners of <hi>Scotlands</hi> Packets,
being for the ſame committed to the Fleet, the Houſe of Commons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed
him, and enclined to have rewarded him: the caſe was the ſame
with this. And the like proceedings of Maſter <hi>William Larner,</hi> Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeller,
his Brother, and Maid.</p>
            <p>But that which is moſt obſervable, is, that Maſter <hi>Richard Overton</hi>
who affronted the Lords more then Lieut. Col <hi>Lilburne,</hi> and proteſted
to the Lords faces againſt them, at his firſt comming before them, and
afterwards appealed to the Houſe of Commons, and all the Commons
of <hi>England,</hi> and particularly to the Generall and whole Army: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the Lords approved of his Proteſtation, by their releaſing
him out of priſon, without any ſtooping to them: yet Lieut. Col. <hi>Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne</hi>
hath lain two yeares and above in priſon, and all his eſtate kept
from him, to the hazard of ſterving him, his wife, and children.</p>
            <p>Maſter <hi>Speaker,</hi> you have heard the report at large made by Maſter
<hi>Maynard,</hi> and thereupon you gave him his liberty to follow his affairs,
though you did not abſolutely determine the buſines; but ſuch is his
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:116676:4"/>
misfortune. that he is ſince committed by a warrant of this Houſe, upon
the ſingle information of one Maſter <hi>Maſterſon</hi> a Miniſter, who was
not ſworn: And truly Maſter <hi>Speaker,</hi> I conceive it one of his greateſt
ſinnes and errors that he hath committed, <hi>viz. his idolizing this Houſe,</hi>
for he beleeves that <hi>you are the Supream Authority, and the chiefe
Judicatory, in repreſenting the People, from whom</hi> All POVVER <hi>is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived,</hi>
according to that Maxim * <hi>Quicquid efficit tale, eſt magis ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le:</hi>
But I have ſhewed him the contrary, as you may find it in the firſt
of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, <hi>Membrana 14. numero</hi> 79. There the Commons
made their Proteſtation <hi>that they had no jurisdiction but in making of
Lawes, and Money matters, as granting of Subſidies, &amp;c.</hi> And truly
I conceive it not honourable, nor juſt, <hi>that We, that are Legiſlators,
ſhould be Adminiſtrators or Executioners of juſtice;</hi> but to leave theſe
petty things to the <hi>Constables, Juſtices</hi> and <hi>Judges,</hi> whom we may
call to queſtion, and punniſh if there be occaſion.</p>
            <p>Maſter <hi>Speaker,</hi> I dare not ſpeake againſt your <hi>Warrant,</hi> for what is
paſt; but I pray obſerve, <hi>It is a Priſon Dore with two Locks and Bolts
upon it,</hi> ſo that it is impoſſible the Priſoner ſhould ever get out, but dye
in Priſon.</p>
            <p>Lieut. Col. <hi>Lilburne</hi> is committed in order to his tryall at Law, <hi>and
yet is debarred all Law;</hi> for upon his pleading, when he had brought
his <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> the Judges confeſſed <hi>the Warrant to be illegall, and
yet they durst not releaſe him:</hi> Secondly, The cauſe is generall, <hi>which
is nothing in Law, viz. For treaſonable and ſeditious practiſes, &amp;c.</hi>
But Sir <hi>Ed. Cooke</hi> tels us the particular Treaſon is to be expreſſed, and
that which is worſt of all, the word of God doth not warrant it: For
<hi>Feſtus</hi> the Pagan and corrupt Judge, who expected a bribe from poore
<hi>Paul,</hi> would not ſend him to <hi>Ceſar</hi> without ſpecifying the cauſe in his
<hi>Mittimus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not in the power of Parliaments to make a Law <hi>againſt the Law
of God, Nature, or Neceſſary Reaſon:</hi> and it was the chiefe cauſe
why <hi>Empſon</hi> and <hi>Dudley,</hi> thoſe Favourites and Privy Councellors to
<hi>Henry</hi> 7. were beheaded, as it appeares in the Indictment, which you
may read in the 4. part <hi>Inſtitutes,</hi> chap. Court of <hi>Wards,</hi> for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
the fundamentall Lawes of the Land: They had an Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
for their Indempnity, as the 11. of <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. wherein the Judges
were authorized to proceed by information, whereas by Law it ſhould
have been by <hi>Indictment,</hi> and they were to judge by <hi>diſcretion,</hi> which
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:116676:4"/>
was contary to Law, for it ought to have been by Juries of 12. men.</p>
            <p>I brſeech you for the time to come that we commit none but our own
Members, and that we avoid theſe old Counſell Table warrants, which
runne in generals, <hi>during pleaſure,</hi> which was the cauſe of that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Law, got with ſo much difficulty, called the <hi>Petition of Right,</hi> and
that for <hi>Aboliſhing the Starchamber,</hi> and <hi>regulating the Counſell Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
is not inferior to it.</p>
            <p>I pray let us remember and apply it to our ſelves: How dangerous
and fatal it hath ever been for <hi>Kings to extend and stretch their Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives
above and beyond Law:</hi> for the ſame Fate befell the Counſell-Table,
Starchamber, and High Commiſſion. And I pray let us keep our
ſelves within our Sphere, and not make our Priviledges, <hi>Entia, tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendentia,</hi>
* which are not to be found in any predicament of Law.</p>
            <p>As touching generals, I pray remember what you your ſelves declared
in anſwer to the King, in the caſe of the Lord <hi>Kimbolton</hi> and the five
Members accuſed, and Alderman <hi>Pennington,</hi> Alderman <hi>Foulk,</hi> Col.
<hi>Ven,</hi> and Col. <hi>Manwaring, viz. That it is againſt the Rules of juſtice
that any man ſhould be impriſoned upon a generall charge, when no
particulars are proved againſt them,</hi> 1 part book Decl. pag. 840, 841.</p>
            <p>But leaving that, I ſhall acquaint you what this brave invincible ſpirit
hath ſuffered and done for you: <hi>he was perſecuted by the Biſhops, had
five hundred ſtripes with knotted cords, from the</hi> Fleet <hi>to</hi> weſtminſter,
<hi>there he was Pilloried, and gagged, lay long in a naſty cloſe Priſon in
Irons, without Pen, Inke, or Paper, or any company:</hi> Alas! I cannot
remember halfe his ſufferings: this in his youth, when he was but about
twenty yeares of Age, from which murdering impriſonment this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
ſet him free, with Dr. <hi>Baſtwick, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Shortly after he was queſtioned for his life at the Lords Barre, for aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting
the priviledges of Parliaments, and was accuſed by a ſingle wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of Treaſon, but he was cleared by other witneſſes, and diſcharged
by the Lords: when the Parliament was to be forced, he fought with
the Cavaliers, and brought many friends to aſſiſt in the <hi>Court of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts,</hi>
he was one of the firſt that took up Armes, and behaved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
bravely at <hi>Keinton, where he kept the Field all night:</hi> Afterwards
he fought ſtoutly at <hi>Brainford,</hi> was taken priſoner, and uſed cruelly, and
got a peſtilentiall Feaver in the Caſtle of <hi>Oxford:</hi> he was arraigned for
his life before Sir <hi>Robert Heath,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Gardiner,</hi> where he
aſſerted the Parliaments cauſe, having the <hi>Obſervator</hi> without book,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:116676:5"/>
and ſpake more for us, then many of us are able to ſpeake for our ſelves:
he relieved with money, and held up the ſpirits of his fellow priſoners;
he reſiſted ſtrong temptations from ſeverall great Lords, who offered
him great preferment; he was an emminent actor in that famous Battle
at <hi>Maſton Moore,</hi> and took in <hi>Tickhil Caſtle</hi> with only foure Troops
of Dragoones, and for his paines had like to have been hang'd; you muſt
pardon me for injuring him, for I am not able to remember halfe his
ſervices to the publique.</p>
            <p>For all his ſufferings and actings for you, I beſeech you firſt take off
the marke of your own diſpleaſure, which wounds him to the heart.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that you would diſcharge him from the Lords impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, that you would pay him his Arreares, and paſſe the order
into an Ordinance for the 2000. l. out of the eſtates of thoſe which gave
that barbarous, cruell, bloody, tyrannicall judgement againſt him in the
<hi>Starchamber,</hi> they are your own expreſſions in your Vote of <hi>May</hi> 4.
1648.</p>
            <p>Maſter <hi>Speaker,</hi> I have forgot one materiall thing, which is this; you
have allowed Lieutenant Colonel <hi>Lilburne</hi> forty ſhillings a weeke, but
he hath not received a Pennie, neither is he in any hope of it, for he
cannot flatter, or comply, beſides this ſuppoſed gift of yours hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
ſtarved him, his friends in the Country thinking he had received it
having thereupon withdrawn their benevolence, and he and his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
therby expoſed to want and miſery.</p>
            <p>After Sir Iohn Maynard, Commiſſary Copley &amp;c. had ſeveral times
moved the Houſe to take the buſines into conſideration, the Houſe was
pleaſed to referre it till Tueſday following, being <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1. 1648. on
which day the Petition hereunto annexed, was by ſeverall eminent
Citizens, preſented to the Honourable Houſe of Commons, after a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
made in the Houſe by the Lord <hi>Car,</hi> who exceeding nobly of his
own accord, appeared in his behalfe, being a meer ſtranger to him, and
having no other inducement thereunto, then his love to justice, and an
heroick ſympathy with him in his unparralleld ſufferings.</p>

for the long deſtructive impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment
of Lievtenant God, <hi>Lilburn;</hi> yet
we choſe rather to be ſilent, in the ſame, expecting from
time to time his enlargement by this Honourable Houſe,
then by our Petitions to intercede, in his behalfe.</p>
            <p>But obſerving not only his own endeavours, and dayly
ſolicitations to be fruitleſſe but that whileſt he ſought his
Freedome from the impriſonment of the Lords, he became
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:116676:6"/>
A priſoner unto you; and perceiving many of his greater
Friends, in whom he much truſted (as changed with time)
turned their backs upon him, and that many of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
enemies made advantage by the hard uſage of ſo emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
a friend, to alienate the hearts of the People from you,
and which, as we feare, hath had no ſmall influence in thoſe
unhappy Riſings and Revolts that have been ſeen of late a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
you.</p>
            <p>We hereupon judged our ſelves bound in duty and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
both to you and him, at this time to break our ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
and to teſtify before this honourable Houſe, that we
verily believe there is no declination in him from thoſe juſt
Principles that induced him, to oppoſe the tyrannous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
of the <hi>Starchamber,</hi> and for which he under-went
ſo cruell a <hi>Whipping, Gagging, and impriſonment,</hi> as this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Houſe voted to be illegall, againſt the liberty of
the Subject, and alſo barbarous, bloody, wicked, cruell, and
tyrannicall, and that he ought to have good Reparations
therefore.</p>
            <p>Neither do we believe there is any alteration in him, from
that judgement and affection that in defence of the juſt, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of this honourable Houſe, induced him ſo freely
to venture his life, and ſpend his blood at <hi>Westminſter,</hi> when
firſt this Houſe was in moſt danger; or after that at <hi>Keinton</hi>
Battle, and <hi>Brainford,</hi> whence he was led Captive in a moſt
barbarous manner to <hi>Oxford,</hi> where he was ſo many wayes
in danger of his life, that had not this honourable Houſe at
that time, manifeſted a moſt tender regard unto him, he
had certainly periſhed.</p>
            <p>We alſo profeſſe our ſelves fully perſwaded, that as he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
moſt thankefully, valiantly, and ſucceſsfully again
adventured his life, for the juſt liberties of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:116676:6"/>
ſo if occaſion ſhould miniſter opportunity, he would
evidence himſelfe ſtill to be the ſame he then was.</p>
            <p>And concerning his demeanour before the Lords, and
for which they ſentenced him 4000l. ſeven yeares impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment,
and incapable of bearing any Office in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
wealth during his life: when you ſhall pleaſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
that he really lookt upon himſelfe as injured in all
their proceedings with him; and not only ſo, but that if he
ſhould in the leaſt circumſtance, or civil complement, have
owned their authority over him, being a Commoner, that
therein he ſhould have betrayed thoſe common known li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
of the Nation, for which he had ſo freely ſpent his
blood, and ſo many wayes adventured his life, inaſmuch as
in him was ſubjugated all the men and women in <hi>England</hi>
to the illegall ſummons, attachments, ſentence, fines, and
impriſonments of the Lords: and when you ſhall be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to mind the late ſtrong allegations of Sir <hi>Iohn Maynard,</hi>
Sir <hi>Iohn Gayer,</hi> Alderman <hi>Adams,</hi> Alderman <hi>Langham,</hi> and
Alderman <hi>Bunce;</hi> whereby it clearely appeareth, that the
Law of the Land appoints another way for the Tryals of
Commoners, (and upon all which allegations they are all
enlarged) we truſt his demeanour before the Lords will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently
appeare to be no wayes criminall.</p>
            <p>And concerning the cauſe of his commitment by you,
when you ſhall conſider how probable it was, that the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
informing was tranſported in his apprehenſion of things
never intended, the whole company preſent, except the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former,
all wel-affected perſons, being ready to depoſe
upon Oath, that there was not the leaſt evil mentioned, as
by a Petition long ſince preſented to this Houſe, is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt—when you ſhall conſider how hard and uncertain a
condition it is for him, and in him, for all the People of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:116676:7"/>
this Nation to be made lyable (by any Authority whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever)
to be attached and impriſonned upon generall accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations,
which <hi>in Law are no crimes,</hi> as Judge <hi>Bacon</hi> and Judg
<hi>Rols</hi> in the open Court lately declared in his caſe, the <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
offence</hi> being of <hi>right</hi> to be incerted in every War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of Commitment, by whomſoever—when you ſhall
pleaſe to conſider that all commitments of <hi>right</hi> ought to
referre to a ſpeedy tryall at Law, and not <hi>during pleaſure,</hi> as
your commitment to him hath proved, which is another
hard condition we are all made ſubject to in his caſe.</p>
            <p>When with ſerious deliberation you ſhall weigh theſe
things, and what it is for a man born of a generous parentage
that hath done and ſuffered ſo much for the liberties of his
Country, and for defence of this Parliament, to be made a
priſoner for no leſſe then 7. yeares by the Lords, who have
no jurisdiction over him: and appealing to the Houſe of
Commons, (who ought to be the refuge of Commoners)
not only not to be relieved, but by them, upon miſ informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and that by one ſingle perſon, to be as it were rivited
in priſon, to continue above two of thoſe 7. yeares, as he
hath done, forcibly with-held from a legall Tryall, though
continually cryed out for by him: to have his dearly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed
Arreares, and Voted Reparations, to a great value
held from him, whilſt in ſeeking the ſame he hath ſpent
nigh halfe the value, to the great indebting of himſelfe, as
he confidently averreth: and all this time to have no al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance
to maintain himſelfe, his wife and children, but
that they muſt either ſtarve, or depend upon the uncertain
(and to a free and ingenious mind, the unwelcome) charity
of compaſſionate People, and that alſo to be taken from
him, by your voted allowance of thirty ſhillings <hi>per weeke,</hi>
whereof no one pennie hath been paid, as he is ready to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:116676:7"/>
and was enforced to make known, or had periſhed, ſo
much his friends depended thereupon, (as well they might)
being by ſome mens art, confidently publiſhed in ſeverall
of the weekly Pamphlets.</p>
            <p>When you ſhall ſeriouſly lay theſe things to heart, and
judge impartially thereof, as if his caſe were one of yours,
we cannot but confidently hope his inſtant enlargement,
with full poſſeſſion of all that hath of a long time been due
unto him, and that he ſhall receive ſuch further reſpect as
may encourage him, and all others in the wayes of publique
vertue, fidelity, and reſolution.</p>
            <div type="order">
               <p>All which we moſt earneſtly entreat: again profeſſing from our
very hearts, we ſee no cauſe in him, but that the affection of
this Honourable Houſe may juſtly be the ſame towards him, as
it was when they voted him worthy of reparations for his cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el
ſuffering by <hi>Starchamber,</hi> or delivered him from his many
dangers at <hi>Oxford</hi>—And which being added unto thoſe,
would bind both him and us, and all well affected People in
conſtant affection and ſervice to this honourable Houſe.</p>
               <p>But if this (for reaſons we cannot diſcern) ſhall not be granted,
we yet humbly entreat that you would he pleaſed forthwith to
order him a ſpeedy and legall tryall by twelve ſworn men, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the known Law of the Land; a juſtice not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed
to Traytors, Vagabonds, or your worſt of enemies.</p>
               <p>But if this alſo ſhall be denyed, by <hi>a Parliament of England,</hi>
(as our hearts will not give us leave to imagine) we ſhall not
then well know what to do, unleſſe it be to bewaile his ſad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
