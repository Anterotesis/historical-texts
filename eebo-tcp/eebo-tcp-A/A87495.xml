            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Honourable Houſe of <hi>COMMONS.</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <hi>The Almighty God, bleſs, guide, and direct you, that you may have the Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to protect his true Worſhip, now in this diſtracted time, when ſo many devouring Devils would deſtroy it; for the Devil is an Enemy to Truth.</hi>
               <lb/>
               <salute>Gentlemen,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Can aſſure you I have been very Zealous for the Peace of this Nation; and God has been infinitely good to lengthen out our Tranquility hitherto, contrary to the expectation of Men and Devils: I muſt conſeſs I do not love War, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is deſtructive, and the winner may be a loſer: Therefore I humbly intreat Your Honours, to beg the Infinite Majeſty of Heaven his Directions, and he will direct you to preſerve his Worſhip, and to keep your Trade, and prevent War, if you will fincerely ſeek to him and be juſt, and to do as you would be done unto, and not encourage them that violently break his Commandments; which the Interlopers has done with a high hand. I love the Gentlemen, but I am ſorry they ſhould be guilty of ſuch a Crime, that has brought a ſcandal upon the Government, and a diſhonour to Religion, not conſidering Gods Commandments: But Your Honours know, if any Man has neceſſity for Money, and he ſells his Houſe to two Men, the laſt buyer muſt be the loſer, and ſo it muſt be in this caſe; there muſt be no Unity, for that will be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown, and deſtroy the Trade of the Nation. There is not any thing for the advantage and peace of the Nation, than to unmake them again, for they have made a great breach upon Friendſhip, and has diſturb the peace of the Kingdom; for every one is tearing and rending one from another, and if the Commandments be of no effect, Who can live ſafe? Therefore if you love God for the good of your own Souls, and the peace of the Kingdom put an end to it; and if you love the Gentlemen, order their Money to be paid them again, for that is the greateſt good you can do them, for God will never bleſs the breach of his Commands; but if they will ſubmit, and be willing to have their Money again: For it has been an ill example, and if they will be ſorry that they ſhould give the occaſion, God will pardon both the Sheep and the Shepherd; but if they are ſtiff-necked and will not yield, God knows how to puniſh them, and all that ſupports them; for he is a powerful God, he can ſafe and deſtroy in a moment, for they ſhall know that there is a God in <hi>England</hi> as well as in <hi>Iſrael. The Lord grant that we may do thoſe things to prevent his anger.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I humbly beſeech your Honours, not to bring a Sea of trouble upon your ſelves at this time, as to concern your ſelves for an Heir for the Kingdom, for it will take up a great deal of time, and it will be all to no purpoſe; for it is Chriſt's Kingdom, and when it is his Will, that you ſhould trouble your ſelf about an Heir, he will direct you. But the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Children muſt not be Heirs; for the King told me, that all the Diſcourſes was Fabulous, for he was never Married to his Mother: And when the difference was between the King and the Duke, I faſted three days for to Unite them: And I made Applications daily, and the King was ſo gracious, that he did not ſay any thing againſt the Duke, but ſaid you are hard upon me, But why do not you go and hear what he ſays to you? But when I came he received me very civilly, but I never heard any Mortal viliſie the King at ſo great a rate as he did, which made my heart ake, and ſo I declin'd the Cauſe. Why ſhould any one think of an Heir, have you not got a King you can truſt? I would that all could truſt God, for then you need not fear the greatneſs of <hi>France,</hi> nor depend upon the fidelity of the Dutch; but you would be glorious, great, and happy, and the King and People would obtain more true joy in a Week, than they have in a Year; for he would endow you with ſuch Chriſtian Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that might rectifie all miſtakes. The late Parliament could truſt God without a Standing Army, and make Corn cheap, and they put down thoſe helliſh Serpents that did ſo much miſchief, and the people are very thankful: And God will enable the Old Company to pay off the New: For they have been eſtabliſhed by Kings and Queens for above theſe Hundred Years; and they thought it was for the advantage of the Crown, and the good of the Kingdom: And Your Honours muſt keep up the Kings Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative; and in ſo doing you will preſerve your own Power: And God can make the young King of <hi>Spain</hi> a Friend to Chriſtendom, and therefore you may own him.</p>
            <closer>
               <hi>The Almighty grant that you may know how to deny your own Intereſt, for God's Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and the King and Kingdoms good: Which the Lord grant,</hi> Amen. Amen.
<signed>So I reſt your Souls-well-wiſher,
ELINOR JAMES.</signed>
