            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>
                  <label>Solution.</label> TO this, theſe Anſwers may be given. Firſt, that hardneſſe of heart is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, ſenſible, or inſenſible. Felt, or not felt.</p>
               <p>Inſenſible hardneſſe of heart, and which is in a man, and not felt, and perceived, <note place="margin">Zech. 7. 11 Eph. 4. 19. Exod. 10. 17.</note> is a great, and a dangerous judgement, but the ſenſible, and felt hardneſſe which is in Gods Children, and which they feele, and bewaile in themſelves, is rather a bleſſing than a curſe. Of this the Church complaineth, ſaying unto God, why haſt thou hardned our hearts againſt thy feare? <hi>Eſay</hi> 63. 17. And this muſt not diſhear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, nor diſcourage any Communicant, but rather comfort him: for when the heart feeleth its hardneſſe, and complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of it, is grieved, and diſliketh it, wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it were not ſo, this is a ſure ſigne of a gracious eſtate, and that there is ſome meaſure of true ſoftneſſe in that mans
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57546:16"/>
heart, though at this time undiſcerned of him. For it is by ſoftneſſe that hardneſſe of heart is felt, and if there were no grace there, ſuch a corruption as this, would lie ſtill undiſcerned, it being the part of grace, and not of corruption, to diſcover ſuch corruptions in us. Secondly, we muſt know, that every lumpiſh, and heavy heart, betiding Gods Children at times, is not a hard heart: for even the beſt of Gods children at times may be thus affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, witneſſe <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 42. 6, 7. <hi>Heman, Pſal.</hi> 88. 14. <hi>Ionah, Ion.</hi> 3. 4. 7. the Church of God, <hi>Eſay</hi> 49. 14. yea, Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe was not free from it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 46. Thirdly, it muſt be remembred for our comfort, that the benefit of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not tied to the very inſtant of Receiving, but if before, and after, a man have beene able, and can lift up his heart unto God, he may finde comfort, though for the preſent he have not ſo lively a ſenſe, and feeling thereof as hee deſireth.</p>

               <p>
                  <label>Solution.</label> HE may; and that for theſe reaſons.

comming to the Sacrament, and parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thereof, or any other part of Gods publique worſhip, and ſervice, for the known ſinnes of thoſe, that were to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take with us therein: but have rather taught us by their example to doe the contrary; and have ſhewed us by their practiſe, that in Aſſemblies, where the word, and worſhip of God is kept pure for ſubſtance, there may be a comfortable participating of Sacraments, yea, though by connivence of governours ſome inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate walkers be admitted.</p>

For the firſt, tis true, that we have daily neede of the remembrance of Chriſts Death, and conſequently of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. As our bodies have daily neede of nouriſhment by our corporall foode, ſo have our Soules by our ſpirituall.

               <p>For ſeeing there is required a due, and diligent preparation for the Receiving of this Sacrament, the ſame muſt moderate our neceſſity, ſo that we ſhould as well look to our fitneſſe as to our neede.</p>

               <p>THere are three things (we know) that fit a veſſell to receive a great meaſure of liquor. The firſt is, when it is of large capacity. A ſmall Veſſell may be filled, but yet a ſmall Veſſell cannot have ſo much poured into it, as a Veſſell that is of larger capacity. The larger the Bucket is, that is let downe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Well, the more Water it brings up.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is when it is an open Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell. For though a Veſſell be of never ſo great capacity, yet if the Mouth of the Veſſell be ſhut, and cloſed up, though it be throwne into the Sea, where there is Water enough, yet it fills not.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, when the Veſſell is wide open. For though the mouth of a Veſſell be open, yet if it be not wide open, it doth
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:57546:32"/>
not fill ſo readily. Take a Bottle, or narrow-mouth'd Glaſſe, and dowſe it under the Water, yet it may be pulled up againe, with little, or no Water in it, though it be of great capacity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the narrowneſſe of the mouth hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the ready and quick paſſage of the Water into it: Whereas a wide-mouth'd Veſſell, as a Paile, or Bucket, is no ſooner under Water, but it is inſtantly filled, becauſe the wouth of the Veſſell, is wide, open and broade. And juſt ſo it is in the Sacrament, if we deſire a libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall largeneſſe of Gods Mercy, and Chriſts Merits, we muſt come thereunto with hearts inlarged with Hungring, and Thirſting deſires after Chriſt, and his Righteouſneſſe; and the more our hearts are inlarged herewith; and the more open, and ready they are to receive it, the more ſhall the Sacrament empty it ſelfe with abundant bleſſing upon our Soules.</p>

               <p>FOr as it is not enough for a Man to to dreſſe, and trim up himſelfe in his handſomer apparell before he comes to a great Mans Table; but there is a great care alſo to be had of that carriage, and behaviour, that beſeemes ſuch a Mans Table, and perſon.

               <p>MAny that have no great care, nor make any great Conſcience of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the Sacrament without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, Faith or Repentance; yet will ſeeme to make ſome ſcruple of comming without Charity. Yea, many though they will not abſtaine, for that they be common Swearers, habituall Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards, uncleane perſons, and the like notorious ſinners in many other reſpects: yet if there be a breach, and a falling out betweene them, and others, they will by no meanes meddle with the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:57546:38"/>
but will abſtaine from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to it purpoſely for that very reaſon.</p>
               <p>But if theſe Men out of Conſcience Scruple their comming to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without Charity, why then ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple they not their living without it too; and their want of thoſe other as neceſſary graces, Knowledge, Faith, and Repentance? For a good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in one thing, is a good Conſcience in all.</p>
