            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>PROV. XX. XXV.</bibl>
               <q>It is a snare to the Man who devoureth that which is HOLY.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IT is commonly received, among <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,</hi> that <hi>The Proverbs,</hi> which we read scattered and in parcels, from the X<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. <hi>Chap.</hi> are without Method, not written in a constant tenor, as the former <hi>Nine,</hi> by <hi>Solomon</hi>; But some at one time, some at another, as the matter and occasion affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, were uttered by the <hi>King,</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served by standers by, and, afterwards, not without great benefit, though without order, committed to Writing.</p>
            <p>And other occasions there were for uttering others (for, so wise a man spake nothing rashly or unseasonably;) but, for this <hi>Proverbe</hi> now in hand, what hint was given, to what it was an answer, upon what occasion it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, is not so evident. For what? <hi>Solomon</hi> was no
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:112217:3"/>
Grater on the <hi>Laity,</hi> much lesse (which is as infamous) on the <hi>Clergy.</hi> None more bountifull then Hee, towards <hi>Holy things</hi>; none farther from <hi>Alienating.</hi> Whence then, or what had He to do with <hi>Sacrilegious persons,</hi> or <hi>Vow-breakers,</hi> whom this Verse points at? Was there any in <hi>Solomons</hi> time, of so cursed a stomach, that <hi>Consecrated Things</hi> must be his Morsels? Any, in that age, such an enemy to <hi>Holy Things,</hi> as to <hi>Devoure</hi> them? Of <hi>Vowes,</hi> as to breake them? So it should seeme: And indeed to this passe it came, that <hi>Interpreters,</hi> of no small account with mee, are of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it was so; and that there were some such in those dayes, of whom there are not a few, now. And that this pious and wise answer, was given by that Wise and Pious <hi>Prince</hi> to those <hi>Counsellors,</hi> who laboured to perswade him, that those things, which were given and designed by His <hi>Father,</hi> by <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Samuel,</hi> and reserved in the <hi>Threasury</hi> for the building of the <hi>Temple,</hi> might be <hi>Alienated,</hi> and spent upon <hi>Court</hi> Vanities.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I shall diduce this a little higher.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To <hi>David</hi> (whom the Holy Scriptures call a <hi>Man after Gods heart</hi>) <hi>God</hi> gave such a mind,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 7.2.</note> being a man to <hi>His</hi> mind, that he judged it unseemly, the storm of War being now blown over, that He himselfe should dwell in <hi>Cedar,</hi> and the <hi>Ark of GOD</hi> lodg between <hi>Curtaines.</hi> And truly it is an unjust demand of certaine men, that the <hi>Church</hi> should be in no better condition, now flourishing with Peace, then formerly she was,<note place="margin">Philip, 4. <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

In times of War and distractions the <hi>Church</hi> must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with Goat-skins; In Peace, and setled times, she requireth Carved works and <hi>Cedar.</hi> To this therefore <hi>David</hi> wholly
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:112217:3"/>
gives and applyes Himselfe;<note place="margin">1 Chro. 26, 27. 28.</note> and, besides much formerly dedicated and stored up to this purpose, by <hi>Saul, Abner, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,</hi> and by Him piously and faithfully conserved, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed further at his own charge, both <hi>Cedar</hi> and <hi>Marble, Precious stones</hi> and <hi>Metals</hi>: And that not sparingly or grudgingly, and with an evill eye:<note place="margin">1 Chro. 26. 4.</note> For he expended 3000 <hi>Talents</hi> of <hi>Gold,</hi> 7000 of <hi>Silver.</hi> And besides not content with that, partly by his example, partly by his perswasion, he wrought so far upon his <hi>Nobles,</hi> that they likewise in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged themselves in the like vow and promise:<note place="margin">1 Chro. 29. 7.</note> By whose bounty there was an accession, of 5000 <hi>Talents</hi> of <hi>Gold,</hi> 10000 <hi>Talents</hi> of <hi>Silver,</hi> of <hi>Brasse</hi> 18000 <hi>Talents,</hi> and 100000 <hi>Talents</hi> of <hi>Iron</hi>; so great an accession, say I, that, which hapned in our memory in the taking from the <hi>Church,</hi> did then in the addition to it, there was need of a <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations,</hi> over which, the <hi>Chronicles</hi> testifie,<note place="margin">1 Chro. 29, 8.</note> one <hi>Iehiel</hi> was <hi>President.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This so great weight of <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver,</hi> when <hi>David,</hi> at the point of his death, delivered to <hi>Solomon</hi> his Sonne, for the building of the <hi>Temple,</hi> it being as yet in the <hi>Threasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and not brought into the <hi>Temple</hi>; that there were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Court-Ratts</hi> (haply <hi>Ieroboam</hi> and others of the same stamp,) who would perswade the <hi>King,</hi> as they in the Prophet, <hi>That the House of GOD needed no sieling</hi>;<note place="margin">P, Hag. 1,4</note> as He in the Gospell, <hi>That CHRISTS head might be well enough without Ointment; To what purpose is this waste?</hi>
               <note place="margin">St. Mark 14. 4.</note> That there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore He should apply it to his <hi>Threasury,</hi> for which it was much fitter then the <hi>Temple</hi>; and that they, to this end, were ready to make inquisation into <hi>Sauls</hi> and <hi>Abners Vowes,</hi> and (which is easily done) pick out some holes, find out some tricks, to make those <hi>Vowes null and invalid.</hi> These Counsellers were not effectuall with the True-hearted <hi>King,</hi> but such Counsellers there were; and it seemes probable
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:112217:4"/>
to mee, that this was the occasion of this Verse, and that the <hi>Rabbies</hi> were not much out in their conjecture. That these Counsellers were not effectuall, this Verse declares; which, with <hi>Solomon</hi> and the like godly <hi>Princes,</hi> will for ever stop the mouths of such Petitions. And also, why they were not. For, it would be a certaine <hi>Snare</hi> to Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and the <hi>Ruin</hi> of his Kingdome, if he should permit so great a wickednesse. It is indeed a bait, sufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticing, but wrapt about with a <hi>Snare</hi> not to be avoyded.</p>
            <p>You see whether the Words tend (and at the first veiw deliver themselves) <hi>Viz.</hi> to the conservation of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred <hi>Patrimony,</hi> to the repelling of <hi>Sacrilegious</hi> hands from it, and stupifying or deading their <hi>Teeth</hi> who do <hi>Devoure it.</hi> Which I would to GOD this our Age could be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded of; in which a wicked custome, hath prevailed, and growes dayly more and more, of <hi>Laying hands upon HOLY Things</hi>; in which, there are no improvements to the <hi>Clergy,</hi> (would that were all?) there are frequent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairings; I say, frequent impairings; and I wish it might only be said, there are; and that there might never be cause of using the <hi>Future tense.</hi> But, I shall speak freely; what for that <hi>Unholy hunger after Gold,</hi> there is nothing esteemed <hi>HOLY</hi>; and the restitution of <hi>Holy Things</hi> is the pretence for <hi>SACRILEGE.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Adde to this humour of the present Age, another Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour; That those Worthies, not to be named without all honorable respect, whose help <hi>GOD</hi> made use of for the <hi>Reformation</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> were very sollicitous for the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation</hi> of <hi>Doctrine,</hi> but lesse attended the <hi>Churches Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi>; and almost said, what the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Sodom</hi> did to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> though in another sense, <hi>Give us the Soules, and take the rest to You.</hi> But as they, who thought they should find the <hi>Baptist</hi> in Kings Courts, so they, that think they
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:112217:4"/>
shall find <hi>ABRAHAM</hi> there, are both deceived.</p>
            <p>Which Errour, though a small one (and a small one indeed it is, if we compare it with those great and famous acts performed by them) yet, we may justly feare, if not seasonably withstood, will lie heavy upon succeeding Ages: in which true-hearted honest men (from that of <hi>Solomon, Pro.</hi> 14. 4. <hi>Where no Oxen are, the crib is cleane</hi>) presage Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barisme, or somewhat worse, which I will not speake of; falsly perchance, and I pray <hi>GOD</hi> it prove so, but not rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I am sure, not without cause. So that, in very truth, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse we would have the <hi>Universities</hi> to be broken up, the <hi>Clergy</hi> to be trampled on, and all that is called <hi>HOLY</hi> come to ruin, there lyes a necessity upon us to plead for the <hi>Churches Patrimony:</hi> That, which is left of it, let us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neil and rub over with this bitter juice; let us shew them the <hi>Snare</hi> in which they take paines to trap themselves; and, that it is not lawfull for them to do what dayly they attempt, unlesse it be lawfull for them to blot this Verse out of the <hi>Holy Scriptures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed to confesse the truth, this blur upon <hi>our Age,</hi> that <hi>Holy Things</hi> are so <hi>Devoured,</hi> much troubles me, (though there were, there were indeed, in <hi>Solomons time,</hi> such, whose teeth itched to be at them.) But this troubles me more, that we <hi>Divines</hi> see these things, and are luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warme, nay silent; that we <hi>put up</hi> and <hi>Devoure these De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourings</hi>; that (which the <hi>Apostle</hi> complaines of, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 20.) <hi>We suffer if a man devoure us, if a man bring us into beggery.</hi> But this most of all, that <hi>we our selves,</hi> (so it is) dayly expose <hi>our selves</hi> to be eat and drunk up, as I may so say, by <hi>these Devourers of the Clergy.</hi> This is not the way, believe me, to effect what we desire.

               <note place="margin">2 Chro. 31. 4.</note> hath very well comprised the whole businesse, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing a fit <hi>portion</hi> to the <hi>Priests &amp; Levites,</hi> that they might more couragiously attend the study of the <hi>Law.</hi> Which <hi>portion</hi> that it should be deemed <hi>Holy,</hi> there was an expresse command by <hi>GOD</hi> Himselfe: Both under the <hi>Law,</hi> where the People was taught to say;<note place="margin">Deut. 26. 13.</note>

               <hi>the Holy things of the Temple.</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>Holy Revenues.</hi> Our busines is about this fourth. For no man gapes after, or fastens his teeth upon those three: This last, this, this it is, upon which they set their teeth and stomack. Though indeed, as I shall shew anon, there is but one bit, one draught of all. Truly, they are ty'd in a close and strong knot together, <hi>Holy Revenues, Holy Persons, Holy Meanes, Holy Manners.</hi> Nor shall we be ever able to keep up <hi>Holy Manners</hi> without due <hi>Meanes</hi>; nor due <hi>Meanes</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fit <hi>Persons</hi>; nor fit <hi>Persons</hi> without ample <hi>Revenues and comings in.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This therefore which <hi>Solomon</hi> calleth <hi>Holy,</hi> is the <hi>Tribute of the Sanctuary.</hi> But what is that, or how so called? I shall tell you that, too. The <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> is plentifull about it; but it may be reduced to two heads. <hi rend="sup">1</hi> Of <hi>Oblation.</hi> 
               <hi rend="sup">2</hi> Of <hi>Indiction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Of <hi>Oblation</hi>; either by <hi>Vow,</hi> or <hi>Freewill</hi>; that the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi> call <note n="a" place="margin">a Vow, simply. vid. Gen, 28. 20.</note>

Only this I say; The <hi>Church</hi> had a <hi>Patent</hi> granted her, by vertue whereof every one had leave to <hi>alienate and set apart</hi> what he would of his own <hi>to holy uses,</hi> and that either by way of <hi>Freewill offering,</hi> or by <hi>Vow</hi>; whether it were <hi>Person</hi>; or <hi>Beast,</hi> Cleane or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane, of the Flock, or of the Herd; whether <hi>Houses</hi> or <hi>Lands,</hi> of inheritance or purchase.

            <p>2. I come to the <hi>Indiction,</hi> that which is set and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. And sure there was a necessity for this, lest, if those <hi>Freewill offerings</hi> should come in coldly, and the <hi>Threasury of the Church</hi> should be, as it is often, empty for want of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant showre of <hi>Manna,</hi> the Priests should well nigh starve. I am to treat of a hard point, and (that, which grieves mee most) but briefly. It is certain that in every ones <hi>estate</hi> there is a <hi>sacred part.</hi> This is more obscure, <hi>what</hi> that is, or <hi>how much.</hi>

How so, who declared to him the <hi>measure of the Divine portion?</hi> no doubt but the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> to so <hi>holy a man.</hi> That same <hi>Spirit,</hi> who before had tacitely dictated it to <hi>Abraham,</hi> did afterward by an expresse Law take order for that and no other <hi>portion,</hi> to bee payd to <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons consecrated</hi> by Him.<note place="margin">Numb. 18. 21.</note> Indeed to some this seemes wholly <hi>ceremonial,</hi> as all things doe now a dayes that touch the <hi>purse.</hi> Others will not allow any portion to be <hi>by Natural Right,</hi> nor <hi>so great</hi> by <hi>Positive.</hi> That GOD was indeed as carefull for our sustenance, as He was for the <hi>Levits.</hi> That there was nothing then reserved to the <hi>Positive Law,</hi> nor therefore now: and to this purpose they urge that in the 23. of <hi>St. Matth.

            <p>In respect of <hi>Man,</hi> that must needs be most equal, which is not <hi>too loose</hi> for one, <hi>too strait</hi> for another.

            <p>This <hi>Portion</hi> therefore the <hi>Church</hi> hath hallowed, and given that honor to <hi>God</hi> the <hi>author of this Imposition,</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive that He best knew the <hi>Measure of His own Tribute</hi>; and that no <hi>Councils of the Church,</hi> no <hi>Assemblies of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> could settle that affaire more wisely, then it was of old provided for by the <hi>Sacred Law</hi>; then <hi>the Lawyer himselfe</hi> (so absolute, that <hi>Iustinian</hi> is no body to him) had proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med many ages since.

But because 'tis an easie matter to find the just vengeance upon <hi>Sacrilege,</hi> under the <hi>Law,</hi> and the credit of the <hi>Old Testament</hi> is in this point suspected, I had rather shew it from the <hi>New.</hi> There, <hi>Iudas</hi> who first filch'd from his <hi>Masters</hi> baggs, afterwards betrayed his <hi>Master</hi> himselfe, and, as a just punishment of his former sins, taught us by his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable example, that there is an <hi>halter,</hi> a <hi>snare,</hi> which lyeth hid in these <hi>Holy things.</hi> This befell him who theiv'd from <hi>Christ.</hi> But they, who first dared to make an inrode upon the <hi>Church stook,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 5. 10.</note> (though it be all one) I say not to take it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way being given, but only to detein it, before it was given, (the <hi>Gospel</hi> it selfe making no plea, nor interceding for the fact) were choaked with a sudden and most horrid death, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a word of the <hi>Apostle.</hi> Vpon which place I will stand a little more: For it is, as the fairest, so the most apposite and full in this point.</p>
            <p>First, then, it is evident that <hi>things may be consecrated to Holy use,</hi> even under the <hi>Gospel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, That <hi>being so consecrated,</hi> they are no longer <hi>ours.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:112217:12"/>Thirdly, that, since they are not <hi>ours,</hi> they cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined without great <hi>sin,</hi> not <hi>taken away</hi> without greater.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That whosoever doth one or t'other, doth it therefore, because <hi>Satan hath filled his heart.</hi> (<hi>Sacrilegious Persons,</hi> then, are filled with <hi>Satan.</hi>)</p>
            <p>Fifthly, That this kind of men is to be punished with <hi>death,</hi> not only with <hi>censures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixthly, And that <hi>death sudden,</hi> that there should be no space for the <hi>expiating of so great a sin.</hi> And,</p>
            <p>Seventhly, with <hi>death immediately from Heaven,</hi> wherby <hi>God</hi> declared, as it were from Heaven, that he himselfe was the <hi>avenger of so great a wickednesse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These examples, <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Brethren,</hi> are from the <hi>Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</hi> The <hi>Gospel</hi> is no milder against these men then is the <hi>Law.</hi> And even the <hi>Gospel</hi> itselfe, the Minister of life, hath its <hi>snare, a snare of death,</hi> for that man, for that Conscience, which makes no <hi>Conscience or Religion</hi> of <hi>devouring</hi> what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to <hi>Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yes, but how many <hi>Sacrilegious persons</hi> hath no such thing befallen? For it is not usuall or perpetuall which is inflicted on <hi>a growing mischeife</hi>: Neither doth <hi>Solomon</hi> say it is; that they shall be taken in the <hi>very act.</hi> But what he saith, is <hi>usual,</hi> neither do examples fail us; for, though they may escape the <hi>light</hi> and <hi>day</hi> for a while, they shal not escape so; <hi>Solomons snare</hi> will take them by the <hi>heele.</hi> For the <hi>snare</hi> he speakes of, is the <hi>Snare of a Fowler</hi>; in which perhaps the <hi>bird,</hi> that is taken, is not presently strangled, but tangled by the <hi>foot</hi> or <hi>neck,</hi> oftimes till the evening, and oftimes longer, till the return of the <hi>Fowler.</hi> Many times the destruction is slow, but ever sure.</p>
            <p>I beleive you have observed, that the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> speak not of the <hi>punishment of wicked men,</hi> alwayes, after the same manner. The Wrath of <hi>God</hi> is sometimes as a <hi>storme</hi>

suddenly rushing down all before it;<note place="margin">H. Ios. 23 13.</note> sometimes as a <hi>Net</hi> taking for the present, and after a while slaying. In P. <hi>Esay,</hi> (<hi>Chap.</hi> 51. <hi>v.</hi> 8.) it is an <hi>Axe</hi> suddenly cutting down: and it is a <hi>Moth</hi> consuming by peicemeale. In P. <hi>Hosea,</hi> (<hi>Chap.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 12.) He saith, he will be a <hi>Lyon</hi> to some, to others <hi>rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi> and a <hi>Moth:</hi> a <hi>Lyon,</hi> which teareth in a moment; a <hi>Moth,</hi> which weareth out insensibly and by degrees. The <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexie</hi> killeth one way, the <hi>Hectik</hi> another, but both kill. A <hi>Ship</hi> perisheth one while by <hi>neglecting the Pump:</hi> another while by the <hi>Overflowing of the Billowes</hi>; but both wayes it perisheth.
