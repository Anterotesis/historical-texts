            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>IT was not yet my hap to be tendered the new
Oaths, but ſuppoſing that at ſome time it may,
ſince in the laſt Seſſions of Parliament there were
Agitations for barring all Perſons from Voices in Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of Members for Parliament, and from Practice
in their Profeſſions, beſides the Penalties of this Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,
and Paiment of double Taxes, in caſe of refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
to Swear, and Declare, as by this Act is required;
Theſe and ſome other Conſiderations (needleſs to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularize)
put me on ſearch into the Quality and Senſe
of theſe Oaths, with the Duty and Lawfulneſs of taking
or refuſing them. And firſt I obſerved, that in theſe
Oaths there is no declaring or ſwearing to the King's
Supremacy, in any Things or Cauſes, nor a Renuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Rights or Titles of any other Perſon, nor a
Promiſe of Faith and Allegiance to the preſent Prince's
Heirs and lawful Succeſſors, nor an Acknowledgment
before God and the World of the King's lawful Title to
this Realm, nor a ſwearing to the plain and common
Senſe of the Words; all which were Parts of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:60480:3"/>
Oaths of Supremacy and Allegiance, and might
have raiſed Scruples, if inſerted in theſe, that are
now frivolous. I likewiſe obſerve, that the <hi>non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurat</hi>
Proteſtants and the Catholicks are not by the ſame
Reaſons induced to refuſe to take theſe Oaths, the one
having ſworn the former, the latter generally refuſing
them. On the whole I have made the Reflections,
which I herewith preſent to you, my truly dear Friend.
I will not affirm to you, that I am ſo fully ſatisfied in
this Enquiry, as that I am reſolved to take theſe Oaths,
when required ſo to do; nor will I conceal from you,
that my private Opinion is, that I may, as a ſound
Catholick, with a ſafe Conſcience, without Hazard of
Salvation, both take theſe new Oaths, and ſubſcribe the
Declaration now framed by Parliament. The Matters
therein contained are entirely within the Conſideration of
the Laws of the Kingdom, without any relation to the
Myſteries of Faith; and therefore I believe you a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
and proper Iudg herein, and earneſtly requeſt you to
give me your Thoughts hereof. I would not that it
ſhould be ſaid of me, <hi>Incidit in Scillam qui vult
vitare Charibdim.</hi> I reſolve to be governed by your
Sentiments of this Affair, and ever to acknowledg to
the World, that I very much honour you, and am,</p>

            <head>REFLECTIONS
ON THE
Oaths &amp; Declaration
Lately appointed in the room of the
Oaths of Supremacy and Allegiance.</head>
            <p>SInce the Supreme Power of this Nation
hath, for the Security of its Government,
enacted, that all Perſons ſhould either take
theſe Oaths, or ſuffer ſevere Penalties for their
Refuſal: It ſeems to be an Act of Charity, no
leſs than of Prudence, to conſider the Reaſons
for taking or refuſing them: I apply my ſelf to
Catholicks.</p>
            <p>The firſt of theſe Oaths is barely promiſſory
to bear Faith and true Allegiance to the preſent
Prince, who, whatever his Title be, hath ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60480:7"/>
Power to rule,<note place="margin">Protection infers publick Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> govern and protect us: To
him, whileſt we live under his Government, we
are Subjects: As it is undeniable that he is King
of this Realm either <hi>de jure</hi> or <hi>de facto,</hi> or both
ways, (which, matters not now to be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
for no ſort of Right is here ſworn to, as was
in the former Oaths to our lawful Kings) ſo it is
plain, that we are his Subjects <hi>de jure</hi> or <hi>de facto,</hi>
or both ways. The Right of a Prince and Duty
of a Subject are Correllatives, they live and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
together. Thus whileſt he is our King, we
are his Subjects; whileſt we are his Subjects we
owe him Duty and Fidelity, and ought not to
ſcruple promiſing it, when thereto required; to
which we are now more ſtrictly obliged, by the
Authority of the Kingdom commanding it.</p>
            <p>In all Countries, as well Catholick as others,
Fidelity is required from thoſe in Subjection,
unto thoſe who have the Dominion, whether
it be gained by Conqueſt, or otherways. In our
own, Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> declared, that (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the Cenſures of his Predeceſſor <hi>Pius
Quintus</hi>) the Subjects of <hi>England</hi> ought to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
all Duty to Queen <hi>Elizabeth:</hi> and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
might be the Catholicks inward Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
concerning her Title, yet after the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60480:7"/>
had acknowledged her a lawful Queen,
all Civil Obedience was exactly paid to her.
This Oath of Fidelity is generally taken in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
by the Catholicks, purſuant to the Articles
for Surrender of <hi>Limerick,</hi> by Approbation of
the Primate and Clergy of that Kingdom. The
Fathers of the Society of Jeſus,<note place="margin">In the Provinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Congregation at <hi>Ghent,</hi> 5 <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> 1681.</note> of the Engliſh
Province, decree thus, <q>Let us all profeſs, that
as much Obedience and Fidelity ought to be
ſincerely ſworn and exhibited to our King
from every one of us, as is wont to be ſworn
and exhibited to any Princes whatſoever from
other Catholick Subjects.</q> Here is no Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
made between lawful or unlawful Titles
of Princes, but the Relation between any Princes
whatſoever and their Subjects allowed to be a
Ground for Fidelity.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Oath is a part of the Oath of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance,
made in the Reign of King <hi>James,</hi>
               <note place="margin">3 Jac. 1. cap. 4.</note>
which Oath was freely taken by the chief and
others of the Catholick Clergy here in <hi>England,</hi>
and by them the Nobility and Gentry were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed
and exhorted to do the ſame, declaring it
to be a Duty incumbent on them by the Law of
God. Sixty of the Doctors of the <hi>Sorbon</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60480:8"/>
to the ſaid Oath, theſe following
Words, <q>We underwritten, Divines and Doctors
of the Sacred Faculty of <hi>Paris,</hi> do judg the
Oath, as it is on the other ſide, (<hi>i. e.</hi> the Oath
of Allegiance) may with Safety of Faith and
Conſcience be taken by Engliſh Catholicks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
But Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the Fifth ſent a Breve into <hi>England,</hi>
directed to the Engliſh Catholicks, wherein, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing
the ſaid Oath at large, he declares, that
this Oath contains many things plainly repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to Faith and Salvation, and admoniſheth
and requireth them not to take <hi>that Oath.</hi> This
Breve his Holineſs ſeconded by another, and
both were confirmed by ſucceeding Popes.
The Fathers of the Society in their Provincial
Congregation afore-mentioned, decree thus
concerning that Oath, that the Oath (<hi>i. e.</hi> the
Oath of Allegiance) as it is now ſprinkled with
many Heterodox Clauſes, cannot be taken, as
being condemned by many Breves of Popes.
Theſe things conſidered, I'll ſuppoſe, <hi>that Oath</hi>
might not be taken by Catholicks, becauſe it
contained many things contrary to Faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
and is ſprinkled with many Heterodox Clauſes;
and laſtly, becauſe it is condemned by many
Breves of Popes. But then it muſt be granted
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60480:8"/>
to me, that this Oath, now to be taken, is not
<hi>that Oath</hi> which was required not to be ſworn,
which was condemned: This Oath is but one
Clauſe amongſt many which compoſe that
Oath; the Pope doth not declare that all the
things in that Oath are repugnant to Faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
his Prohibition doth not fall on any particular
Clauſe, the Fathers of the Society do not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach
every Clauſe in that Oath, nor diſtinguiſh
thoſe Heterodox ones that are ſprinkled in it:
Both Pope and Fathers allow, that ſome Things
and Clauſes in that Oath are not liable to Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure:
There are many Clauſes in that Oath,
whereof thoſe which are condemned, though
called many, may be feweſt in number. Now
if this Oath be not <hi>plainly</hi> repugnant to Faith and
Salvation, there is no Ground for refuſing it,
becauſe it is a part of the former Oath: And
that it is not plainly repugnant to Faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to
abhor, deteſt and abjure that damnable Doctrine
and Poſition, (mentioned in this Oath) the
Word of God, the Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> the
Subſcription of the Doctors of the <hi>Sorbon,</hi> the
Decrees of the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
of the Fathers of the Society to an
Agreement with the <hi>Sorbon,</hi> are full and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60480:9"/>
convincing Evidences: To all or ſome of
which every one may eaſily apply himſelf for
Satisfaction.</p>
            <p>The Declaration annexed to theſe Oaths is
not to be ſworn to,<note place="margin">This Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is aſſertory of ſomething paſt; it is an Act of Faith, depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Evidence of what is paſt.</note> but only to be made, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated,
and ſubſcribed to, as a Matter which
the Declarer believes to be true, according to a
rational Judgment and moral Certainty thereof,
which yet may be conſiſtent with an abſolute
Poſſibility of the thing being otherwiſe: It is an
Aſſertion of the Truth of a thing, as it is in his
Conſcience or rational Judgment, not as it is in
it ſelf; and this moral Certainty may ſecure the
Declarer from a Lie, and juſtify him before God
and Man.</p>
            <p>The Reflections I make being with Reference
to the Catholicks in <hi>England,</hi> I will conſider the
Duty and Lawfulneſs of their making, or refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
to make this Declaration diſtinctly from
others.</p>
            <p>1. And to ſhorten my Work I will here ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
that by foreign Prince, Perſon, Prelate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
is meant the Pope and his Succeſſors.</p>
            <p>2. That the Pope hath, and ought to have,
ſome Juriſdiction, or Power, or Superiority,
or Preheminence, or Authority, in this Realm.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:60480:9"/>
3. That the Popes formerly had, and had
a Right to, ſome Juriſdictions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> within this
Realm, which now are not enjoyed by them.</p>
            <p>4. That the Juriſdictions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which Popes
formerly had, and now have not, they ought
not to have in this Realm.</p>
            <p>To explain my ſelf in my ſecond Suppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Catholicks unanimouſly grant, that Chriſt
gave a Power purely ſpiritual to his Apoſtles,
throughout the whole World, and in them to
their Succeſſors, to preach, to feed his Sheep,
to bind and looſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This Power being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
to the Pope, as Succeſſor to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> his
Holineſs hath a Right to throughout the whole
World, for thus large is the Commiſſion from
Chriſt.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>King</hi> James <hi>in his Premonition,</hi> p. 46. <hi>Let the Pope be</hi> Primus Epiſcopus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter omnes Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copos, <hi>and</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceps Epiſcopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum <hi>as</hi> Peter <hi>was</hi> Princeps Apoſtolorum.</note> And this Power being given by God,
cannot be taken away by Men, nor be denied
by Chriſtians, either in this Realm, or any other
part of the World, without Breach of Faith.
The ſpiritual Power could not be exerciſed by
Kings or Princes, it did never belong to them,
or to their Crowns, nor indeed was ever claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or pretended to in this Realm: therefore I
will here only conclude, that it is not proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that this Declaration intends to deny the
Pope's Power purely ſpiritual in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60480:10"/>
I ſhall endeavour to make this more plain
hereafter.</p>
            <p>My third Suppoſition grants, that Popes had
a Right to, and enjoyed Juriſdictions, Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe were in Courts and Matters
called Eccleſiaſtical or Spiritual, as Caſes of
Marriage, Tythes, Wills, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> were merely external, political
or civil, and came not to the Pope <hi>jure divino.</hi>
Our Saviour declared, that his Kingdom is not
of this World, and therefore gave no Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> beſides that which is purely
ſpiritual, to his Apoſtles, or their Succeſſors.
The Crown of <hi>England</hi> is, and of long time hath
been, an Imperial Crown, depending only on
God, by whom Princes reign. From the Crown
divers Privileges have been at divers times, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by the Piety or Inadvertencies of Princes,
granted to Popes (in the Language of thoſe
Days called the Church;) at other times Uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
have been made, when the Princes were
weak or unfortunate: Theſe Privileges being
long uſed, and their Origine either forgotten or
concealed, have been commonly look'd on, and
claimed, as the proper and inherent Right of
thoſe to whom they were granted, or came.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60480:10"/>
This Right being charily preſerved by them,
and freely confeſs'd by others to be a good Title,
accompanied with a long and quiet Poſſeſſion,
and called Eccleſiaſtical or Spiritual, came to be
thought at laſt to be a Right given them by God,
whereas in Truth it proceeded from Men; and
as all humane things are ſubject to change, may,
by the ſame Power from whence it was derived,
be taken away. And thus hath it fared with the
Pope's Power in Temporals,<note place="margin">24 H. 8. c. 12. 25 H. 8. c. 20. 25 H. 8. c. 19. 25 H. 8. c. 21. 28 H. 8. c. 16. 1 Eliz. cap. 1. 5 Eliz. cap. 1. 1, 2 P. M. c. 8.</note> which he had and
exerciſed in this Kingdom; ſometimes they have
been diſputed, other times taken from him and
reſtored to the Crown, then again reſtored to
his Holineſs, and about 130 Years ſince were
again taken from him and reſtored to the Crown,<note place="margin">In <hi>France</hi> the Clergy publiſhed this Propoſition, That the Pope had no Power in civil or tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Affairs, and that Kings are ſubject to no Eccleſiaſtical Powers.</note>
and ſo continue at this Day, which is a Matter
ſo evident to every Engliſh-man, that no one
of them can find Reaſon to believe, that the
Pope, <hi>at this time,</hi> hath any Juriſdiction, Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> (beſides that which is purely Spiritual)
in this Realm.</p>
            <p>The fourth Suppoſition intends, that ſince
thoſe Eccleſiaſtical or Spiritual Juriſdictions,
Powers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which the Pope enjoyed and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed
in this Realm, and which were not pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Spiritual, nor derived to him from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60480:11"/>
but came to him by the Grants of Princes,
Conſent of People, or by ſome other mere hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
means, as touching Appeals, Annats, Firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruits,
electing of Biſhops, Diſpenſations in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Laws, to the Prejudice of the Crown,
and impoveriſhing of the Subjects, giving Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cences
in abundance of humane Caſes or Things,
putting Biſhops into their Biſhopricks, and
Prieſts into their Pariſhes: ſince I ſay theſe Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> came to the Popes by times, or by
Concordates between Princes on the one ſide,
and Popes on the other, which could not be Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
or Supernatural Powers, that is, Powers
derived to him, or conferred on him <hi>jure divino,</hi>
are aboliſhed as to his Holineſs, and reſtored
to the Crown, by ſeveral Acts of Parliament,
as antiently belonging thereto, it is as plain that
the Pope ought not to have thoſe Juriſdictions,
Powers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of which he is thus legally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted,
as it is apparent that <hi>at this time</hi> he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hath nor exerciſeth them.</p>
            <p>Now to enlarge ſomewhat on the Subſtance
of the two laſt Suppoſitions, I will inſtance in
ſome few Remarks, what Interruptions the
Popes have met with in the Exerciſe of their Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical
or Spiritual Powers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in Matters
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60480:11"/>
merely Temporal in this Realm. King <hi>Henry</hi>
the Firſt gave the Biſhoprick of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> to <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
Gifford,</hi> and forthwith inveſted him into all
the Poſſeſſions thereto belonging, though con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to a Canon. The ſame King alſo gave
the Archbiſhoprick of <hi>Canterbury</hi> to <hi>Radolph</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of <hi>London,</hi> and gave him Inveſtiture by a
Ring and a Croſiers Staff. In the ſame King's
Reign <hi>Thurſtan,</hi> elect Archbiſhop of <hi>York,</hi> got
leave of the King to go to a Council held un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Pope <hi>Calixtus</hi> at <hi>Rhemes,</hi> giving his Faith to
the King that he would not receive Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Pope, but notwithſtanding he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
to be conſecrate at the Pope's Hand,
which, as ſoon as the King heard, he forbad
him to come within his Dominions. King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
the Firſt prohibited the Abbot of <hi>Waltham,</hi>
and Dean of <hi>Paul</hi>'s, to collect a tenth of every
Man's Goods, for a Supply to the Holy Land,
which the Pope by three Bulls had committed
to their Charge. The ſame King impleaded the
Dean of the Chappel of <hi>Wulverhampton,</hi> becauſe
the ſaid Dean had, againſt the Privileges of the
Kingdom, given a Prebend of the ſame Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
to one at the Pope's Command. King
<hi>Richard</hi> the Second, by Act of Parliament, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60480:12"/>
that any ſhould procure a Benefice
from <hi>Rome,</hi> under pain to be put out of the
King's Protection. Thus ſeveral Catholick
Princes, in Catholick times, diſputed the Pope's
Juriſdictions, Powers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in ſeveral Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical
or Spiritual Matters. King <hi>Henry</hi> the
Eighth (no leſs a Catholick, and likewiſe in a
Catholick time) by ſeveral Acts of Parliament,
conſiſting of Lords Spiritual and Temporal,
and Commons, all Catholicks, deprived the
Pope of ſeveral Juriſdictions, Powers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
which were ſuppoſed to be uſurped from the
Crown, and the Exerciſe whereof were much
to its Detriment.<note place="margin">1 Eliz. cap. 1. 5 Eliz. cap. 8.</note> Again, Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vives
all thoſe Statutes made by her Father, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtores
all antient Juriſdictions to the Crown,
and aboliſheth all foreign Powers repugnant to
the antient Juriſdiction of the Crown: And
thus they continue to this Day.</p>
            <p>From what I have collected here it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
that no purely ſpiritual Power hath been
by the Laws of this Kingdom taken from the
Pope; that whatever Power hath been taken
from the Pope, hath been reſtored to the Crown,
as its antient Juriſdiction, and no other: but
ſince the Words of the Declaration deny any Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60480:12"/>
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be enjoyed by, or rightfully
to belong to any foreign Prelate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I ſhall
conſider the Meaning of thoſe Words, wherein,
if I can hit on the Senſe which this Declaration
by the Intent of the Impoſers of it bears, let
that determine the Lawfulneſs or Unlawfulneſs
of making it, for no more is required of us.</p>
            <p>This Declaration is <hi>verbatim</hi> a Clauſe in the

the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> and in another
Act made in the fifth Year of her Reign, it is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted,
that the Oath made in the firſt Year of
her Reign, ſhall be taken and expounded in ſuch
Form as is ſet forth in an Admonition annexed
to the Queen's Majeſties Injunctions, publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the firſt Year of her Majeſty's Reign, that

than that was challenged and lately uſed by
the noble King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, and King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>

For certainly her Majeſty neither doth,
nor ever will challenge any other Authority

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60480:13"/>
by the noble King of famous Memory,<note place="margin">If any Perſon ſhall accept the ſame Oath with this Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Senſe or Meaning, her Majeſty is well pleaſed to accept every ſuch in that behalf as her good and obedient Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Henry</hi>
the Eighth, and King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, which
is, and was of <hi>antient time</hi> due to the Imperial
Crown of this Realm, that is, under God to
have the Soveraignty and Rule over all manner
of Perſons born within theſe Realms, Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and Countries, of what Eſtate (either
Eccleſiaſtical or Temporal) ſoever they be, <hi>ſo
as</hi> no other foreign Power ſhall or ought to have
any Superiority over them.</p>
            <p>Now to ſhew that King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth
neither claimed nor pretended to any Power
purely Spiritual, let us ſee a <hi>Proviſo</hi> made in an
Act paſt in his Reign,<note place="margin">24 H. 8. c. 21.</note> Provided always that
this Act, nor any thing therein contained, ſhall
be hereafter interpreted or expounded, that
your Grace, your Nobles, and Subjects, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
by the ſame, to decline or vary from the
Congregation of Chriſt's Church, in any things
concerning the very Articles of the Catholick
Faith of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> or in any other things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
by Holy Scripture, and the Word of God,
neceſſary for your and their Salvation. The
Statute containing this <hi>Proviſo</hi> is revived and
confirmed by the Statute of 1 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 1. And
it is undeniable, that all <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> at that
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60480:13"/>
time, did own the Pope's Spiritual Power,
which was derived from the Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>Further, to ſhew, that the Queen who made
this Oath, intended it only for to diſtinguiſh
thoſe who denied the Pope's Power in Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,
from others who would not, and that
therefore ſhe doubted of their Loyalty. In
the Act made aforeſaid is enacted,<note place="margin">5 Eliz. cap. 1.</note> 
               <q>That for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch
as the Queen's Majeſty is otherways
ſufficiently aſſured of the Faith and Loyalty of
the Temporal Lords of her Highneſs's Court of
Parliament; therefore this Act, nor any thing
therein contained, ſhall not extend to compel
any temporal Perſon, of or above the Degree
of a Baron of this Realm, to take or pronounce
the Oath aboveſaid.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It was notoriouſly known, that the Lords and
Commons in that Parliament, wherein the Oath
of Supremacy was appointed, were moſtly Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Catholicks, which includes their holding
and profeſſing the Pope's Paſtoral Power. It
was Treaſon and Premunire to hold or profeſs
what by the Oath was denied to the Pope; but
it was neither for a Lord or other Perſon to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
himſelf a Roman Catholick, there was no
Diſloyalty in that. Thus then, I conclude, that
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60480:14"/>
the Pope's purely Eccleſiaſtical or Spiritual Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
is not denied in that Oath, and that this is the
Senſe, in which this Declaration is to be made,
as being a part of that Oath. And this I am
the more inclined to believe, becauſe in theſe
Oaths there are no doubtful Expreſſions of ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Juriſdictions, Powers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to belong
to any other Perſon; thoſe which are here only
declared, are, that no foreign Prince, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> hath
or ought to have. Nor is it to be paſt by with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
notice, that the Powers taken from his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs
by King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, were never
meant to be other than thoſe that were Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral,
for Queen <hi>Mary,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

reſtores to the Pope ſuch Authority, Prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
and Juriſdiction, as his Holineſs uſed
and exerciſed, or might <hi>lawfully</hi> have uſed and
exerciſed, by Authority of his Supremacy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
without Diminution or Enlargement of the
ſame, and no other. Which demonſtrates, that
the Juriſdictions, Powers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which King
<hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth deprived the Pope of, were
only ſuch as an Act of Parliament could reſtore
him to, which cannot be meant of that purely
Spiritual Power given by Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:60480:14"/>
To ſum up this Diſcourſe: The Pope had a
purely Spiritual Power committed by Chriſt
to him, as Succeſſor to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> to be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed
throughout the whole World, that is, To
teach, to bind, and looſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This Power,
we ſay, no Temporal Prince ever had, or claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
or could deprive him of. The Pope like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
had in this Kingdom Eccleſiaſtical or Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Power in Courts and Cauſes, or Matters,
called Eccleſiaſtical or Spiritual, as in Divorces,
Tythes, Oblations, Obventions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This
Power was external, political, civil, and meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
temporal, granted by or gained from the
Princes of theſe Realms, which being found
to be exerciſed to the great Detriment of the
Crown, and adjudged to be ſo by the Eſtates of
the Realm, hath been by ſeveral Statutes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted
from the Pope, and reſtored to the
Crown above 130 Years paſt, and ſo ſtill it
continues. The Truth of this is aſſured to us by
Acts of Parliament, and other credible Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
ſo manifeſtly, that there is no room for
Scruple in affirming, that (<hi>rebus ſic ſtantibus</hi>)
no foreign Prelate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> hath or ought to have
any Juriſdiction, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in this Realm, which is
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60480:15"/>
not derived from Chriſt, and which the Laws
of this Kingdom have deprived him of.</p>
            <p>Here is Authority commanding us to take
lawful Oaths, and to declare what we may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably
judg and be morally certain to be true,
no competent Authority admoniſhing or requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the contrary: Here are the Opinions of
great and learned Divines for the Lawfulneſs
and Duty of taking theſe Oaths: Here are the
higheſt of Evidences for the Truth of that Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which we are to declare our Belief of; the
Catholicks in <hi>England</hi> (generally) never took
the former Oaths of Supremacy and Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
and therefore on account of ſome Branches
in thoſe, they are not obliged to refuſe the firſt
of theſe Oaths: Theſe Oaths neither are in
themſelves, nor are intended to be diſtinctive
Signs between Catholicks and Proteſtants, for
the Acts lately made for amoving Papiſts and
reputed Papiſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and for diſarming Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
and reputed Papiſts, appoint the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
made in the Reign of the late King <hi>Charles,</hi>
               <note place="margin">30 Carol. 2.</note>
to be for the Trial and Diſcovery of them, and
that Declaration is not ſcrupled at by Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,
who yet (ſome of them) refuſe the firſt
of theſe Oaths: And had the Declaration which
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60480:15"/>
is annexed to theſe Oaths been a Denial of the
Pope's Paſtoral Power in this Realm, there
needed no other Teſt for Diſcovery of Papiſts,
ſince no Catholick would diſown that Spiritual
Power to be in his Holineſs. Theſe things
