            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THis undrest Play has been so little endebted to Poet and Painter, that it has wanted Beauty to invite Numbers, and Merit to secure Friends: yet with all its disadvanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, it has not mist of Honours; when it has appeared, so often favour'd by your <hi>Graces</hi> Presence, and somtimes by your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; an encouragement so great, that your <hi>Grace</hi> little thinks what mischief you have brought upon your Self, by the Persecution you are like to suffer from the Addresses of so troublesome a Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite as Poetry; yet such a Favourite, whose Arrogance you cannot blame: For, as 'tis said of Poets, who are Born, not Made, 'tis so with their <hi>Patrons</hi>: Your Kindness is Hereditary, and you derive your Friendship to the Muses from your Noble <hi>Ancestry.</hi> The
<pb facs="tcp:61206:4"/>
Name of <hi>Newcastle</hi> warrants my Ambition; a Person of that Worth and Gallantry, that he has been an <hi>Atlas</hi> to Poetry; his Bounty to it admits of no Equal, and his Perfection in it, no Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior: Nor has he only been the greatest Protector of the Muses, but their greatest <hi>Subject</hi> too, witness those Immortal Trophies of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance, his late memorable Services to an Exile King, and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining Crown; where his Unbyast Courage aim'd at no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward then the Glory of his Cause. And so like <hi>Caesar,</hi> who after his Conquests, wrote his own Commentaries, the Hand of a <hi>Newcastle</hi> acted, what the Hand of a <hi>Newcastle</hi> only was worthy to write. Thus have his adorable Qualities resembled the Arm'd <hi>Pallas</hi> amongst the Ancients; though in their infinite numbers of feigned Deities, they to every Attribute of a Divinity, nay almost to every Humane Art appropriated a particular God, yet they united Learning and Arms. Thus has this Illustrious <hi>Heroe</hi> character'd that Divinity on Earth, which they but fancied in Heaven. But your <hi>Graces</hi> Glory does not rest here; your Affinity is no less Conspicuous, than your Birth, being Allied to another equal Miracle of Loyalty, an <hi>Albemarle,</hi> differing from the former only in time and Fortune, That attended a Setting, and This Usher'd in a Rising Sun. Nor in this Circle of Honour does your <hi>Grace</hi> only share, but make a part; your own Virtues shine so worthy of the Sphear they move in, that all your additional Ornaments of Fame and Greatness, are not the Gift, but the Reward of Providence. And on that score <hi>Mariamne</hi> throws her self at your feet: Your smiles have made her a Captive, and your Vertues a Proselyte. But while so mean an Offering as a Play, begs your Acceptance, the more worthless, in that the hasty Representation of it did not give me time to put a finishing hand to it, the first Copy of it being given me by a Gentleman, to use and form as I pleas'd, I humbly implore, that, what the present wants may be supplyed by the Zeal and Obedience of</p>
