            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>WE are ſo highly ſenſible of the extraordinary Merits of Our County of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> of their Zeal for the Defence of our Perſon, and the Juſt Rights of Our Crown, in a time when We could contribute ſo little to Our own Defence, or to their Aſſiſtance; (in a time, when not only no Reward appeared, but great and probable Dangers were threatned to Obedience and Loyalty) of their Great and Eminent Courage and Patience in their Indefatigable proſecution of their great work againſt ſo Potent an Enemy, backt with ſo Strong, Rich and Populous Cities, and ſo plentifully furniſhed with Men, Arms, Money, Ammunition and Proviſions of all kinds; and of the wonderful ſucceſs with which it hath pleaſed Almighty God (though with the loſs of ſome Eminent perſons, who ſhall never be forgotten by Us to reward their Loyalty and Patience) by many ſtrange Victories over their and Our Enemies, in deſpite of all humane probabilities and all imaginable diſadvantages; that as We cannot be forgetful of ſo great Deſerts, ſo We cannot but deſire to publiſh to all the World, and perpetuate to all time the memory of their Merits, and of Our Acceptance of the ſame. And to that end, We do hereby render Our Royal Thanks to that Our County in the moſt publick and laſting manner We can deviſe, Commanding Copies hereof to be Printed and published, and one of them to be read in every Church and Chapel therein, and to be kept for ever as a Record in the ſame, that as long as the Hiſtory of theſe Times, and of this Nation ſhall continue, the Memory of how much that County hath merited from Us and Our Crown, may be derived with it to Poſterity.</p>
