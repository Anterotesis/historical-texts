            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Members of Parliament, and
all others that have bowels of pitty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
cruelly oppreſſed Tenants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>YOu muſt not expect high Language from us, who
are low-borne Tennants; We ſhall ſpeake plain
Truthes, And firſt, we are bold to tell you, That
our Fore-Elders were Antient Tennants to the
<hi>Dean and Chapter of Durham<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> who thought they
had left unto us that large Birth-right which could
not legally have been taken from us; but we finde it otherwiſe,
for we are now become (unleſs God help us) miſerable ſlaves to
Lieutenant Collonel <hi>John Lilburne;</hi> for the Parliament having
given unto the ſaid Mr. <hi>Lilburne</hi> three thouſand pounds, and
afterwards committed him to the Tower for high Treaſon; and
being acquitted by his Jury at <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi> he preſently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,
that there was remaining and not paid, fifteen hundred
pounds of the ſaid 3000 <hi>l.</hi> gift. The Lord Generall then coming
out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> moved the Parliament to give Mr. <hi>Lilburne</hi>
the ſaid fifteen hundred pounds ſo owing unto him, out of
<hi>Deanes and Chapters</hi> Lands; Which the Parliament immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
granted, and therein begun our miſeries; for we being
poor People farre remote and diſtant from <hi>London,</hi> and all, or
moſt of us ignorant of our own buſineſs, wanting friends to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe
or help us, within the ſmall time of pre-emption the Act
allowed us, the ſaid Lieutenant Collonell <hi>John Lilburne</hi> ſtept
in before us, and made choyce of ſeverall Farmes and Cottages
which we held lying in the County of <hi>Durham,</hi> being the whole
livelihood and ſubſiſtence of fourteene Families. And before
the Act paſſed, the ſaid Mr. <hi>Lilburne</hi> made large promiſes of
kinde uſage to us the Tenants, ſaying in the preſence of ſeverall
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:35326:3"/>
witneſſes, <hi>That we ſhould have our Lands again, paying him
the Rates of his purchaſe</hi> (namely) <hi>the money he paid;</hi> but
ſince, we have ſo farre taſted his kindneſs, as now we have
cauſe to ſay, <hi>The Lord deliver us from ſuch a Landlord.</hi>
There are of us fourteene Families, and when the Act paſſed,
but two of our Farmes were out of Leaſe, <hi>William Hunting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
had the one, and <hi>George Clifton,</hi> a poor Priſoner in the
Goale, had the other. I, the ſaid <hi>William Huntington</hi> Married
a Widdow, that was Tennant to the <hi>Deane and Chapter,</hi> ſhe
had a Houſe, Farme, Goods and Houſhold-ſtufie, two Cows
and four Children; I, the ſaid <hi>William Huntington</hi> after marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
with her, was forced to borrow moneys to Plow and Sow
the ſaid Farme, and God gave me a Childe by her, that made
our number five; ſo ſoon as our Houſes, and Lands were ſetled
by Authority of Parliament in the ſaid Mr. <hi>Lilburne,</hi> he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
came into the County of <hi>Durham,</hi> and ſtripped me the
ſaid <hi>William Huntington,</hi> of Houſe, Farme, Cropp, Houſhold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuffe,
Goods, Hay, and Straw, and two Cowes; he tooke from
me Goods to the value of one hundred and thirty pounds
at the leaſt; he thruſt us all out of doors, my Wife with her
five ſmall Children, leaves us not one Cow, I may truely ſay,
ſcarcely one bit of bread; and for my ſelfe, I could expect no
other, but to lye and rot in Priſon for the Debt which I borowed
as aforeſaid. Next, he fell upon me <hi>George Clifton,</hi> a poor Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner
in the Goale of <hi>Durham</hi> for debt; he likewiſe caſt my poor
Children out of my Houſe and Farme, expoſing them to periſh
in the ſtreets; tooke from me Houſe, and Farme, Houſhold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuff,
and all that I had; and my Children being put by him
upon the Pariſh, he was ſo farre from allowing them ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
out of my owne Eſtate, that he refuſed to contribute with
the Pariſh towards their maintenance. And thus he dealt
with the two Tennants of the two Farmes out of Leaſe. And
the ſaid Mr. <hi>Lilburne</hi> alſo threatned me <hi>Gaſcoyne Eden,</hi>
becauſe I would not deliver up my Eſtate to him, then having
ſeven yeers in Leaſe: He writ a Letter to me, wherein he tells
me, That he was the Deane and Chapters Succeſſor, and
did therein command me to ſend in a Man and Horſe, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:35326:3"/>
to my Leaſe, in compleat Armes, to ſerve under his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Collonell <hi>Robert Lilburne</hi> in <hi>Scotland;</hi> and further ſaid
in his ſaid Letter, That if I did not give up my Leaſe to him,
(having ſeven years then in being) he would extend all the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Forfeitures and Breaches of my Leaſe againſt me, to make
it void, whereby he might weary me out of my Right and Due
of yeers therein. Next after, he fell upon me <hi>Robert Chriſt ofer</hi>
another of the poor Tennants, who was alwayes conſtant and
faithfull to the Parliament, and voluntarily ſet forth Horſes and
Armes in the Parliament Service, farre beyond my Eſtate; I
never offended him in all my life, but in a moſt humble manner
tendering my Rent to him about a week after the day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he refuſed to
receive it, and told me, My Leaſe was forfeited, by my failing
the juſt day of payment, and he would take advantage of it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly:
Yea, after many humble addreſſes made unto the
ſaid Mr. <hi>Lilburne</hi> by the poor Cottagers and Leaſers, divers
of them following him to <hi>London,</hi> and there craving pity and
compaſſion from him upon their poor Wives and Children, offering
him his money with advantage for the ſaid Lands; he (in a great
paſſion) denied, bid them goe home again like as Fools they came,
ſaying, He would out them every man as their Leaſes expired.
Need then made me poor <hi>William Huntington</hi> to runne from
Juſtice to Juſtice, complaining of the wrong done unto me by
Lieutenant Collonell <hi>John Lilburne;</hi> I went to the publique Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
at <hi>Durham,</hi> where Sir <hi>Arthur Haſlerigge</hi> was upon the
Bench; after the Reading of my Petition there, he told me, <hi>It was
not in the power of the Seſſions to help me.</hi> I then not knowing
what elſe to do, went immediately to <hi>London</hi> upon my naked
Feet to the Parliament, and Printed my ſad caſe and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and delivered it to the Members as they came into the
Houſe; at which Lieutenant Collonell <hi>Lilburne</hi> was a little
moved, and then ſaid, the buſineſs ſhould be referred to my
Lord Generall, Sir <hi>Arthur Haſlerigge,</hi> and Collonell <hi>Martin;</hi>
which made me exceedingly to rejoyce: and in purſuance
thereof, I attended Collonell <hi>Martin</hi> from place to place ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his appointment, ſo long, that wearineſs and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty
drove me back again into the Country, having nothing
to relieve me, but the Charity of ſuch as pittied my conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:35326:4"/>
I then being not able to abide in the Country for feare of
Impriſonment, came againe to <hi>London</hi> on foot, begging my
Bread by the way, it being about two hundred Miles. And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
no better ſucceſs at the Parliament doore, after a long
attendance, and many being wearied of me, and my ſelfe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
of my life; I returned againe to hide my ſelfe a while in
the Country, hoping God might help at the laſt. Then when I
heard that Lieutenant Collonell <hi>John Lilburne</hi> was baniſhed,
and that there was a Fine to be payd to Sir <hi>Arthur Haſlerigge,</hi>
I forthwith tooke me to my Feet, and againe to <hi>London</hi> I went,
and told Sir <hi>Arthur,</hi> that it was now in his power to do both
my ſelf, Wife and Children good, and that we would pray for
him all our dayes, if he would but help us as God had put it
into his hands. Sir <hi>Arthur</hi> was pleaſed to ſpeak to Collonell
<hi>Martin,</hi> and a time was appointed at Sir <hi>Arthurs</hi> Chamber at
<hi>White-Hall,</hi> where Collonell <hi>Martin,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Lilburne,</hi> Mr. <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardſon,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> and ſome others of Mrs. <hi>Lilburnes</hi> Friends
met: I had onely my ſelfe to lay open my miſerable caſe;
which when the aforeſaid Gentlemen heard they lifted up
their hands, wondring that Lieutenant Collonell <hi>John Lilburne</hi>
ſhould deale ſo cruelly with a poore miſerable man, his Wife,
and five ſmall Children. Sir <hi>Arthur</hi> moved, that whereas the
Rent of that Farme had for a long time been but three pounds
<hi>per Annum;</hi> And that the Parliament had ſold it to Lieutenant
Collonell <hi>Lilburne,</hi> upon improvement, at eighteen pounds,
that therefore I ſhould give eighteen pounds <hi>per Annum</hi> to
Mrs. <hi>Lilburne,</hi> which was the racke Rent valued to her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.
Mrs. <hi>Lilburnes</hi> Friends that came with her, pittyed my
caſe ſo much, that they thought it fit I ſhould have alſo the one
hundred and thirty pound Goods reſtored, which Mr. <hi>Lilburne</hi>
had taken from me. Mrs. <hi>Lilburne</hi> then replied, that ſhe had
no money, but I might have one of my Cowes againe: ſome
of her Friends then ſaid, It was fit I ſhould have ſatisfaction
out of the Rent. And Sir <hi>Arthur</hi> ſaid, Care muſt be taken that
the poore man have a livelihood from his hard labour, ſo that
he may preſerve his Wife and Children from ſtarving; And
alſo to help Mrs. <hi>Lilburn</hi> and her children. And further ſaid,
That he was ſenſible, that <hi>John Lilburn</hi> ought not to have taken
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:35326:4"/>
thoſe Goods from me: for if any Arrears were due, they belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the State, and not to the Purchaſer. But ſaid, that now
Mrs. <hi>Lilburn,</hi> and her children, being in as ſad a condition as my
ſelf and mine; that therefore I ſhould pay unto her, for her ſelf
and children, the full improvement, which was Eighteen pounds
a yeer; and that if I did not carefully pay my Rent. Mrs. <hi>Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn</hi>
ſhould enter upon the Farm. This, though heavie on my
ſide, to loſe all my Goods, and to be raiſed up to ſo high a Rent,
as from Three pounds to Eighteen pound, <hi>per annum,</hi> the Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
being figned by Mrs. <hi>Lilburn,</hi> Colonel <hi>Martin,</hi> and Sir
<hi>Arthur Haſlerigge,</hi> I joyfully took it, reſolving to labour hard,
and to pay my Rent honeſtly; and made haſte into the Country,
and ſhewed the Agreement under the aforeſaid hands to Mr. <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard
Lilburn.</hi> Mr. <hi>John Lilburn</hi>'s father, and deſired him to
deliver me Poſſeſſion accordingly: which he abſolutely refuſed.
Then ſome Women, my wives Neighbours, deſirous to ſee her in
her houſe again, thruſt out the ſaid Mr. <hi>Richard Lilburn</hi> from
amongſt them: which no ſooner being done, but the ſaid Mr.
<hi>Richard Lilburn,</hi> by his great importunity with the Sheriff of
the County, and by colour of an old Warrant, as I underſtand,
procured the ſaid Sheriff to come to my houſe, and thruſt us out
of poſſeſſion, and gave it to Mr. <hi>Richard Lilburn.</hi> Then I
forthwith went again to <hi>London</hi> to Sir <hi>Arthur Haſlerigge,</hi> and
told him how little Mr. <hi>Richard Lilburn</hi> valued the Agreement
made in his Chamber. He told me, he could do no more but
get it under Mrs. <hi>Lilburn</hi>'s hand, and Colonel <hi>Martin</hi>'s, and
that he knew not what to do or ſay to Mr. <hi>Richard Lilburn.</hi>
But I preſſed him moſt earneſtly, and ſaid, I never durſt return
into the Country, if I had not help from him; and that it was in
his power. And really, I had rotted in Priſon, and my Wife and
her children had gone a Begging all their days, who was deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of honeſt Parents, ſuch as had lived in good credit amongſt
their Neighbours, had I not found pity and compaſſion in Sir
<hi>Arthur</hi>'s breſt, neceſſity inciting me ſtrongly to importune him
daily for his aſſiſtance: for when he would have put me off, I
told him I muſt continue to trouble him. And in truth, my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
was ſo miſerable and deſperate, having gone upon my bare
feet two thouſand miles, back and again, or thereabouts, in ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:35326:5"/>
releife, that I thought to hang upon his doore would bring
me reſt. Sir <hi>Arthur</hi> then acquainted Collonell <hi>Martin</hi> what
Maſter <hi>Richard Lilburne</hi> had done, and deſired him to ſpeak
to Mrs. <hi>Lilburne,</hi> that order might be taken for the performance
of the ſaid Agreement, which ſhe and her Friends had made
and ſigned; he promiſed a ſpeedy accompt, and the next
day he told Sir <hi>Arthur,</hi> that ſhe had received Letters from
her Husband, wherein he commanded, that nothing ſhould
be done by her; and thereupon, Sir <hi>Arthur</hi> deſired Collonell
<hi>Martin</hi> to tell her from him. That if ſhe would not perform
her Agreement, which he apprehended to be juſt and reaſonable,
and for her advantage, he thought he was bound in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
to preſerve the poor man, his Wife and Children, by
laying his extent upon the Lands. Collonell <hi>Martin</hi> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
replyed, That he would do very well in ſo doing; and if
it was his caſe he would do the like. Collonell <hi>Martin</hi> then
acquainted Mrs. <hi>Lilburne</hi> with Sir <hi>Arthurs</hi> reſolution, and
returned this anſwer, That ſhe was <hi>John Lilburnes</hi> Wife, and
that he could not prevail in the leaſt with her, and therefore
bad Sir <hi>Arthur</hi> not to expect further. Then we, the reſt of
the Tennants, hoping there was an opportunity for us and ours,
made choyce of one Captain <hi>Farrer</hi> to be our Solicitor, and
ſent him to <hi>London</hi> to Sir <hi>Arthur Haſlerigge,</hi> to entreat, That
according to Lieutenant Collonell <hi>John Lilburnes</hi> Promiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he bought our Lands, that we might yet have it as he payd:
Thereupon, the ſaid Captain <hi>Farrer</hi> applied himſelfe to Sir
<hi>Arthur Haſlerigge</hi> at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> acquainting him with the
Tennants humble and earneſt deſires; and as it hapned upon
ſome complaints that Mrs. <hi>Lilburne</hi> had made to Collonell
<hi>Joyce,</hi> againſt Sir <hi>Arthur Haſlerigge,</hi> there was a meeting
appointed at Mr. <hi>Peters</hi> Chamber in <hi>White-Hall,</hi> and thither
came Mrs. <hi>Lilburne,</hi> and her own Father; and there were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Mr. <hi>Peters,</hi> and Collonell <hi>Joyce;</hi> and Sir <hi>Arthur Haſle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigge</hi>
tooke the ſaid Captain <hi>Farrer</hi> along with him. Then
did Sir <hi>Arthur</hi> Declare in the preſence of all before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,
That he never had a thought of getting one penny out
of <hi>John Lilburnes</hi> Eſtate, and that Mrs. <hi>Lilburne</hi> had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
him to lay his extent upon the Land, becauſe ſhe would not
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:35326:5"/>
perform the Agreement under her own hand, whereby <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tington,</hi>
his Wife and Children might live. He then declared the
great complaints of the Tennants. And this offer was made by
Sir <hi>Arthur</hi> to Mrs. <hi>Lilburne,</hi> That the Tennants ſhould pay
the ſumme of money, for which the Parliament gave him that
Land, being nine hundred and forty pounds, with conſideration
from the time of paſſing the Act, ſhe deducting what Rents they
had received. Afterward Sir <hi>Arthur</hi> told her, the Tennants
ſhould give her a thouſand pound at one entire payment; that
the preſent Rent was but three and fifty pound <hi>per annum:</hi>
And when all Leaſes were out, it would not come to above one
hundred five and twenty pounds <hi>per annum.</hi> And then Mr.
<hi>Peters</hi> offered her to help her to a hundred pound <hi>per annum</hi>
for ever, and in preſent poſſeſſion for that thouſand pound.
Sir <hi>Arthur</hi> told her that if ſhe was his own Siſter, he would
adviſe her to take it; for if ſhe did, ſhe was then certaine of
good maintenance for her ſelfe and her Chrildren, and that
no Act her Husband either had done, or ſhould do, could take
it from them, for ſhe ſhould have it upon this Extent; and for
his part, he did not expect or deſire thankes. Then Mr. <hi>Peters</hi>
and Collonell <hi>Joyce,</hi> much approved the motion, but Mrs.
<hi>Lilburne</hi> would not conſent. Then Sir <hi>Arthur</hi> ſaid, He
would do the Tennants what good he could, and never take
one penny for his own advantage from Mrs. <hi>Lilburne</hi> or her
Children. All which the ſaid Captaine <hi>Farrer</hi> is ready to averre
and atteſt, upon his own Knowledge: And further, that Sir
<hi>Arthur Haſlerigge</hi> hath been at great trouble and charge
out of his own Purſe; but never received one penny out of Mr.
<hi>Lilburnes</hi> Eſtate. Nay, when we the Tennants deſired the
ſaid Captaine <hi>Farrer</hi> to preſent him with a Breeding Mare, as
a ſmall token of our thankfulneſs, in anſwer to his great trouble
and charge; Sir <hi>Arthur</hi> replied. No, he would not gaine the
Hayre of a Horſe by Lieutenant Collonell <hi>Lilburnes</hi> Eſtate;
notwithſtanding he bought the ſaid Mare of M. <hi>Thomas Daviſon.</hi>
at the Rate of forty pounds. And all we the Tennants do wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
That Sir <hi>Arthur Haſlerigge</hi> never received one penny of
our Rents; but the ſame or moſt part thereof hath been payd
to Lieutenant Collonell <hi>John Lilburne,</hi> or to his Father Mr.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:35326:6"/>
               <hi>Richard Lilburne,</hi> for his uſe, ſince the time of his Grant, untill
of late, that the ſaid Mr. <hi>Richard Lilburne</hi> refuſeth to receive
any more Rents of us, ſaying, That he would not be ordered
by Sir <hi>Arthur Haſlerigge</hi> to receive any Rents at his appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
meaning this Order here under written made and ſigned by
Sir <hi>Arthur Haſlerigge.</hi>
