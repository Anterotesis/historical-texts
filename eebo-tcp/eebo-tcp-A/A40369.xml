            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

much troubled, and could he have got near the Altar would have interrupted them; but being hindred by the throng of the people, he was very sorrowful for his neglect of that opportunity to declare against their Idolatry, which neglect he much lamented, and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved how to redeem it; to effect which he cast up all his accounts, and bad a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dieu to worldly concerns; and giving himself to reading, meditating, fasting, weeping, and praying: He being clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly drest the next <hi>Sunday,</hi> when the like Solemnity was to be done, he gat to the Altar betimes, and there stood with a Testament in his hand till the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal came to solemnize it, and till he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated, sacrificed, and lifted up on high the Host, shewing his God to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who with the Kings and Nobles gave great reverence to it; and at last, when the Cardinal came to begin to toss it to and fro round the Chalice, making several Circles, this <hi>Gardner</hi> stept in, and with one hand took the Cake and trod it under foot, and with the other

hand overthrew the Chalice, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the Kings, and the Nobles and Citizens, which abashed them all; and one cut him with a Sword, but the King commanded he should be saved; and being examined, he confessed himself to be an <hi>English-man</hi> and a Protestant, and decryed much against their Idolatry; for which after several torments to cause him to confess others, he taking all the blame on himself, they put a hard roul of Linen with a string into his throat, and so often pulled that up, and then cut of his right hand, which he took in his left and kist, then in the Market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place they cut off his left hand, and he kneeling down kissed it, then was he carried to Execution, and being hung on high a fire was made under him, and he by degrees let down into it, so that only his legs at first felt the fire, yet would he not recant; and being bid to pray to Saints, he said, That when Christ leaves off to be our Mediator and Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, then he would pray to our Lady and the Saints. And then he prayed,

                        <hi>O Eternal God, Father of all mercies; I beseech thee look down upon thy Servant.</hi> And the more terribly he burnt, the more vehemently he prayed; which his Enemies desiring to hinder, he said the 43. Psalm; before the close of which, the Rope was burnt asunder, and he fell down into the Fire, and was burned to death, 1552. whose death was not unpunished, for among the King of <hi>Portugal</hi>'s Ships ready to sail, being in a Haven hard by, one was burnt by a Spark of Fire blown from the Martyrs Fire; and within half a Year the Kings Son dyed; and the King himself within a Year. <hi>Vol.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 745, 746, 747, 748.</p>

for Christ. Which Objection he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered from Gods mercies, and the unworthiness of like Servants in all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, who have been accepted.

Hunter</hi> said, <hi>For my little pain which I shall suffer, which is but short, Christ hath promised me a Crown of joy; may you not be glad of that Mother</hi>?

humble and meek, and his life an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Piety. He was ready to do good to all, forgiving all Enemies rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily; and never sought to do evil to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one. To the poor, blind, lame, and sick, he was a very Father, a careful Patron, and diligent provider.

To whom he said, <hi>Dear Friends, I thank you for your care; yet I know my Cause so good, and the truth so strong on my side, that I will, by God's grace, go and appear before them; and to their beards will resist

God will not forsake his Church, but will raise up more fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Teachers than I, who shall never have again so glorious a call as I now have; wherefore I be seech you to pray for me, and I doubt not but God will give me strength and his spirit, that all my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries shall have shame of their doings.</hi> And so taking care of his people, he and his Man, <hi>Iohn Hull,</hi> went towards <hi>London</hi>; but his Man advised him to fly, proffering his faithful service to him in all affairs: To whom the Doctor replyed, <hi>Oh</hi> John, <hi>shall I give place to this thy Counsel, and leave my Flock in this danger? Remember Christ, the good Shepherd, who not only fed his Flock, but dyed for them also. Him must I follow, and by God's grace will; therefore,</hi> John, <hi>pray for me; and if thou seest me at any time weak, comfort me; and discourage me not in this godly Enterprize, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</hi> When he came to Bishop <hi>Gardiner,</hi> who reviled him much, and asked him how he durst look him in the face, and if he knew who he was?

                        <hi>Yes, I know who you are, Dr.</hi> Stephen Gardiner, <hi>Bishop of</hi> Winchester, <hi>Lord Chancellor; and yet but a mortal Man I trow: but if I should be afraid of your Lordly looks, why fear you not God the Lord of us all? How dare ye look any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Man in the face, seeing you have forsaken the truth, denyed Christ, and done contrary to your Oath and Writing? With what face will ye appear before Christ's Iudgment Seat, and answer to your Oath against Popery in King</hi> Henry <hi>the</hi> 8th<hi>'s time, and in King</hi> Edward <hi>the</hi> 6th<hi>'s dayes, when you both spoke, and wrote against it.</hi> Vol. 3. p. 167, 168, 169. When he was condemned with Mr. <hi>Bradford,</hi> and others; they joyfully gave thanks, and stoutly said to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, <hi>That God would require their blood at their hands, and that one day they should repent this their Tyranny a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Flock of Christ.</hi> p. 174. When <hi>Bonner,</hi> Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> came to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade him; and brought with him the Vestments, according to their Popish manner; he bad him put them on, but
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:95562:94"/>
Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> would not, so <hi>Bonner</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed another to put them on; and then Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> set his hands by his side, and walked up and down, saying, <hi>How do you like me now? how say you my Lord, am not I a goodly Fool? how say you my Masters, if I were in</hi> Cheapside <hi>now, should not I have Boys enough to laugh at me, and at these Apish toys, and toying trumpery</hi>? So the Bishop performed his Ceremonies of degradation, and cursed him: To whom Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> said, <hi>Though you curse, God will bless: you have done me wrong, and violence; yet I pray God, if it be his will, forgive you.</hi> The next day his Wife and Son and Man, supped with him; and he exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Son to obey God and his Mother; and exhorted her to be stedfast in the faith, and to shun Popery; and then wrote his last farewel to his People of <hi>Hadley,</hi> perswading their stedfastness in the Doctrine he had preached a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them against Popery. <hi>Vol.</hi> 3. <hi>p.</hi> 175.

his Wife and Children suspecting as much, lay all night in <hi>Botolph</hi>'s Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard; and as he went early in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, she cryed to him, <hi>Rowland, Rowland,</hi> and came to him; who took his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Mary</hi> in his arms, and then all of them kneeled and said the Lords Prayer; then kissed he his Wife, saying, <hi>Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel my dear Wife, be of good comfort; for I am quiet in my Conscience, and God shall stir up a Father for my Children</hi>; and kissing his two Daughters, <hi>Mary,</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> he said, <hi>God bless you</hi>: and so praying them all to keep close to God's Word, and to flye Idolatry, he went on: to whom his Wife said, <hi>God be with thee my dear</hi> Rowland, <hi>I will meet thee at</hi> Hadley: And after this Speech to his Wife, he did see his Son <hi>Thomas,</hi> and his Man <hi>Iohn Hull,</hi> whom he commanded to lift up his Son, whom he blessed and prayed for; and then gave him again to his Servant. At <hi>Burntwood</hi> as they went, they made a Hood for the Dr. with holes only to see and breathe through, that none might

know him, nor he speak to any. The Dr. was very pleasant all the way, as if he was going to a Banquet. And when he came to <hi>Chelmsford,</hi> the Sheriff of <hi>Suffolk</hi> met him; and as they were at Supper, the Sheriff of <hi>Essex</hi> perswaded him to turn to Popery; pleading his strength of body might live long, and he would be in great esteem, because all loved him for his sweetness and Learning, and a pardon might still be had, and so drank to him, and so did all the Yeomen of the Guard, his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants. And when the Cup came to the Dr. he considered a while before he spake, and at last thanked them for their Counsel; and said, <hi>To be plain with you, I perceive I have been deceived my self, and am like to deceive a great many of</hi> Hadley <hi>of their expectation:</hi> At which words they rejoyced, saying, Gods blessing on your heart, hold you there still, why should you cast away your life? But he said, <hi>My meaning is this; I am deceived, and, as I think, I shall deceive a great many: I am, ye see,

a Man of a great carcass, which I thought should have been buried in</hi> Hadly <hi>Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, but herein I see I am deceived: and there are a great many worms in</hi> Hadly <hi>Church-yard which would have had a jolly feeding upon this carrion, but now I know they will be deceived, for this carcass must be burned to ashes:</hi> Which sayings asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished the <hi>Sheriff,</hi> that he should but jest at death now at hand. Within 2 miles of <hi>Hadly,</hi> he desired to alight to make water, and fetched a frisk or two as Men do in dancing, saying he was very well, never better; <hi>For now I know I am al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most at my Father's home.</hi> And after that he did understand he should go through <hi>Hadly,</hi> he blessed God that he should once more see his People before he died, whom he prayed God to bless and keep stedfast in word and truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and at <hi>Hadly</hi> a poor Man and 5 Children meeting him, begg'd an alms, and pray'd to God to comfort him, as he had done often him and his Children.

Certainly if your petitions were just and lawful, God would have heard you; but ye honour a false God, and pray not as ye ought to pray, and therefore hath not God granted your desire; but God hath heard my complaint, and I trust will strengthen me in his own cause.</hi> Then the Bishop would have a <hi>Mass,</hi> at which <hi>Rawlins</hi> went, and begg'd the Brethren or but one Brother to bear witness that he did not worship that Idol the <hi>Host</hi> over the Priest's head: and so, soon after he was condemned: who then sent to his Wife for a Shirt to be burnt in, which he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Wedding-garment.

                  <p>THE First Persecution was raised by <hi>Nero Domitius,</hi> the 6<hi>th</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of <hi>Rome</hi>; who thought, by raising a Persecution in all his Provinces, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolish the Name of Christians.

                  <p>The Second Persecution began in the 69. year of Christ by <hi>Domitian,</hi> who began mildly, yet did after so rage in pride, that he commanded himself to be worship'd as God: He slew most of the Nobles, and all of the Seed of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>: He intending to destroy all of the Seed of <hi>David,</hi> lest Christ should come and cast him out of his Empire: And sending for two Nephews of <hi>Iude,</hi> the Brother of Christ, who were then alive; and demanding of them concerning Christ's Kingdom, upon their informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that it was not an earthly King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:95562:123"/>
but an heavenly Kingdom, to be manifested in the consummation of the World, when he should come again to judge the quick and dead. <hi>Domitian</hi> stayed the Persecution, and dismissed them. <hi>Vol.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 48.</p>

                  <p>The Fourth Persecution began by <hi>Marcus Antoninus Verus,</hi> who began to Reign in the 162. year of Christ, and was very sharp and severe against Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians: which Christians, when the Armies of this Emperour were warring against the <hi>Vandals,</hi> and had like to have perished for want of Water five dayes, did, to the number of a Legion, withdraw themselves suddenly from the Camp, and prostrated themselves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God; and by ardent Prayer obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of God, by and by, a double relief; Rain for themselves, and Lightning, discomfiting their Enemies, who were
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:95562:123"/>
many of them put to flight: which Miracle so pleased the Emperour, that he abated his fury against the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; grew milder, and ordered his Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers to give thanks to the Christians, no less for his victory, than for the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of himself; and also ordered that their Accusers should be burned alive. <hi>Vol.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 54. to 66.</p>
                  <p>The Fifth Persecution was raised by <hi>Severus,</hi> the Emperour; who, in the year of Christ, 215. proclaimed, and commanded, no Christian should be suffered. <hi>Vol.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 70.</p>
                  <p>The Sixth Persecution began by <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus,</hi> about 237 years of Christ, against the Teachers of the Christians; think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereby to destroy the rest the soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. <hi>Vol.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 76.</p>

This <hi>Dioclesian</hi> and <hi>Maximinian,</hi> deposed the Emperial Office willingly, 309. and lived retired<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. <hi>Vol.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 100.105.</p>
                  <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> 8. King of <hi>England,</hi> by the instigation of <hi>Stephen Gardiner,</hi> and other Popish Prelates, was forced to make, and decree, these 6 Articles, to be observed by his Subjects, 1540. which were cause of great Persecution.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That in the Sacrament of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar upon the efficacy of the words of Christ exprest by the Priest, Christ's natural body is really present, Water, Bread, and Wine; and that after Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration there remains no Bread, nor Wine, nor any other substance; but the substance of Christ, God and Man.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the Communion in both kinds is not necessary absolutely, by the Law of God, to all Persons; and that in the Flesh, under the form of Bread is
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:95562:124"/>
the very Blood; and with the Blood, under the form of Wine, is the very Flesh; as well apart, as they were both together.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That the Priests, after the Order of Priesthood, may not marry by the Law of God.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Vows of Chastity and Widow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, advisedly made by the Law of God, ought to be kept; and exempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from other liberties of Christian People, which else they might enjoy.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That it is meet and necessary, that private Masses be continued in the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Church and Congregation.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. That <hi>Auricular</hi> Confession is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, and expedient to be retained, used, and frequented in the Church of God.</p>
                  <p>The Opposers of those Articles were to be esteemed Fellons, and to lose both life and goods; which occasioned great and cruel Persecutions. <hi>Vol.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 441.</p>
                  <p>These Articles, and all other Popish Articles, were repealed by King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the 6<hi>th. Vol.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 654.</p>
