            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>I Heartily wish this Play were as perfect as I intended it, that it might be more worthy your acceptance; and that my Dedication of it to you, might be more becoming that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Esteem which I, with every Body, who are so fortunate as to know you, have for you. It had your Countenance when yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known; and now it is made publick, it wants your Protection.</p>

               </gap> Objections, that they have found fault with that, which has been pleasing to you. This Play in relation to my concern for its Reputation, succeeded before it was Acted, for thro' your early Patronage it had an audience of several Persons of the first Rank

both in Wit and Quality; and their allowance of it, was a Consequence of your approbation. Therefore if I really wish it might have had a more popular reception; it is not at all in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of my self; but because I wish well, and would gladly contribute to the benefit of the Stage, and diversion of the Town. They were (not long since) so kind to a very imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Comedy of mine, that I thought my self justly indebted to them all my endeavours for an entertainment that might merit some little of that Applause, which they were so lavish of, when I thought I had no Title to it. But I find they are to be treated cheaply, and I have been at an unnecessary expence.</p>
            <p>I would not have any Body imagine, that I think this Play without its Faults, for I am Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scious of several, and ready to own 'em; but it shall be to those who are able to find 'em out. I confess I design'd (whatever Vanity or Ambition occasion'd that design) to have written a true and regular Comedy, but I found it an undertaking which put me in mind of—<hi>Sude<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> a design, I do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess both the attempt, and the imperfect perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance. Yet I must take the boldness to say, I have not miscarried in the whole; for the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical part of it is perfect. That, I may say with as little vanity, as a Builder may say he has built
<pb facs="tcp:56397:3"/>
a House according to the Model laid down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him; or a Gardiner that he has set his Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in a knot of such or such a Figure. I design'd the Moral first, and to that Moral I invented the Fable, and do not know that I have borrow'd one hint of it any where. I made the Plot as strong as I could, because it was single, and I made it single, because I would avoid confusion, and was resolved to preserve the three Unities of the Drama, which I have visibly done to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most severity. This is what I ought not to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve upon my self; but the Ignorance and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of the greater part of the Audience is such, that they would make a Man turn Herauld to his own Play, and Blazon every Character. However, Sir, this Discourse is very impertinent to you; whose Judgment, much better can discern the Faults, than I can excuse them; and whose good Nature, like that of a Lover, will find out those hidden Beauties (if there are any such) which it would be great immodesty in me to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:56397:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>I have since the Acting of this Play hearkned after the Objections which have been made to it; for I was Conscious where a true Critick might have put me upon my defence. I was prepared for their Attack; and am pretty confident I could have vindicated some parts, and excused others; and where there were any plain Miscarriages, I would most ingenuously have confess'd 'em. But I have not heard any thing said sufficient to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke an Answer. Some little snarling and bark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there has been, but I don't know one well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth'd Curr that has opened at all. That, which looks most like an Objection, does not relate in particular to this Play, but to all or most that ever have been written; and that is Soliloquy. Therefore I will answer it, not only for my own sake, but to save others the trouble, to whom it may hereafter be Objected.</p>
            <p>I grant, that for a Man to Talk to himself, appears absurd and unnatural; and indeed it is so in most Cases; but the circumstances which may attend the occasion, make great alteration. It oftentimes happens to a Man <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 words">
                  <desc>〈◊◊◊〉</desc>
               </gap> which require <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="4 words">
                  <desc>〈◊◊◊◊〉</desc>
               </gap> their Nature, cannot admit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 words">
                  <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. Such, for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, is all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>nd other less mischievous intentions may be very improper to be Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to a second Person. In such a case there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Audience must observe, whether the Person upon the Stage takes any notice of them
<pb facs="tcp:56397:4"/>
at all, or no. For if he supposes any one to be by, when he talks to himself, it is monstrous and ridiculous to the last degree. Nay, not only in this case, but in any part of a Play, if there is expressed any knowledge of an Audience, it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufferable. But otherwise when a Man in Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquy reasons with himself, and <hi>Pro's</hi> and <hi>Con's,</hi> and weighs all his Designs: We ought not to imagine that this Man either talks to us, or to himself; he is only thinking, and thinking such Matter, as were inexcusable Folly in him to speak. But because we are conceal'd Spectators of the Plot in agitation, and the Poet finds it necessary to let us know the whole Mystery of his Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance; he is willing to inform us of this Persons Thoughts, and to that end is forced to make use of the expedient of Speech, no other better way being yet invented for the Communication of Thought.</p>
            <p>Another very wrong Objection has been made by some who have not taken leisure to distinguish the Characters. The Hero of the Play as they, are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 words">

in the World, than one of the Fair Sex. They are concerned that I have represented some Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men Vicious and Affected: How can I help it? It is the Business of a Comick Poet to paint the Vices and Follies of Humane kind; and there are but two Sexes that I know, <hi>viz. Men,</hi> and <hi>Women,</hi> which have a Title to Humanity: And if I leave one half of them out, the Work will be imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. I should be very glad of an opportunity to make my Complement to those Ladies who are offended: But they can no more expect it in a Comedy, than to be Tickled by a Surgeon, when he's letting 'em Blood. They who are Virtuous or Discreet, I'm sure cannot be offended, for such Characters as these distinguish them, and make their Beauties more shining and observ'd: And they who are of the other kind, may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless pass for such, by seeming not to be displeased, or touched with the Satyr of this <hi>Comedy.</hi> Thus have they also wrongfully accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed me of doing them a prejudice, when I have in reality done them a Service.</p>
            <p>I have heard some whispering, as if they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to accuse this Play of Smuttiness and Bawdy: But I declare I took a particular care to avoid it, and if they find any in it, it is of their own making, for I did not design it to be so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood. But to avoid my saying any thing upon a Subject, which has been so admirably handled before, and for their better instruction,

I earnestly recommend to their perusal, the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle Dedicatory before the <hi>Plain-Dealer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You will pardon me, Sir, for the freedom I take of making Answers to other People, in an Epistle which ought wholly to be sacred to you: But since I intend the Play to be so too, I hope I may take the more liberty of Justifying it, where it is in the right. I hear a great many of the Fools are angry at me, and I am glad of it; for I Writ at them, not to 'em. This is a bold con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, and yet I don't think I shall disoblige one Person by it; for no Body can take it to himself, without owning the <hi>Character.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I must now, Sir, declare to the World, how kind you have been to my Endeavours; for in regard of what was well meant, you have excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed what was ill perform'd, I beg you would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the same Method in your acceptance of this Dedication. I know no other way of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a return to that <hi>Charity</hi> you shew'd, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting an Infant, but by Enrolling it in your Service, now that it is of Age and come into the World.

            <lg>
               <l>WELL then; the promis'd hour is come at last;</l>
               <l>The present Age of Wit obscures the past:</l>
               <l>Strong were our Syres; and as they Fought they Writ,</l>
               <l>Conqu'ring with force of Arms, and dint of Wit;</l>
               <l>Theirs was the Gyant Race, before the Flood;</l>
               <l>And thus, when <hi>Charles</hi> Return'd, our Empire stood.</l>
               <l>Like <hi>Janus</hi> he the stubborn Soil manur'd,</l>
               <l>With Rules of Husbandry the rankness cur'd:</l>
               <l>Tam'd us to manners, when the Stage was rude;</l>
               <l>And boistrous <hi>English</hi> Wit, with Art indu'd.</l>
               <l>Our Age was cultivated thus at length;</l>
               <l>But what we gain'd in skill we lost in strength.</l>
               <l>Our Builders were, with want of Genius, curst;</l>
               <l>The second Temple was not like the first:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:56397:7"/>Till You, the best <hi>Vitruvius,</hi> come at length;</l>
               <l>Our Beauties equal; but excel our strength.</l>
               <l>Firm <hi>Dorique</hi> Pillars found Your solid Base:</l>
               <l>The Fair <hi>Corinthian</hi> Crowns the higher Space;</l>
               <l>Thus all below is Strength, and all above is Grace.</l>
               <l>In easie Dialogue is <hi>Fletcher's</hi> Praise:</l>
               <l>He mov'd the mind, but had not power to raise.</l>
               <l>Great <hi>Johnson</hi> did by strength of Iudgment please:</l>
               <l>Yet doubling <hi>Fletcher's</hi> Force, he wants his Ease.</l>
               <l>In differing Tallents both adorn'd their Age;</l>
               <l>One for the Study, t'other for the Stage.</l>
               <l>But both to <hi>Congreve</hi> justly shall submit,</l>
               <l>One match'd in Iudgment, both o'er-match'd in Wit</l>
               <l>In Him all Beauties of this Age we see;</l>

               <l>All this in blooming Youth you have Atchiev'd;</l>
               <l>Now are your foil'd Contemporaries griev'd;</l>
               <l>So much the sweetness of your manners move,</l>
               <l>We cannot envy you because we Love.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Fabius</hi> might joy in <hi>Scipio,</hi> when he saw</l>

                     <p>True, but you shall judge whether I have not reason to be allarm'd. None besides you, and <hi>Maskwell,</hi> are acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Secret of my Aunt <hi>Touchwood's</hi> violent Passion for me. Since my first refusal of her Addresses, she has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to do me all ill Offices with my Uncle; yet has managed 'em with that subtilty, that to him they have born the face of kindness; while her Malice, like a Dark Lant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn, onely shone upon me, where it was directed. Still it gave me less perplexity to prevent the success of her displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, than to avoid the importunities of her Love; and of two evils, I thought my self favour'd in her aversion: But whether urged by her despair, and the short prospect of time she saw, to accomplish her designs; whether the hopes of her revenge, or of her Love, terminated in the view of this my Marriage with <hi>Cynthia,</hi> I know not; but this Morning she surpriz'd me in my Bed.—</p>

                     <p>What at first amaz'd me; for I look'd to have seen her in all the Transports of a slighted and revengful Woman: But when I expected Thunder from her Voice, and Lightning in her Eyes; I saw her melted into Tears, and hush'd into a Sigh. It was long before either of us spoke, Passion had ty'd her Tongue, and Amazement mine.—In short, the Consequence was thus, she omitted nothing, that the most violent Love could urge, or tender words express; which when she saw had no effect; but still I pleaded Honour and nearness of Blood to my Uncle; then came the Storm I fear'd at first: For starting from my Bed-side like a Fury, she flew to my Sword, and with much ado I prevented her doing me or her self a mischief: having disarm'd her; in a gust of Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56397:11"/>
she left me, and in a resolution, confirm'd by a Thousand Curses, not to close her Eyes, till she had seen my ruin.</p>

                     <p>O foy, don't misapprehend me, I don't say so, for I often smile at your Conceptions. But there is nothing more unbecoming a Man of Quality, than to Laugh; Jesu, 'tis such a Vulgar Expression of the Passion! every body can Laugh. Then especially to Laugh at the Jest of an Inferiour Person, or when any body else of the same Quality does not Laugh with him. Ridiculous! To be pleased with what pleases the Croud! Now when I Laugh, I always Laugh alone.</p>

Your Nephew's Scorn of you, added to my hopes; I watch'd the Occasion, and took you, just Repulsed by him, warm at once with Love and Indignation; your

                     <p>No, Marriage is rather like a Game at Bowls, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune indeed makes the match, and the Two nearest, and sometimes the Two farthest are together, but the Game de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends entirely upon Judgment.</p>

And how can you help it, if you are made a Captive; I swear it's pity it should be a fault,—but my honour—well, but your honour too—but the sin!—well but the necessity—O Lord, here's some body coming, I dare not stay. Well, you must consider of your Crime; and strive as much as can be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it,—strive besure—but don't be melancholly, don't despair,—but never think that I'll grant you any thing; O Lord, no;—but besure you lay aside all thoughts of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, for tho' I know you don't Love <hi>Cynthia,</hi> only as a blind for your Passion to me; yet it will make me jealous,—O Lord, what did I say?

Love cancels all the Bonds of Friendship, and sets Men right upon their first Foundations.</p>
                     <p>Duty to Kings, Piety to Parents, Gratitude to Benefactors, and Fidelity to Friends, are different and particular Ties: But the Name of Rival cuts 'em all asunder, and is a general acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance—Rival is equal, and Love like Death an universal Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller of Mankind. Ha! but is there not such a thing as Honesty? Yes, and whosoever has it about him, bears an Enemy in his Breast: For your honest man, as I take it, is that nice, scrupulous, conscientious Person, who will cheat no body but himself; such another Coxcomb, as your wise man, who is too hard for all the World, and will be made a Fool of by no body, but himself: Ha, ha, ha. Well for Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Honesty, give me Cunning and Hypocrisie; oh 'tis such a pleasure, to angle for fair-faced Fools! then that hungry Gudgeon Credulity, will bite at any thing—Why, let me see, I have the same Face, the same Words and Accents, when I speak what I do think; and when I speak what I do not think—the very same—and dear dissimulation is the only Art, not to be known from Nature.</p>

Then she has told me the whole History of Sir <hi>Paul</hi>'s nine years Courtship; how he has lain for whole nights together upon the Stairs, before her Chamber-door; and that the first Favour he receiv'd from her, was a piece of an old Scarlet Petticoat for a Stomacher; which, since the day of his Marriage, he has, out of a piece of Gallantry, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into a Night-Cap, and wears it still with much Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity on his anniversary Wedding-night.</p>

Did not she tell you at what a distance she keeps him. He has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd to me that but at some certain times, that is I suppose when she apprehends being with Child, he never has the privilege of using the familiarity of a Husband with his Wife. He was once given to scrambling with his hands and spraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in his Sleep; and ever since she has him swaddled up in Blankets, and his hands and feet swath'd down, and so put to bed; and there he lies with a great Beard, like a <hi>Russian</hi> Bear upon a drift of Snow. You are very great with him, I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der he never told you his Grievances, he will I warrant you.</p>

                     <p>Nay, then you have her; for a woman's bragging to a man that she has overcome Temptations, is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that they were weakly offered, and a challenge to him to engage her more irresistably.

                     <p>'Tis a mistake, for women may most properly be said to be unmask'd when they wear Vizors; for that secures them from blushing, and being out of Countenance, and next to being in the dark, or alone, they are most truly themselves in a Vizor Mask. Here they come, I'll leave you. Ply her close, and by and by clap a <hi>Billet doux</hi> into her hand: For a woman never thinks a man truly in love with her, till he has been fool enough to think of her out of her sight, and to lose so much time as to write to her.</p>

                     <p>I Heard him loud as I came by the Closet-Door, and my Lady with him, but she seem'd to moderate his Passion.</p>

                     <p>Ay, Hell thank her, as gentle breezes moderate a fire; but I shall counter-work her Spells, and ride the Witch in her own Bridle.</p>

                     <speaker>Cyn.</speaker>
                     <p>My Mind gives me it wont—because we are both so willing; we each of us strive to reach the Gole, and hinder one another in the Race; I swear it never do's well when the Parties are so agreed—for when People walk hand in hand, there's neither overtaking nor meeting: We Hunt in Couples where we both pursue the same Game, but forget one another; and 'tis because we are so near that we don't think of coming together.</p>

                     <p>Hum, 'gad I believe there's something in't;—Marriage is the Game that we Hunt, and while we think that we only have it in view, I don't see but we have it in our power.</p>

                     <speaker>Cyn.</speaker>
                     <p>Within reach; for example, give me your hand; why have you look'd through the wrong end of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective all this while; for nothing has been between us but our fears.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mell.</speaker>
                     <p>I don't know why we should not steal out of the House this moment and Marry one another, without Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration

                     <speaker>Cynth.</speaker>
                     <p>And he that can't live upon Love, deserves to die in a Ditch—Here then, I give you my promise, in spight of Duty, any temptation of Wealth, your inconstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, or my own inclination to change.—</p>

                     <speaker>Mell.</speaker>
                     <p>That's but a kind of Negative Consent.—Why, you wont baulk the Frollick?</p>

                     <p>If you had not been so assured of your own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct I would not—But 'tis but reasonable that since I consent to like a Man without the vile Consideration os Money, He should give me a very evident demonstration of his Wit: Therefore let me see you undermine my Lady <hi>Touchwood,</hi> as you boasted, and force her to give her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and then—</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mell.</speaker>
                     <p>I'll do't.</p>

                     <speaker>Mell.</speaker>
                     <p>This very next ensuing hour of Eight a Clock, is the last Minute of her Reign, unless the Devil assist her in <hi>propria persona.</hi>
                     </p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Cyn.</speaker>
                     <p>Well, if the Devil should assist her, and your Plot miscarry.—</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mell.</speaker>
                     <p>Ay, what am I to trust to then?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Cyn.</speaker>
                     <p>Why if you give me very clear demonstration that it was the Devil, I'll allow for irresistable odds. But if I find it to be only chance, or destiny, or unlucky Stars, or any thing but the very Devil, I'm inexorable: Only still I'll keep my word, and live a Maid for your sake.</p>

            <l>COuld Poets but forsee how Plays would take,</l>
            <l>Then they could tell what Epilogues to make;</l>
            <l>Whether to thank or blame their Audience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> most:</l>
            <l>But that late knowledge, does much hazard cost,</l>
            <l>Till Dice are thrown, there's nothing won, nor lest.</l>
            <l>So till the Thief has stol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>'n, he cannot know</l>
            <l>Whether he shall escape the Law, or no.</l>
            <l>But Poets run much greater hazards far,</l>
            <l>Than they who stand their Trials at the Bar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>;</l>
            <l>The Law provides a curb for 'its own Fury,</l>
            <l>And suffers Iudges to direct the Iury.</l>
            <l>But in this Court, what difference does appear!</l>
            <l>For every one's both Iudge and Iury here;</l>
            <l>Nay, and what's worse, an Executioner.</l>
            <l>All have a Right and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <l>Each chusing that, in which he has most Art.</l>
            <l>The dreadful men of Learning, all Confound,</l>
            <l>Unless the Fable's good, and Moral sound.</l>
            <l>The Vizor-Masks, that are in Pit and Gallery,</l>

            <l>The Lady Criticks, who are better Read,</l>
            <l>Enquire if Characters are nicely bred;</l>
            <l>If the soft thing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <l>They Iudge of Action too, and Time, and Place;</l>
            <l>In which, we do not doubt but they're discerning,</l>
            <l>For that's a kind of <hi>Assignation Learning.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Beaus Iudge of Dress; the Witlings Iudge of Songs;</l>

            <l>Thus poor Poets, the Favour are deny'd;</l>
            <l>Even to make exceptions, when they're Try'd.</l>
            <l>'Tis hard that they must every one admit;</l>
            <l>Methinks I see some Faces in the Pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>,</l>
            <l>Which must of Consequence be Foes to Wit.</l>
            <l>You who can Iudge, to Sentence may proceed;</l>
            <l>But tho' he cannot Write, let him be freed</l>
            <l>At least from their Contempt, who cannot Read.</l>
