            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Doubtless I may through mistake and want of ability to discern what is truth, and what is falshood, what is true learning, and what is but opiniative, painted and seeming misse the way, and shoot far from the mark; yet hath my will and affections no other end but onely to hold out what is <hi>Homogeneous</hi> to truth, and of real tendency to advance Science.</p>
            <p>Others may imagine that confidence of self-sufficiency, or hope of fame and vain glory, to be said to have attempted great things; or like <hi>Scaliger</hi> with <hi>Cardan</hi> to think to gain credit, to intermeddle with the splendor of the great name

               </gap>; or that in the vain confidence of my abilities in <hi>Oratory,</hi> I have plaid but <hi>Agrippa</hi>'s Ape, to make a <hi>declamation</hi> against the <hi>approv'd Scholastick learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> thereby to be accounted more learned: To these I plainly answer, my <hi>own breast</hi> is mine own <hi>Sanctuary</hi> &amp; let them judge what they please, for if affection to simple and naked truth had had no more influence upon my spirit than desire of fame and repute, I could have been willing to have been silent untill I had been returned into that universal silence into which all must goe; and if I be not guilty of too much dubitation with <hi>Pyrrho,</hi> I am not culpable of too much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidence with <hi>Aristotle.</hi> But I must needs confess, as I never attempted any adversary through the incouragement of his weakness, so I never fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any because of his supposed strength; those that teach in the <hi>Academies</hi> are but as others, and <hi>homo</hi> is a common name to all men.</p>
            <p>And if these men <hi>understood</hi> that I know better how to live without the most men in the World, than many in the world know how to live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out me, they would never have judged me by their own measure, nor have imagined that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fear or favour, repute or disrepute, could have drawn me to this undertaking. And my
<pb facs="tcp:51321:5"/>
unskilfulness in <hi>Oratory</hi> is so sufficiently manifest in these unelegant lines, as it cannot be of much weight to beget a belief of gaining credit by that means, whereof I am absolutely conscious I am utterly void; and if <hi>Agrippa</hi> have done well, why should I be troubled to be accounted his i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitator?</p>
            <p>Others will look upon me as an absolute <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller,</hi> and imagine that I would but have the Tree digged up by the roots, that if I get none of the main timber, yet I may have some of the tops, or at least to warm my self with the chips; And will say, that as the <hi>Presbyters</hi> rooted out the <hi>Episcopants,</hi> yet it was but to gather the Tythes into their own Barns; and as the <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents</hi> dismounted the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> yet it was but to ride in their saddle: so we that talk of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the <hi>Academies</hi> and <hi>Schools,</hi> do it but that we might divide some of the spoil, or step into the places of those that are turned out. Wel, it is an easie exposition to expound other mens aymes by their own, and to judge what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers intend to do, because we our selves have either done or intend to do the like in like cases; but facility and verity are not alwaies twins, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are not necessarily corrupt because we are so, minds as well as faces may have the same dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference. But however I must needs so far own <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling,</hi> that I hold plai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> dealing to be a jewel, and he that loves rugged, knotty and uneven paths may chuse them for me, I shall not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly follow him therein; smooth and plain waies to me seem more amiable, secure, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable.
<pb facs="tcp:51321:5"/>
For the <hi>Prelacy</hi> though it sought to bow me, yet it could not break me; though the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> pride did seem to threaten me, yet it could not hurt me, and the <hi>Independent</hi> forms could never inform me beyond the basis of a better building than man can erect: nor can the spoil of <hi>Academies</hi> ever please my mind, nor shall fill my purse. And therefore I would have such to know that I am no <hi>Dean</hi> not <hi>Master, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident</hi> nor <hi>Provost, Fellow</hi> nor <hi>Pensioner,</hi> neither have I tyths appropriate<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> nor impropriate, aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, nor State pay, nor all the levelling that hath been in these times, hath not mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nor raised me, nor can they make me fall lower, <hi>Qui cadit in terram, non habet unde cadat.</hi> And he that would raise himself by the ruins of others, or warm himself by the burning of <hi>Schools,</hi> I wish him no greater plague than his own ignorance, nor that he may ever gain more knowledge than to live to repent.</p>
            <p>Some also will inquire who, and what I am, how bred and educated, that I dare be so auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and insolent to examine and oppose that learning, which hath been received and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for so many years, as<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ented unto, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolled by so many great wits and profound judgements, and defended, and patronized by all the <hi>Academies</hi> in the Universe: and will think it fit I should give an account of my self, that the world may judge of mine abilities, lest my shoulders be found too weak to support so ponderous a burthen. To all which I might return this, <hi>Si respondere noluero, quis Coacturus
<pb facs="tcp:51321:6"/>
fit</hi>? yet shall I not be so <hi>Cynical,</hi> but plainly tell them that <hi>Hercules</hi> is easily known by his foot, and the Lion by his paw, the Treatise it self will sufficiently speak both my strength and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, my science and ignorance, and causes are best known by their effects, and the tree by its fruits, and therefore they need no cleerer rules, or means to judge by, than the things herein laid down. And if I know little (as I am most conscious that I only know this, that I know nothing at all, at least as I ought to know) let not my education be blamed, but my negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and stupidity, though I must confess I ow little to the advantages of those things called the goods of fortune, but most (next under the goodness of God) to industry: However, I am a free-born <hi>Englishman,</hi> a Citizen of the world, and a seeker of knowledge, and am wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to teach what I know, and learn what I know not, and this is sufficient satisfaction to modest inquirers.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, some may object and say, that this Treatise is but like <hi>Plato</hi>'s <hi>Republick, Sir Thomas Moor</hi>'s <hi>Vtopia,</hi> or the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi>'s new <hi>Athlantis,</hi> fraught with nothing but <hi>Heterodoxal</hi> novelties, and imaginary whimseys, which are not to be imitated, and are meerly unpractica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. To this I answer, that phantastical heads may very well be filled with such roving thoughts, and conceited crotches, yet I would have them to know that in <hi>Plato</hi>'s <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,</hi> and <hi>Sir Thomas Moor</hi>'s <hi>Vtopia,</hi> are more excellent things contained than fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb facs="tcp:51321:6"/>
and impossibilities, though the general blindness, and curse upon the Sons of <hi>Adam</hi> keep them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> seeing or practising any thing that may break the yoak or remove the burthen: and for the <hi>arcana et magnalia naturae,</hi> aimed at by <hi>Sir Francis Bacon,</hi> they might be brought to some reasonable perfection, if the waies and means that he hath prescribed, were diligently obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and persued; and if these poor lines of mine contained but any treasure comparable to any of their rich mines, I should set an higher Character of esteem upon them, than now I ought, or they any way merit. And it is true, that supposed difficulty, and impossibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, are great causes of determent from attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or trying of new discoveries, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prises, for the sloathful person usually cryeth, go not forth, there is a Lion or Bear in the way; and if <hi>Columbus</hi> had not had the spirit to have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted, against all seeming impossibilities, and discouragements, never had he gained that immortal honour, nor the <hi>Spaniards</hi> been Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of the rich <hi>Indies,</hi> for we often admire why many things are attempted which appear to us as impossible, and yet when attained, we wonder they were no sooner set upon, and tried, so though the means here prescribed may seem weak and difficult to be put into use, yet being practised may be found easy and advantagious. And I hope newness need not be a brand to any indeavor, or discovery, seeing it is but a meer relative to our intellects, for that, of which we were ignorant, being discovered to us, we call
<pb facs="tcp:51321:7"/>
new, which ought rather to mind us of our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becillity and ignoranee, than to be any stain or scandal to the thing discovered, for doubtlesly he said well that accounted <hi>Philosophy</hi> to be that, which taught us <hi>nihil admirari,</hi> and admiration is alwaies the daughter of ignorance.</p>
            <p>And if some shall allege that here is nothing mine own but what is gleaned and collected from others, and so is nothing else but a trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription, and that if every bird take her own feather, I shall be but left naked and bare. Well, suppose all this be true, and that <hi>nihil dictum quod non prius,</hi> yet is this no more blameable in me than in others, for I confess the most of the Arguments I have used have been borrowed from those learned Authors whose names I have used, or whose writings I have cited, yet are there many things also of mine own, at least the methode and manner of arguing, so that I may say with <hi>Macrobius, omne meum, nihil meum.</hi> And if the things therein contained be hinted at and taught by others, then I only am not <hi>Paradoxal</hi> but they also, and I have produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced their testimony, that the world may see how many valiant champions have stood up to maintain truth against the impetuous torrent of antiquity, authority and universality of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; and though they be not so numerous, yet are they no babes, but strong men, who fight not with the plumbeous weapons of notions, <hi>Syllogism,</hi> and putation, but with the steely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments of demonstration, observation, and experimental induction, so that I hope I shall
<pb facs="tcp:51321:7"/>
not be accused of novelty and singularity, seeing I have so many noble <hi>Heroes</hi> to bear me company.</p>
            <p>However I may be censured, I intend not to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperse the persons of any, nor to traduce nor ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniate the <hi>Academies</hi> themselves, but only the corruptions that time and negligence hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced there, but simply to attempt (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to my best understanding) some reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not eradication of their customes, and learning, which though I have (peradventure) but weakedly mannaged, yet I hope my poor mite, with the can did and ingenuous will be accepted, and for the rest I value them not, and I intreat the more able to supply what my want of strength hath left incompleat, and imperfect.</p>
            <p>Lastly, I have rather intended this as an essay to break the ice to some more able judgement, than as sufficient of it self to perform what is ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med at, because I have neither performed what I should have done, nor what I could, but only traced out some few cleer things as a guide to higher and more noble undertakings: In a word, if I have said or done any thing that may truely advance Science, I have mine end, if otherwise, blame the weakness, not the will of him, who subscribes himself,</p>

Which is sufficiently witnessed by the most Nations of note; for the <hi>Indians</hi> had their <hi>Brachman's,</hi> and <hi>Gymnosophists</hi>; the <hi>Persians</hi> their <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gusaei,</hi> or <hi>Magicians</hi>; the antient <hi>Gaules,</hi> and <hi>Britaines</hi> their <hi>Druides</hi>; the <hi>Iewes</hi> their <hi>Rabbies,</hi> both <hi>Cabalists</hi> and <hi>Talmudists</hi>; and the <hi>Graecians</hi> their <hi>Masters</hi> and <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers.</hi> The <hi>Aegyptians</hi> also had their <hi>Priests,</hi> who were men of great learning, and did but account of the <hi>Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi>

in point of knowledge as children, as one of them ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, <hi>Vos Graci semper estis pueri</hi>; and this was that great learning, which <hi>Moses</hi> being skilled in, is commended by <hi>S. Stephen,</hi>

Yet had they not (as far as I can gather) any publick salaries, but their merit was their maintenance, and their excellency in arts, and diligent industry, the only Trumpet to blow abroad their fame, and to procure them both advancement, and auscultators,</p>
               <p>I shall not need to enlarge my self to speak of their anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, or the commendable ends of their first erection, it being manifest that the chief ends, in the institution of them amongst the Heathen, were first to inable men for their undertaking in the Commonwealth; and secondly to fit them for the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, or worship of their <hi>Idols,</hi> and imaginary gods; which ends (though diversified in the object) were (in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability) the same that <hi>Christians</hi> aymed at in setting up their <hi>Schools</hi> and Universities: The first of which was good, <hi>Politick,</hi> usefull and profitable, inabling men for all kind of undertakings, both military and civil, without which men do not much differ from brute animants; the perfection of which is the greatest acquisition that men in this frail life can be partakers of, and in comparison of which all other worldly treasures are but as vapours and emptiness.</p>
               <p>But the other end, namely by these acquirements to fit
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51321:10"/>
and inable men for the Ministry, and thereby to unlock the sealed Cabinet of the counsel of God (as it hath been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly received in judgement, and used in practice) hath not onely failed of the principal end aimed at, but been quite contrary and opposite thereunto. For every thing stretched and elevated beyond its own proper sphear and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, becomes not onely vain and unprofitable, but also hurtfull and dangerous: <hi>Boni oculi, &amp; usui necessarii, sed cum sine lumine aspicere volunt,</hi>

               <p n="2">2.

And <hi>Saul</hi> before his conversion, &amp; the rest of the <hi>Iewish Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies,</hi> understood the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> tongues, and yet by them understood nothing of the saving mystery of Grace, for <hi>they stumbled at the stone of offence,</hi> and though they were Princes in humane learning and wisdome, yet did they not know God in his divine wisdome, <hi>for had they known it,</hi>

               <p n="3">3. This is built upon no surer a foundation than a tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional faith, for <hi>oportet discentem credere, every man must believe his Teacher,</hi> &amp; therfore hath no more in this but what is taught by man, who is not able to receive the things that are of God, for they are spiritually discerned. So that in this case he that understands the original tongues, in which the text was first written, conceives no more of the mind of God thereby, than he that only can read or hear read the translation in his Mothers tongue: For the reasons are every way pareil, and parallel; for what difference is there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him that relies upon his teachers skill, and he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies upon the skill of a Translator, are they not both alike, since they are but both <hi>testimonia humana,</hi> full of errors, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes and fallacies?</p>

               <p>First, the Vanity of it appeareth in this, that men and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cademies</hi>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:51321:14"/>
have undertaken to teach that which none but the Spirit of Christ is the true Doctor of,<note place="margin">Matth. 23.9. James 3.1.</note> and so contrary to the truth <hi>call men teachers and masters upon earth,</hi> when <hi>we have but one father</hi> (to teach these things) <hi>which is in heaven,</hi> and <hi>one</hi> true <hi>Master</hi> (who only can disciple us in these things) <hi>even Christ,</hi> and so ought not vainly (because of mans pretending to teach us those things in the ordinary way of humane teaching) to <hi>be called, or to call one another Rabbies;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jam. 1.13.</note> 
                  <hi>for every good gift, and every perfect gift is from above, and commeth down from the father of lights, with whom is no variablenesse, neither shadow of turning.</hi> I do not deny nor envy men the titles of being called Doctors and Masters for their knowledge in natural and civil things, and for to have a civil reverence and honour, but to have these titles given them as able, or taking upon them to teach spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual things, is vanity and pride, if not blasphemy: For I must conclude with <hi>Chrysostome,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chrysost. in Ep. ad <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. cap. 2. Hom. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Omnis ars suis terminis non contenta, stultitia est, Every art not content with it own bounds,</hi> is <hi>foolishnesse.</hi> And therefore sober and Christian-like is that conclusion of <hi>Cartesius</hi> speaking of <hi>Theology, Sed cum pro certo et explorato accepissem, iter quod ad illam ducit doctis non magis patere quam indoctis, veritatosque Ã  deo revelatas humani ingenii captum excedere, verebar ne in temeritatis crimen inciderem,</hi>

               <p>Secondly, from this putrid and muddy fountain doth arise all those hellish and dark foggs and vapours that like locusts crawling from this bottomlesse pit have overspread the face of the whole earth, filling men with pride, insolency, and self-confidence, to aver and maintain that none are fit to speak, and preach the spiritual, &amp; deep things of God, but such as are indued with this <hi>Scholastick,</hi> &amp; mans <hi>idol-made-learning,</hi> and so become fighters against God, and his truth, and persecutors of all those that speak from the principle of that wisedome,<note place="margin">Iam. 3.15.17.</note>

And if they would have considered <hi>Theologie</hi> as natural, which is such a spark of knowledge as can be had of God by the light of nature, and the contemplation of created things, which in regard of the object may be called <hi>Divine,</hi> in respect of the information, <hi>natural,</hi> and so kept it within its own bounds,<note place="margin">

               <p n="1">1. The knowledge of Tongues beareth a great noise in the world, and much of our precious time is spent in attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing some smartering and small skill in them, and so we do all <hi>servire duram servitutem</hi> before we arrive at any compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent perfection in them, and yet that doth scarcely compensate our great pains; nor when obtained, do they answer our longing, and vast expectations For there is not much profit or emolument by them, besides those two great and necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry uses, to inable to read, understand, and interpret or trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the works and writings of other men, who have written in several languages; so that in this regard they are as a key to unlock the rich cabinet of divers Authors, that there by we may gather some of their hidden treasure; and also to inable men to converse with people of other nations, and so fit men for forein negotiations, trade, and the like, which indeed are very useful and extremely beneficial to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. Yet besides what I have formerly spoken of Tongues in relation to the interpretation of the Scripture, thus much also is evident, that if a man had the perfect knowledge of many, nay all languages, that he could give unto man, beast, bird, fish, plant, mineral, or any other numerical crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or thing, their distinct and proper names in twenty se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>Idioms,</hi> or <hi>Dialects,</hi> yet knows he no more thereby, than he that can onely name them in his mother tongue, for the intellect receives no other nor further notion thereby, for the senses receive but one numerical species or <hi>Ideal</hi>-shape from every individual thing, though by institution and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, twenty, or one hundred names be given unto it, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Idiome</hi> of several nations. Now for a Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to spend seven years time about the sharpning and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of his instruments, and then had no further skill how to imploy them, were ridiculous and wearisome; so for Scholars
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:51321:20"/>
to spend divers years for some small scantling and smattering in the tongues, having for the most part got no further knowledge, but like Parrats to babble and prattle, that whereby the intellect is no way inriched, is but toylsome, and almost lost labour. Excellent and worthy was that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the renowned and learned <hi>Comenius</hi> in his <hi>Ianna linguarum</hi> (if it had been as well understood, and seconded by others) to lay down a platform and seminary of all lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and knowable things, that youth might as well in their tender years receive the impression of the knowing of matter, and things, as of words, and that with as much ease, brevity and facility.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For <hi>Grammar</hi> which hath been invented for the more certain and facile teaching, and obtaining of languages, it is very controvertible whether it perform the same in the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, easiest and shortest way or not; since hundreds speak their mother tongue and other languages very perfectly, use them readily, and understand them excellent well, and yet never knew nor were taught any <hi>Grammatical</hi> rules, nor followed the wayes of Conjugations, and Declensions, N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>un, or Verb. And it is sufficiently known, that many men by their own industry, without the method or rules of <hi>Grammar,</hi> have gotten a competent understanding in divers languages: and many unletter'd persons will by use and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cize without <hi>Grammatical</hi> rules learn to speak, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand some languages in far shorter time than any do learn them by method and rule, as is clearly manifest by those that travel, and live in divers Countries, who will learn two or three by use and exercize, while we are hard tugging to gain one by rule and method. And again, if we conceive that languages learned by use and exercize, render men ready, and expert in the understanding and speaking of them, without any aggravating or pusling the intellect and memory, when that which gotten by rule and method, when we come to use and speak it, doth exceedingly rack and excruciate the intellect and memory; which are forced at the same time, not onely to find fit words agreeable to the present matter dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed of, and to put them into a good <hi>Rhetorical</hi> order,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51321:20"/>
but must at the same instant of speaking collect all the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous rules, of number, case, gender, declension, conjugation, &amp; the like, as into one center, where so many rayes are united, and yet not confounded, which must needs be very perplex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ive &amp; gravaminous to Memorative faculty; and therfore none that attains languages by <hi>Grammatical</hi> rules do ever come to speak and understand them perfectly and readily, until they come to a perfect habit in the exercitation of them, and so thereby come both to lose and leave the use of those many and intricate rules, which have cost us so much pains to attain to them, and so to justifie the saying, that we do but <hi>discere dediscenda,</hi> learn things, which afterwards we must learn to forget, or learn otherwise: when those that get them by use and exercitation, attain them in shorter time, have a more perfect and ready way in speaking of them, and are freed from all these tedious pains and fruitlesse labour. Much to be commended therefore was the enterprise of Doctor <hi>Web,</hi> who found out a more short, certain and easie way to teach the <hi>Latine</hi> tongue in, than the tedious, painful, intricate and hard way of <hi>Grammar,</hi> and that by a brief and easie <hi>Clausulary method,</hi> in farre shorter time to attain perfection therein, and if it had been well followed and improved, would have produced an on incredible advantage to the whole nation; but we are in this like tradesmen, who all bandy and confederate together to suppresse any new invention though never so commodious to the Commonwealth, lest thereby their own privare gain should be obstructed or taken away.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If the way to attain to languages by <hi>Grammatical</hi> method and rule were the best and most certain, (which yet we have made appear not to be so) yet the rules comonly used are guilty both of confusion and perplexity. How darkly and confusedly do they go to work? leading youth on in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate laborinth, wherein he is continually toyling like an horse in a mil, and yet makes no great progress, and all because the method is perplex and obscure, void of evidential perspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity, rightly co-aptated to the tender capacities of young years, which is the cause of the other, namely its prolixity, as

and truly as the impression in the wax agrees with the seal that instamped it, and as face answers face in a glass, then there is not absolute congruency betwixt the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and the thing, the intellect and the thing understood, and so it is no longer verity, but a ly, and falsity. And therefore if <hi>Adam</hi> did not truly see into, and understand their intrinsecall natures, then had his intellect false notions of them, and so he imposed lying names upon them, and then the text would be false too, which avers that what he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them was their names. Also <hi>Adam</hi> was in a deep sleep when <hi>Eve</hi> was framed of his bone, and yet when she was brought before him being awaked, he could tell that <hi>she was bone of his bone, and flesh of his flesh,</hi> and therefore <hi>he called her woman,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 2.23.</note> 
                  <hi>because she was taken out of man.</hi> Now if it be denyed that he understood by his intrinsick and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate light, what she was, and from whence she was taken (which I hold altogether untrue) and that God by extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick information told <hi>Adam</hi> from whence she was taken, yet did he immediately give unto her an adaequate name, suiting her original, which most significantly did manifest what was her nature, and from whence it came, and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less the name being exactly conformable, and configurate to the <hi>Idaea</hi> in his mind, the very prolation, and sound of the word, contained in it the vive expression of the thing, and so in verity was nothing else but that pure language of nature, which he then spake, and understood, and afterwards so miserably lost and defaced. And if it be objected, that if <hi>Adam</hi> did understand the internal natures, vertues, effects, operations, and qualities of the creatures, then he would have known that the effect of eating of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, would have made him wretched, and discovered his nakedness, and then he would not have been so mad as to have tasted thereof: To this I answer, first, that God had plainly told him, that if he did eat thereof he should surely dy, and yet notwithstanding he did eat thereof, rather believing the <hi>Serpent</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> than the words of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty. But if it be supposed, that if he had known the operation, and effect of that fruit, he would not have cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:51321:24"/>
the word of the Serpent, more than his own evidential knowledge: To this, it is cleer, that though the Serpent denyed that the effect, or eating of it, would procure death, so likewise he cunningly affirmed and insinuated, that the eating of it would open their eyes, and that thereby they should be like Gods, knowing good and evil: and therefore it was the promise of <hi>Deifying</hi> them,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.5.6.</note> that did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame their desires, for <hi>it seemed to the woman good for food, and pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, and therefore this made her put forth her hand, and eat of the fruit, and give also unto her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and he did eat.</hi> But to answer this fully it is a deep mystery, and for man to eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, was to judge of God or his works, and creatures, by the creaturely, womanish, earthly, and Serpentine wisdome, and so to feed it self, and find both good and evil, and not to abide in the union, and to know all things in the light and image of God, and so to have seen them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding good,<note place="margin">1 Tim 2.14.</note> and to this the Apostle alludeth, saying, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression.</hi>

When I consider that the voices of birds, and beasts (though we account them inarticulate) are significative one to another, and that by the altering, and varying of those sounds, they express their passions, affections and noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as well as men, and are thereby understood of one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, I cannot but believe that this is a part of the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of nature; for the Lamb knoweth the individual bleating of the Ewe that is the Dam, from all the rest of the Ewes; and the young Chickens will all run under the Hens wings, at a certain sound of the Cocks voice, and all the Hens will run unto him at a certain call, and therefore doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less there is something more in that which <hi>Cornelius Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa</hi> relates of <hi>Apollonius Tyaneus,</hi> than every one takes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, that he understood the language of birds and beasts: And I cannot but admire how when we hear one laugh, and another howl and weep, though the sounds be not articu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, we can readily tell the one is the expression of sorrow,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:51321:25"/>
and grief, and the other of mirth and joy: now from whence do we know this? this is not acquired by us, or taught us by others, for even Children cry immediately after they be born, and though it be said to be by reason of the sensation of cold which they felt not in the womb, it is true, but then what is the cause that crying or weeping is in all creatures the sign of sorrow, pain or grief, might not some other kind of sound be the sign of it, or might it not in several creatures be expressed by different and various tones? No truly, the mind receiveth but one single and simple image of every thing, which is expressed in all by the same motions of the spirits, and doubtlessly in every creature hath radically, and naturally the same sympathy in voice, and sound, but men not understanding these immediate sounds of the soul, and the true <hi>Schematism</hi> of the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal notions impressed, and delineated in the several sounds, have instituted, and imposed others, that do not altogether concord, and agree to the innate notions, and so no care is taken for the recovery and restauration of the Catholique language in which lies hid all the rich treasury of natures ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable and excellent secrets.</p>

And indeed it is the counsel of the <hi>Arch-Sophister</hi> their Master, to speak am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bigously while they dispute, to obfuscate the light with dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, lest the truth should shine forth, nay rather to spatter and blurt out any thing that comes into the budget, rather than yield to our adversary,<note place="margin">Aristot. lib.

And whereas the best part of <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick</hi> for that purpose is <hi>Induction,</hi> which backt with long experience and sound observation, might be prevalent to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the working of mother Nature; yet that hath been alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether laid aside, while the glory of <hi>Syllogisms</hi> hath been highly predicated:<note place="margin">Verulam.

And though some may say that these things are added by his interpreters; that nevertheless argues his defect, and besides the additions are not so very compleat as might be desired. And secondly, in his book <hi>de Categoriis,</hi> definitions are usually wanting, for he defines not what a <hi>Category</hi> is, not what <hi>Substance</hi> is, nor what <hi>Quantity</hi> is: but if any reply, and say he could not define these because they are the <hi>summa genera,</hi> how could he define a <hi>Relative,</hi> or <hi>Quality,</hi> which are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise <hi>summa genera</hi>?

But I pray you, why may there not be more? For if that be a Mood, which doth modificate the propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that is to say, indicates how the praedicate is in the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, may not all Adjectives by the like right be Moods? For if this be a modal proposition, It is a necessary thing that man is a living Creature; These also are modal, It is an honest thing that man should be studious of vertue, It is a just thing that a Son should obey his Father, It is a gallant thing to die for ones Countrey; but what shall I say more of many other defects, that may be seen even of a blind man?

And first of that principal part concerning De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions as to matter and subject (for we have said somthing of it formally as to methode and tractation) which is the basis of all, wherein if there be a defect, the whole edifice falls to the ground; for whereas it determines all perfect De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions to consist of the next <hi>genus,</hi> and a Constitutive Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and since there is scarcely any other difference known, except rational, and irrational, that is specifical, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xim to the individuals, the one of which is negative, and so can positively prove nothing, and the other not only is, and may justly be controverted, but also made apparent, that Brutes have reason gradually as well as man, how lame and dilacerate this member is, needs no further demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

They take that for granted, or at least unproved, which is not onely controvertible and indemonstrable, but untrue, namely that the Earth is the Center of the Universe, and that the Heavenly Bodies do in their motions so observe it, and from thence deduce the causes of gravity and levity; the contrary or uncertainty of which appears thus. First, it is manifest that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>bs, because by their own confession, some of them, as â˜‰ and â™‚, are sometimes in their <hi>Apogaeum,</hi> and sometimes in their <hi>Perigaeum,</hi> that is sometimes neerer and sometimes further off from the earth; which they could not be if the Earth were their true and proper Center, because according to the definition of <hi>Euclide,</hi> the Circumference of a circle is every where equidistant from the Center, and all lines drawn from the Center to the Circumference are equal, otherwise it would cease to be a Circle, and one Circle can have no more than one Center; and therefore the Earth is not the Center of the Planetary Orbs. Secondly, if the Earth were the Center of the Orbs of the Planets, the dissection of the Orbs would be needless into Excentricks and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centricks<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> which being their own tenent, manifests that the earth is not their true, and proper Center.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if the Earth were their Center, the Aequinoctial line dividing both the Earth and Heavens into 2 equal parts, the <hi>Sun</hi> in his annual motion could not be longer time in the one half circle than in the other, unless he did not pass over equal intervals, or spaces of the line, in equal times, and so should intend and remit his motion, which is denyed of all: and therefore it being found by certain, and yearly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation, that he staies some daies longer on the Northside the <hi>Aequator,</hi> than on the South, it is manifest that the Earth is not the Center of his Orb.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, there are divers Planetary Bodies that move cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, that observe not the Earth as their Center at all, as

               <p>Fiftly, for the eighth <hi>Sphere,</hi> no certain rules of Art can demonstrate that the Earth is its center, because it bears no sensible magnitude unto it, so that no angle can be assigned to know the distance, and the eye cannot be a certain, and proper judge, because it judges not of distance as its proper and immediate object, but to do that is the office of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sense, and where the distance is great and vast, though the eye be far distant from the Center, yet the things seen will seem to stand in a Circle about it, though they be not truly and exactly so, and therefore this is rather a postulate than a proof, and may justly be denyed, because it cannot be proved: and that all the Stars that we call or account fixt (though we cannot prove that any of them are so) stand all in one Circle or Orb, cannot be true, for doubtless the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of their apparent magnitude is a certain argument that they are not all equidistant from the Earth, and therefore is not the Earth the Center of the Universe.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, for their arguments taken from gravity and levity, they do but therein usually <hi>petere principium, beg the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,</hi> and thereby commit a most palpable <hi>Paralogism,</hi> for they define gravity to be that <hi>quod tendit deorsum, which tends downwards,</hi> and if the cause is demanded why bodyes severed from the Earth do tend downwards thither again, they answer <hi>quia gravia sunt,</hi> which in effect is this, They tend to the Earth, because they do tend to the Earth, which is <hi>idem per idem</hi>: And if it were granted that the Earth were the Center of the Universe,<note place="margin">Gal.

the <hi>Mathematicians</hi> truly say, they must touch in infinite points, and so there could be no motion at all, because there could be no appulsion, nor retrocession, and where there is neither of those, it is impossible there should be local moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or lation; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">White Dial. de mund. fol. 84.</note>Thirdly, if the Orbs were solid, and impenetrable, then could not possibly any Comets be above the superficies of the <hi>Moons</hi> Orb, or if it be certain that they have been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served above (which is true) then of necessity the Orbs are not solid,<note place="margin">Kepler<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> de Stella martis lib.</note> but fluid bodies: neither could any new Star ever appear if they were solid, but such have been known un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly to be seen sometimes, and yet were no Comets, therefore of necessity they are fluid, and not solid bodies. And it is undeniably true, that if the Orbs were hard as Steel, and of such solidity as is alleged, then they could not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly intersect or enter into the Orbs of one another; but it is certainly known by exact observation, and <hi>Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> demonstration, that when <hi>Mars</hi> is in the lowest part of his <hi>Epicycle,</hi> or in <hi>Perigaeo,</hi> he is then within the Orb of the <hi>Sun,</hi> which he could not penetrate if it were solid, and therefore unquestionably they are not hard, but fluid bodies; and so the <hi>Scholastick Systeme</hi> is ruinous, and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, I shall urge one <hi>Optical</hi> argument, which is this, That if the Heavens were all solid, and divided into so many Orbs, and they again subdivided into others, then it must follow necessarily that according to the multitude of Superfic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:51321:33"/>
the Stars or Planets would ever be seen in their true places, but either confounded, or numerously multiplyed, which how absurd, let the abbetters of this opinion themselves judge.</p>
               <p n="4">4. From these they ground the motion of the tenth, ninth, and eighth <hi>Sphere,</hi> making the tenth <hi>Sphere</hi> move most rapidly from East to West in that space which we call 24. hours, and so snatcheth, and forceably whirleth about with it, all the inferior Orbs, which innately, and properly have a reluctancy, and contranitency against it. The absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of which appears thus.</p>
               <p>First, that the Diurnal motions of all the Orbs in 24. houres, except the tenth <hi>Sphere,</hi> are meerly violent, and compulsive, and only the motion of it natural, and proper. Now how could they conceive, who hold that <hi>nullum vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentum est perpetuvem,</hi> that a motion that is violent could be perpetual in nature, especially to these pure bodies which they hold to be eternal and immutable? or how can it be that the first <hi>Sphere</hi> should communicate its velocity to all the inferiours, and the second should communicate none at all? Why is not <hi>Iupiter</hi> carried with the motion of <hi>Saturn</hi>? or the <hi>Sun</hi> with <hi>Mars? Hoc mihi si solvas Oedipus alter eris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, if the extreme and incredible velocity of the tenth <hi>Sphere,</hi> be seriously considered, it will exceed all possibility of belief, nay even swifter than thought or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination: for of diverse Orbs moved about in the same space of time, the least moves the most slowly, and the greatest most swiftly, for if it be computed according to the least <hi>Diametre</hi> given unto it, and how it moves more swiftly than the Orb of the <hi>Moon,</hi> by so many times as it exceeds the greatness of its Circumference, it will be past all humane sense, and understanding to imagine the extreme velocity of it, so that no Creature can believe it to be so, but also be compelled to confess, that it is most likely either to be set on fire, or else by the most vehement swiftness to be whirled into <hi>Attomes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, if the eight <hi>Sphere</hi> be conceived to move, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:51321:34"/>
as they fancy to themselves that all the Stars are fixt, like so many nayls in a wheel, or bowl, considering the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensity of its compass, the exceeding velocity of its motion, and that the earth (which they suppose the Center of it) to bear proportion unto it, but as an insensible point or prick, then it could not possibly be but that it would appear all as an inflamed light, or a concave globe of fire, because at one and the self same instant the multitude of raies would all be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited in this small Center, the Earth (or eye of the beholder) and infinite rayes strike the eye successively in a manner, ere the others passed from it, and so must of necessity appear all intirely as fiery and luminous; so as we behold a piece of wood whose end is fired being quickly whirled about in the air in a circular manner, doth appear to the eye as a true Circle of fire or brightness: so that this would of necessity follow upon the structure of their <hi>Systeme.</hi> By all which ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments may evidently appear, the impossibility of the truth of that <hi>Astronomical</hi> composure which the <hi>Schools</hi> cry up for so certain, neat, and beautiful, so that I may conclude with a learned Author, <hi>Non enim quae de Arthuro et ipsius Equitibus finguntur,</hi>

But in the name of them all hear <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> who saith so elegantly, and truly, <hi>Abjice Aristotelis minutiloquam sagacitatem, abjicite mortiferos illos super anima sermones, et universe humana illa dogmata. Throw away the minutiloquious sagacity of Aristotle; throw away those mortiferous Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of his upon the soul: and universally all those human opinions of his.</hi> So that if the judgement of the Fathers be of any weight, the <hi>Philosophy</hi> of <hi>Aristotle</hi> is not much to be regarded.</p>
               <p>As for that which is alleged concerning <hi>Philip</hi> chusing <hi>Aristotle</hi> for a Tutor to his Son <hi>Alexander,</hi> it merits but a slight confutation: for admit that <hi>Philip</hi> was a very wise and prudent Prince (as no doubt but he was) yet did the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of his skill principally consist in <hi>Political,</hi> and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary prudence, and knowing Arms better than Arts, was not adaequately fit to judge of the abilities of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> except by vulgar rumour, and common fame. And it is not to be denyed that in his time the fame of <hi>Aristotle</hi> was exceedingly blown abroad; but who is ignorant of the inconstancy and levity of the popular croud in propagating,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:51321:38"/>
and spreading of rumours? But let it be granted that <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi> did excell not only all the learned men in <hi>Greece</hi> that lived in his time, but all the men of the whole world that lived in the time of <hi>Philip</hi>; yet what is this to the number and abilities of those that have lived both before and since? or how comes the Judgement of <hi>Philip</hi> to oblige us who are not under his Empire, and who could not compel the minds of men, under the tyranny of one mind? for it is easier to inslave bodies than to captivate minds. And for <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> though he had <hi>Aristotle</hi> in singular esteem, yet did he much value other learned men, as <hi>Xenocrates,</hi> whose aemu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lator <hi>Aristotle</hi> was, and also <hi>Pyrrho</hi>; so that both these received for gifts many Talents.</p>
               <p>But this is not to be denyed, that the splendor of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> name did bring much credit, and authority to <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,</hi> both living and dead: but this notwithstanding amongst the vulgar and those of vulgar wits, who as they are onely moved with external showes, so they think that a great Prince cannot but have a great Master: when for the most part Princes chuse not Tutors for Princes, either for their abilities in judging of the solidity of literature, or for the love they have to vertue, truth, or sincery, but rather for worldly or <hi>Politick</hi> ends; that their sons may be instructed, and fitted both to keep and acquire large Dominions, and Territories; and for the most part true Science scorns the bondage, flattery, and vanity of Courtly splendor.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Again, there is no reason why the <hi>Peripatetick Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy</hi> should have the palm and preheminence above all other, because there is a great uncertainty both of the books and doctrine of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> as we shall evince in some few reasons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is uncertain whether any book of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> or which owns him for author, be extant or no; for if it were not dubious to what end do his interpreters, as <hi>Simplicius, Themistius,</hi> and almost all the rest, which write in this age, prepose this question at the beginning of every book that they expound, <hi>Sitne hujusmodi liber Aristotelis an non? is this book Aristotles or not</hi>? Certainly if this thing
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:51321:39"/>
were not dubious, there were no cause for propounding this question; for we use not to scruple about things that are certain, but about things that are doubful. For it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired concerning his book <hi>de interpretatione,</hi> whether it be his or no, the later men do affirm it, but long ago <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dronicus Rhodius</hi> ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>h denyed it, whether therefore shall we give our suffrage to these modern men, or to him that is more antient? who by the verdict of <hi>Boetius,</hi> and <hi>Porphyrius,</hi> is said to have brought <hi>Aristotles</hi> writings out of <hi>Greece,</hi> and to have digested them into order; who shall loose this knot? who shall resolve this doubt?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another argument ariseth from hence; that <hi>Laertius</hi> hath drawn the order and Catalogue of <hi>Aristotles</hi> books, and yet many are wanting which he enumerates, and we have many as 12. or 14. of <hi>Metaphysicks,</hi> 8. of <hi>Physicks,</hi> 4. <hi>de Coelo,</hi> 2. <hi>de generatione,</hi> 4. <hi>of Meteors,</hi> and 3. <hi>of the Soul,</hi> which are not mentioned in his Catalogue, and therefore who need doubt but these are Supposititious? For if they had been extant in the daies of <hi>Laertius,</hi> would he have concealed them? or could he have had no suspition of them, who was so diligent to know, and commit to poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity both the lives and books of the Philosophers? And it appears that when <hi>Ptolomaus Philadelphus</hi> did erect that huge Library at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> using the help and pains of <hi>Demetrius Phalereus,</hi> who was a <hi>Peripatetick,</hi> This man, as he did promise great rewards in the Kings name to those that brought books from any where, so he hath not thought those to be neglected which were said to be <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles</hi>; And therefore <hi>Ammonius</hi> writeth, that many books were brought under the hope of gain bearing the title of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle,</hi> that notwithstanding were spurious and none of his: and therefore who can be certain in such a caliginous <hi>Labirynth,</hi> to know whether these that we have be truly his, or but false and adulterate? seeing many of them are suspected rather to belong to <hi>Architas</hi> than to <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Seeing according to <hi>Laertius,</hi> and some others, that there were many that bore the name of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> might
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:51321:39"/>
not easily all their works be ascribed to this one <hi>Stagyrite</hi>? as in other things it often falls out: for there were many <hi>Iupiters,</hi> yet all things were ascribed to one son of <hi>Saturn,</hi> and there were many called by the name of <hi>Hercules,</hi> yet all their labours made onely one son of <hi>Al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>mena</hi> famous. And did not <hi>Theophrastus</hi> and others (who are said to have imitated the stile of <hi>Aristotle</hi>) compose many books under the same title with those of his (as many be gathered from <hi>Laertius Catalogues</hi>) &amp; so might not they in continuance of time have the inscription creep in, one instead of the other? And is it not controverted whether the beginning of the <hi>Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicks,</hi> and the books of plants, and others belong to <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrastus,</hi> or to <hi>Aristotle</hi>? And doth not <hi>Cicero</hi> in his books <hi>de finibus</hi> witness that those books <hi>Moralium Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chomachiorum,</hi> which are commonly ascribed to <hi>Aristotle,</hi> are to be attributed to <hi>Nichomachus</hi> his son? And lest any should object (as they usually do) that they are written in his stile and methode, doth he not conclude, <hi>Non video, cur non potuerit patri similis est filius, I do not see why the son might not be like the Father</hi>? And are there not some books amongst those vulgarly accounted the works of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle,</hi> as the book of plants, that of the world to <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> and others, that none dare positively assert to be <hi>Aristotles</hi>? Neither is this any new thing in him, for the same suppositition of books hath happened to <hi>Plato, Cicero, Seneca, Origen, Cyprian, Hierom, Augustine,</hi> and other great men.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Let it be concluded, that we have the books which may justly and legitimately be ascribed to <hi>Aristotle,</hi> yet notwithstanding how dubious is it to know in these books what is properly and truly his, and what is not? For <hi>Strabo, Plutarch,</hi> and others, do memorate that when <hi>Theophra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus</hi> had left <hi>Neleus Scepsius</hi> heir to his own, and <hi>Aristotles</hi> Library, their books lay long hidden in the ground and that many years after, when they were corroded with worms, and moths, and almost consumed, and wasted, they were dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged up and sold to <hi>Apellicon Teius,</hi> who took care to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port them to <hi>Athens,</hi> and took upon him to amend and
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:51321:40"/>
correct the defects according to his own mind: And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
                  </gap> not long after <hi>Lucius Sylla</hi> had carried them to <hi>Rome</hi> forth of <hi>Greece,</hi> he committed them to <hi>Tyrannion</hi> the <hi>Grammarian,</hi> that he might correct and alter them; and so that he added detracted or changed what he judged <hi>Appellicon</hi> had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved, or might better agree to the mind of <hi>Aristotle.</hi> And that afterwards succeeded <hi>Andronicus Rhodius</hi> who again turned all upside down and altered as he thought fit. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore how shall we believe that the pure text of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> passing the hands of so many Correctors (that I may not more truly say Corruptors come to our hands without being viciated in innumerable places? first suffering by the injury of time, and then by the conjectures of so many Censurers. Especially if to this we shall add, the variety, oscitancy, and unskilfulness of transcribers, we shall find that in this author, which is common to almost all, that of one and the self-same place there will be vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous lections, that it will be hardly possible to divine, which are the primary and proper footsteps of the author.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But let this also be given, that there is nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in his works but what is his own, yet the style and manner of <hi>Aristotles</hi> writing doth render his doctrine so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, and obscure, that to fish out his meaning there is need of a <hi>Delian</hi> Urinator. For though he might be copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and elegant in easie matters, yet in things that are more difficult, and which require more perspicuous explication, he is so ambiguous, brief, lame, and intricate, that he seems from thence to have raised plenty of matter, and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to make his Sectators wrangle and conjecture. Therefore <hi>Atticus</hi> did worthily, and appositely compare him, and his writings, to that black humour poured forth by the Cuttle fish, under which lying hid she escapeth catching; for he seems to have spoken so on purpose, as though he be taken in some sense, yet in another he makes an escape, and so eludes the Catchers. And some of his followers do acknowledge that he hath used this kind of equivocal spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of purpose; but what need we any further witness, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold <hi>Aristotle</hi> himself openly declaring that he used this
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:51321:40"/>
affected obscurity in his <hi>Physicks,</hi> for labouring to conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late <hi>Alexander</hi> complaining that he had divulged them, he saith, <hi>Scripsisti ad me de libris Auscultatoriis, existimans in arcano custodiendos fuisse. Seito igitur ipsos editos, et non editos esse. Cognosci enim, percipique ab iis tantum poterunt, qui nos audierint. Thou hast written to me touching my books of Auscultation, thinking that they were to have been kept in secret. Therefore know that they are published, and not published. For they can onely be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, and perceived of those who have heard us.</hi> Which things being thus, we may marvail to what end they have called and accounted him as a <hi>Daemon</hi>? for verily he hath imitated the cunning of a <hi>Cacodaemon,</hi> who is said to speak by his Prophets and <hi>Sibylls</hi> after such a manner, that his words may be used in divers and contrary senses: is this the honour of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> or the glory of the <hi>Schools</hi>?</p>
               <p n="6">6. But further let it be conceded that <hi>Aristotle</hi> hath spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and written perspicuously, yet nevertheless his doctrine is left very uncertain: For he for the most part still useth a <hi>Rhapsodie,</hi> and is a great Compiler of other mens works, and that without taking time to digest or censure all things in them, so that it is difficult to discern when he produceth any thing of his own, when of another mans. And therefore who is there, who when he perceives himself to be urged and pressed with any place in <hi>Aristotle,</hi> may not oppose, and say, that it is not he that speaks there, but some of the antients under his person, and so never be without a subter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, and way for evasion? Again, it is not seldome that he doth openly declare the fallaciousness, and uncertainty of his doctrine by inserting of Adverbs of doubting, as in his book of the <hi>Categories</hi> speaking of Relatives he saith, <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tassis autem difficile sit de rebus hujusmodi vehementer asserere: Perhaps it is difficult to affirm any thing vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of such like matters.</hi> And further where he hath reckon'd up the four species of quality, he addeth, <hi>Fortassis quidem igitur alius quispiam apparuerit qualitatis modus, sed ferÃ¨ qui maxi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:51321:41"/>
that are especially spoken of.</hi> There are many such like places which I omit, these being sufficient to manifest the man to be no other but such an one as the author of the censure commonly prefixt before his works, who after many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations given him, saith, <hi>Accedebat ad haec, ingenium viri tectum et callidum, et metuens reprehensionis, quod inhibebat eum, ne proferret interdum apertÃ¨ quae sentiret. Inde tam multa per ejus opera obscura, et ambigua. There happened to these things, the closs wit of the man, and crafty, and fearing reprehension, which did inhibit him, that sometimes he durst not utter openly those things which he thought. From whence it is that so many things, throughout his works, are obscure and ambiguous.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. But let us omit these, and give it for granted that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle</hi> hath uttered his opinion plainly, and doth speak al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together <hi>Dogmatically,</hi> and without haesitation; will it not still remain of necessity that his doctrine is uncertain and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure, seeing it is beset with continual altercations amongst the <hi>Peripateticks</hi> themselves, differing about the interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his text? neither is there any possible hope of their reconciliation, but that we may sooner see a conjunction of the poles of heaven, one holding this, and another that, and yet all affirming that their meaning was <hi>Aristotles</hi> mind: for when they make the question, whether, and what kind of matter he did ascribe to the heavens, some af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that he did attribute matter to the heavens, and some deny that he did attribute any: some hold that he appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated the same matter to the heavens, that he did to the elements, and other some affirm that he gave them a divers matter. Wherefore suppose any one not preoccupated de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired to be instructed in the <hi>Peripatetick</hi> doctrine, what should he do, or whither should he turn himself, when he should see about some one difficulty propounded, divers and sundry opinions differing one from another, and <hi>Aristotle</hi> wrested against himself? would he think it possible that <hi>Aristotle</hi> at one and the self-same time, did hold things absolutely contrary one to another?</p>
               <p n="8">8. And if all this were granted that the <hi>Aristotelians</hi>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:51321:41"/>
did not disagree amongst themselves, and had a genuine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of <hi>Aristotles</hi> mind, yet would there remain much doubt and uncertainty in his doctrine: because in it there are many things omitted, and insufficient, many things <hi>Tautological</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and superfluous, many things false, impious, and calumnious, and many things repugnant, and contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, which we shall make out hereafter, and so pass them in this place.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Neither ought the throne be yielded to <hi>Aristotle</hi> alone, nor his <hi>Philosophy</hi> onely adored, and admitted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in his writings innumerable things are wanting, and defective, that are essentially necessary to the compleating of <hi>Physical knowledge,</hi> which we shall something at large demonstrate.</p>

I shall pass by the defects in his <hi>Organical</hi> learning, as having been touched before when we handled <hi>Logick,</hi> and onely come to open his defects in <hi>Physicks</hi>: And here first is required a definition of <hi>Physick,</hi> the declaration of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject matter is wanting, a general partition, and distributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is required: neither is it shewn to what end, how or in what order he will proceed to speak of the heavens, the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teors, the animants, and the like, which all belong to <hi>Physical</hi> speculation, this is all the order of this great Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thode-monger. And when he had laid it was to be proceeded <hi>ex notioribus nobis ad notiora naturÃ¢,</hi> and that even by common sense singulars are better known to us, and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salls more known in nature, yet presently after he prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterously concludes, <hi>ab universalibus ad singularia proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendum.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. What a brave definition doth he give of Nature,<note place="margin">Arist. l. 2.

                  <hi>And at the length being very anxious, the writer of natural au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scultation is ignorant what he should or ought to call nature.</hi> And also confutes some other descriptions of <hi>Aristotle</hi> with many pregnant and undeniable arguments:<note place="margin">Arist. l. 3 Phy. cap. 3.</note> and in the most of all his divisions and definitions, as may be seen in his definition of motion, and of alterarion, and divers others, which were tedious and fruitless to reckon up.</p>
               <p n="3">3. His proofs and demonstrations for the most part have the same lameness with the rest, <hi>ex uno disce omnes.</hi> He goes about to prove the world to be perfect, because it doth contain bodies, and that a bodie is perfect because it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth trinal dimension, and that trinal dimension is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, because three are all things: but three are all things, because if they be either one,<note place="margin">Arist. lib. de Coel. et Mun. ca. 1, 2, 3, 8, 9, 10. prim. lib.</note> or two, yet we have not named all things; but as soon as there are three, we may call them all things. O how egregious! O how super-sufficient is this proof! O how wonderfully beseeming so great a <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher</hi>! O how fit is he to be the Prince of Learning, and the <hi>Dictator</hi> in the <hi>Academies</hi>! And the same absurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties may be seen every where in his writings.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The like appears in his argumentations against the antient <hi>Philosophers,</hi> whom he seems every where to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute, calumniate and contradict, but with the same imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and defects, as to instance in two or three. He taxeth <hi>Democritus, Leucippus,</hi> and others very insufficiently, who did hold that generation was by congregation,<note place="margin">Arist lib 1. de Gen. et Cor. cap. 2, 9.</note> and that no continuum was compounded of indivisible things, which they speaking of <hi>Physical</hi> impartibilitie, he impugns as of <hi>Mathematical.</hi> Doth he not unworthily tax <hi>Plato,</hi> that besides matter and Idaea, he had put no efficient cause of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration? when he himself besides matter and form, rather hath put privation, which is a <hi>non ens,</hi> than any efficient cause: <hi>Quapropter cum Aristoteles nesciat naturam,</hi>

For those Sciences that we have now, are nothing else but certain concinnations of things formerly found out; not the wayes, or designations of inventing new works.</hi> And one thing more, instead of establishing the mind in Physical truths, most usually they confound the judgement with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical terms, which in <hi>Aristotles</hi> writings is no small error: for though the Mathematicks be exceedingly helpful to Natural <hi>Philosophy,</hi> yet is confusion of terms very hurtful; for if a Mathematical point or superficies be urged in a Physicall argument it will conclude nothing, but onely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuscate, and disorder the intellect.</p>
               <p n="7">7. This <hi>School Philosophy</hi> is altogether void of true, and infallible demonstration, observation, and experiment, the only certain means, and instruments to discover, and ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomize natures occult and central operations; which are found out by laborious tryals, manual operations, assiduous observations, and the like, and not by poring continually upon a few paper Idols, and unexperienced Authors: As though we could fathome the Universe by our shallow ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, or comprize the mysteries of mother nature in the narrow compass of our weak brains; or as though she would follow us into our Chambers, and there in idlenesse communicate her secrets unto us; no verily, <hi>Dii bona sua laboribus vendunt,</hi> ease and idleness are not the way to get knowledge.

Another thing of no less weight than the former I shall denote unto them, which is that part of natural <hi>Philosophy,</hi> that concerns medicine, which of all other is most necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and behooful for conserving and restoring the health of man; and yet is no less imperfect, and defective than any of the rest.</p>
               <p>For first it is turned into a way of meer formality, flattery, cunning, craft and covetousness, nothing being so much sought after by its professors as popular applause, repute, and esteem with rich and mighty men, that thereby the larger fees may be drawn from them, while in the mean time, the poor are neglected and despised. Is this the office of a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician? is only riches got by hook or crook, whether the Patient reeeive benefit or none, live or dy, the sole end of their profession? and must these things have the countenance of Law, and confirmation by Charters? must these things be applauded and cryed up, while the sincere and faithful en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors of simple and honest-meaning men, are disdained and trampled upon? But the world hath alwaies loved deceivers, and therefore must be deceived.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the rule being most sure, that <hi>ubi desinit Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophus, incipit medicus,</hi> it must of necessity follow, that if <hi>Philosophy</hi> be false, uncertain, and ill bottomed of it self, then the medicinal knowledge that is built thereon<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and drawn from thence, must needs be faulty and ruinous. Now how false the <hi>Aristotelian Philosophy</hi> is in it self is in part made cleer, and more is to be said of it hereafter, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore truth and experience will declare the imperfection of that medicinal knowledge that stands upon no better a basis. For <hi>Galen</hi> their great <hi>Coryphaeus</hi> and <hi>Antesignanus</hi> hath laid down no other principles to build medicinal skill upon, than the doctrine of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> as that all bodies mixt are compounded of the four Elements, and that the total pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity or disparity, temperament, complexion, and constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all bodies do arise from the equal or unequal conflux and commixture of these four: and that from these do result four prime qualities, and four humours, and that the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding, defect, repugnancy, or alteration of he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>For this same author makes it good by undeniable argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and experiments, that there are not four Elements, nor humours, in <hi>rerum natura,</hi> and hath said enough, suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently to confute and overthrow the whole Fabrick of the <hi>Galenical</hi> learning, which here I forbear to insert. And therefore it is very strange that the Schools, nay in a manner the whole world, should be inchanted and infatuated to admire, and own this ignorant <hi>Pagan,</hi> who being ambitious of erecting his own fame, did traduce, and darken the writings of those that preceded him, and preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to interpret and open the doctrine of learned <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> he altogether obscured and perverted the same: And yet can the Schools be so wilfully mad to adore this Idol<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and follow this blind guide.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if the ground of <hi>Galenical Physick</hi> had been sound and firm, and that it were the true and certain way both to find out the causes, and to cure diseases, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding hath it been but loosly prosecuted, and smally promoted, seeing for the space of so many hundred years, there is not by the Schools found out any more certain, safe, or easie way to cure diseases than was in the daies of <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi>: It is very strange that it should grow up and flourish with them, and never since come to any more perfection, when it is usually observed that nothing is <hi>simnl &amp; semel</hi> invented and perfected. For it is plain that in <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanical</hi> knowledge nothing of value is found out or discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed since the daies of <hi>Dioscorides</hi>; for though some plants be now found out that were not then known, and many species of others also, and their cuts and figures more perfected, as beside much confusedly heaped up concerning their qualities of heat and cold, driness and moisture; yet is nothing more

added by real experience, and diligent observation of their specifick vertues, and intrinsick properties, so that in regard of the vegetable Kingdom the art of medicine hath got little advance.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, though medicinal knowledge have received some melioration especially in the <hi>Anatomical</hi> part, wherein men have laboured with much acuteness, diligence, and observation, so that this part seems to be growing, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rising towards the <hi>Zenith</hi> of perfection, especially since our never-sufficiently honoured Countryman Doctor <hi>Harvey</hi> discovered that wonderful secret of the bloods circulary mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: yet for all this there comes small advantage by it in practice, and application, for the more certain, safe, and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie curing of diseases: for though it bring great satisfaction to a speculative understanding, and help to cleer many intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate doubts, yet doth it little to remove dolor, danger, or death.</p>
               <p>And moreover though it be grown to a mighty height of exactness, in vulgar <hi>Anatomy</hi> and dissection of the dead bodies of men, or the living ones of beasts, birds, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes; yet is it defective as to that vive and <hi>Mystical Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy</hi> that discovers the true <hi>Schematism</hi> or signature of that invisible <hi>Archeus</hi> or <hi>spiritus mechanicus,</hi> that is the true opifex, and dispositor of all the salutary, and morbifick li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neaments, both in the seminal <hi>guttula,</hi> the tender <hi>Embrio,</hi> and the formed Creature,<note place="margin">Rob. de Fluct. lib de Anato. mia mystica.</note> of which <hi>Paracelsus, Helmont,</hi> and our learned Countryman Dr. <hi>Pludd,</hi> have written most excellently.</p>

And this so necessary a knowledge both in the genus and species of it is altogether omitted by the School; they understand and teach nothing of Caelestial signatures, which are in some measure made known by the quantity, light, colour, motion, and other affections of those bodies: They teach nothing of <hi>Sub-caelestial Physiognomy,</hi> whether Elementary, <hi>Meteorolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical,</hi> or <hi>Mineralogical,</hi> but are utterly ignorant in all these, as also in <hi>Botanical,</hi> and <hi>Anthropological Physiognomy,</hi> contenting themselves with a few frivilous, false and formal definitions, and notions, and so never seek to penetrate into the more interiour nature of things, by which it comes to pass that they know little in the vegetable, and animal king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, and least of all in the subterranean, or mineral; and but that <hi>Paracelsus, Crollius, Quercetan, Baptista Porta,</hi> and some others had taken pains in it, there had no foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps of it almost been visible.<note place="margin">Arist. lib. de Som. et vig. cap. 3.</note> And my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> doth reckon also as defective the interpretation of natural dreams; for though <hi>Aristotle</hi> himself hath said something of this, yet those that pretend most to admire and honour him, have taken as little pains in this as the rest, to improve it to the glory of their great Master.</p>

               <p n="4">4. The <hi>Philosophy</hi> of <hi>Aristotle</hi> maintained by the <hi>Schools</hi> ought not to be prised so much above others, because in it there are many things superflu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>For first, omitting many superabundant reiterations, and repetitions in his <hi>Organicks</hi> and <hi>Animasticks,</hi> I shall only touch some few contained in his <hi>Physicks</hi>: as in that much celebrated definition wherein nature is said to be <hi>Principium, &amp; causa motus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Arist. lib. 2. Phys. cap. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>&amp; quietis ejus, in quo inest primÃ², &amp; per se, &amp; non secundÃ¹m accidens.</hi> 1. This particle <hi>causa</hi> seems to be put superfluously; seeing every cause is a principle. 2. That of <hi>quietis</hi>; seeing the faculty of Contraries are the same, for that which is the faculty of speaking, and holding
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:51321:48"/>
ones peace, is the same. 3. That <hi>ejus, in quo est,</hi> seeing also art is the principle of the motion of the artificer, in whom it is. 4. That <hi>primÃ².</hi> 5. And that <hi>per se</hi>; for also art is the cause of artificial motion, primarily, and by it self, <hi>qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenus</hi> as far as it is of this sort. 6. That particle, <hi>&amp; non secundÃ¹m accidens,</hi> is needless; for wherefore was that necessary seeing before he had put <hi>per se</hi>? I shall omit the rest of his nauseous <hi>Tautologies</hi> in the 3, 5, and 7. chapters of the forcited book, and in the most of the books of <hi>Physicks</hi> following, as obvious to every one that will take pains to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine and consider them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in his book <hi>de Coelo</hi> he reiterates this, <hi>Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicis corporis simplex est motus, &amp; simplex est motus simplicis corporis,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Arist. l. 1. de Coel. et Mun. cap. 2.</note> as though these two were much different: and there twice or thrice is repeated the probation, that Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar motion doth agree to some body according to nature. The like to which may be seen in the 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 12. chapters of the same book, and in all the books following of the same subject. I shall onely name one other, and so pass this point, <hi>in lib.</hi> 1. <hi>De or<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>u, et interitu, cap.</hi> 6. He propounds the question of the Elements, whether they be, or they be not? and whether they be sempiternal, or not? As though they had not been agitated in his third <hi>book de Coelo,</hi> and at last brings in that vain repetition, <hi>est igitur tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gens ut plurimÃ¹m id, quod tangit tangens: apparet tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gens tangere quod tangit, necesse videtur esse quod tangitur tangere,</hi> &amp;c. O how egregiously is this disputed of him who must needs be accounted the <hi>Prince of Philosophers</hi>! O how excellent needs must those disciples be that are taught by so worthy a Master!</p>
               <p n="5">5. This <hi>Philosophy</hi> ought not so much to be magnified above other, because in it are very many things that are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently, and absolutely false, to make which appear, I shall onely name two or three manifest particulars.</p>
               <p>First he affirms that nothing is contrary to substance, which he again asserts in his <hi>Logick,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Arist. lib. 1. Phys. cap. 6.</note> and repeats elsewhere, which to me seems absolutely false: for certainly the substance of the fire is contrary to the substance of the water. But thou
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:51321:49"/>
wilt say the contrariety is solely in the qualities. But see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these qualities are every one proper to their substances, and do arise out of them, and accept their <hi>esse</hi> from them: and therefore doth not this also argue contrariety in them? For let the substance be of the same nature on both sides; from whence is it that these qualities do arise rather than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which are contrary unto them? And again in the same chapter it is false that he teacheth that contraries can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not suffer of themselves: For do not cold things strive with hot, and moist things with dry? And do not these qualities mutually beat back, and expel one another.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is false which he affirms <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Phys. cap.</hi> 7. That the formal, final, and efficient causes are coincident, to wit in respect of the same effect: for how can the father be the same with the essential form of the Son? And it is also false which he defends in the eighth chapter, That art doth not deliberate; otherwise artists do all things rashly. But although the Mason do not deliberate, whether he ought to prepare a foundation rather than an house, Therefore doth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>e not consult, whether he shall build it now rather than at another time? or whether of this matter, rather than of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? or whether in this manner, rather than in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, how false is that which he laies down in the 6, and 7. chapters of the third book of <hi>Physicks,</hi> that no num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber can be given, than which a greater may not be exco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitated: but that a magnitude may be given, to wit the world, than which no greater can be excogitated? I pray you why may it not be lawful and possible to conceive a magnitude greater than this world? nay ten thousand times greater, wherein lies the impossibilitie? He also defines there <hi>infinitum</hi> to be that beyond which something alwaies may be taken; but how is that possible to be infinite that hath something <hi>extrase</hi>? or that it can be made infinite by some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without it self? These are brave sancies, and fine dreams.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, in the 8. book, besides innumerable falsityes that may be observed in the 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. chapters, that
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:51321:49"/>
is a most signal one, which in the first chapter he labours to build up, of the eternity of motion: that thereby he may make out the ingeniture, and eternity of the world. Let us therefore see with what reasons he can evince, and perswade it. 1. Is this, Motion is the act of a movable thing: Therefore that which is movable hath preceded Motion. I pray you doth he not wound himself with his own weapon, and strangle himself by his own consequence? For if any thing hath preceded Motion: Therefore motion is not eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. 2. He argues, The thing moving, and the thing mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved are either made, or are eternal; But neither can be said to be so. But wherefore cannot the one or both be eternal, and nevertheless without motion? He adds, because this is absurd. An egregious instance truly, and indeed <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical</hi>! for where appears this absurdity? He further urges: If the thing movable had preceded motion, then it had rested: and so another motion had been necessary before, of which that rest had been a privation. Verily as though he who is born blind, ought to have seen in the womb, that blindless might be accounted the privation thereof. 3. He proceeds, Power ought to be neer to the Act. As though stones that have lain hid from the framing of the world under the earth, had not as well power to be framed into an house which is made to day, as they have a few daies before they be digged up. 4. He saith, Time is eternal, therefore Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion also: He confirms the <hi>Antecedent,</hi> 1. Because all <hi>Philosophers,</hi> except <hi>Plato,</hi> do affirm it. As though the matter were pleaded in the Court, where voices are numbred? yet some have accounted <hi>Plato</hi>'s judgement more than a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand; but this were to try things by authority, not by truth. 2. Because time is not <hi>sine nunc</hi>: but every <hi>nunc</hi> is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the sequent, and the end of the praecedent time. As though there could not be a <hi>nunc</hi> first, and last; if either the motion of heaven hath begun, or also if we believe that motion is not measured by time, which were not hard to demonstrate.</p>
               <p n="5">5. I shall onely instance in one place more, and that is <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Coelo cap.</hi> 3, <hi>cap.</hi> 4. There he assumes, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours

to prove, that Circulary motion hath nothing contrary un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o it: what if of two wheels or orbs, the one were moved towards the Orient, and the other towards the Occident, were they not to be said to be moved towards contrary parts? and is not this to have something contrary unto it? nay may not the motion of something in a straight line, be contrary to motion that is circular, seeing all motion is considered in relation unto the term, or point from whence, and unto which it moves? and how this cannot be possible, to me seems neither probable nor possible. And though I have but taken these few things to instance in, yet were it no hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (but that it belongs not to my present purpose) to evert the whole ground and fabrick of his <hi>Philosophy,</hi> and that with arguments unanswerable, and infallible, but these are suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for this place and purpose.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Aristotle's ipse dixit,</hi> or the <hi>School's sic habet A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristoteles,</hi> ought no longer to pass for oracles, nor his tenents for truths before others: because innumerable things in his <hi>Philosophy</hi> do contradict, and are <hi>diametrically</hi> contrary; and that I may make out what I say, I shall call in for witness his own words, and instance in some few particular places, that it may be manifest how in constant and wave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring he was in his own opinions.</p>
               <p>First, in his book of <hi>Categories</hi> there is plain contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, seeing he makes ten: and notwithstanding elsewhere sometimes three, sometimes six, sometimes eight. He saith the first substance is rather substance than the second, and not long after he affirmeth that the property of substance is to receive more and less. He makes Time a species of Continued quantity: and notwithstanding in the 4 book of <hi>Physicks,</hi> he will have it to be Number, which is Discrete quantity. He also indeavours in the 1 <hi>book Priorum Analyticorum,</hi> to demonstrate the definition of the figures, and in the 2 af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter teacheth that definition cannot be demonstrated. In the 1 <hi>book Posteriorum</hi> he will have us in Demonstration to proceed from things more known to us: and for all that he defines demonstration to be that which proceeds from Causes, but causes are more unknown to us than effects; and in the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:51321:50"/>
same books he hath many such like, which for brevity I omit.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in his first book of <hi>Physicks</hi> he impugneth that immovable principle of <hi>Parmenides,</hi> and <hi>Melissus</hi>: and after in the 8 book he proveth that there is one immovable principle of motion. He teacheth in the fifth chapter, that Contraries are not made, by course, of themselves, and not long after he holdeth, that whatsoever is generated, is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated of its contrary, and that whatsoever is corrupted goes into its contrary. In the second book, and seventh chapter, he disputeth against <hi>Empedocles</hi> affirming that the works of nature are made by chance; And yet confesses that Monsters are the misses and lapses of nature: And in the seventh book of <hi>Metaphysicks</hi> the seventh chapter, he holdeth that those things that do grow withou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In the seventh chapter in the words cited not long before he altogether supposeth the heaven not to be animated: and notwithstanding he expressely saith it is animated in the second book, and second chapter; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the first <hi>de anima</hi> the third chapter, and elsewhere. In the second book, and second chapter, he holdeth that a sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piternal motion is in God: and in the eighth of the <hi>Physicks</hi> he maintaineth the <hi>primum movens</hi> to be immovable which is God: In the eight he saith the heaven is not an Organical body, and notwithstanding (as it is already seen) he hath made it to be indued with a Soul: For the soul, as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines it, is the act of an organical body: as also in the twelf he saith, <hi>Actionem astrorum talem esse, qualis est plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarum, &amp; animalium.</hi>

               <p>THough there be something in the most of these, that might tollerably pass, yet are many things in them so useless, false, uncertain, superfluous, wicked and defective, that they stand in need of reformation, melioration, or era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication, as we shall shew of every one of them in their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the <hi>Metaphysicks,</hi> which they call their <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia prima,</hi> and do usually define it to be <hi>Scientia entis, quatenus ens est,</hi> the abuse and vanity of it appears in this. That it being nothing else but an abstract consideration of things by way of prescision, or cutting off from all other co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitant cogitations, and so to weigh and examine the things nudely and barely under the respect of their being, all other notions there about being separate from it, doth bring no better instruments, nor effective means for the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of truth, than the weak and bare operation of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect, or indeed of Phantasie, or the Imaginative faculty, and therefore no marvail that it hath spider-like weaved forth so many slie and cunning Cobweb-contextures of slender conceits, and curious niceties, fit for nothing but to insnare and intangle: and hath been so luxuriously petulant in the faetiferous production of so many monstrous, fruitless, and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:51321:51"/>
vain Chimaeras. For they holding the soul to be <hi>tabula ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa,</hi> in which nothing is insculpt, and that Science comes not by <hi>reminiscence,</hi> or <hi>resuscitation,</hi> but meerly acquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively <hi>de novo,</hi> and that there is nothing in the Intellect that hath not first some way or other been in the Senses, then must it needs follow that the operations of the Intellect are but weak means to produce <hi>Scientifical</hi> certitude, and so <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphysical</hi> learning but barren and fruitless.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It hath neither laid down, nor assumed any certain principles, that are necessary or helpful to promote Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; for whereas it obtends this for a maxim, That not any thing can be, and not be at the same instant of time; what fruitful products was there ever yet drawn from this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable fundamental? neither ever hath it proceeded so far as to find a sure, and ultimate resting place, which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the learned <hi>Renatus des Chartes</hi> hath happily performed,<note place="margin">Renat. des Cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

It is of no use nor advantage to other Sciences, nor ever hath brought any good or profit unto the sons of men, but onely seduced them into strange labyrinths of notional Chymaeras, and speculations, like idle and vain dreams, filling and feeding the fansie, but yielding nothing of soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity to inrich the Intellect, nor any thing of use or profit to accomodate mankind: except that may be accounted an advantage, to obscure the truth, and lead the phantasies of men into the crooked <hi>Meanders</hi> of conceit, and nutation, and so with the assistance of its Twin <hi>Logick</hi> (both sisters of the same mother <hi>Nox</hi>) bring men to imagine and argue much, but in truth and verity to know little.</p>

things for the eradicating of vice, the planting of vertue, and the establishing of mental tranquillity, and moral felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which <hi>Aristotle</hi> and all his <hi>Sectators</hi> never either under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, or had fruition of.<note place="margin">Arist.

               <p>Now for the <hi>Political</hi> and <hi>Oeconomical</hi> learning taught by the Schools out of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> as it hath many things of singular use, and commoditie in it, so is it not without its chaff, and tares, deserving rather purging, and refining, than the estimation of being compleat and perfect: For as there are many things in it frivolous, obscure, immethodical, superfluous, and false, so also is it very defective, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect; for if we look upon what <hi>Plato</hi> hath written <hi>de le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibus,</hi> and <hi>de Republica,</hi> though there may be found ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things unpracticable, and incompleat, yet compared with the other, it is no way inferiour, but deserves as great, if not an higher commendation; and so the writings of <hi>Bodin,</hi> nay <hi>Macchiavel</hi> and divers other modern authors may duly challenge as much praise in this point, as that of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> which the <hi>Schools</hi> do so much adhere to and magnifie, yea even our own Countreyman master <hi>Hobbs</hi> hath pieces of more exquisiteness, and profundity in that subject, than ever the <hi>Graecian</hi> with was able to reach unto, or attain; so that there is no reason why he should be so applauded, and universally received, while more able pieces are rejected, and past by.</p>
               <p>Lastly, for <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> or <hi>Oratory, Poesie,</hi> and the like, which serve for adornation, and are as it were the outward dress, and attire of more solid sciences; first they might tollerably pass, if there were not too much affectation

towards them, and too much pretious time spent about them, while more excellent and necessary learning lies neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected and passed by: For we do in these ornamental arts, as people usually do in the world, who take more care often time about the goods of fortune, than about the good of the body, and more nice and precise sollicitousness about fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and garbs, than either about the body it self or the goods of the mind,<note place="margin">Verul. de Au.

And therefore it was not without just cause that <hi>Plato</hi> (though by some censured for it) did reckon <hi>Rhetorick</hi> amongst the voluptuary arts, for we most commonly use it either for the priding and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of our selves that we may appear eloquent, and learned to others, or else use it cunningly and sophistically to capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, and draw over the judgements of others to serve our ends and interests: and thereby make false things appear true, old things new, crooked things straight, and commodious things unprofitable, as <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>Imperitior mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, quod ornatÃ¨ dicitur, etiam verÃ¨ dici arbitratur, The more unskilful multitude thinketh that what is spoken elegantly,</hi>

               <p>HAving hitherto spoken of the subjective learning that the <hi>Schools</hi> handle, it follows in order to examine their customes and methode, not that I mean to meddle either with their manners, or maintenance, but leave that to the judgement of others, lest it happen to me, as <hi>Erasmus</hi> said of <hi>Luther,</hi> that it was dangerous to meddle with the <hi>Popes</hi> Crown, and Monks bellies: but only to note some
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:51321:54"/>
things in the way, and methode of their teaching, which are obvious to my weak observation, and so shall lay them down as they present themselves to my low apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Though in one <hi>Academy</hi> there be usually divers <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges,</hi> or houses, yet must all the Scholars in those several places be tyed to one methode, and carried on in one way, nay even bound to the same authors and hardly allowed so much liberty, and difference, as is between <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and <hi>Ramus Logick</hi>: As though they in the way of their teaching had arrived at the highest point of perfection, which could no way be improved, or no other as profitable could be discovered and found out, and so are all forced like carriers horses, to follow one another in the accustomed path, though it be never so uneven or impassable.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Their <hi>Scholastick</hi> exercises are but slenderly, negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, and sloathfully performed, their publike acts (as they call them though but verbal digladiations) being but kept four times in the year, that is in the terms, which if one should tell them in plain terms, are but usually idle termes: as though time of all other things here below, were not to be accounted most pretious, and that there can be no such detriment done unto youth, as to lose or mispend it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Their Custome is injurious, and prejudicial to all those that desire to make a speedy progress in learning, nay unequal, and disproportionable in it self, namely to ty men to a set time of years, or acts, before they can receive their <hi>Laureation,</hi> or take their degrees: as though all were of one capacity or industry, or all equally able at their matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, and so the sloathful, and painful, the most capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and most blockish, should both in the same equal time have an equal honour, which is both disproportionable and unjust. For some will attain to more in one year than some in three, and therefore why should they not be respected ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their merits and proficiency, and not bound to draw in an unequal yoak? and what matter were it whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a man had been there one moneth or seven years, so he had the qualification required, and did <hi>subire examen,</hi>

and perform the duties of the place, surely it is known that <hi>gradus non confert scientiam, nec cucullus facit mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chum.</hi>

               <p n="5">5. What is there in all their exercises, but meer notions, and quarrelsome disputations, accustoming themselves to no better helps for searching into natures abstruse secrets than the <hi>Chymaeras</hi> of their own brains, and converse with a few paper Idols? as though these alone were sufficient keyes to open the Cabinet of Natures rich <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And in the mean time, the way to attain knowledge is made more difficult, and the time more tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and so we almost become strangers to our own mother tongue, loving and liking forein languages, as we do their fashions, better than our own, so that while we improve theirs, our own lies altogether uncultivated, which doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less would yield as plentiful an harvest as others, if we did as much labour to advance it: <hi>Neque hodiÃ¨ ferÃ¨ ulla est natio, quae de idiomatis sui praestantia non glorietur, aut contendat.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. IX. Of some expedients, or remedies in Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, Grammar, Logick, and Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</head>
               <p>I Know it will be objected, that <hi>facile est reprehendere, it is an easie thing to find fault,</hi> but difficult and arduous to repair and amend, and that one fool may mar, and spoil that in an hour, which many wise men cannot make right again in many ages: and the most ignorant may easily disorder, and deface the master-piece of the most curious ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:51321:57"/>
when he is not able to repair the least part of it. And therefore that it is not sufficient to demolish an antient, and goodly Fabrick, upon pretence that it is either unprofitable in the site, and figure, or that the materials are ruinous, and decayed; unless we bring better in their room, have laid a better platform, and know certainly how to erect a better Fabrick.</p>
               <p>To which I answer, by a cleer confession, that before we throw down we should know wherewithal, and how to build, and that it is far more easie to demolish, than to erect a sufficient and compleat Structure, and especially for a single person (and he also of the lowest, and least abilities) which is &amp; ought to be the work of many, nay all persons and ages: for as I verily believe that what I have produced for demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strating the groundlesness, ruinousness, and ill composure of the <hi>Scholastick</hi> Fabrick of learning is not far from the truth, so also am I confident of mine insufficiency to erect a better in the place thereof, yet <hi>in magnis voluisse sat est,</hi> I shall do mine endeavour, hoping that those that are more able will put to their hands to help to supply my defects, and so shall offer the best materials and art that I have to erect a new, and better building, and in the same order that I have handled the several parts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Therefore for <hi>Theology</hi> which is a speaking of God, or a speaking forth the things of God, it is expedient that men should lay aside the suffering of themselves to be styled by that blasphemous t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>le of <hi>Divines,</hi> which is such an impropriety of language as all their learning will never be able to justify, it being an attribute that doth onely predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate essentially of the being of God, and is indeed incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable to the Creature, who hath nothing that is divine or spiritual but by participation; for though the text saith that <hi>Saints</hi> are partakers of the divine nature, yet will it not follow that because they are said to be partakers of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine things that therefore they are divine, because partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations do not truly predicate of those essences to which they are communicated, but of that being from whence they flow: for men participate of the light and heat of the Sun,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:51321:57"/>
but it cannot be truly predicated of men that either they are the Sun, nor truly and univocally that they are of a <hi>Solary</hi> nature, but onely that participating of its influences and operations, they may be truly said to be heatned, and inlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: for though it be in the <hi>English</hi> translated <hi>Iohn the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,</hi> whereby those that understand not the <hi>Greek</hi> are mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and thereby drawn to give that title to their <hi>Priests,</hi> who blasphemously assume it to themselves, yet I hope there is much difference betwixt <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                  </gap>, one that speaks of God or divine things, and one that is divine, the <hi>Scots</hi> therefore have a more apposite and warrantable <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thite,</hi> who seldome or never call their Ministers <hi>Divines</hi> but <hi>Theologues,</hi> and we have many could cry out against the <hi>Bishops</hi> for having the title of Lord, or Grace given them, and yet they themselves can swallow this title of being <hi>Divines,</hi> which is more unseemly, unfit, and unwarran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another expedient that I shall offer in this case is, That the Scriptures which are as the seamless Coat of Christ may not be rent and torn with the carnal instruments of mans wit and reason, nor modell'd, or methodiz'd as an humane art or science, but laid aside in <hi>Scholastick</hi> exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises, as a sacred and sealed book,<note place="margin">Lev. 10.1, 2.</note> lest they offering strange fire upon Gods altar, perish as others have done: for in the day of mans light the Tabernacle of the Lord will be covered with a cloud, and in the night of his darkness there will be fire;<note place="margin">Exod. 40.36, 37, 38.</note> therefore let not men journey until the cloud be taken up, or the fire appear, otherwise they must know the Lord doth not lead them nor go before them. And indeed, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever the proud and deceitful heart of man may imagine, the Scriptures are a sealed book,<note place="margin">Isa. 29.11, 12.</note> for so the prophet saith, <hi>The vision of all is become as the words of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one that is learned, saying, Read this I pray thee: and he saith, I cannot, for it is sealed. And the book is delivered to him that is not learned, saying, Read this I pray thee, and he saith, I am not learned.</hi> What can be more plain than this, that it is as a sealed book both to the learned, and unlearned? and this is it that is sealed
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:51321:58"/>
with seven seals,<note place="margin">Rev. 5.1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</note> and no man in heaven, nor earth, nor in the Sea, that is found worthy to open this book, and to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>close the seaven seals thereof, but only the strong Lion of the Tribe of <hi>Iuda,</hi> and therefore let <hi>Schools</hi> not touch it, lest it be their destruction. For unless they leave the Lords own work to himself, and cease to sit in the seat of the scornful, <hi>The Lord will laugh them to scorn,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psalm 1.7.</note> 
                  <hi>and vex them in his sore displeasure,</hi> neither will he bless them in their labours, nor prosper them in their exercises: Nay, until all the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, and Elderships of the earth that profess his name, take off their Crowns, and lay them at the feet of the Lamb, and learn to practise, and put in execution our Saviors coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, <hi>To give unto God the things that are Gods, and to Caesar the things that are Caesars,</hi> and not at all to intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with the things of God, misery and destruction will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them to the grave, and of them shall be required the blood of all the Saints. O therefore that they would <hi>Kisse the Sonne lest he be angry,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 2.12.</note> 
                  <hi>and so they perish from the way of everlasting truth: for when his wrath is kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled but a little, blessed are all they that put their trust in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The last expedient I shall present in this subject is, That what can be discovered of God, and supernatural things, by the power of Reason, and the light of Nature, may be handled as a part of natural <hi>Philosophy</hi> (unto which it doth belong) because it is found out by the same means and instruments that other natural Sciences are: and what may from thence cleerly be demonstrated, and deducted, may be holden forth as a means to overthrow <hi>Atheism, Gentilism,</hi> and the like, but not to statuminate, or build up any thing in religion, nor like a wild bore to enter into the Lords vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard to root up and destroy it.</p>
               <p>In the next place are languages, and <hi>Grammar,</hi> which is the means or instrument by which they are taught, unto which I shall offer these few helps.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That care may be had of improving, and advancing our own language, and that arts and sciences may be taught in it, that thereby a more easie and short way may be
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:51321:58"/>
had to the attaining of all sorts of knowledge: and that thereby after the example of the <hi>Romans</hi> we may labour to propagate it amongst other nations, that they may rather be induced to learn ours, than we theirs, which would be of vast advantage to the Commonwealth, in forrein Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Trading, Conquest and Acquisitions, and also of much domestick advantage within our own territories. For if we should arrive at any extraordinary height of learning, and knowledge, though we should but speak and write in our own mother tongue, then would other nations be as earnest in learning it, and translating our books, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ages have been in labouring to attain the language, and translate the books of the <hi>Graecians,</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> and we at this day of the <hi>French,</hi> and <hi>Germans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That some compendious way for both teaching and learning forein languages, may be established by use and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise, without the tedious way of rule, or <hi>Grammar,</hi> which doubtless upon diligent, skilful, and exact tryal, would prove more short, easie, certain, and beneficial, as is manifest by ordinary people that never knew any thing of <hi>Grammatical</hi> order, being kept in families that speak another language, and having none to converse with that speaks their own, will in a wonderful short time learn to speak, and understand it; for when necessity is joined with industry, it produceth great and stupendious effects.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That in the way of teaching languages the order pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed by <hi>Comenius</hi> in his <hi>Ianua linguarum</hi> may be practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and means used to improve it, that both words and matter, names and things, may be learned together, which may be done both with the same facility, and in the same shortness of time; that so the tender intellects of young children may not onely inbibe the names, but also the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and qualities of things.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That in the methode of teaching <hi>Grammar,</hi> master <hi>Brinsleys</hi> way laid down in his <hi>Grammar School</hi> may be put into practice, that children may be taught in their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tongue to know perfectly the several parts of Speech, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:51321:59"/>
and indeclinable, and punctually to vary the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable parts, especially Noun, and Verb, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strue and parse in their own tougue, that so they may be ready to make use, and to apply it when they learn the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi> or any other language, without which they shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have any sure foundation, nor proceed in any way of ease and certainty, nor arrive at any height of perfection, for none learns more than what the intellect clearly compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ends, and what it knows how to practise, and make use of.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In the <hi>Grammatical</hi> way of teaching it is a most certain axiom, that what is one part of speech in one lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, is so in all, and four parts being indeclineable, it is manifest that they are learned by no rules, but only by use and exercise, as the memory can congest and record them: so that there remains but other four to be obtained by rule, and two of them, which is Pronoun and Participle, either are but very few, as the Pronoun, and so are easily known wherein they agree or differ from the Noun &amp; Verb; or the Participle, which hath nothing but what agrees either with the Noun, or Verb, or with both: So that the whole difficulty is in the Noun and the Verb, of both which some are regulars, and some are irregulars, <hi>Anomala,</hi> defectives, or <hi>Heteroclytes.</hi> Now for the irregulars, the best, easiest, and shortest way were to learn them by use and exercise, without rule, which for the most part is done, and the rules usually are but superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and render the way more perplex and tedious; and this being observed, the way of regulars would be facile and brief, as being but one rule for all. And this I suppose being observed would render the way of <hi>Grammar</hi> teaching of more bevity, facility, and certainty, but greater experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces may know better waies.</p>
               <p>It may be imagined that I should proffer some auxiliary means for the promoting of <hi>Symbolical,</hi> and <hi>Cryptographi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> learning, as being a part of <hi>Grammar,</hi> but therein I must rather acknowledge mine inability, and onely wish that so much of it as is discovered, and made clear by others, might be put in practice, then would the benefit of it be better
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:51321:59"/>
understood by use, than I can demonstrate in words. And for the universal Character that would require a peculiar Tract, not a cursory touch: and for the language of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, I fear it is not acquisitive but dative, and therefore shall not be so weak in that particular, to prescribe a rule, which none hath power to follow, or strength to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.</p>
               <p>Next in order followeth <hi>Logick,</hi> which being that art or Science that should administer expedients and helps for the promoting and finding out of all other Sciences, doth not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding stand in need it self: from whence then should it have it? truly it is hard to determine, for it is such a groundlesse, intricate, and perplex piece, that it is very doubtful from whence it had its original, and therefore most difficult to know how to find its remedies; yet shall offer my best assistance to its regulation and amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is necessary that its radical ground be found forth in nature, and likewise its extent, without which it is not possible to lay open its nature and efficacy; for though it undertake to reason and argue of all things, yet bears it forth but little light and evidence of its own power and strength. And therefore in the first place it is requisite to inquire, what reason and ratiocination are in their intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick nature, and what they can operate, and effect, both solely by themselves, and conjunctively with the senses, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is clear that the work of Reason is posterior to that of Sense, and doth but compound, divide, and compare the several species that are received by the senses, and make Deduction, and draw Conclusions from them, and this is necessary that its distinct power and efficacy may be known. Also it is expedient to examine wherein man in reason exceeds other animants; for though man to maintain his unjust tyranny over the other fellow creatures (excuse the phrase it is no ranting term,<note place="margin">Job 17.14.</note> for <hi>Iob</hi> confesseth, <hi>I have said to corruption thou art my father, to the worm thou
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:51321:60"/>
art my mother and my sister</hi>) hath assumed to himself the title of being Rational, and excluding all other living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures from that prerogative, when it is certain that many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Creatures excell man in the acuteness of some Senses, and it is questionable that some exceed him in Reason too, though therein he be to be preferred before the most, so that if it be diligently searched into, it will be found that there is no specifical but a gradual difference.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Before any great good can be effected with <hi>Logick,</hi> especially with the <hi>Syllogistical</hi> part, it will be very expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent that its principles be demonstratively cleared and proved, either in some other Science from whence they are taken, or be briefly and compendiously laid down, and defined, that they may more certainly be assented to, and the grounds known, as in the <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> where a few Definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>Petitions,</hi> and <hi>Axioms,</hi> serve to demonstrate the whole operations by, with such certitude, that none since the daies of <hi>Euclide</hi> have denyed, or rejected them, that so by this means the Conclusions in <hi>Logick</hi> may be certain and profitable.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That some prevalent way might be found out, for dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering and rectifying the delusions and fallacies of the senses, and for drawing adaequate<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and congruous notions from things, and giving <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>pposite and significant denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to notions, that so the fountain may be made cleer at the head, and rise of it, that all the several rivulets, and streams that run from thence may be lympid and pure, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which it will be but as a muddy puddle, whose streams cast forth dirt and myre.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That the chiefest and most beneficial part, which is Induction, may be improved, that it may be serviceable and helpful for the discovering of Science, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be unless some carefull, diligent, and exact means be brought into practice, for the making, trying, and

observing of all sorts of experiments, both frugiferous, and luciferous, that time may not be vainly spent in needlesse altercations, disputations, speculations, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but in reall, and profitable experiments, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations; That so the end of <hi>Logical</hi> labour may not be to bring forth opinion, and errour, but certainty of Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and solidity of truth.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Mathematicks</hi> should now come in order, but of them I need say little, as to their advance, because they contain sufficient expedients in themselves for the progresse of their promotion, and indeed do want no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but diligent and faithful prosecution, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, that they may arrive at a compleat period. And therefore the onely help I shall offer in this case, is, to desire that this so noble, and excellent a Science, with all the parts of it, both general, and special, vulgar, and mystical, might be brought into use and practice in the Schools, that men might not idlely lose their time in groundlesse notions, and vain <hi>Chymaeras,</hi> but in those reall exercises of learning that would both profit themselves, succeeding generations, and other Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.</p>
               <p>And I could also wish that the sound, and <hi>Apodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical</hi> learning of <hi>Copernicus, Kepler, Ticho Brahe, Galilaeus, Ballialdus,</hi> and such like, might be introduced, and the rotten and ruinous Fabrick of <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Ptolomy</hi> rejected and laid aside.</p>

               <head>CHAP. X. Of some helps in Natural Philosophy.</head>
               <p>NOw when I come to lay down some expedients for the reformation and promotion of <hi>Physical</hi> knowledge, two things (I know) will be questioned, and inquired of.</p>
               <p>And first, Whether all the whole body of the <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotelian Philosophy</hi> should be eliminated, and thrown a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
               <p>To which I answer, No; for there are many things in his <hi>History</hi> of <hi>Animals,</hi> and some things in his <hi>Politicks, Ethicks, Logick, Metaphysicks,</hi> and <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> that are commodious and useful, yet do they all stand in need of reformation and amendment: But for his Natural <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,</hi> and his <hi>Astronomy</hi> depending thereon, it admits of no reformation, but eradication, that some better may be introduced in the place thereof. And for his Expositors, and Commentators, they instead of reforming what was amisse in his writings, carried with a blind zeal to make him the onely oracle of truth, have increased the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not supplyed the defects, nor removed the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>routs.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it will be urged, That if the <hi>Peripate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Philosophy</hi> which the Schools maintain, should be taken away, where would any such perfect, compleat, and methodical piece be found to supply the place there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>To which it is answered, That I have already demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated, and laid open the faults and defects thereof, that there is no such perfection in it at all as is supposed, and therefore no inconvenience to remove it. And admit there
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:51321:61"/>
were no such compleat piece, as were requisite to substi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute instead of the <hi>Aristotelian</hi> learning being taken away, the greater were the shame of <hi>Academies,</hi> that within the compass of so many Centuries have done no more for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of learning, for the greater the defect is, the more it ought to stir up all mens endeavours to repair, and make good the same. And also there are some pieces of <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy</hi> more compleat than <hi>Aristotles,</hi> as I shall shew in the following expedients.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It cannot be expected that <hi>Physical</hi> Science will arrive at any wished perfection, unlesse the way and means, so judiciously laid down by our learned Countreym<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>

                  </gap>d <hi>Bacon,</hi> be observed, and introduced into exact practice; And therefore I shall humbly desire, and earnestly presse, that his way and method may be imbraced, and set up for a rule and pattern: that no <hi>Axioms</hi> may be received but what are evidently proved and made good by diligent observation, and luciferou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap> experiments; that such may be recorded in a general history of natural things, that so eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry age and generation, proceeding in the same way, and upon the same principles, may dayly go on with the work, to the building up of a well-grounded and lasting Fabrick, which indeed is the only true way for the instauration and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of learning and knowledge.</p>
               <p n="2">2. How unfit, and unsuitable is it, for people professing the Christian Religion to adhere unto that <hi>Philosophy</hi> which is altogether built upon <hi>Ethnical</hi> principles, and indeed contrary and destructive to their tene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ts? so that I shall offer as a most fit expedient, that some <hi>Physical</hi> learning might be introduced into the Schools, that is grounded upon sensible, rational, experimental, and Scripture principles: and such a compleat piece in the most parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of all human learning (though many vainly and falsely imagine there is no such perfect work to be found) is the elaborate writings of that profoundly learned man Dr. <hi>Fludd,</hi> than which for all the particulars before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned (notwithstanding the ignorance and envy of all oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap> the world never had a more rare, experimental and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect piece.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:51321:62"/>3. That the <hi>Philosophy</hi> of <hi>Plato,</hi> revived and metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dized by <hi>Franciscus Patritius, Marsillius Ficinus,</hi> and others; That of <hi>Democritus,</hi> cleared, and in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure demonstrated, by <hi>Renatus des Cartes, Regius, Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cylides Holwarda,</hi> and some others; That of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> illustrated by <hi>Petrus Gassendus</hi>; That of <hi>Philolaus, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedocles,</hi> &amp; <hi>Parmenides,</hi> resuscitated by <hi>Telesius, Campa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nella,</hi> and some besides; and that excellent <hi>Magnetical Philosophy</hi> found out by Doctor <hi>Gilbert</hi>; That of <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,</hi> revived by the <hi>Paracelsian</hi> School, may be brought into examination and practice, that whatsoever in any of them, or others of what sort soever, may be found agreeable to truth and demonstration, may be imbraced, and received; for there are none of them but have excellent, and profitable things, and few of them but may justly be equallized with <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and the <hi>Scholastick</hi> learning, nay, I am confident upon due and serious perusal and tryal, would be found far to excel them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That youth may not be idlely trained up in notions, speculations, and verbal disputes, but may learn to inure their hands to labour, and put their fingers to the furnaces, that the mysteries discovered by <hi>Pyrotechny,</hi> and the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders brought to light by <hi>Chymistry,</hi> may be rendered fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar unto them: that so they may not grow proud with the brood of their own brains, but truly to be taught by manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al operation, and ocular experiment, that so they may not be sayers, but doers, not idle speculators, but painful o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perators; that so they may not be <hi>Sophisters,</hi> and <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers,</hi> but <hi>Sophists</hi> indeed, true Natural <hi>Magicians,</hi> that walk not in the external circumference, but in the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of natures hidden secre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>s, which can never come to pass, unless they have Laboratories as well as Libraries, and work in the fire, better than build Castles in the air.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That the <hi>Galenical</hi> way of the medicinal part of <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick</hi> (a path that hath been long enough trodden to yield so little fruit) may not be the prison that all men must be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chained in, and ignorance, cheating and impostorage main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by Lawes and Charters; but that the more sure, cleer
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:51321:62"/>
and exquisit way of finding the true causes, and certain cures of diseases, brought to light by those two most emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and laborious persons, <hi>Paracelsus,</hi> and <hi>Helmont,</hi> may be entertained, prosecuted and promoted; that it may no longer be disputable whether medicine (as it stands in the common road of use and form) be more helpful than hurtful, or kill more than it cures; and whether the <hi>Republique</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> were more happy in the health of her Subjects which wanted <hi>Physicians</hi> for five hundred years, than we that have them in more abundance than Caterpillers, or Horseleaches. And unless these few expedients be put in practice, we may wax old in ignorance, and never see <hi>Physical</hi> knowledge ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at any height of perfection; and so I pass to the others following.</p>
               <p>The next is <hi>Metaphysicks,</hi> to help which I shall only offer this expedient, that it might be reduced to some certain grounds and principles, from whence demonstrations might be drawn, that men might proceed with some certainty, and not wander in the dark they know not whither, and so that the most sure way of <hi>Rena<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>us des Cartes</hi> may be brought into use, and exercise, who hath traced it unto the head of the Spring, and shaken off the loose and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous questions, notions, and frivolous <hi>Chimaeras</hi> thereof: That so it might become useful and beneficial, which as it now stands, and is used (or rather abused) serves for little else but o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ly to amuse, and amaze the understanding, to blow up the Phantasie with ayrie and empty notions, and to make men vainly and fruitlessly wast their most pretious time, which should be bestowed in things of more necessary use, and of greater concernment.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Ethical</hi> knowledge, I suppose it better taught by president and practice, than by words and precepts, for seeing vertue doth consist in action, it must of necessity be far more laudable, that men be brought up to live vertuously, than to talk and dispute of vertue, and therefore could wish it more practical and less speculative. And yet could desire that the nature of passions and affections, vertues and vices, might be more radically demonstrated, and sought into, than they
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:51321:63"/>
are in the Scholastick way, and therefore shall onely propose that what <hi>Melancthon</hi> and <hi>Cartesius</hi> have discovered of them, might be made documental, and practicable, and that the doctrine of them might be made more consonant to that Christian Religion which men so much profess, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of, and that <hi>Seneca</hi> and <hi>Epictetus</hi> might not be sleight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and neglected, while <hi>Aristotle</hi> is only applauded and imbraced, betwixt whom there is no small difference.</p>
               <p>Lastly for <hi>Rhetorick</hi> and <hi>Poesie,</hi> I shall prescribe nothing, but leave every man to the freedome of his <hi>genius,</hi> only to add this, that Emperours and Kings can make and create Dukes, Marquesses, and Earls, but cannot make one O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator or Poet, and so shall conclude with the <hi>Lyrick</hi> Poet, <hi>Tu nihil invitÃ¢ facies, dicesve, MinervÃ¢.</hi>

               <p>IN order to the prescription of remedies concerning their Customes and Method, though (as in the rest) I cannot do what should or ought to be done in so weighty a matter, yet shall I contribute what lies in my weak power, and at least expresse my good will, if not my skill.</p>
               <p n="1">1. And so shall first desire that men may no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap> be tyed up all to one method or way, lest as it may keep them in a good path, so it may hinder them from imbracing, or following a better: and it is cleer that there may be many waies to one place, and divers methods for the attaining the same end of knowledge, so as we would not exclude men from tryals that they may find out the best, so we would not ty them to any one, lest it prove the worst.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:51321:63"/>2. That above all other things care may be had that time be not mispent, or trifled away, which is an irreparable loss, and utterly irrevocable, and therefore I could wish that <hi>Apelles</hi> motto might be had in everlasting remembrance, <hi>Nulla dies sine linea</hi>; and therefore long vacations, relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and intermissions are to be looked upon as <hi>Scylla</hi> and <hi>Charibdis,</hi> the rocks and shelves whereon youngmen may easily suffer Shipwrack.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I shall tender this, that all should not be tyed to one term or time, but every one have his honour according to his industry and proficiency, that therby those that are pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful may be incouraged, and those that are idle and sluggish may be ashamed: And that none may be debarred of his degree or grace, how short a time soever he hath been there, if he be but able to perform the requisites and exercises in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined, by which means merit, not years, sufficiency, not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality, shall take place and be rewarded.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That their exercises may not only be verbal and dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative, but practical and operative, that they may not onely be tryed what they can say, but what they can do, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what they opinionate, but what they can perform, that as nature hath given them two hands, and but one tongue, so they may learn to work more and speak less.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That their exercises may be in the <hi>English</hi> as well as other tongues, that while they labour to make other lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages familiar unto them, they become not altogether strangers unto their own: and that scurrility, and childish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse may be laid aside, and all things performed with more sobriety and gravity.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That neither antiquity nor novelty may take place above verity, lest it debarre us from a more diligent search after truth and Science: Neither that universality of opinion be any president or rule to sway our judgements from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vestigation of knowledge; for what matter is it whether we follow many or few, so the truth be our guide? for we should not follow a multitude to do evil, and it is better to accompany verity single, than falsity and errour with never so great a number. Neither is it fit that <hi>Authority</hi> (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:51321:64"/>
of <hi>Aristotle</hi> or any other) should inchain us, but that there may be a general freedome to try all things, and to hold fast that which is good, that so there might be a <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophical</hi> liberty to be bound to the authority of none, but truth it self, then will men take pains, and arts will flou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ish.</p>
               <p n="7">7. As to the order to be observed in teaching the Arts, and Sciences, doubtless there can be no better method, than leading them into the fair fields of <hi>Mathematical</hi> learning, which by reason of its perspicuity and certitude would so settle and season the understanding, that it would ever after be sufficiently armed to discern betwixt truth and opinion, demonstration and probability: and render it more fit and able to proceed in Natural <hi>Philosophy,</hi> and other Sciences, and so to proceed to the Tongues, then to <hi>Physicks,</hi> and so to <hi>Logick, Metaphysicks,</hi> and the like, which order with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out question, would prove more advantagious, than that which the Schools have pursued for so many years with so little fruit. And these are the Expedients that for the present I have to present, hoping they may be acceptable until bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be found out; and if any thing herein may appear to be erroneous, let it be but candidly made manifest, and he will be willing either to give further satisfaction, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim his mistakes, who in these things judgeth himself but as the meanest of men, and so no way privileged from frailty and infirmity.</p>
