            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

that he had no leaſure, the woman looking

ſpoken of a ſubiect, and not with that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence

I haue read that the Tribunes, which wer
officers choſen for the defence of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
of Rome, had their gates or dores
neuer ſhut, neither by day, nor by night, in
token that thither might be the recourſe of
al them that had néede of ſuccour. So ought
euery gouernoure, whether he be ſpiritual
or temporall, to be a ſuccour, and as it wer
a caſtle and a fortreſſe to them that be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

that he wrote <hi>de principe,</hi> amongſt other
preceptes, willeth chiefely and aboue all
thinges, that whoſoeuer be the head of the
people, be a diligent worſhipper &amp; folower
of God: next, that he be louing to his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes,
<pb facs="tcp:12611:2"/>
if he will haue them to be faythfull
to him, and loue him as ſubiectes ſhoulde
their prince. For it is not of likelyhood, ſaid
<hi>Dion,</hi> neither doth nature permit, but that
he that loueth, ſhould be loued, when we
ſée dogges to fawne, and horſes to neye to
them, of whom they be cheriſhed. Again, he
would haue ſuch rulers to call themſelues
ſhepherdes and féeders of men, rather then
otherwiſe. So <hi>Homer</hi> calleth a king <hi>paſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem

people. And <hi>Plato</hi> in his Dialogue called

as a ſhepherdes care is to ſée his ſhéepe

that he will not tarye with them to kéepe
them from wolues, from dogges that fall
to byting of them, and from other like ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenous
beaſts? Who would imagine him
to be ſo negligent, that he will not in the

lawes haſte thou made for the ſetting forth
of my glorye, for the extirpation of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyes,
for maintenaunce of equitie, for pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
of wronge, for prouiſion, that
thinges may be ſolde at a competent price,
that couetous men make no dearth to
their condemnation, when I geue plentie?
Thou Lorde, howe haſte thou gouerned
vnder thy prince? Thou man of woorſhip,
howe haſte thou indeuoured to haue qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etnes
kepte, and the princes lawes to be
obeyed? Thou Iuſtice, how haſte thou mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred
right indifferently to all perſons?
Thou Maior or head officer in anye Citie
or Towne, howe haſte thou kept thy ſelfe
cléere from periurie? howe haſte thou ſéene
good order obſerued, and al ydlenes &amp; diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
maners to be baniſhed? Finally, thou,
whatſoeuer officer or Magiſtrate thou be,
howe haſte thou regarded the common
wealth, and preferred it afore thy priuate
lucre or commoditie? O that theſe thinges
were conſidered: for as ſure as God liueth,
theſe accomptes will he call vpon ſtraytly.
None ſhall eſcape, <hi>Cui multum datur</hi> (as
S. Gregorie ſayeth) <hi>multum ab eo quaere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,</hi>
He that hath muche geuen him, ſhall
make a great accompt thereof, and muche
<pb facs="tcp:12611:5"/>
ſhall be of him required: And at that daye
percaſe he ſhall recken him ſelfe moſte for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
and happie, that had leaſte in this
worlde, and leaſt to doo. And he peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
moſte infortunate, that hath moſte to
doo in this worlde, vnleſſe he order it well,
vnleſſe he order it righteouſly, iuſtly, and
ordinately.</p>
            <p>Nowe, good Reader, thou haſte hearde,
that Chriſte ſayeth: <hi>Bonus paſtor animam
ſuam dat pro ouibus ſuis,</hi> And to put thée
out of doubt who is this good ſhepherde, he
ſayeth: <hi>Ego ſum paſtor bonus, &amp; cognoſco
oues meas, &amp; cognoſcunt me meae.</hi> I am the
good ſhepherde, which will geue my lyfe
for my ſhéepe, by my death to purchaſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
lyfe, that as I will riſe, and dye no more,
ſo ſhall they after their bodily death ariſe
at the laſt day, neuer to dye any more, but
to liue alwayes with my father and me. I
knowe my ſhéepe, not all onely that they
be mine, but I ſo knowe them for mine,
that I wilbe their ſuccour in their tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
I will ſtrengthen them in their
perſecutions, I will receaue them into my
ioye and glorie, I knowe them, and they
knowe me. This is then required of the
ſhéepe, that they knowe their ſhepherde.
<pb facs="tcp:12611:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Thrée properties muſt be in euery man or
woman that ſhall haue this worthy name
to be called a ſhéepe of Chriſte. The firſte
propertie is, that our Sauiour ſayeth, that
his ſhéepe doo know him. This knowledge
haue Chriſtes ſhéepe of him, that by his
godhead he is their father, by his manhood
he is their brother, and by his benefites he
is their louing lorde and maſter. They
knowe it is he, and none other, that hath
made their peace with God his father: <hi>Ipſe
enim eſt pax noſtra,</hi> for he is our peace (<hi>Ad
Epheſios ſecundo</hi>) he hath gotten vs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geuenes
of our ſinnes, he hath deliuered
vs out of the bondage of the deuill, he hath
purchaſed heauen for vs, he is to vs <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris
fortitudinis,</hi> the Tower of our ſtrength.
The ſeconde propertie of Chriſtes ſhéepe
is, to heare their ſhepherdes voyce, and to
geue no eare to the voyce of any ſtraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
You will aſke me peraduenture, how
you ſhoulde heare him, which although he
be verily and bodily héere with vs in the
Sacrament of the Aultare, yet in his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
forme he is aſcended vp into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
and ſitteth on the right hande of his
father? Wherevnto I aunſwere, that we
<pb facs="tcp:12611:6"/>
muſt heare his voyce ſounding by the
mouth of his Churche, which is the verye
true ſpouſe of Ieſus Chriſte, <hi>Quam ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficauit,
mundans eam lauacro aquae in verbo
vitae,</hi> whom he hath ſanctified and purified
with the bath of water in the worde of
life, <hi>vt exhiberet ipſe ſibi glorioſam eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am
non habentem maculam aut rugam,</hi> to
make it a glorious Churche to himſelfe
without ſpot or wrinkle (<hi>Ad Epheſios.</hi> 5.)
If we heare the church, we heare Chriſte:
for as the holy Biſhop and Martyr <hi>Irenaeus</hi>
writeth in the fortie Chapter of his thirde
booke, <hi>Vbi eccleſia, ibi &amp; ſpiritus, &amp; vbi ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritus
dei, illic eccleſia &amp; omnis gratia, ſpiritus
autem veritas,</hi> where the Churche is, there
is the ſpirite of God, and where the ſpirite
of God is, there is the Churche and all
grace, and the ſpirite is truth. Wherefore
as the ſame godly father writeth in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> forty
and thrée Chapiter of his fourth booke, we
be bounde to be obedient to the Prelates
of the Churche, <hi>his qui ſucceſsionem ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent
ab Apoſtolis,</hi> to them that haue their
ſucceſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from the Apoſtles. <hi>Reliquos verò</hi>

that go away from the principall ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion,
we ought to ſuſpect them as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes.
Theſe are Ireneus wordes in the
place nowe alleaged. And Chriſt ſayth him
ſelfe: <hi>Qui vos audit, me audit,</hi> He that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
you, heareth me. Wherfore, if we wil
heare Chriſt, as his father hath commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
vs, <hi>Ipſum audite,</hi> Heare him, <hi>Math.</hi> 17.
then muſt we heare the Churche. The
Churche is our moſte holy Mother, whom
we ought to haue in great reuerence, and
to commit our ſelues wholly vnto her, to
heare her, and, like obedient children, to do
what ſhe biddeth vs. What the Churche
holdeth in matters of religion, that muſt
we holde: what the Churche preſcribeth, it
is our duetie to folowe: what the Churche
forbiddeth, that are we bound, vnder paine
of damnation to auoyde in any wiſe. S.
Iohn in the fourth Chapter of his firſte E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle
biddeth vs be ware, that we beléeue
not euery ſpirite, but to trye the ſpirites,
whether they be of God or not. Then, how
can they be of God, whiche go from the
Churche? S. Auguſtine in the expoſition
of this Epiſtle of S. Iohn, <hi>tractatu primo,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:12611:7"/>
writeth thus: <hi>Qui eccleſiam relinquit, quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modo
eſt in Chriſto, qui in membris Chriſti
non eſt? Quomodo eſt in Chriſto, qui in
corpore Chriſti non eſt?</hi> He that leaueth
the Churche, howe is he in Chriſte, that is
not in the members of Chriſte? howe is he
in Chriſt, that is not in the body of Chriſt?
By the which S. Auguſtine affirmeth, that
the Churche, which is the ſpouſe of Chriſt,
is alſo the miſticall bodye of Chriſte, and
Chriſte is the heade of the Churche. As
many therefore, as be Chriſte his ſhéepe,
they heare their ſhepherdes voyce in the
Churche. They will not heare the voyce of
ſtraungers, as of <hi>Luther, Oecolampadius,
Zuinglius, Caluine,</hi> &amp; like heretikes, which
for all their gaye wordes, and crying ſtill,
Chriſte and the Goſpell, maye haue euerye
one of them, theſe verſes of <hi>Perſius</hi> in his
fifte Satyre worthely ſpoken to him:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pelliculam veterem retines, &amp; fronte politus

Thou kéepeſt ſtill thine olde hyde vppon

Epiſtle: <hi>Magiſtri mendaces, qui intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducunt
<pb facs="tcp:12611:8"/>
ſectas perditionis,</hi> Lying maſters,
bringing in ſectes of perdition, and deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the God that bought them. Howebeit,
ſithen it is ſo, as Paule ſayeth, There will

               <hi>non parcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes

our owne ſelues will men ariſe, ſpeaking
peruerſe thinges, And ſuche is our frayle
nature, that as the wittie <hi>Horace</hi> ſayeth:
<q>
                  <l>Decipimur ſpecie recti,</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>We be ſoone deceaued vnder the colour of
truth. It behoueth vs to folowe the counſel
of our head and principall maſter Ieſus
Chriſte, whiche teacheth vs an excellent
document of heauenly philoſophie, ſaying:
<hi>Attendite vobis à falſis Prophetis,</hi> Take yée
héede to your ſelues, and beware of falſe
Prophetes, which come vnto you, <hi>in veſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentis
ouium,</hi> in ſhéepes cloathing, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
they are <hi>Lupi rapaces,</hi> Rauening
wolues: We muſt, I ſay, beware, that we
be not deluded, and vnder colour of Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall
veritie, be made to receaue perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
and damnable hereſyes, as alas the
more pitie, hath miſerably chaunced to our
noble Realme of Englande, vnder colour
of bringing vs to truth, leading vs awaye
from the truth, to the vtter decaye of all
<pb facs="tcp:12611:8"/>
godlines, and ſetting vp of counterfaite re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
The wéede hath nowe ouer growen
the corne, euill, hurtfull, and ſoulequelling
wéedes of hereſie haue ouergrowen, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed,
pulled downe to the grounde, and
vtterly choked the good corne of chriſten
religion, and all eccleſiaſticall conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
All you therefore that haue bene ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
and taken wéedes for wholſome flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
beware leaſt with the ſtenche of ſuche
rotten wéedes, yée infecte your ſoule to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting
damnation. The infallible truth
is dayly opened vnto you, The falſhood is
mightily conuinced, as ſhall plainelye ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
in the Diſcourſe héere folowing.
Stande no more in the defence of that,
which you may eaſily knowe and ſée with
your eyes, if ye will not be wilfullye and
obſtinately blinde, to be nothing but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt:
What doo I call it, deceipt? naye, I
cal it a moſt venimous poiſon to the ſoule,
yea, and an helliſhe draught of endleſſe
death. Playe not the parte of a mad man,
of whom <hi>Horace</hi> writeth in the ſeconde
booke of his Epiſtles, that he was angrye
with his frendes, for that they had cauſed
him to be healed of his phreneſie, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored
to his wittes agayne: Be not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grye,
<pb facs="tcp:12611:9"/>
that you may (if you will) be brought
out of the fowle miſte, into the cléere ayre,
from darkenes to light, from an horrible
phreneſie to godly wiſedome. Folowe the
wholſome counſell of Saint Paule in the
fourth to the <hi>Epheſians, Vt non ſimus am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plius
pueri, qui fluctuemus, &amp; circumfera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur
quouis vento doctrinae, per verſutiam
hominum, per aſtutiam qua nos adoriuntur,
vt imponant nobis,</hi> That we be no longer
children, and fléete too and fro, caried hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and thither with euerye blaſt of doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine,
by the wilines and craftines of men,
wherwith they ſet vpon vs to deceiue vs.
There haue béene a great manye ſuche
ſprongen vp in our Realme of late, which
haue taught vs wronge Leſſons: <hi>Emende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus
ergò in melius,</hi> Let vs amend therfore.
The thirde propertie is, that the ſhéepe doo
folowe their Shepherde: This propertie
is of ſo great importance, that without it
the other two cannot auayle. It is not y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to knowe Chriſte to be our refuge,
our helpe and ſuccoure: It is not ynoughe
with that alſo to heare Chriſte ſpeaking to
vs in his Churche, except we folow Chriſt
and his Churche, and ſhewe our ſelues
willingly to doo that which the Churche
<pb facs="tcp:12611:9"/>
commaundeth vs. We muſt faſt, when the
Churche commaundeth vs, and as it bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
vs: We muſt pray as the Churche in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructeth
vs, We muſt doo thoſe good woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes
that the Churche teacheth vs to doo. In
obeying the Churche, we obey God: if we
be diſobedient to the Churche, we diſobeye
God. For as <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> ſayeth vpon the
firſte Epiſtle to the Corinthians, <hi>vt corpus
&amp; caput vnus eſt homo, ita vnum eſt eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia
&amp; Chriſtus,</hi> As the body and the head is
but one man, ſo is Chriſte and his Church
one thing. Doo therefore as the wiſe man
biddeth thée, <hi>Audi diſciplinam patris tui, &amp;
ne dimittas legem matris tuae,</hi> Heare the
diſcipline of thy father, and forſake not
the lawe of thy mother: I meane, thy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the holye Churche, whom as manye
as forſake, they forſake God alſo. For as
holy <hi>Ciprian</hi> writeth <hi>de ſimplicate prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latorum:
Habere non poteſt deum patrem,
qui eccleſiam non habet matrem,</hi> He can
not haue God to be his father, that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not the Churche for his mother. Yée
may ſée here euidentlye, that this holye
man would haue vs to be obedient vnto,
and diligently to kéepe, the ordinaunces
<pb facs="tcp:12611:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of our fathers, &amp; not to inſtitute euery day
newe faſhions, as men moſte vnconſtant,
and full of newe fangles. The Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians
are prayſed, that they ſuffered no
ſtraunge ware to be brought into their Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
whereby the Citizens might be effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated
and corrupted in their maners,
and for the ſame cauſe they extoll greatlye
<hi>Licurgus,</hi> which made the ſame law. Now,
if the Lacedemonians were ſo ſerious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruers
of their olde lawes and cuſtomes,
what a ſhame ſhall this be to vs Chriſtian
men (which were not taught of <hi>Licurgus,</hi>
but of Chriſte himſelfe) dayly to alter and
chaunge, not content with thoſe rites and
Ceremonyes that were ordeyned of aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
time out of memorie? <hi>Irenaeus</hi> tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
in his thirde booke againſt the here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyes
of <hi>Valentine,</hi> and ſuche other: whoſe
wordes taken out of his fourth Chapter of
the ſayde booke, I will briefely rehearſe:
<hi>Si quae de aliqua modica quaeſtione diſcepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio
eſſet, nonnè oporteret in antiquiſsimas
recurrere eccleſias, in quibus Apoſtoli con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſati

any controuerſie ſhoulde be of any queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
were it neuer ſo litle, muſt it not be
<pb facs="tcp:12611:10"/>
méete to haue our recourſe vnto the moſte
auncient Churches, in the which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
were conuerſant, and of them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue
the playne certaintie thereof? It fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth,

But what if the Apoſtles left nothing
written of that matter, muſt we not fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the tradition of them, to whoſe gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce
they committed the Churches?
Here haue you the minde of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> who
was néere vnto Chriſt his time: for as S.
Hierome teſtifyeth in an Epiſtle to one
<hi>Theodora,</hi> he was Diſciple to <hi>Papias,</hi> who
was S. Iohn the Euangeliſts ſcholler. He
woulde haue men to be taught of Chriſte,
of his Apoſtles and their ſucceſſours, and
not of euery one, which raſhelye and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
lawfull authoritie taketh vpon him to
be a teacher. Chriſten men ſhould be obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to chriſten ordinaunces, and folowe
that doctrine that is alowed by them that
are lawfully called, and haue the cenſure
of doctrine committed to them. Such were
the Apoſtles, called and put in authoritie
by Chriſte. Suche were they, to whom
<pb facs="tcp:12611:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
theſe agayne gaue the charge ouer anye
faythfull congregation. Suche are all they
which haue ſo from time to time béene
lawfully called by them that haue power
to put others in authoritie, and ſo ſuccée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in due order, els, <hi>Quomodò praedicabu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
niſi mittantur,</hi> Howe ſhall they preache,
except they be ſent, as it is written in the
tenth to the Romanes, and ſent by them
which haue authoritie to ſende. Did not
S. Paule for that purpoſe leaue <hi>Titus</hi> in
<hi>Crete?</hi> Did he not alſo geue Timothie
charge to laye handes to quickelye on no
man? To theſe that be thus lawfullye or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned
and called to haue cure and charge
of ſoules, ye are bounde to geue an eare: by
theſe ye muſt be ruled in matters of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as obedient children to their ſpiriritual
fathers. And this biddeth S. Hierome, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to <hi>Nepotian: Eſto ſubiectus pontifici
tuo, &amp; quaſi animae parentem ſuſpice,</hi> Be
ſubiect to thy Biſhop, &amp; reuerence him as
thy ſoules father. The ſame leſſon teacheth
Chriſoſtome in an Homilye, <hi>De recipiendo
Seueriano,</hi> where he beginneth thus: <hi>Sicuti
capiti corpus cohaerere neceſſarium eſt, ita
eccleſiam ſacerdoti, &amp; principi populum,</hi>
As it is of neceſſitie, that the body cleaue
<pb facs="tcp:12611:11"/>
to the head, ſo it is likewiſe of neceſſitie,
that the congregation cleaue to their
Prieſt and ſpirituall ruler, and the people
to their prince. And within a fewe wordes
after he alleageth for the confirmation of
this matter the Apoſtle writing thus to
the Hebrewes, in the thirtenth Chapter:
<hi>Obedite praepoſitis veſtris &amp; obtemperate
eis, quia ipſi peruigilant pro vobis, quaſi pro
animabus veſtris rationem reddituri,</hi> Obeye
them that haue the ouerſight of you, and
doo as they would haue you, for they watch
for your ſakes, as they which ſhall geue
accoumptes for your ſoules. This obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
doth our Sauiour require of all men,
ſaying: <hi>Qui vos audit, me audit,</hi> He that
heareth you, heareth me. This obedience
to Chriſtes Churche hath continued
throughout all Chriſtendome time out
of minde. And if the authoritie of the
learned and holye fathers ought to beare
ſwaye and preuayle, as of right it ought
to doo in déede. <hi>Arrogantium enim
hominum eſt, maiorum ſuorum authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem
aſpernari, &amp; ſe illis ingenio vel ſapien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia
anteponere:</hi> For it is the maner and
propertie of proude arrogant perſons to
contemne the authoritie of their elders,
<pb facs="tcp:12611:12"/>
and to preferre themſelues before themin
wit or learning. If the conſent of all
chriſten Regions ſhould be regarded, <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilia</hi>
(ſayth <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in the firſt Chapter

are probable, which all men, or at the leaſt,
the moſt part doo iudge to be ſo. If the long

<hi>In his enim</hi> (as witneſſeth S. Hilarie
vpon the hundred and eyghtéene pſalme)
<hi>tanquàm in coelo verbum dei permanet, in

doth the word of God abide, among whom
that worde is not offended. If theſe thrée,
I ſaye, The authoritie of the learned Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
The common conſent of chriſtian
Regions, The long continuaunce of time,
may be a ſufficient teſtimonie for the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
we haue the true Goſpell, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true
ſenſe of it: Our religion is the very chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
religion, The order of Ceremonyes
that the Catholike Churche doth vſe, is the
right order, Our faſting and praying is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Scriptures, Our Church is
the true and lawfull ſpouſe of Chriſt, from
the which as many as ſeperate them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues,
they are no ſhéepe of Chriſtes folde,
<pb facs="tcp:12611:12"/>
they are reprobate perſons, they are the
children of Beliall, they are ympes of hell.
You know what order your fathers kept,
howe they liued, and howe they beléeued:
You are not ignoraunt, howe you haue
béene brought vp, inſtructed and trained in
the lawes of Chriſte. Whoſoeuer goeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to infringe or breake any part of that
godly order, of that auncient cuſtome and
laudable vſage, he is an heretike, an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mye
to God, a murtherer to mannes ſoule,
a diſturber of the common wealth, a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerter
of all honeſt diſcipline, and therfore

            <p>I haue hearde, read, and ſéene manye
thinges, yet can I not reade, heare, or ſée
any worlde more contaminate and proue
to all kinde of vices then this our age is.
And howbeit afore our dayes haue béene
in all times and ages men and women ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye
vitious and monſtrous in their liuing,
yet then vertue was vertue, and vice was
vice: But nowe in our corrupt time, we
haue loſt the true names and vſe of all
thinges, and vertue with vs is taken for
vice, and contrarily, vice is coumpted for
vertue. They that be ſtudious of modeſtie,

Agayne, the ſtatelyer that one goeth, the

this day they like, to morowe they miſlike,
and one is againſt another of them, euen
in the higheſt miſterie of Chriſte his reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
And no meruaile, for the deuill is

Theſe with the reſt of that rable did neuer
agrée one with another, in their doinges
there is no vnitie, no certaintie at all: and
therfore ſuch maſters, ſuch ſcollers come of

were not the children of our true mother

we cannot ſhewe, that God is the
Authour of our Prieſthood, that we
ſhould be conſtrained to confeſſe, that
it is not of God, ſeeing that without

what reaſon is there, I praye you,
in this? for although it were ſo, that
of our owne priuate power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie,
without being called, wee
ſhoulde take it vppon vs, it ſhoulde
not folowe by that, that it is not of

tooke it vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their owne
boldenes:<note place="margin">2. Paral. 26</note> the which is not true. And
as touching this, that he ſaieth, that
our order of prieſthood is not of God,
we will proue that falſe in ſome other

of our vocation, to aunſwere him &amp;

vntill (ſaith he) that in the vnitie of

his ſimilitude of many that come fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
diuerſe wayes, and meete all in one
waye. And thus he meanes, that the
ſpirituall edification of the Churche,
ordeined of Biſhops, Paſtours and
Doctours, ſhall endure, vntill that
the Goſpell be preached through all
nations. By the effecte of the whiche

of great antiquitie, all one kinde of

Catholike faith by the Apoſtles and
their ſucceſſors for euer. As the ſonne
of God, before he ſuffered, did attaine
and arriue to the perfection of his

Churche ſhall continue in this world,
vntill it be perfect in his members,

that when the Apoſtle doth tell, how

that I woulde haue thee to leane
to that flocke, that can leade thee
from age to age, and from yere to

on the which he was nailed at noone
dayes: and there it is where thou
oughteſt to quiet thy ſelfe and thy
conſcience. Then to beginne: If thou
doeſt aſke the <hi>Caluiniſtes,</hi> Where is
the true fayth (the which, as they
ſaye, doeth conſiſte in the true prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
of the worde of the Lorde,
and in the adminiſtration of the
Sacramentes, according to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
of Ieſus Chriſte) they will
aunſwere: It is at <hi>Geneua,</hi> the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans</hi>
will aunſwere, At <hi>Wittem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berge,</hi>

and ſo conſequently of the reſt.
And then purſue, and aſke farther,
where it was twentye yeares
<pb facs="tcp:12611:24"/>
agone? They will ſay, in the ſaide Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
but if thou come to demaunde of

anye thing at all to lye, they
will not aunſwere at all, for there is
none of them, that can deny, but that
<hi>Luther,</hi> who beganne to preache his
newe Goſpell the yere. 1517. was the
firſte beginner of all theſe troubles, &amp;
the father of all thoſe that teache this

vnto this obiection, I meane,
becauſe that the Greekes haue not

had ſucceſſion and continuaunce of

There is none that doo ſtudy &amp; reade

as touching the proceeding of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
ghoſte: the which errour they had

and yet notwithſtanding they

argument is of no force: For althogh
that the careleſſe liues of ſome Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
and eccleſiaſticall perſons haue
bene ſo great and ſo hurtfull vnto the
blud of our Sauior Chriſt (I mean,
to the ſoules bought with it) yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
that, the Churche hath
not loſt the ſucceſſion &amp; continuaunce
of one doctrine, as touching the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration
of the Sacramentes by
thoſe that were deputed by the Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops.
If one ſhould ſee a Prelate do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

all, which of thoſe two woulde you
take to be Biſhop? they haue both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided

loſſe doo you feele? he that hath anye
intereſt, let him valewe the damage.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:12611:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
And although that the negligence of

God with the diligence of the depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
nor his conſcience cleere, yet this
ought to ſuffiſe, that though his faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
be through negligence, or through

the aſſurance of our doctrin, the

               <p>You ſee well by theſe wordes, howe
that <hi>Tertulian</hi> doeth continue with
the ſucceſſion of the Paſtours, the
which he doeth affirme to be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye,
ſaying: that you, and ſuch as you
are, ought not to be receiued to the
miniſterie of the Church, nor to teach
the people, contrary to the eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
order, except that you ſhewe the
antiquitie of your table. And it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
(ſaith he) that you recken your
Paſtors and Biſhops by order, and
howe they haue ſucceeded one after
another: for this is the waye that the
Churches doo maintaine their right.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:12611:33"/>
The ſaide <hi>Tertulian</hi> doth ground his
ſimilitude vppon the cuſtome of the
Ciuill gouernaunce. For when that
thoſe yare princes or Lordes doo ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaye
their landes, the ſubiectes are
bounde to ſhewe, what bandes they
holde of them, ſetting it all forth by
accompt, ſhewing by what tenure
they holde their copie, and whether it
be demeanes or freeholde, comming
by inheritance or bought: they ought
likewiſe to name him that had it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and by their owne title to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe
all other perſons that maye
make claime vnto it. According to
this paterne and order we haue ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
you accompt of our inheritance,
although we were not bounde to it,
ſetting before your eyes the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of <hi>Salomon,</hi> by whom our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
<hi>Ieſus Chriſte</hi> is repreſented.
That ſame <hi>Salomon</hi> doeth geue the

to ſet his Tabernacle by the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle

their flocke, vntil he come to the place
where <hi>Chriſte</hi> was nailed on the
Croſſe at noone dayes. The whiche
counſell, as the moſte certaine (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to <hi>Tertulian</hi> his opinion) we doo
folowe, thinking it ſufficient, to keepe
vs firmely in the right and auncient
Catholike fayth. For we that are the

whom we doo call in iudgement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

which ſent them, and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
may direct the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to <hi>Chriſte,</hi>
who by the mouth of his moſte lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

at the beginning. 1. <hi>Ioan.</hi> 2. And ſo we
ſhall continue and reſt with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the Sonne and the holy Ghoſt.
And if any body doth come to teache

which hath bene taught vs at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning:
I doo not ſaye, written in

                  <note place="margin">Galat. 1.</note> or an
excommunicate perſon, yea, although
it were an Angell of heauen. The
which doeth perſwade vs, not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue

but to keepe our ſelues vnder the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernaunce
of our olde Paſtours and

Biſhops, without hauing any reſpect
to their euill or good liues: for as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
our faith and ſaluation, that
doth unport nothing. The good and
holye liues of Ieſus Chriſte and his
Apoſtles hath profited nothing, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to the obſtinate Iewes, nor to
the vnbeleuing Gentiles: Nor in the
like caſe the depraued life of manye
euil Biſhops that haue bene at <hi>Rome</hi>
and in other places haue not ſhut the

I meane, the one, that we
beleue that, that our Paſtours &amp; the

thouſande and fiue hundred yeres:
and the other, that their euill liues
cannot hurt vs. For as the Apoſtle

body of our Sauiour is not really in
the Sacrament of the Aultare? who
hath taught the doctrine (or, if it be

wold haue vs to receiue as a Goſpel?
I know before hand, that you wil al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leage

<pb facs="tcp:12611:36"/>
Let me vnderſtand by what means
you canne ioyne your ſelues vnto the
Churche of the Apoſtles, ſeing that
you condemne and cut off all the
Chriſtians that haue beene and are
betweene you and them. For to veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fye
this, I will alleage no other but
your owne workes: for <hi>Caluin</hi> in his
Inſtitutions at the Treatiſe of the
Supper of the Lord, ſpeaking of the
oblation of the body of our Sauiour
<hi>Chriſte,</hi> as it was offered in olde
time, he doeth write punctually theſe
wordes: <hi>Caluinus, in ſua inſtitutione
tradita de Coena Domini. I finde</hi>
(ſayth he) <hi>that thoſe of olde time haue
chaunged this faſhion, otherwiſe then
the Inſtitution of our Sauiour did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
ſeing that their ſupper did repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
a certaine ſpectacle of a ſtraunge
Inuention, or at the leaſt, of a newe
maner. There is nothing more ſure vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the faythfull, then for them to holde
them ſelues vnto the pure ordinance of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:12611:36"/>
the Lorde, by whom it was called a
ſupper, to the ende, that onely his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
may be our rule. Yet it is true,
that when I conſider their good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and that their intent was, neuer
to derogate from the onely ſacrifice of
Chriſte, I dare not condemne them of
folye, and yet I thinke, that one cannot
excuſe them, that they haue not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
fayled in the exteriour forme: for
they haue folowed more the Cerimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of the Iewes, then the order of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſte did permit. And this is the
point, in which they ought to be reſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
for they haue conformed to muche
vnto the olde Teſtament, not conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
themſelues with the ſimple inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of Chriſte, they haue to muche
inclined themſelues vnto the ſhadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Ceremonies of the Iewes lawe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe are <hi>Caluins</hi> words. The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
may by them ſee well, howe this
noble Reformer of the Goſpell doeth
correct al ages and Churches, be they
<pb facs="tcp:12611:37"/>
of <hi>Martyrs, Confeſſors, Doctours, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters,
Preachers,</hi> or anye others,
from the Apoſtles time vnto our age,
yet doth he not deny, but that hauing
ſome regard of their ſimple ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
he is content to be ſo good to them, as
for this time not to condemne their
error or impietie, becauſe that which
they did was with a good intent:
but yet fearing, that the bearing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to muche fauour woulde trouble his
conſcience, he geueth ſentence againſt
them, ſaying, that they ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted,
becauſe they were not content
with the onely inſtitution of <hi>Chriſte,</hi>
but rather, that in this caſe they haue
folowed the ſhadows of the Iewes.
Nowe, for my part, I thinke <hi>Caluin</hi>
and his felowes ſo ſcrupulous, that
they would not ioyn themſelues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

he doth counſel my maſters his defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

thinke, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thei tooke this cuſtom of the

y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> impoſition of hands that, that they

did the like vppon the litle chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
when he did praye. <hi>Math.</hi> 19.
And as I thinke, it was all to one
ende ordeined in the lawe: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
the Apoſtles, by the impoſition of
handes, did ſignifye, that they did of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
vnto God him, that they did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue
into the miniſterie, althoughe
they did vſe it likewiſe with thoſe,
vnto whom they did diſtribute the
viſible giftes of the holy Ghoſt. How
ſo euer it be, they haue vſed this ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnitie
as many times, as they did
ordeyne any body to the miniſterie of
the Churche, as we ſee by example,
aſwell touching the Paſtours and
doctours, as the Deacons. Now, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
there be no ſpecial commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement,
as touching the impoſition
of handes: yet notwithſtanding, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that we reade, that the Apoſtles
did vſe it continuallye, that which
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:12611:40"/>
they did vſe ſo diligently ought to be
vnto vs as a precept. And ſurely, it is
a profitable thing, to ſet forth to the
people the dignitie of the Miniſterie
by ſuche a Ceremonie, and to make
him know, that is thus ordeyned mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter,
that he apperteyneth no more
to himſelfe, but that he is dedicated
to the Seruice of God and of his
Churche. &amp;c. Thus, ſeing that <hi>Caluin</hi>
doth confeſſe the impoſition of han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
to be ſo neceſſary for the miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of the Churche, and that it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued,

And if one ſhould ſpurre you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde,

that it hath beene deſtitute altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

that God did greatly afflicte the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites

yet did he neuer leue them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

would ſo haue geuen you ouer, as to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:12611:42"/>
want miniſters to comfort you in

What ſtayes you, that you doo
not go to them, ſeing that you haue
nothing to do with oures? And if you
ſay, that you haue done ſo, doo vs ſo

That with the heart one doth beleue

I knowe that you wil denye the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,</hi>

the eccleſiaſticall gouernment, which
you haue vſurped in manye places
with to great libertie of conſcience, &amp;
licence to doo euill, which is the very
death of the ſoule, as <hi>Saint Auguſtine</hi>

haue reſtored Fraunce to his olde
eſtate, then there wilbe more appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce

to preache the true worde of God,
then there is now. But in this eſtate
that ye are, although that God had
geuen you commiſſion (the which he
neuer thought) he would haue called
it backe, becauſe of your noble actes.
<hi>Theodoſius</hi> and <hi>Arcades,</hi> whiche in
old time were Emperours of <hi>Rome,
(L. ſi quis in tantam. cod. vnde vi.</hi>) did
eſtabliſh or make an Edict, that if the
true owner or lorde of a thing ſhould
vſe any force, or to ſeeke by the waye
<pb facs="tcp:12611:47"/>
of violence (without ſtaying for the
ſentence of the Iudge) to get poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his owne from another man,
yea, although the other had no right
to it, he ſhoulde not onely loſe the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion,

if it were founde, that he that did
enter by force, had no right to the

be condemned to geue as much more
of his owne vnto him, againſt whom
he had vſed the force, as the thinge
was valued at, that he ſought to
vſurpe. If one ſhoulde call you, my

               <p>FOr your defence you alleage no

you to ſowe this ſeede of ſedition.
You ſaye, that the fielde is great, and

you marke that, that doth folowe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwarde,
and to take the counſaile
of the wiſe: Chriſte doeth not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde
therefore, that euerye one
ſhoulde take his ſickle, and goe, and
cut downe other mennes corne. But
he ſayeth:<note place="margin">Mat. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>Praye the maſter of the

teache vs, that if we ſee anye eſtate
out of order, we ſhoulde praye to
God to redreſſe it: And in the meane
time we ought to correct and amend
our own liues: for if euery man were
<pb facs="tcp:12611:48"/>
for him ſelfe, God would be for vs all.
Yet, notwithſtanding this, it is not
reaſonable, that vnder the colour of a
good zeale, a ſeruant ſhoulde take in
hand an acte of ſo great importance,
without expreſſe commaundement
of his maſter, as it is ſaide. But now
that we are come to talke of your
good zeale (if it pleaſe you) let vs
knowe, if thoſe ardent flames of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
haue ſo inflamed you, that you
haue ouerthrowen the Chaires of the
negligent Paſtors and Biſhops, and
in their roomes ye haue collocated
your miniſters in euery place, where
ye could beare any ſwaye, as it doeth
appere in many townes and Cities
in this Realme. I doo not doubt, but
that you will doo the beſt that ye can
to doo the like with the reſt, I mean,
aſwell Temporall as Spiritual. For
eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as God (of whom ye ſpeake ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten)
doeth make no exception of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
euen ſo you, that call your ſelues
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:12611:48"/>
his Lieuetenants wil make no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betwene the euyl eſtates &amp; the

adminiſtration of iuſtice is very ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable

be many in this vocation that would
not for any thing do any wrong vnto
the widowe &amp; fatherleſſe childe, and
yet we ſee and knowe by experience,
that ther are many others that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any conſcience, doe take brybes
and offer wrong, both to the father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
and to the widowe, the whiche
crimes are no leſſe in that eſtate, then
the careles liuing of the Biſhops and
Paſtors. So that I thinke by this,
that he that hath geuen you charge
and power to turne the Byſhops out
of their ſeates, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Curates out of their
benefices, and the Monkes &amp; Abbots
out of their Abbeys, becauſe of their

Knightes, Iudges and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
<pb facs="tcp:12611:49"/>
becauſe of the corrupt liues of
many of them. And to make an ende
of the reformation, your holy Ghoſte,
and thoſe zealous flames of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite,
woulde moue you to goe a litle
higher: for there is nothing done, but
the ſpirite may amend it. Againſt the

but that there hath beene and are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
ill princes that do gouerne their

And if by chaunce your Goſpell ſhuld

is more then a woorſhipper of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doles,

the line of <hi>Dauid,</hi> by whom God

that there is one God in Trinitie of

That if that our Churche had not

that my name be knowen ouer al the

that their doctrine was not new: for
when they began to preache, vnto the

                  <note place="margin">Act. 14.</note> This doctrine was not

doth proteſt, that he doth teach
them no newe thing, but rather him
whom they did worſhip, and did not
knowe. By the which it is plainelye
to be ſeene, that the Apoſtles did not
announce vnto the people any newe
lawe, for it was verye olde, and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding,
they did confirme it
with miracles. And if you ſaye, that
although thoſe learned Philoſophers
had a knowledge of God, as it doeth
appere by their workes: yet there is
founde in them no mention of <hi>Ieſus
Chriſte,</hi> and therfore, that it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary

And although that their doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
was newe and vnknowen to
the Gentiles, yet you cannot alleage,
that it was ſo vnto the Iewes: for
they being ſtudied &amp; learned in <hi>Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>

the Prophetes. Doeth not <hi>S. Paule</hi>

to preache the Goſpel, the which God
promiſed by the holye Scriptures. <hi>S.

S. Peter</hi> ſaith afterwarde: All the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes
that haue beene from <hi>Samuell</hi>
vnto this time, doo announce vnto
you theſe dayes, that is to ſaye, the
doctrine that we doo preache. That
that the Apoſtles did preach vnto the
Iewes, that is to wit, the remiſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of

of <hi>Chriſte,</hi> it was no newe thing: for

the Prophetes haue witneſſed, that

he had layed vpon his ſonne all oure

of our Redeemer, and of the gal,
the Iſope, and the Vinager. <hi>Daniel</hi>
did not onely diſcrye the death of
our Sauiour, but therewithall, the
verye time that he ſhoulde come. And
to be briefe, all the Prophetes haue
announced vnto the Iewes that,
that the Apoſtles did preache vnto
them. Nowe, if we deſire to knowe
why this olde doctrine preached, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
to the gentiles as to the Iewes
by the Apoſtles, was confirmed
with many miracles, which they did
in the name of God, who ſent them,
the cauſe is this: the deuill had ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured
and hidden the truth ouer all
nations, that ſuperſtitious Idolatrye
had taken place in ſteede of the true
ſeruice of God, ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> poore Painims
did not put their truſt in one God,
but in a multitude of goddes. And in
like maner, the true religion geuen by
god to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iſraelites, had ben troubled,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:12611:63"/>
and almoſte cleane aboliſhed by the
traditions of the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes,
in the which they did truſte, for

yee are content to matche vs
with the ſuperſtitious Iewes, and
Idolatrous Paynims, plating your
ſelues in the degree of the pure Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellers,
and the true children of God,
taking vppon you the Succeſſion
of the Apoſtles, and calling youre
Congregation, the true Catholike
and Apoſtolicall Churche. This
ſoundes notablye well, but ſeeing
that youre cauſe is abſolutelye to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourme
the Churche, as they didde,
preaching the auncient doctrine of
God, as they did, and dealing with
ſuperſtitious Idolaters, that cleaue

then vnto the pure worde of god, as

               <p>YOu doo coniure vs by the name of

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:12611:64"/>
occaſion as I will ſhewe by this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
that doeth folowe, I am ſure
that you are not ignorant, howe that
<hi>Luther,</hi> after he began to preache, his
Goſpell was not founde barren: for
immediatlye after his beginning, he
did ingender another Goſpeller, that
is to wyt, <hi>Andrew Coralſtadius,</hi> and
from thence was produced another,
called <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> &amp; of <hi>Zuinglius, Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colampadius.</hi>
Then, <hi>Thomas Munce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi>
conſidering, that he had no leſſe
the gifte of the ſpirite then the reſt, he
began to forge a newe Goſpell of the
<hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which he thought
to gratifye the Towne of <hi>Milhouſe,</hi>
who had receaued alreadie the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
of <hi>Luther.</hi> But the Senate of
that Towne, being weried alreadye
with to many ſtraunge Goſpels, they
aduertiſed <hi>Luther</hi> your fyrſte Apoſtle
of it. And he wrote to them againe,
that <hi>Thomas Muncerus</hi> ought not to
be receaued, if he could not proue his
<pb facs="tcp:12611:65"/>
vocation by ſome miracle. And if you
demaunde where I haue founde
this, I ſaye to you, not in the workes
of ſome lying Papiſt, but in the
Commentaryes of youre deere Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriographer
maſter Sleydon,<note place="margin">Li. 8. fo. 4.</note> who
hath ſo good a grace in his writing,
and is ſo moued with the trueth of
his ſpirite, that he doth omit nothing
in his Hiſtorie, but that, that doeth go
agaynſt himſelfe, and the profeſſours
of his religion. I doo wiſhe thoſe
that doo vnderſtande the Latine, to
reade this aunſwere of <hi>Luther</hi> in the
Commentaries them ſelues, and for
the reſt, I will ſet it forth, tranſlated,
not by me, but by a miniſter of youre
owne ſect, called <hi>Robert Preuoſt,</hi> who
dwelleth in a ſegnorie of <hi>Berne.</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his tranſlation, the wordes
are theſe. <hi>Luther was of opinion, that
the Senate of Milhouſe ſhould do very
well and wiſely, to demaunde of Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer,
who had geuen him commiſsion
to teache, and who had called him vnto
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:12611:65"/>
it. If he ſay, that it is God, let them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde
of him, to ſhewe ſome ſigne or
miracle to proue his vocation: and yf
he could not do it, that they ſhould ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhe
him: for it is common to God, to
declare his will by ſome miracle, at
any time when he will haue the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
cuſtome and order chaunged.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe are the wordes of <hi>Luther.</hi> We
ought to yeelde that that is right to
euery body, and not depriue any man
of the praiſe that he doth deſerue. And
ſo I ſay, all the Catholike Churche is
bound to geue prayſe and thankes to
<hi>Luther,</hi> for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> memorable good &amp; wiſe
counſel that he hath geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for he hath
taught vs, how we ſhal expel &amp; ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw,
not only y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hereſies that he did
preache vnto vs, but likewiſe yours, &amp;
thoſe of all the reſt. For if it be ſo, that
euery time that god will chaunge the
ordinarie cuſtome (ſuche as ours) to
an extraordinarye (ſuche as yours)
there ought miracles to be ſhewed by
<pb facs="tcp:12611:66"/>
thoſe that come extraordinarily. By
this good &amp; godly aduiſe, we knowe,
that <hi>Martin Luther,</hi> nor none of you
all, which doo come extraordinarily,
as he did, do come from God, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from the prince of darknes. <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin</hi>
doth confirme this opinion of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
as touching the vocation of the
miniſterie: for vpon the thirde Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>S. Luke,</hi> in his harmonie, he do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
ſay thus, <hi>None ought to attribute
vnto himſelfe by authoritie any office,
foraſmuch as it is great temeritie: ſuch
perſons did nothing of them ſelues ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
it were, being called to it by God.</hi>
Of this we gather, we ought to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe
nothing of our ſelues: for if
that the great Prophets haue atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to be called of God, what are
thoſe, that in theſe dayes take it vpon
them of them ſelues, we ought to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere,
that they are preſumptuous fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes.

vnto this, which is a notable waye
to deceaue the ſimple and vnlearned,
I ſay, that if the alleaging of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
ſhoulde maynteyne you, and
fauoure your cauſe ſo muche as you
doo ſaye, our ſyde were driuen to
harde ſhiftes: for then we might bee

but likewiſe, for refuſinge the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
of diuers heretikes that haue
beene manye hundred yeeres before

the Scriptures, as it doeth appere
by the three paſſages written vnto

to verifye, that the mercye of

God was denyed vnto him, that did
offende after his Baptiſme, ioyned
with that that is written in the fyrſt
booke of the Kinges. <hi>If man</hi> (ſayde
the good <hi>Helye) doeth ſinne agaynſt
man, he maye agree with him agayne:
but yf he come to offende God, who
ſhall he be that ſhall praye for his ſinne?</hi>
Did not the <hi>Arrians</hi> alleage Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
to maynteyne, that Chriſte
was not God and manne? Yes ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye,
as manye places or more then
the Catholikes. <hi>Saint Auguſtine</hi> doth
write in his booke <hi>De haereſibus, ad
Quoduultdeum,</hi> That there was
in his tyme a certayne ſecte of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes
that taughte, that for a man
to be ſaued, he ought to be gelded.
And they did alleage the nynetenth
Chapiter of <hi>Saint Mathewe,</hi> where
<hi>CHRISTE</hi> doeth prayſe the
Ennuches, whiche haue gelded
theym ſelues for the Kinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb facs="tcp:12611:68"/>
of heauen. And if a man were
diſpoſed to forge another hereſye like
this, he might ſoone finde ſcripture to
mainteyne it, being yll interpreted: for
he doth commaund, that we ſhoulde
pull out our eyes, and to cut off our
handes and feete euerye time, that
through them we are ſcandalizated:
for (ſaith he) it were better for one to
enter blinde or lame into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of heauen, then to be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
hauing all our members: ſo that,
taking theſe words as they are plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
written, we ought to cut the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
from our body. Beſydes this, he
that would forge an hereſie ſomwhat
more pleaſaunt and eaſye, one might
ſoone doo it: the which is, that for to
go to Paradiſe, we haue no neede of
hoſe, ſhoes or money, becauſe that our

foraſmuch as our Sauiour hath ſaid,

but we muſt turne the other
cheeke alſo. <hi>Iouinian</hi> a great heretike,
did teache, that a Chriſtian after his
baptiſme doth no more offende God,
yea, that he coulde not, although he
would. Who would not hate ſuche a
blaſphemous error as this? yet if the
alleaging of the Scriptures ought
to ſuffiſe, he maye be preferred before
maſter <hi>Caluin</hi> as more auncient: for
he doth alleage <hi>S. Iohn</hi> in his fyrſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle,<note place="margin">Cap. 5.</note>
who ſaith: <hi>We knowe, that he
that is borne of God, doeth not ſin, for
<pb facs="tcp:12611:69"/>

him, and the yll ſpirite ſhall not touche

Euery man that is borne of God,
that is to ſaye, baptiſed, he doeth not
ſinne, for the ſeede of God doth dwell
in him, and he cannot ſinne, for he is
borne of god. <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> doth write
in his .89. <hi>Epiſt. ad Hilarium,</hi> that the
<hi>Pelagians</hi> and <hi>Maniches,</hi> amonge o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

The which doctrine is eaſily to

vnderſtoode:<note place="margin">Math. ca. 10. &amp;, 16.</note> for our Sauiour doth

a greater errour then this, and
more brutiſhe, the which is, that all
mens wiues ſhould be common, and
they did call this the true Goſpel, and
the pure worde of God, alleaging for
it the fyrſt &amp; eyght of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> where
God doth ſaye: Increaſe and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plye,
and repleniſhe the earth. If you
doo ſaye, that this is a fooliſhe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
I confeſſe it to be ſo: but that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Churche which hath condemned
this hereſye of theirs, doeth likewiſe
condemne yours. When the deuil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
to fight with Chriſte, he
thought he could in no wiſe ayde him
ſelfe ſo well, as with the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
perſwading him, that the beſt
way for him to ſhewe him ſelfe to be
the ſonne of God was to breake
his necke, caſtinge himſelfe downe
from the Pinnacle of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Temple.
<pb facs="tcp:12611:70"/>
And he did alleage this text
ſaying,<note place="margin">Pſal. 90.</note> as it is written: That the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels

that he ſhoulde not hurt his foote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the ſtones, folowing that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi>

then the Bible.</p>

the Councell that the Apoſtles helde
at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> being preſent the holye
Ghoſte, this ordinance was made, as
we reade in the .15. Chapter of the
Actes. And if that one ſhould take in
hande to bring all the places of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that the heretikes haue alleaged
to mainteyne their opinions, I dare
boldly ſaye, that he ſhall fynde it an
endleſſe piece of worke. For amonge
ſo great a number of falſe prophetes,
there hath bene very fewe, or almoſte
none, but they haue ſought to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne
their opinions by Scripture,
drawing the places, as it were by vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence,
to a depraued and a corrupte
ſenſe, being this the maner of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting
<pb facs="tcp:12611:71"/>
of the Scriptures, called at
this day the pure worde of God, by
thoſe that haue profeſſed to be as long
as they liue, enemies to the trueth.
The learned and auncient Doctour
<hi>Epiphanius,</hi> in his fyrſt booke againſt
hereſyes, doeth alleage, as touchinge
this matter, a verye familier exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
ſaying, that if ſome good Caruer
had made the Image of a king, ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with manye Iewelles and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
ſtones, and that another ſhould
come afterward, and ſhould take the
ſame Iewels &amp; precious ſtones, and
make with them the Image of a
Foxe or a Dogge, and that he ſhould
ſaye: Beholde, here is the Image of
a king, woulde not euery body laugh
him to ſcorne, and ſay, that he did it in
mockerie, or els, that he were mad?
Yes ſurely: for although they be the
ſame Iewelles, and that very ſtuffe,
wherewith was made the Image
of the kinge, yet, becauſe that this
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:12611:71"/>
other workeman hath taken them
awaye, and faſhioned them after
another ſorte, it ought no more to be
called the Image of a king, but the
picture of a foxe or a dogge. Euen
thus is it with the holye Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
whiche were lefte vs by the
Apoſtles and Prophetes, for to paint
in riche coulours the Image of the
great kinge of glorye: but ſeeinge
that you take thoſe precious ſtones
from the Image of this kinge,
and doo appropriate them vnto the
Image of a foxe, making them ſerue
to cloake youre hereſyes withall, it
ought no more to be called the worde
of God, nor the holye Scripture,
but the woorde of menne, and falſe
doctrine. And therefore, yf you will
haue it to beare the fyrſte name,
you muſt ſet it in the fyrſt eſtate, that
is to ſaye, that it ought to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted
by him, that did firſte indite it.
<pb facs="tcp:12611:72"/>
It is not by the will of man, ſayth <hi>S.
Peter. Epiſt. 2. Ca.</hi> 1. That the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
was brought, but by the inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the holy Ghoſte, that holye per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
haue ſpoken. &amp;c. I knowe well,
that you attribute the intelligence of
the Scripture vnto your Sinagog:
But howe ſhall we beleue, that the
holy Ghoſte doth dwell more in you,
then in all the vniuerſall Churche,
which hath continued from the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of Chriſt, vntil this time? I pray,
doo ſo much as aunſwere me, if you
my maſters be the lodging of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
Ghoſte, where did he make his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence
before ye were borne? I know
already your aunſwere, the which is,
In the heartes of the faithfull. And
where were thoſe faythfull? Marye,
where the holy Ghoſte was. Anſwer
thus ſtill, and ye ſhalbe ſure, that ye
ſhall not be ouertake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: for it is as good
as to playe <hi>Handie dandie,</hi> and ſo ye
ſhall accompliſhe the olde Prouerbe,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:12611:72"/>
the which ſayeth: It is as farre from
Douer to Caleys, as from Caleys to
Douer. But to the ende that all the
worlde may ſee the great hazarde of
eternall damnation that thoſe runne
into, that are ſo ready to beleue euery

               <p>THe Catholike Church continually

this, diuers Miniſters and

conſiſtoryes of <hi>Valentinus, Photinus,
Manes, Theodorus, Neſtorius, Apolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naris,
Eutichus, Macharius, Eutioche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
beſydes a great number of other
famous heretikes that I cannot here
name, haue ſought to teache the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarye,
ſaying, that they were ſent
from him that ſent the Apoſtles, to
refourme the Churche, not by the
Traditions of men, which you call
Papiſticall, but by the pure worde of
God. For euen like you, my maſters,
did <hi>Valentinus</hi> and his felowes begin
the refourmed Churche, taking vpon
them the correction of all the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
and Fathers in times paſt,
ſaying that they did abuſe the people,
becauſe that they taught, that Ieſus
Chriſte had taken fleſhe and bloud
of the Virgin Marye, ſaying, that
this was a great errour: the whiche
ought to be refourmed, and that the
people ſhoulde beleeue, that he
brought his bodye from heauen,
<pb facs="tcp:12611:74"/>
and that he cauſed it to paſſe through
the wombe of the virgin Marye, as
the water doth through the chanell.
This Goſpell was very ſtraunge, yet
the ſaide <hi>Valentinus</hi> did not want
Scripture, as you haue to confyrme
it, interpreting it, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as you do inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prete
here in Fraunce. He did alleage
for his text the thirde of <hi>Iohn,</hi> where
Chriſte doth ſaye: <hi>No perſon is aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to heauen, but he that did deſcende
from heauen.</hi> And therefore did he
mainteine, that ſeing Chriſt is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
and deſcended from heauen, that
he tooke no fleſhe of the virgin Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye.
<hi>Neſtorius</hi> another notable here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike,
did linke his Goſpel to <hi>Apollina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi>

GOD: for ſeeing (ſaide <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollinaris</hi>)
that this man is deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

he tooke no fleſhe of the virgin: and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:12611:74"/>
beſydes this,<note place="margin">Ioh. 6.</note> Chriſte ſaith: I am deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended
from heauen, not to doo my

he doeth not ſpeake, as one that is

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted

into another: he did fortifie his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
with another text, where <hi>S. Iohn</hi>
doth write of the mariage at <hi>Canaa,</hi>
where the water was chaunged in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
wine, that is to ſaye, as touching
the verye ſubſtaunce of the water,
which was turned into wine: Euen
ſo ſayth he, that it became at the very
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:12611:75"/>
Incarnation of Chriſte, alleaging
that that we haue ſayde, And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word
was made fleſhe. <hi>Arrius,</hi> whiche was
the moſte famous heretike that euer
hath beene, did pretende to verifye an
other Goſpell: and his was, that our
Sauiour Chriſte had not taken at
his Incarnation, a perfecte ſoule, as
other men haue, but that he had only
a body, and that his diuinitie did ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plye
the abſence of his ſoule. Of this
opinion was <hi>Apollinaris, Theodorus,
Moſsneſtenus:</hi> and <hi>Neſtorius</hi> came
after, and they did blame the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Churche, becauſe it did teache
the ſayde vnion, called, as I haue
ſayde, <hi>Hipoſtaticque,</hi> that is to ſaye, of
the two natures in one perſon. And
they did alleage for their argument
a very ſubtill reaſon, the which was,
that God did inhabite within the
body of our ſauiour, as he did within
a Temple, that is to ſay, by grace, and
<pb facs="tcp:12611:76"/>
not by being vnited together. And
therefore, euen as it were a great fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye,
to ſay that God is a Temple, that
ſo it is to ſaye, that God is a manne.
This Goſpell did ſeeme verye newe,
yet did not they want Scripture to
mainteyne it, and that more plainer,
then euer I coulde ſee anye place, to
mainteyne your hereſyes. Chriſte did
ſaye vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iewes:<note place="margin">Ioh. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Vndoe this Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,

againe.</hi> He meant it by the Temple of
his bodye, ſaith <hi>S. Iohn.</hi> Then the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye
of Ieſus Chriſte is the Temple of

this be not a notable argument
to deceaue the ſimple man that is not
vſed to reade howe the doctours ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounde
theſe hard places. And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer
they did alleage <hi>S. Paule</hi> in the
fyrſt to the <hi>Coloſsians,</hi> where he doth
ſaye, that the plenitude or fulnes of
diuinitie doth dwell in Ieſus Chriſte
corporally, they doo alleage this place

your holye prophetes: they haue beene
condemned as heretikes by the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Councels, you are ſo likewiſe.
They did appeal vnto the pure word
of God, you doo the like: Yet are they
proued to be falſe cogging knaues,

you, vppon what grounde ſhall we

made Chriſt loſe his inheritance, ſpred
ouer all the worlde, to come to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned
only in <hi>Affrick,</hi> &amp; there only to
remayne? We put the like queſtion to
<hi>Caluin, Beza, Virett,</hi> and the reſt, that
it may pleaſe them to tell vs, if that
by chaunce they haue ben aduertiſed,
through what occaſion our Sauiour
Chriſt hath loſt his inheritaunce, that
is to ſaye, the Churche ſpread ouer all
the worlde, to remaine nowe in the
latter dayes, with a company of rude
Swizers, or in two or three corners
beſydes, and not among the reſt, (for
there is a great number of good Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes)
what badge can ye ſhewe,
or what ſigne to make vs know, that
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:12611:80"/>
you are the ſucceſſors of the Apoſtles
of Chriſte? If that the Scriptures
that you alleage, ought to be a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
proufe, we are content to accepte
it, if you will be content to graunt
the like vnto the abouenamed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes,
whiche haue fortifyed their
campe with as manye places more,
then you doo alleage. Nowe if that
(notwithſtanding the Scriptures
by them alleaged) you doo condemne
them as heretikes, becauſe that they
did interprete them contrary to that
that the Churche doth teache (and to
ſay truth, you can imagine no other
excuſe) to what purpoſe doo you take
vpon you the names of Catholikes,
ſeeing that you commit the like of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence?
The diuerſities of thoſe old he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſyes
grounded vppon the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
yll interpreted, doo teache vs,
that we ſhoulde not permit the noyſe

of the refourming of ones maners,
there is no neede to regarde, whether
the doctrine be newe or olde: for (as
the Apoſtle ſayth) let euery man take
it to his owne ſenſe: but when it is to
be talked of, as touching ones fayth,
the Catholike ought greatlye to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
of ſinguler interpretations, and
to holde them as very ſuſpitious. He
ought to folowe the ſentence that is

Catholike Churche, without making
any accompt of all theſe new deuiſes:
for euen as, when one will repaire an

the Sceipture, not altogether to the

And in like maner <hi>Daniell, Moyſes</hi> &amp;
<hi>Aaron</hi> with al the reſt of the prophets

ſeeing that Chriſte came at the verye

ſayde vnto the Iewes, that the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures

yet to ſay the truth, if he had done no
other but this, he had not fully appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
his vocation, to condemne their

vnto him: We know well, that by the

about this time, foraſmuche as the
Scepter of this kingdome is taken

this a good conſequence: the Meſſias
ought to come about this time, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is I? No no, ſhewe vs your

Go your wayes (ſayde Chriſte) and

the lame do walk vpright, the dumbe
ſpeake, the deafe heare, the lepers are
cured, the dead are raiſed againe, and

is as much to ſay as, tell <hi>Iohn,</hi> that I

And to conclude this matter,
the ſayde <hi>Weſtfal.</hi> doth ſay, that the

he doth marche, geuing the
vauntward vnto the martyrs of the
Calueniſtes that haue ſuffered at <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neua.</hi>
So that if one demaund of the
Lutherans, whyther goe thoſe that
dye in the religion of Caluin, of Beza,
or of the Anabaptiſtes? they ſaye, To
the Diuel. And if one demaund of the
Calueniſts in like maner, Whither go
the Anabaptiſts and the Lutherans?
they ſay in likewiſe, To the diuel. And
who would put the like queſtion to
the Anabaptiſts, I am aſſured they
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:12611:90"/>
would ſay as the others, To the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel.
For my part I beleeue you, I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
you, all three, And ſeeing that ye
agree ſo wel, that one ſerue for an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

when he ſaid, This people do ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor

this ſentence is contrarie to the other,
if you do not vnderſtand it as I haue

as a Ruffian takes great pleaſure to

ſo it is of al other ſinnes. But with
al this a man may not affyrme truly,

the fruite is good, although the

to ſtay vntill your ſtomacke be

but if one doo graffe vpon it ſome
Crabſtocke or ſome other kynde of
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:12611:93"/>
wilde fruite, the tree can beare no
other but Crabbes or wyldinges:
Euen ſo we Chryſtian perſons, who
are the trees of God planted by the
pleaſaunt fountayne of his grace,
and purged with the holy water of
Baptiſme to beare fruite at our ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
ſo that we take euer to proſpet
withall, the dewe of his grace that
planted vs, I meane, the fayth of our

beare good fruite, as it is ſayd before,
alleaging the 3. of <hi>S. Iohn,</hi> yll vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode
by <hi>Iouinian,</hi> He that is borne of
God doth not ſinne, for the generation
of God doth preſerue him, &amp; the eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
of our health ſhal not touche him.
And in the ſayde Chapter he ſayth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne,
All men, or euery man that is
borne of God doth not ſinne, for the
ſeede of God is in him, and he can
not ſinne, becauſe he is borne of God.
By this it is not ment that Baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
(the which he doth cal the beeing
<pb facs="tcp:12611:94"/>
borne of God) doth take away from
man the power or libertie to do euyl,
for if he wyl degenerat from the grace
that he hath receaued by the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of regeneration, &amp; that in ſteede
of growing graft vpon the ſtocke of
the loue of God, which is the true life
that he will fructifie towards his
death and deſtruction, in this caſe he
is no more the ſonne of God, for as
Chriſte ſayth,<note place="margin">Iohn. 8.</note> If ye be the children of
Abraham, do the works of Abraham.
But as he doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue and hath this
good wyl, which was taught by the
Angel vnto the Shepheards, &amp; that
he doth continue, hauing the grace
that was inſpired in him by the holy
ghoſt at his baptiſme, ſo long he doth
not ſinne vnto eternal death, for the
generation of God, that is to ſay, the
grace receyued by this holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
doth ſo defend him, that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel

not able to preuayle agaynſt him,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:12611:94"/>
and as long as this good ſeede, which
is the word of god, doth dwel in him,
he cannot ſinne, and if he did ſinne, the
ſede would no longer remaine in him.
The holy ghoſt ſayth,<note place="margin">Sap. 1.</note> The wiſe man
ſhal refuſe the hypocrite and diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler,

that he ſayth, That he that is borne
of God doth not ſin, for it is as much
to ſay, as that one can not ſerue two
maſters, and that he that ſerueth god
can not ſerue the diuel.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 10.</note> For S. Paul
ſayth, You can not aſſiſt at the Table

Iuſtice and Iniquitie, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
Ieſus Chriſt &amp; Belial. And
he that doth loue this world declareth
him ſelfe an enemy vnto God. And a
little before he had ſayd, He that doth
<pb facs="tcp:12611:95"/>
commit ſinne, is the ſonne of the deuil,
the which doeth not affyrme, that a
ſinner cannot be the ſonne of God, if
he repent and do penaunce: but in the
meane while, he that is in actuall ſin,
or hath a minde to doo euil, is as then
not the ſonne of God, but the ſonne of
the deuill. The good tree doeth not
beare yll fruite: for although the fruit
doo rot or periſhe vpon the tree, that
corruption doeth not proceede of the
tree, but of the wormes, byrdes, or of
ſome other kinde of vermine: &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
when they ſaye, that by the fruite
we ſhall knowe the tree, and by the
workes the faith, this ought to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood,
when the fruite doth ripe in
ſeaſon, &amp; that it hath the naturall hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
and propertie of the tree. And
in a man, that he haue the influence of
the true fayth, and not otherwiſe: for
euen as the rotten fruite hanging vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the tree, doth not digreſſe nothing
from the good Stocke: euen ſo the yil
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:12611:95" rendition="simple:additions"/>
workes of vs that are Chriſtians,
ought not to ſtayne our holy and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike
religion. For the corruption of
our yll fruites commeth of our ſelues,
and not of our religion, the whiche
doth defende vs from doing that we
do, I meane, to ſweare, to blaſpheme,
to commit adultery, to doo anye man
wronge, or to offende God any way.
He that doeth deſyre then by the
fruit, to knowe whether the tree of
our religion be good, he ought not to
bende his eyes to looke vpon the rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
fruite, as if that were ſufficient to
proue the goodnes of the tree: but let
him looke vppon the good fruites,
Suche are all the Doctours, aſwell

that the matter falleth out ſo plainly,
I pray you be not ſo obſtinate, geue
place vnto the beſt to reforme the reſt,
for to be worſe then you I think none
can be founde. You my maſters, that
can make ſuch tedious ſermons, and
rayle at large againſt our Popes and

you ſet out gloriouſly the titles of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,

for if you marke well that that

that ye runne farre wide of the text,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:12611:100"/>
and the ſimilitude of the wolfe doth
full well appertayne vnto your mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie.
There he doth declare the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
that is betwixt the good ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herde
and the bad (which he doth call
<hi>Mercenarium</hi>) &amp; the wolfe. The good
Shepherde is he, that doeth hazarde
and venture his life for his flock: The
yll Shepherde is he, that taketh the
milke and the wool from the ſheepe, &amp;
letteth them rome without taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye
care to keepe them. The wolues
ſeeing them rome abrode, ſcatered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the flocke, doth deuoure all thoſe that
are yll kept. The good Shepherde is
our Sauiour Chriſte and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
and all the good Biſhops that
did floriſhe in olde time, and al the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
Confeſſors and martyrs that haue
liued in the golden age, when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bloud
of our Sauiour Chriſte was yet hot
boyling in their heartes. The yll ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdes
haue folowed after, whiche
haue not cared for their ſheepe. The
<pb facs="tcp:12611:101"/>
wolues (which are the heretikes) ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this haue ſcatered the ſheepe out
of the fould of Chriſt, which is the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike
Church, where they had bene
borne ſpiritually, that is to ſaye, rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated
w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the grace of the holy ghoſt,
&amp; the Sacrament of baptiſme, to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the ſectes of perdition. If all our
Shepheardes had bene as carefull to
keepe their flockes as they ought to
haue bene, your Congregation had
neuer ben ſo ſtrongly builded as it is
at this day in Fraunce. And therefore
you offer your Churche (if it maye be
ſo called) great wronge, when you
ſpeake againſt the abuſes of ours, for
our ſinnes haue bene and are the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
foundation of your buildinge.
And euen as the worme is nouriſhed
in the Apoſteme with the yll humors,
euen ſo you feede of our faultes, and
are nouriſhed with our ſinnes, youre

woulde amende our liues, I knowe
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:12611:101"/>
howe ſoone your religion woulde de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caye.
And therefore our Paſtors are
not wolues, but they haue permitted
the wolues to deuoure their ſheepe,
and ſo they ſhall aunſwere for them
before the throne of the eternall
Iudge, who doth aduertiſe them by
the Prophete <hi>Ezechiell,</hi> that they ſhal
aunſwere for all the miſchiefes that
happen vnto their ſheepe, manye

               <p>ANd if I did not thinke, that it

I woulde ſet forth the reſt of our
Catholike doctrine, &amp; the confyrma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it by the teſtimonie of ſuche a

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:12611:104"/>

which haue ſuffered for our reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and that haue taught vs, both
by worde of mouth, and by writing,
all that we doo vſe at this daye, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
vs to liue and dye in it and for
it. I would haue you anſwere me vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this: Doo you thinke, that they be
in heauen or in hell? I know wel, that
meere ſcrupuloſitie of conſcience will
make you not expreſſe plainelye that,
that your works doo teache, and that
you will remit this queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God. But this is not to the
purpoſe, for I do not demaund of you
any abſolute aunſwere, as if you had
bene in heuen or hell to ſee it: but this,
to vtter in your conſcience, what you
thinke of thoſe that haue holden,
mainteyned and confeſſed our fayth
(whom you call Infidels and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious
Papiſtes) are they condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned?
If you ſay, yea, Then wherefore
was the bloud of Chriſte ſhed on the
<pb facs="tcp:12611:105"/>
Croſſe? it had bene better that he had
neuer ſuffred, if this were true. If you
ſaye, that God woulde be mercifull to
them, becauſe their error proceeded of
ignoraunce, and ſo, that he will haue
pitie of vs, becauſe of ours. But I
knowe, that you will ſay, that we are
nowe vnexcuſable, becauſe that wee
do refuſe the truth that you do preach.
By the ſelfe ſame reaſon our aunce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
can alleage before God no good
excuſe, foraſmuch as they do make no
accompt of the receauing of ſuch mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters

becauſe they woulde not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue
the Goſpell of <hi>Vigilantius,</hi> who
did euen as you doo preache, that we
ſhoulde not allowe the expoſition of
the doctours, nor honour the relicques
of Martyrs. <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> is likewiſe
condemned, becauſe he wrote &amp; prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:12611:105"/>
againſt the <hi>Arrians,</hi> who taught
as you do, that it is an offence to pray
for the dead. And to be briefe, if that
which you doo preach ought to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Goſpel and true word of God,
ſince the Apoſtles time ther hath bene
neuer a Chriſtian Doctour in the
Church: for they haue all taught the
contrarye to your forged Goſpell, as
euery man may ſee, that will take the

to reade thoſe places that are quoted
by me and diuers others that haue
confuted your hereſies manye a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
yeere agone by their authorities.
Let them then that haue any eyes,
beholde the hazarde that ye runne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
and ſo manye others throughout
the worlde, which folowe your opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
If one ſhoulde come to accuſe an<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>other
of falſehoode, and that before
he be aſſured of this matter, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he did ſeeke to attaynt the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendaunt,
woulde not one thinke
<pb facs="tcp:12611:106"/>
his matter verye great, or his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
very ſmall, to run headlong into
the daunger of that crime, which, if

that that was mentioned a litle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,

with them, which is, that the

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:12611:106"/>
nowe brought to light through your

more then halfe the value of

interpreting both their workes and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

And to the ende that no bodye
runne aſtray from the right path that
he ſhould folowe, the good Chriſtian
ought to fixe in his minde this reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
I mean, to ſerue God, and to liue
in the Catholike fayth, commonlye or
priuately: for when there is any que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
put, as touching the life, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

leade one to perdition, and the narow
waye doth guide vnto the port of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.
But if one ſpeake of religion,
the contrarye is verifyed: for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
way is the way of health, &amp; the
priuate way is the path of damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
The Prophete Dauid in the. 24.

he prayed god to teach him his waies

From whence come ſo many kinde of

here lay before you the worthy exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb facs="tcp:12611:134"/>
of the bleſſed martyr Sebaſtian,
by him brought of a loafe of breade to
Genſerichus then king of the Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dales,
a furious and a barbarous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
whiche breaking into Affrike,
they founde there many valiant cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayns
placed by the Emperour The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odoſius
the ſecond, for the defence and
ſauegarde of the countrey: amonge
the reſt was this Sebaſtian, by dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
an earle, and a couragious and
valiant captayne, who with the reſt
yeelding to the force of Genſericus,
was, as <hi>Victor de perſecutione Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalorum</hi>
writeth, for his great wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and valiantnes not ſo muche
beloued as feared of the king Genſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richus,
who being an Arrian, inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by colour of religion to work his
death. For Genſerichus knowing
Sebaſtian to be a ſeuere and a perfit
chriſtian man, conuented him before
the Arrian Biſhops, and vnder the
pretence that amitie and frendſhippe
<pb facs="tcp:12611:135"/>
might be the ſurer, and continue the
longer betwixte them, Genſerichus
moued him to become an Arrian, and
to profeſſe the ſame maner of beleefe
and religion, as he and his people
were of. For anſwere this holy mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr
Sebaſtian requeſted Genſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus
the king to commaunde a fyne
wheten loafe to be brought vnto him,
and taking it in his hande (and here
to omit many of his wordes and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
ſayinges) he requeſted the king
Genſerichus, to commaund the loafe
of breade to be broken in peeces, to be
ground, brought to flower, and boul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
afreſhe, to be ſeaſoned with water
and ſalte, and baked agayne, if then
it ſhould in the end proue better bread
then it was before he would not faile
to accompliſhe the king Genſerichus
his will &amp; pleaſure: but if it were not
poſſible by breaking of the loafe, and
baking of it againe, to better it, but to
make woorſe breade then before, he
<pb facs="tcp:12611:135"/>
wold not, nor could not conſent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto:
And in fine ſuffered death, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
defence of the chriſtian fayth &amp; religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
by him alreadye profeſſed and recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
rather then he would condiſcend
to the impayring, infringing or brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of any part therof. And ſo Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerichus
cauſed this bleſſed man Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſtian
to dye a holye Martyr. Thus
much I haue brieflye deducted out of
the hiſtory of Victor, to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> intent, that
ſo apte and familiar an example of ſo
