            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Narrative of the Proceedings of the Committee of the Militia of <hi>London,</hi> Concerning a <hi>Letter,</hi> in Part Reſolved to be ſent to General <hi>Monck,</hi> and the Officers under His Command in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THe Commiſsioners for the Militia of the City of <hi>London</hi> being met the third of <hi>November</hi> inſtant, at their ordinary place of meeting, a Draught of a Letter was produced, to be Addreſſed to General <hi>Monck</hi> and his Officers, Teſtifying Their diſlike of His Undertaking, and Raiſing Forces, which after a long Conteſt and Oppoſition made by a conſiderable Number of the Members of that Committee, Eminent for Eſtates and Intereſt in the City, was Reſolved on by a very ſmall diſproportion and odds of Votes, <hi>viz.</hi> two or three at the moſt; againſt which the ſaid Diſſenters Generally made Their Proteſtation, and many of Them in further Teſtimonie thereof Subſcribed Their Names in the Paper of the Committee; But no Reſolution being taken at that time, when the ſaid Letter ſhould be ſent, by whom, or how Directed, They appointed to meet the next day, to Treat further thereupon; being met, the Diſſenters comming with a very good aſſurance that They ſhould have been able to have laid aſide and prevented the ſending of any Letter of that Import by a far greater number of Members, whom the former Debates, and a more ſerious Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had made ſenſible of the danger and imprudence of ſuch an Application, deſigned for the diſcouragement of that Faithful and Generous Aſſertor of the Parliaments Right, the Liberties of the People, and the Government of the Common-wealth, by the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Civil Power, there was an indeavour by producing a Letter from the pretended Committee of Safety, to diſcharge that Committee from further Sitting, the Authority whereof was likewiſe diſowned, and Declared againſt by many, as inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to ſuſpend Their Sitting, Authorized by Act of Parliament: Notwithſtanding, upon a Solemn Promiſe, That the Letter ſhould not be ſent, or made publique; and at the Requeſt of the Lord Mayor, That They would give place to the Court of Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who had appointed to meet in the ſame Room, at the ſame Time, upon other Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, the Committee by mutual Conſent Adjourned themſelves: Now foraſmuch as the ſaid Letter, contrary to Promiſe, is publiſhed in Print, and probably may alſo be ſent to General <hi>Monck,</hi> leaſt the ſame ſhould be deemed the free and unanimous Act of the Committee for the Militia of <hi>London,</hi> it is thought fit to publiſh the Premiſes, with the Names of thoſe that carried on the Letter, as alſo of thoſe that diſſented, to the end that the City, who are beſt able, may Judge of the matter by the manner, and the men Reſpectively Engaged on either ſide.</p>
