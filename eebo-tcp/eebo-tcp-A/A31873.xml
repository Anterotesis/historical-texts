            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>Of giving
OFFENCE
TO
Weak Brethren.</head>
            <p>IT hath been often obſerved concerning our <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
Brethren,</hi> that when they are urged to
mention any one thing required of the People in
the Publick Worſhip of God in our Pariſh
Churches, judged by them abſolutely ſinful, on
the account of which their ſeparation from us is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,
and conſequently juſtifiable, they either put us off
with ſome inconveniencies, inexpediences or corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
(as they call them) ſome things appointed and uſed,
which in their opinion render our ſervice leſs pure
and ſpiritual; (the chief of which exceptions have been
conſidered in ſeveral Diſcourſes, lately written with
great temper and judgment for the ſatisfaction of all
honeſt and teachable minds:) Or elſe ſome of them tell
us, that they are indeed themſelves ſufficiently perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of the lawfulneſs of all that is enjoyned, they do
not ſee but a good Chriſtian may ſerve God acceptably
and devoutly our way, and may go to Heaven living
and dying in our Communion; but then there are
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52667:3"/>
many other Godly, but weaker Chriſtians of another per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion,
with whom they have been long joyned: And
ſhould they now, at leaſt totally, forſake them, and
conform, they ſhould thereby give great offence to all
thoſe tender Conſciences, which are not thus convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
of the lawfulneſs of holding ſuch Communion with
our Church, in Prayers and Sacraments, as is by Law
required. Which is a ſin ſo Heinous and of ſuch dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Conſequence, that our <hi>Saviour</hi> tells us, St. <hi>Matt.</hi>
18. 6. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall offend one of theſe little ones which
believe in me, it were better for him that a Milſtone were
hanged about his Neck, and that he were drowned in the
depth of the Sea;</hi> and in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> account it is no leſs
than Spiritual Murther, <hi>a deſtroying of him for whom
Chriſt dyed,</hi> Rom 14. 15.</p>
            <p>Now this Caſe of <hi>giving Offence to weak Brethren,</hi>
I have undertaken briefly to conſider, where I once
for all ſuppoſe (as all thoſe muſt do who make this
the ground of their refuſing to Communicate with our
Church) that nothing is amongſt us impoſed as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of Communion, but what may be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſin; for were any thing in it ſelf ſinful required by
our Church, there could be no room for this Plea of
<hi>Scandal:</hi> That alone would be ſufficient reaſon for Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
from us. I Diſcourſe therefore at this preſent
only with ſuch, who for their own particular could
well enough joyn with us, but dare not do it for fear
of <hi>Offending</hi> thoſe, who yet ſcruple and are diſſatisfied
at the uſe of our Prayers and Ceremonies.</p>
            <p>Nor do I deſign exactly to handle the whole
Doctrine of <hi>Scandal,</hi> or Elaborately explain all the
places of Scripture concerning it, or ſtate the Caſes
there treated of; Nor ſhall I now meddle with the
Duty of Governours and Superiours, how far they
ought to condeſcend to the weakneſs, ignorance, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52667:3"/>
and miſtakes of thoſe under their care and
charge; but I ſhall confine my ſelf to this one
Queſtion.</p>
            <p>Whether there doth lye any obligation upon any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Chriſtian (as the caſe now ſtands amongſt us) to
abſent from his Pariſh Church, or to forbear the uſe
of the Forms of Prayer and Ceremonies by Law appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
for fear of Offending or Scandalizing his weak Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren?</p>
            <p>Here I ſhall Firſt of all inquire, what is the true no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a <hi>weak Brother.</hi> Secondly, What it is to
<hi>Offend</hi> ſuch an one. Thirdly, How far and in what
inſtances we are bound to conſider the <hi>weakneſs</hi> of our
<hi>Brother.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, For the reſolution of this Queſtion it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to know, what is the true notion of a <hi>weak Brother.</hi>
Now a <hi>weak Brother</hi> or <hi>weak in Faith</hi> in Scripture de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes
one newly converted to Chriſtianity; and ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thorowly inſtructed in the principles, nor well ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in the practice of it, the ſame whom our <hi>Saviour</hi> calls
<hi>a little one,</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtle a babe in Chriſt.</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 1.</p>
            <p>Converſion to Chriſtianity is often called our new
birth, and conſequently at Mens firſt entrance into the
Chriſtian Church, they were for a while reckoned as in
an Infant ſtate; and accordingly were to be moſt tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
handled and nurſed, and gently uſed, with all favour
and indulgence, not driven faſter than they were able
to go; till by degrees, by the improvement of their
knowledge they came <hi>to be of full Age,</hi> as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>
expreſſeth it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 14.</p>
            <p>They were at firſt to be fed with Milk, to be taught
the eaſieſt and plaineſt Doctrines, againſt which
leaſt exceptions could be made; (as our Bleſſed <hi>Saviour</hi>
himſelf would not at firſt tell his Diſciples of the
ſhame and ſufferings he was to undergo, and when he
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52667:4"/>
did ſpeak of them it was covertly and obſcurely, ſo
that they did not perfectly underſtand him, leſt they
ſhould by it have been preſently diſcouraged and
tempted to have forſaken him;) no unneceſſary burdens
were to be laid upon them, which might render their
new Profeſſion grievous to them; every Stumbling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>block
and prejudice was to be removed out of their
way, that might occaſion their falling; the grown
Chriſtians and proficients were Charitably to conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend
to the capacity of theſe Novices, and make allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances,
and for a time bear with their Ignorance and
many miſtakes and Childiſh humours, and deny them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
their own Liberty, and become even as Children
with them, as if themſelves were of the ſame mind
and underſtood no better, than theſe raw beginners.</p>
            <p>Now theſe freſh Diſciples, little ones or Babes are
the ſame with thoſe St. <hi>Paul Rom.</hi> 14. calls <hi>weak Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi>
weak for want of Age or Growth, or as the
Original word rather ſignifies, Sickly and Feeble; like
a Man beginning to recover from a waſting Diſeaſe,
his diſtemper, tho cured, yet hangs a long time upon
him, the Dregs of it ſtill remain: He muſt for a while
be carefully attended and watched, ſince every little
thing diſcompoſes him, and hazards a relapſe. So was
it with theſe firſt Converts. As ſoon as ever they
were brought to acknowledg Jeſus to be the Son of
God, and were willing to become his Diſciples, they
were immediately Baptized, tho as yet they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
but little of the Nature or deſign of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.
The Apoſtles and firſt Preachers of our Religion
were in haſt to make more Proſelytes, and therefore
preſently Baptized all that were willing to it without
that previous Inſtruction and Preparation, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,
when Churches were ſetled, was made ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
before Heathens or Jews could be admitted by
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52667:4"/>
Baptiſm. Thus the ſame day the Apoſtles Preached
Chriſt to the Jews, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. they Baptized about three
thouſand of them, and <hi>Philip</hi> without any delay
Baptized the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> as ſoon as he profeſſed to believe
that Jeſus was the Son of God: and the Jaylor and
his Houſehold were Baptized the ſame hour at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night,
at which <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> ſpake unto them the
word of the Lord. After their Baptiſm they were to
be tutor'd and train'd up in their new Religion, where
great care was to be taken, great prudence and caution
uſed towards them, leſt they ſhould ſuddenly flie back
and repent of their change; for having been bred up,
and ſo long lived Jews or Gentiles, and then of a
ſudden turn'd Chriſtians, they retain'd ſtill a great
love and kindneſs for many of their old Cuſtoms and
Opinions, they had mighty and inveterate prejudices
to overcome, the Old man was by degrees to be put
off, and therefore they were at firſt treated with all
the tenderneſs and condeſcenſion imaginable, the
ſtronger and wiſer Chriſtians would not ſtand rigidly
on any little matters, would for the preſent tolerate
many things, which were neceſſary afterwards to be
done away, hoping that in time they might be better
taught, and be brought off thoſe miſtakes they now
Labour'd under.</p>
            <p>Had the Apoſtles in the beginning plainly told all
the Jews of the ceaſing of their Laws, the abrogation
of their Ceremonies and Worſhip, the no neceſſity
of Circumciſion, the taking in of the Gentiles, they
would never have born ſuch Doctrines, they would
never have become Chriſtians upon ſuch terms, nor
ever endured thoſe Teachers, who ſeem'd to make ſo
little account of <hi>Moſes</hi> and their Temple. Now to
gain theſe St. <hi>Paul</hi> became <hi>weak</hi> himſelf, tied up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
while amongſt theſe Jewiſh Converts to ſuch ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervances,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52667:5"/>
which he was really free from, as if he
had the ſame doubts and were of the ſame opinion
with thoſe <hi>weak</hi> Chriſtians, and adviſes all others who
did underſtand their Liberty, yet to oblige their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
by the ſame inoffenſive carriage.</p>
            <p>This then was the difference between the <hi>ſtrong</hi> and
the <hi>weak,</hi> the <hi>ſtrong</hi> were the well-grounded underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Chriſtians, that knew it was lawful for them to
Eat all kind of Meats, that Chriſt had ſet them free
from the burdenſome Yoke of the Jewiſh Ceremonies,
<hi>the weak,</hi> tho Brethren, that is, believers in Chriſt,
yet abſtained from ſome Meats, judging them unlawful
or unclean, and obſerved days, and Zealouſly retained
the Moſaical rites, not being yet ſufficiently inſtructed
in that Liberty our Saviour had purchaſed for them,
or in the nature of his Kingdom, which <hi>conſiſted not
in Meat or Drink, but in Righteouſneſs and Peace, and
Joy in the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Hence I obſerve,</p>
            <p>1. That the rules which are laid down in Scripture
concerning <hi>weak Brethren</hi> principally reſpect thoſe
times when our Religion made its firſt appearance in
the World, and were temporary proviſions for the
eaſier proſelyting men to the Faith of Chriſt, or the
better ſecuring and fixing thoſe that were already come
into the Church. They are not ſtanding Laws equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
obliging all Chriſtians in all Ages, but were ſuited
to the Infant ſtate of the Church, or rather to its
condition whilſt it was but an Embryo, till Churches
were formed and ſetled, and our Chriſtianity had got
firm Footing and Poſſeſſion in the World. Thus St.
<hi>Paul</hi> tells us, 1 Cor. 9. 19. <hi>For tho I be free from all
Men, yet have I made my ſelf ſervant unto all, that I
might gain the more. And unto the Jews I became as a
Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Law, as under the Law, that I might gain them
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52667:5"/>
that are under the Law. To them that are without
Law, as without Law (being not without Law to God,
but under the Law to Chriſt) that I might gain them
that are without Law. To the weak became I as weak,
that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all
men, that I might by all means ſave ſome. And this
I do for the Goſpels ſake, that I might be partaker
thereof with you.</hi> This was the Apoſtles deſign in all
theſe Compliances and Civilities to win many to the
Faith of Chriſt, by theſe wiſe arts to inſinuate himſelf
and his Doctrine into them: but when he had once
made his way, he then taught them another leſſon,
and behaved himſelf after a far different manner. Now
to do as St. <hi>Paul</hi> did, would always be the duty and
wiſdom of one in his circumſtances, who had his office
and was to propagate any Religion amongſt Heathens
and Infidels; like a Maſter that dealeth not ſo ſharply
with his Scholar at his firſt entrance into the School,
as he thinketh fit to do afterwards. But the directions
St. <hi>Paul</hi> gave, and according to which himſelf practis'd
at the firſt planting of Chriſtianity, do no more agree
with our times, wherein Chriſtianity is become the
National Religion, countenanced by the Civil Laws
and Authority, and ſo generally profeſſed by every one
amongſt us, that we hardly know of any other Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
than the ſame Cloaths we did wear in our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy
would ſerve us now when we are of full Age.</p>
            <p>We ought indeed to be very careful of Children,
and lead them by ſtrings, and remove every ſtraw and
rub out of their way, leſt they ſtumble and fall, but it
is ridiculous to uſe the ſame care towards grown men.
None of us Labour under thoſe prejudices the firſt
Chriſtians did, who forſook a Religion in which they
had been bred, and long lived; and as to the Jews had
left a way of Worſhip commanded them by God
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52667:6"/>
himſelf, confirmed to them by many Miracles and
Wonders, delivered to them from their Fathers by a
conſtant ſucceſſion of Prophets ſent from God. There
is not now amongſt us any ſuch competition between
two Religions, but every one learneth Chriſtianity as
he doth his Mothers Tongue. The Apoſtles there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
and Governours of the Church carried themſelves
towards theſe new Converts, as God Almighty did to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when he brought them
firſt out of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> He for a while led them by a Pillar
of Fire and of a Cloud, gave them Water out of the
Rock, and rain'd down Bread and Fleſh from Heaven.
This he did for them whileſt in their paſſage, thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily
provide for them, and in ſome caſes
even humour that People, leſt upon every little pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
they ſhould return back to the Garlick and Ony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of <hi>Aegypt;</hi> but after they were ſetled in the Land
of <hi>Canaan,</hi> he then left them in their own hands, by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Common means to take care of and provide for
themſelves, he did not ſhew the ſame indulgence to
them, as he did whilſt they were in the Wilderneſs.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> would not take that reward that was due
to him for Preaching the Goſpel, but himſelf Laboured
hard night and day, becauſe he would not be charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to his Converts, 1. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 9. and this he did
<hi>for the furtherance of the Goſpel,</hi> that all might ſee he
did not ſerve his own Belly. But ſurely our Diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Brethren do not think themſelves obliged by this
Example, in places where Publick maintenance is ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
on Miniſters by Law, to refuſe to take it, and
earn their own Bread by ſome manual occupation, tho
thereby they avoid giving offence to Quakers, and thoſe
who call them hirelings, and ſay they propheſie only
for filthy lucre.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:52667:6"/>
Thus it is uſually obſerved, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> writes
quite after a different manner to the Romans and to
the Galatians, tho upon the ſame ſubject. In his
Epiſtle to the Romans amongſt whom he had never
yet been, he pitieth and pleadeth for the <hi>weak Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
chargeth that they ſhould not be deſpiſed or caſt
off, that no cauſe of offence ſhould be given them,
but to the Galatians a People that had been fully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
in the nature of their Chriſtian Liberty, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
whom himſelf had planted the Goſpel, and
had been preſent in perſon, and ſo knew that they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
better; when ſome of them fell into the
ſame Error, thinking Circumciſion and the obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Moſaical Law neceſſary to Chriſtians, he
chides them ſharply and rebukes them more ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
<hi>Who hath bewitched you O fooliſh</hi> Galatians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
He who would condeſcend to the Ignorant Novices
amongſt the Romans, would not in the leaſt comply
with the Galatians, that had or ought to have had
more knowledge and light: and afterwards when the
reaſon of ſuch forbearance ceaſed, when the nation
of the Jews had rejected Chriſt, and the <hi>Gentile</hi>
world was come into the Church, the obſervation of
the Moſaical Law, and the diſtinction of meats con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
therein, was ſo far from being tolerated in thoſe,
whether Jews or Gentiles, who through miſtake
thought themſelves obliged to it, that it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
by the Rules and Canons of the Church.
The ſum of all this is, that whatever Argument may
be drawn from St. <hi>Paul's</hi> diſcourſes about <hi>weak Brethren</hi>
by way of Analogy, or Similitude, or Parity of
reaſon, yet there are no ſuch <hi>weak</hi> perſons now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
us, as thoſe were for whom the Apoſtle provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,
or as thoſe <hi>little ones</hi> were for whom our Saviour
was ſo much concerned.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:52667:7"/>
               <hi>2ly,</hi> I would deſire our Diſſenting Brethren to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
by what pretence they can challenge any privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
belonging to them under the notion of <hi>weak
Chriſtians,</hi> when according to their own opinion and
conceit of themſelves, they are of all men furtheſt off
from being ſuch in any ſenſe. This is as if a man
worth a Thouſand pound <hi>per annum,</hi> ſhould Sue in
<hi>formâ pauperis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They who take upon themſelves to be teachers of
others, wiſer and better than their Neighbours, the
only Sober and Godly party, and are too apt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe
all other Chriſtians as Ignorant or Prophane,
with what colour of reaſon can they plead for any fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to be ſhewn, or regard to be had to them in
complyance with their <hi>weakneſs?</hi> Tho they love to
argue againſt us from the example of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion
to the uninſtructed Jews or Gentiles, yet it is
apparent that they do not in other caſes willingly liken
themſelves to thoſe <hi>weak</hi> believers, or <hi>Babes in Chriſt.</hi>
They have really better thoughts of themſelves, and
would be Leaders and Maſters in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and preſcribe
to their Governours and give Laws to all others, and
do prefer their own private opinion (which they call
their Conſcience) before the Judgment of the wiſeſt
men, or the determinations of their Lawful Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours.
And if in all inſtances we ſhould deal with
them as <hi>weak</hi> perſons, turn them back to their Prim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
adviſe them to learn their Catechiſm, they
would think themſelves highly wrong'd and injured.</p>
            <p>If the ſeveral Diſſenters amongſt us did in good
earneſt look upon themſelves as <hi>weak,</hi> that is, Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
Wavering, half Chriſtians, did they think their
diſlike of the Conſtitutions of our Church to be the
effect of ſuch <hi>weakneſs,</hi> they would be either more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to hide it, or would more diligently ſeek out for
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52667:7"/>
remedy; they would be more modeſt and humble,
not ſo forward to judge and condemn what they do
not underſtand; they would not encourage one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to hold out and perſiſt in this their <hi>weakneſs,</hi> nor
breed up their Children in it, nor ſo Zealouſly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to inſtil the ſame prejudices and miſtakes into
all with whom they converſe. But the truth is, they
ordinarily look upon their oppoſition to the orders of
our Church as the effect of an higher illumination,
greater knowledg than other Men have attained unto,
they rather count us the <hi>weak</hi> Chriſtians, if ſome of
them will allow us ſo much; for otherwiſe if they do
not take us for the weaker and worſe Chriſtians; Why
do they ſeparate from us? Why do they aſſociate and
combine together into diſtinct Congregations, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
purer, more ſelect Chriſtians than others? Now
tho ſuch perſons as theſe may be in truth very <hi>weak,</hi>
of little judgment or goodneſs, notwithſtanding this
conceit of themſelves and their party, yet theſe are
not by any means to plead for indulgence under that
Character, nor to expect we ſhould forgo our juſt Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to pleaſe and humour them.</p>
            <p>And that this is nothing but the plain truth is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
evident from this one obſervation, that many
amongſt them will grant our Reformation to have
been very excellent and laudable for thoſe days of
Darkneſs and Ignorance wherein it was firſt made:
But we now, ſay they, ſee by a clearer light, have
greater knowledge, and have arrived to higher per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
and ſo diſcover and cannot bear thoſe faults
and defects, which before were tolerable. Now who
doth not ſee that theſe two pleas are utterly inconſiſtent
and deſtructive of one another? to deſire abatement
of the Ceremonies, and abolition or alteration of the
Liturgy in complyance with their <hi>weakneſs,</hi> and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52667:8"/>
the ſame becauſe of the greater knowledg and
light they now enjoy, above that Age wherein this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Conſtitution of our Church was eſtabliſhed. This
ſhews they will be either <hi>weak</hi> or <hi>ſtrong</hi> according as
it beſt ſutes with the Argument they are managing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
us; they are contented to be reckoned as <hi>weak,</hi>
only that on it they may ground a plauſible objection
againſt us</p>
            <p>3 Thoſe who are really <hi>weak,</hi> that is, Ignorant and
injudicious, are to be born withal only for a time, till
they have received better inſtruction. We cannot be
always <hi>Babes in Chriſt,</hi> without our own groſs fault
and neglect; he is ſomething worſe than a <hi>weak</hi> man
who is fond of, and reſolutely againſt all means of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
perſiſts in his Ignorance and miſtake. The caſe
of young beginners and Novices is very pittiable, who
have not been taught their leſſon, but the ſame conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion
is not due to thoſe, who are <hi>ever learning
and yet are never able to come to the knowledg of the
truth,</hi> not for want of capacity to underſtand, but for
want of humility and willingneſs to be inſtructed. Such
who are peeviſh and ſtubborn, whoſe Ignorance and
Error is Voluntary and affected, who will not yield
to the cleareſt reaſon, if it be againſt their intereſt or
their party, can upon no account claim the priviledges
of <hi>weak</hi> perſons.</p>
            <p>It is a great piece of inhumanity and cruelty to put
a ſtumbling-block in the way of a blind man, but he
walks at his own peril, who hath eyes and will not
be perſuaded to open them, that he might ſee and
chooſe his way. Thus our <hi>Saviour</hi> anſwered his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
when they told him that the <hi>Phariſees were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
at his Doctrine, Let them alone, they be blind
leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind,
both ſhall fall into the Ditch, St.</hi> Matt. 15. 14. They
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52667:8"/>
were reſolved not to be ſatisfied with any thing
our Saviour ſaid or did, they watched for an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
and ſought occaſion againſt him. It was
their Malice, not their Ignorance, that made them ſo
apt to be <hi>offended.</hi> Of theſe therefore our Saviour
had no regard, who were ſo unreaſonable and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
in their oppoſition.</p>
            <p>Not that I would be ſo uncharitable as to condemn
all, or the generality of our Nonconforming Brethren for
malicious and wilful in their diſſent from us. God
forbid that I ſhould paſs ſuch an unmerciful ſentence on
ſo many (as I believe) well meaning, tho miſerably
abuſed perſons, to their own Maſter they ſtand or fall.
But however,</p>
            <p>1. I would out of charity to them beg earneſtly of
them, that they would thorowly examine whether
they have Conſcientiouſly uſed all due means in their
power for information of their judgments concerning
thoſe things they doubt of; whether they have ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
endeavoured to ſatisfie themſelves, and have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly
Pray'd to God to free their minds from all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices
and corrupt affections, and have patiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
the grounds and reaſons of their Separation
from us; for unleſs it be thus really with them, their
<hi>weakneſs</hi> is no more to be pitied, than that mans Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
who might be cured by an eaſie remedy if he
would but vouchſafe to apply it, or would ſubmit to
good Counſel.</p>
            <p>2. I muſt ſay that old and inveterate miſtakes, that
have been a thouſand times anſwered and proteſted
againſt, are not much to be heeded by us. If peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
will by no means be prevailed upon, having ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
light and time allowed them, to lay aſide
their Childiſh apprehenſions and ſuſpicions, they can
hardly be thought to deſerve that compaſſion and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52667:9"/>
St. <hi>Paul</hi> preſcribes towards <hi>weak Brethren.</hi> I
ſhall give one plain inſtance. Let us ſuppoſe that at
the firſt Reformation of Religion amongſt us ſome
very <hi>weak</hi> (and ſuch they muſt be if honeſt) were
<hi>offended</hi> at the Church's requiring Kneeling at the
receiving the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, as ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to them to imply the adoration of the Bread and
Wine, and as likely to harden ſome Ignorant People
in that monſtrous conceit of Tranſubſtantiation: But
now after ſo many publick Declarations made by our
Church, wherein ſhe avows that no ſuch thing is
intended, after the conſtant profeſſion of ſo many,
that have uſed that decent Ceremony, that they abhor
the Doctrine of Chriſts bodily preſence, nay after the
couragious ſufferings, even death it ſelf, of thoſe that
firſt Eſtabliſhed this Reformation, rather than they
would worſhip the <hi>Hoſt;</hi> if after all this, people ſhall
ſtill clamour againſt this geſture as Popiſh, and be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
with thoſe that uſe it, as if thereby they gave di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
honour to the Elements, all that I ſhall ſay is this,
it is a great ſign that it is not infirmity only, to which
condeſcenſion is due, but ſomething worſe that raiſeth
and maintaineth ſuch exceptions and <hi>offences.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This I ſuppoſe holds true even in things where the
<hi>offence</hi> ariſeth from their doubtful or ſuſpicious nature,
that are capable of being miſunderſtood and abuſed,
and may be apt through miſtake to provoke or tempt
others to evil. Yet if there be no moral evil in them,
and the doing of them is of ſome conſiderable conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
or advantage to me, I am bound to forbear
them no longer, than till I have taken due care to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
others rightly of the matter, and warn them
of the danger, till I have endeavoured to rectifie their
judgments concerning the innocency of my action
and intention, and given them notice of the evil that
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52667:9"/>
might poſſibly by my action happen to them. If I
dig a pit, or lay a block in the way, whereby others
not knowing any thing of it are hurt and wounded,
here I ſtand chargeable with it, and am guilty in cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
them to fall; but if they are plainly and often told
of it, and being forewarned yet will run into the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
they are then only to thank themſelves, and it is
purely their own fault. Now if it be thus in caſes that
are liable to ſuſpicion and miſinterpretation, it holds
much more in our Ceremonies and the orders of our
Church, where the <hi>offence</hi> that is taken at them ariſeth
not ſo much from the nature of the injunctions, as from
mens groſs Ignorance, miſconceit or perverſeneſs. Thus
men are no longer <hi>weak</hi> in Scripture ſenſe, than they are
inculpably Ignorant, or which is all one, the Plea of <hi>weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
is gone, after that ſufficient inſtruction hath been
given or offered to them, and other allowances made
according to mens different capacities of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
This ſhall ſuffice for the firſt thing propounded,
to ſhew what is the true notion of a <hi>weak Brother.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2 I proceed to give you an account what it is to
<hi>offend</hi> ſuch an one. Becauſe I write for the uſe of the
Common people only, I ſhall not trouble them with
the ſeveral ſignifications of the <hi>Greek</hi> word which is
Tranſlated <hi>Scandal</hi> or <hi>offence,</hi> nor diſtinctly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the ſeveral places of Scripture where it is uſed, only
ſo far as plainly to ſhew, Firſt, that people are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
miſtaken in the ſenſe they have of it. Secondly,
What it is truly to <hi>offend</hi> or <hi>give offence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. That people are generally miſtaken about the
ſenſe of <hi>offending</hi> or <hi>giving offence.</hi> For by it they
commonly underſtand diſpleaſing or grieving another,
and making him angry with them, and ſo conſequently
they think themſelves in Conſcience bound to forbear
all thoſe things, which godly perſons do not like or
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52667:10"/>
approve of, or is contrary to their fancy and judgment.
It is notorious, that moſt of the ordinary ſort of <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters,</hi>
who aſſign this as the reaſon of their not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
to the Eſtabliſhed Laws of the Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
by doing ſo they ſhall <hi>offend</hi> their Brethren, mean
nothing elſe by it, but that they ſhall fall into diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
with, incur the diſpleaſure and provoke the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of thoſe, with whom they have held Communion
for a long time in religious exerciſes. They, good
men, will be mightily troubled and vexed to ſee or
hear ſuch a ſad thing, and this is taken by many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them for an heinous crime, even the ſame
which St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls <hi>Scandalizing a weak Brother,</hi> to
do any thing which may chance to put any of their
Godly Brethren out of humour.</p>
            <p>The occaſion of this falſe apprehenſion is in all
likelyhood the Ambiguity of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> word <hi>offend,</hi>
which is uſed in the Tranſlation of our Bibles. In
our Language it ſignifies to diſpleaſe, or to do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
which another diſlikes; but the <hi>Greek</hi> word,
which is ſo rendered, ſignifies to lay a ſtumbling block
in the way of another, which cauſes him to fall, or
to enſnare and deceive him into ſomething that is evil,
as I ſhall ſhew more largely preſently. We muſt not
therefore interpret the places of Scripture, where <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend</hi>
or <hi>offence</hi> are found, by the common importance
of the words amongſt us, but by the undoubted ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of the Original word, which all learned men agree
to have quite another ſenſe.</p>
            <p>It muſt not be concealed that there is one place in
the famous fourteenth chapter of the <hi>Romans</hi> that
ſeems to favour this popular conceit <hi>v. 15. If thy Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be grieved with thy meat, now walkeſt thou not
charitably,</hi> and it is the only one I know of that ſounds
this way, but ſurely it is more reaſonable, that this
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52667:10"/>
one verſe ſhould be interpreted by all the other places
of Scripture about this matter, than all the reſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
agreeably to this ſingle verſe. Nay it ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
appears that by <hi>grieving</hi> our Brother, is not
meant diſpleaſing him, or making him ſorry or ſad,
but wounding or hurting him, and ſo it is uſed to
denote, that which cauſes grief or ſorrow. For in the
very next words it follows, <hi>deſtroy not him with thy
meat for whom Chriſt died;</hi> and what is here expreſſed
by <hi>grieving</hi> is <hi>v.</hi> 13. called, <hi>putting a ſtumbling-block
or an occaſion to fall,</hi> and <hi>v. 21. it is good neither to eat
Fleſh, nor drink Wine, nor any thing whereby thy Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak;</hi> all
which ſignifie the ſame with being <hi>grieved.</hi> To be
<hi>offended</hi> or <hi>grieved</hi> is not to be troubled at what ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hath done out of pity and concern for his Soul,
but to receive hurt our ſelves from it, being by it
drawn or deceived into ſome ſin, and our own fall
occaſioned by what our Brother hath done, is that
which creates the grief and trouble. But becauſe this
miſtake doth ſo generally prevail amongſt many, as I
hope, well diſpoſed people, who think that they muſt
not do any thing, at which good men are diſpleaſed
or grieved, I ſhall offer theſe few things to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.</p>
            <p>1. That thus to cenſure and condemn the actions,
and to be diſpleaſed and angry with the perſons of
thoſe that differ from them, or refuſe any longer to
joyn with them in their Separate Congregations, is
a great inſtance of peeviſhneſs and uncharitableneſs,
and is that very ſin which St. <hi>Paul</hi> often warns his
<hi>weak</hi> believers againſt, <hi>viz.</hi> that they ſhould not raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
judge thoſe who knew their duty, and underſtood
their Chriſtian liberty better than themſelves. This
ſeems to be the ſame with that Argument the Papiſts uſe
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52667:11"/>
to perſwade men into, or to keep them in their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
as the ſafeſt way to Heaven; ſince they ſo
confidently damn all Men, whom, tho never ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly,
they thruſt out of their Church. Becauſe ſome
of our <hi>Diſſenting Brethren</hi> are ſo froward and unmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
in their cenſures, and ſo fond of their own way,
as to brand all that return to the Church with the
infamous names of Apoſtates, Time-ſervers, Men that
have made Shipwrack of Faith and a good Conſcience,
and have forſaken Chriſt for fear of Perſecution, and
the like, therefore all thoſe, who are convinced of the
lawfulneſs of Conformity, yet ought ſtill to continue
with them in their Separation, left they provoke and
irritate their anger and diſpleaſure againſt them; and
thus any company of men, that ſhall joyn together
and reſolve to quarrel with all that do not as they do,
or that ſhall leave their ſociety, muſt oblige all for
ever to remain with them, for fear of giving them
<hi>offence.</hi> If what I do is not evil in it ſelf, it cannot
become ſuch, becauſe another Man is cauſeleſly angry
with me for doing of it. Let but thoſe, who Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
from us, mortifie all pride and overweening opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of themſelves, and their own way, let them lay
aſide all Zeal of parties and little ſingularities, and
learn to judge righteouſly and ſoberly of themſelves
and others, and then the cauſe of all this <hi>offence</hi> will
be ſoon removed.</p>
            <p>2. they that pretend that this fear of <hi>offending,</hi> that
is, diſpleaſing their <hi>weak</hi> Brethren hinders their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance
with the Church, ought ſeriouſly to examine
themſelves, whether it is not really only the care of their
credit, and reputation with their party, that keeps
them from Conformity. They are loth to loſe that
ſhare they have in the affections of ſo many, or to
ſink in that eſtimation they have obtained of great
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52667:11"/>
Sanctity, by joyning with the ſtricteſt and pureſt
Chriſtians. For undoubtedly Mens reputation amongſt
a party is a very great temptation to detain them in
Error, and is a mighty prejudice to their underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and receiving the truth, or the doing of their Duty,
when it will expoſe them to reproach and opprobrious
nicknames. Thus our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſaid of the <hi>Jews,</hi> John
5. 44. <hi>How can ye believe, who receive honour one of
another, and ſeek not the honour that cometh from God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When therefore Men tell us, it will be a <hi>Scandalous</hi>
thing for them now to conform, they often mean no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe by it, but that it will be unhandſom, and
a diſgraceful thing for them to change their mind, and
confeſs their miſtake, and retract what they have ſo
long, and ſo Zealouſly defended. Or elſe let them look
well, that it is not ſome paltry ſecular intereſt, that
lies at the bottom, they dare not <hi>Offend their weak
Brethren,</hi> that is; they are afraid they ſhall loſe their
trade, they ſhall diſoblige many of their good
cuſtomers, they get their livelyhood by ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
and therefore they muſt continue of it. But
this is truly to become the ſervants of Men, ſuch as
theſe are the moſt rank Men-pleaſers, and therefore
it is good advice of <hi>Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>in his Cure of Church
diviſions,</hi> p. 141. <hi>Pleaſe men in al things lawful for
their good and Edification; and become all things to all
men in a lawful way: But depart not from the principles
or practice of Chriſtian <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, Communion, Charity
or Sobriety, to pleaſe a dividing hot brain'd Party,
nor to eſcape their ſharpeſt cenſures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. If to diſpleaſe our <hi>weak Brother</hi> were the ſinful
<hi>offending</hi> him, condemned by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> it would prove
an intolerable Yoke upon Mens Conſciences, would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
endleſs perplexities and difficulties, ſo that we
ſhould not be able to do any thing, tho never ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52667:12"/>
with a quiet and well aſſured mind, ſince as
the World now is, ſome one or other will in this ſenſe
be <hi>Scandalized</hi> at it. By doing we ſhall anger ſome,
by forbearing we ſhall provoke others; and ſince thoſe,
who call themſelves <hi>weak,</hi> are divided and ſhatter'd into
ſeveral Sects and Factions, each condemning all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
it is impoſſible for us to comply with any one of
them, but we ſhall thereby diſpleaſe all the reſt. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that would with a good Conſcience perform his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
in whatever place he lives, or relation he ſtands in,
muſt diſpleaſe both good and bad Men, as things now are
amongſt us. <hi>It is a very ſmall thing, as St.</hi> Paul <hi>tells
us, to be judged of Men,</hi> when they paſs their unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable
cenſures upon us, and our actions; and they,
who govern themſelves by the opinions and fancies of
others, can never tell whither they ſhall be led by
this principle. They are ſlaves to the Party they eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſe,
and muſt run with them into all the Folly and
Extravagance they can be guilty of; or if at laſt they
are forced to leave them, they ſhall in the end be more
hated and deſpiſed by them, than if they had never hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured
them at all.</p>
            <p>4. I add only, that according to this Rule, that we
muſt not do any thing which may diſpleaſe or grieve
our <hi>weak Brethren,</hi> we do in effect ſubmit our Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Conſciences to the conduct of the moſt ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
and injudicious Chriſtians, and yield to them
that Power and Authority over us, which we deny to
the Magiſtrate and our Lawful Superiours; and it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but ſeem a very hard caſe, that they who are ſo
tender of their Chriſtian liberty, and think it ſo
highly infringed and violated by the determinations
of their Superiours about indifferent matters, ſhould
yet ſuffer themſelves to be thus ſtraitly tied up by the
wills and paſſions of their <hi>weak Brethren. If this
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:52667:12"/>
were ſo,</hi> ſaith Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> p. 134 of the forenamed
Book, <hi>the moſt Childiſh and Womaniſh ſort of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
who have the weakeſt judgments, and the ſtrongeſt
wills and paſſions muſt rule all the World; for theſe are
hardlieſt pleaſed, and no man muſt diſpleaſe them.</hi> What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
condeſcenſion therefore may be due to the <hi>weak</hi>
and Ignorant, yet it was never intended that they
ſhould govern the wiſer, and better inſtructed Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
in all their actions; and who can Govern more Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely,
than they whoſe wills muſt never be croſſed,
and whom none muſt diſpleaſe? From all this I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that this cannot be the ſenſe of <hi>Scandalizing
or giving Offence, viz.</hi> doing of ſomething, which
another takes ill, or is angry with us for it.</p>
            <p>2. I am now in the Second place to ſhew, what is
the true meaning of <hi>Offending</hi> or <hi>Scandalizing</hi> in
Scripture. The <hi>Greek</hi> word which we Tranſlate
<hi>Scandal</hi> or <hi>Offence</hi> ſignifies either a Trap and Snare,
or elſe more commonly ſomething laid in the way of
another, which occaſions his ſtumbling or falling, by
which he is bruiſed and hurt, and ſo conſequently,
whatever it was that hindred Men from becoming
Chriſts Diſciples, or diſcouraged them in their new
Profeſſion, or tempted them to forſake that Faith they
had lately embraced, is called a <hi>Scandal</hi> or <hi>Offence.</hi> It
is ſometimes rendred an <hi>occaſion to fall</hi> as Rom. 14. 13.
<hi>occaſion of ſtumbling,</hi> as 1 <hi>Joh. 2. 10. a ſtumbling-block,</hi>
Revel. 2. 14. <hi>or a thing that doth Offend, as St.</hi> Matt.
13. 41. In all which places there is the ſame Original
word.</p>
            <p>Hence to <hi>Offend</hi> or <hi>Scandalize</hi> any one, as it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
uſed in the New Teſtament, is to do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
which tends to eſtrange or fright Men from
the Chriſtian Profeſſion, to beget in them hard and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
thoughts of it, or is apt, when they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52667:13"/>
to turn them from it, and make them repent
of their change. Of this I ſhall give ſome few in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
out of the diſcourſes of our Saviour and his
Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>Thus our Bleſſed Lord, St. <hi>Matth.</hi> 17. 27. is ſaid to
have paid tribute, leſt he ſhould <hi>Offend</hi> or Scandalize
the Jews. This was more than he was bound to; for
he tells us, <hi>the Children are free.</hi> But he did it, that
he might not give any occaſion to his Enemies to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent
him to the People, as a contemner of their
Law, or an Enemy to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> (according as you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
that Tribute to be paid either to the Romans
or the Temple) and ſo prejudice them againſt his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
and Doctrine. Thus our Saviours own Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
who were acquainted with his Father, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and Kindred, who knew the meanneſs of his
Birth and Education, <hi>Mark</hi> 6. 3. were <hi>Offended</hi> or
Scandalized at him. They were aſtoniſhed at the
great things he did, and the greater things he ſpoke,
and would in all probability have believed on him,
had they not known his mean Original and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<hi>Is not this the Carpenter, the Son of</hi> Mary,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> After the ſame manner, when our Lord, St. <hi>John</hi>
6. 61. had diſcourſed of <hi>eating the Fleſh of the Son of
Man,</hi> they that heard him, taking it in a groſs carnal
ſenſe, were <hi>Offended</hi> or Scandalized at him. They
began to doubt of his being a true Prophet, or the
Meſſiah, who would teach his Diſciples to turn Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibals.</p>
            <p>Thus again our Saviour, before the night in which
he was betrayed told his Diſciples, St. <hi>Matt. 26. 31.
all of ye ſhall be Offended</hi> or Scandalized, <hi>becauſe of
me this Night;</hi> that is, ſhall fly away and ſhamefully
forſake me, when you behold my hard uſage, and
diſmal ſufferings. So <hi>Chriſt Crucified,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 23.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52667:13"/>
               <hi>to the Jews was a Scandal or ſtumbling-block;</hi> that is,
they had ſet their minds and hearts on a temporal
earthly King, and expected to be freed from the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Yoke, and to be reſtored to their former Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and greatneſs, as the effect of the coming of their
Meſſiah, and therefore could not be perſuaded to own
him for their Prince, and Saviour, and the Son of God,
who was put to ſuch a Curſed and Ignominious death.
In the ſame ſenſe they who <hi>heard the Word of God,</hi> Mark
4. 17. <hi>and received it with gladneſs, but having no root
in themſelves, when Affliction or Perſecution aroſe for
the Words ſake, were preſently offended</hi> or Scandalized;
that is, were ready to leave and renounce that Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
that was likely to coſt them ſo dear.</p>
            <p>After the publiſhing of the Goſpel by the Apoſtles,
that which moſt ſtumbled the Jewiſh Converts, was
the danger <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law and their Temple Worſhip,
and the ſingular preeminences of the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi>
ſeemed to be in of being undermined by Chriſtianity.
They were ſtrangely wedded to their Legal obſervances,
fond of Circumciſion and thoſe peculiarities, which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed
their Nation from the reſt of mankind, they
were jealous of any Doctrine, that encroached upon their
Priviledges, or tended to bring them down to the ſame
level with the Uncircumciſed World. This mightily
<hi>Offended</hi> them, and hardned them againſt Chriſtianity;
whereas on the other ſide, the Gentile Converts with as
much reaſon, were afraid of putting their Necks under
ſo heavy a Yoke, or being brought into ſubjection to the
Jewiſh Law, and there was no ſuch effectual way to
ſcare them from Chriſtianity, as when it came attended
with the burden of the Moſaical Ceremonies; which
were an <hi>Offence</hi> to them; that is, did diſcourage them
from believing in Chriſt, or continuing in his Faith.
Now to prevent the miſchiefs, that might ariſe from
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52667:14"/>
theſe different apprehenſions amongſt the Chriſtian
Proſelites, was the occaſion of the meeting of that
firſt Council at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> mentioned <hi>Acts</hi> 15. and of
thoſe directions which St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
our behaviour towards <hi>weak Brethren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another caſe there was concerning eating of things
offered to Idols, of which St. <hi>Paul</hi> diſcourſeth in his
firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians, chap. 8. and</hi> 10. the
ſum of which ſeems to be this, that the ſtronger and
wiſer Chriſtians ought to abſtain from eating what
had been offered to Idols, tho as ordinary meat, in
the preſence of any one, who <hi>with Conſcience of the
Idol, did eat it as a thing offered to an Idol.</hi> For ſuch
there were in the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> ſo weak, as not
yet to have quite left off their Idolatrous Worſhip, and
a Chriſtians eating what had been Offered in Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
before ſuch an one might ſerve to harden, and
confirm him in his Error, <hi>whoſe Conſcience being
weak is defiled.</hi> Of whoſe Soul St. <hi>Paul</hi> profeſſed
himſelf to have ſo great regard, that he would <hi>eat no
ſuch meat as long as the World laſted,</hi> rather than lay
ſuch a ſtumbling-block before, or wound their <hi>weak</hi>
Conſciences. In all theſe places and many more that
might be named (for the fuller explication of which
I refer you to interpreters, and thoſe that have written
largely on this ſubject) no leſs than Apoſtacy from
the Chriſtian Faith was the ſin, into which theſe <hi>weak</hi>
Chriſtians were ſo apt to fall, and by an undue uſe of
our Liberty to give occaſion to anothers forſaking the
Chriſtian Religion, whereby our Saviour loſeth a
Diſciple, and the Soul of our Brother periſheth, is the
proper ſin of <hi>Offending,</hi> or <hi>giving Scandal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall mention but one place more, which is <hi>Revel.</hi>
2. 14. where <hi>Balaam</hi> is ſaid to have taught <hi>Balac,
to caſt a ſtumbling-block</hi> or Scandal <hi>before the Children
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:52667:14"/>
of Iſrael</hi> which relates of his inticing them by the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of <hi>Moab</hi> to Fornication and Idolatry, and by that
means provoking God againſt them. So that in the
moſt general ſenſe to <hi>Scandalize</hi> or <hi>Offend</hi> any one, is,
to give occaſion to his ſin, and conſequently his ruin
and undoing; and this I ſuppoſe will be granted by all,
that do not receive their opinions from the meer ſound
of words. Hence I ſhall conclude theſe few things.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>The better Men are, the harder it is to</hi> Scandalize
<hi>them: Thoſe are not ſuch Godly perſons, as they
would be thought, who are ſo ready at all turns to
be</hi> Offended; <hi>for how can they be reckon'd to excel
others in knowledg or goodneſs, who are ſo eaſily
upon every occaſion drawn or tempted to ſin? Thus
Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>himſelf tells the Separatiſts in his</hi> Cure of
Church Diviſions. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſually, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> men talk moſt
againſt Scandalizing thoſe, whom they account to be the
beſt, and the beſt are leaſt in danger of ſinning; and
ſo they accuſe them to be the worſt, or elſe they know not
what they ſay; for ſuppoſe a Separatiſt ſhould ſay, if
you hold Communion with any Pariſh Miniſter or Church
in <hi>England,</hi> it will be a Scandal to many good people:
I would ask ſuch an one, Why call you thoſe good people
that are eaſily drawn to ſin againſt God? Nay, that will
ſin becauſe I do my duty: Therefore if you know what you
ſay, you make the Separatiſts almoſt the worſt of men,
that will ſin againſt God, becauſe another will not ſin.</p>
            <p>The great thing our <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> pretend unto
above other men is tenderneſs of Conſcience, by
which they muſt mean, if they mean any Vertue by
it, a great fear of doing any thing that is evil; and
this, where it is in truth, is the beſt ſecurity that can
be deviſed againſt being <hi>Scandalized</hi> or <hi>Offended,</hi> by
what other Men do; that is, againſt being drawn into
ſin by it. So that they do really diſparage and ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:52667:15"/>
reflect upon the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> who are thus afraid
of giving them <hi>Offence,</hi> as I have explained it.</p>
            <p>2. No man can with ſenſe ſay of himſelf, that he
ſhall be <hi>Scandalized</hi> at what another man does; for
it is as much as to ſay, that by ſuch a perſon and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
he ſhall be led into ſin ignorantly, and his ſaying
this confutes his ignorance: If he knows it to be a
ſin, he is not betrayed into it, nor doth he fall into it
through ignorance and miſtake (which is the caſe of
thoſe that are <hi>Scandalized)</hi> but wilfully commits it.
This a great Biſhop compares with the peeviſhneſs of
a little Child, who when he is commanded to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
the word he hath no mind to, tells you he cannot
pronounce that word, at the ſame time naming the word
he pretends he cannot ſpeak. Such Nonſenſe it is for a
man to forbid me doing any thing upon pretence it will
be a <hi>Scandal</hi> to him, or make him through miſtake fall
into ſome ſin, when by this it is plain, that he knows of
it beforehand, and ſo may, and ought to avoid the
ſtumbling-block that is laid before him, and the danger
that he is expoſed unto. <hi>Surely</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 1.
17. <hi>in vain is the Net ſpread in the ſight of any Bird.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If to <hi>Offend</hi> or <hi>Scandalize,</hi> any one is to tempt and
draw him into ſome ſin, whereby his Conſcience is
wounded, there then can be no fear of giving Offence by
our Conformity to the orders and uſages of our Church,
becauſe there is nothing appointed by or uſed in it, but
what may be complyed withal without ſin: For this,
as I before obſerved, is ſuppoſed in the Queſtion I at
firſt propounded to diſcourſe of; that he, who abſented
from his Pariſh Church for fear of <hi>Offending his weak
Brethren,</hi> was convinced in his own mind of the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
of all that is enjoyn'd; and therefore by his
own Conformity, he can only engage others to do as
he hath done, which as long as he is perſwaded to be
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52667:15"/>
lawful, I do not ſee how he can be afraid of <hi>Scandaliz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
others by it, or making them to ſin by his Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
unleſs he will imagine his Brethren, not ſo <hi>weak,</hi>
but ſo wicked, as to Worſhip the <hi>Hoſt,</hi> becauſe he
Kneels at receiving of the Sacrament, and to adore the
Croſs becauſe he bows at the Name of Jeſus, or that
they will renounce all Religion becauſe he hath
forſaken their ways of Separation: This cannot but
prove a vain excuſe for me to forbear doing that, in
which there is really no evil, leſt by the Authority of
my example I make others ſin in doing the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
action; which in this caſe is ſo far from being
to be feared, that if by my example I prevail with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to return into the Communion of our Church,
they are not thereby at all <hi>Scandalized,</hi> but I have
done them a moſt ſignal kindneſs and benefit.</p>
            <p>If it be ſaid, that tho what I do is in it ſelf lawful,
yet it may miniſter occaſion or provocation to others
to do ſomething elſe that is unlawful, and ſo I become
truly guilty of giving <hi>Offence;</hi> I Anſwer, that we are
accountable only for the natural tendencies, or probable
effects of our actions, which may be eaſily foreſeen
and prevented. Remote probabilities and contingencies
and bare poſſibilities come not into reckoning, nor
are they at all to be weighed. If in every action
I am bound to conſider what advantage a wicked
ſenſual Man, or a weak ſilly man might take, and
what Arguments he might poſſibly thence draw to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
himſelf in ſin and folly, or excuſe himſelf from
the care of his Soul and Religion, this would open
the door to infinite Scrupuloſity and trouble, and I
ſhould hardly be able to do or ſpeak any thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the incurring the guilt of giving <hi>Scandal.</hi> Now
this being ſuppoſed, I dare boldly challenge any Man
to name any one ſin either againſt God, our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52667:16"/>
or our ſelves, that our Conformity doth give
any real probable occaſion unto; and it is very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable
to conceit, that our Nonconforming Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
will out of meer perverſeneſs, or ſpite and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
run into ſin, on purpoſe to make our leaving
them criminal and vicious; which if any ſhould be
ſo wicked as to do, yet they would loſe the deſign of
their malice, and prove the only guilty perſons them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>The only thing I imagine can be further ſaid in this
caſe is, that tho I am well ſatisfied my ſelf, yet by my
Conformity I may tempt and provoke others that are
not ſatisfied concerning the lawfulneſs of it, nay thoſe
who judge it abſolutely ſinful, yet rather than ſtand
out, or being moved by the opinion they have of my
goodneſs and Wiſdom, to follow my example with a
doubting or gainſaying Conſcience. Suppoſe a Maſter of
Family that uſed to frequent the private Meetings, and
his Wife and Children and Servants uſed to follow him
thither; but afterwards, by reading of ſuch good Books
as have been lately written, is himſelf ſatisfied concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the lawfulneſs of going to Church, and at laſt
thinks it his duty ſo to do, only he is afraid that
the reſt of his Family to pleaſe and humour him, will
be apt alſo to forſake the private Meetings, and go
along with him to Church, tho it be altogether againſt
their judgment and Conſcience: Or ſuppoſe him a
man of eminency amongſt his Neighbours, on whoſe
favour many do depend, of great intereſt and reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
by whoſe example many are ſway'd and led.
Tho himſelf doth conform upon good reaſons and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
yet his example may invite many others to it,
tho they have received no ſatisfaction concerning the
lawfulneſs of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:52667:16"/>
Now here I deſire theſe three things may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered.</p>
            <p>1. It is certain that it is as unlawful to go to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
Meetings againſt ones Conſcience, as it is to
go to the publick Church againſt ones Conſcience.
Why then ought not this man to be as afraid, when he
leaves his Pariſh-Church and frequents the private
Congregation, leſt he ſhould draw ſome to follow him
thither with a doubting Conſcience; as well as he fears,
if he leaves the Meetings and reſorts to his Pariſh-Church,
ſome not ſatisfied concerning the lawfulneſs
of it, ſhould come after him thither? The influence
of his Example, intereſt, reputation, is the ſame in
both inſtances; the danger of giving this <hi>Scandal</hi> is
equal; that therefore which ought to determine his
practice muſt be his own Judgment and perſuaſion.</p>
            <p>2. Such an one, who hath been a Separatiſt, but
is now himſelf ſatisfied of the lawfulneſs of Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity;
ought to take great care and pains in endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to ſatisfie others alſo, eſpecially thoſe, whom
he hath any cauſe to think to have been led into the
ways of Separation by his example: He muſt not be
aſhamed to own his former miſtake, to ſet before
them the reaſons on which his change is grounded,
and muſt do this publickly and frequently, perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
others to uſe the ſame helps and means, which
were ſo effectual for his own conviction. And thus
he doth all that lieth in his power to prevent this ill
effect, and ſhall not be further anſwerable for the
conſequences of what he doth.</p>
            <p>3. It is truly obſerved by ſome, that conſidering
the known temper of the <hi>Nonconformiſts,</hi> it is not very
likely any ſuch miſchief ſhould enſue, <hi>viz.</hi> that by the
example of one or more leaving their Separate Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,
others ſhould be moved to follow them againſt
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:52667:17"/>
their own Judgment and Conſcience. It is abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
notorious how they have uſed to treat thoſe that
have deſerted them; with what irreconcileable enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
they have proſecuted them, looking upon them as
their worſt Enemies, paſſing more grievous cenſures
upon them than upon thoſe who have all their lives
long continued in our Communion.</p>
            <p>4. I proceed in the laſt place to obſerve from what
I have diſcourſed concerning <hi>giving Offence,</hi> that if to
<hi>Offend</hi> any one, be to lead him into ſin, then we may
<hi>Scandalize</hi> and <hi>give Offence</hi> to others, as ſoon by plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
them and complying with them, as by dipleaſing
them and going contrary to their mind and humour.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who Circumciſed <hi>Timothy, Acts</hi> 16. 3.
in favour of the <hi>weak Jews</hi> that he might inſinuate and
ingratiate himſelf into them, refuſed to Circumciſe
<hi>Titus, Galat.</hi> 2. 3. tho he made the <hi>Jews</hi> angry by it,
yet he would <hi>not give place by ſubjection,</hi> or ſubmiſſion
and condeſcenſion to them, <hi>no not for an hour:</hi> He
conſidered the different ſtates and conditions of the
perſons he had to deal withal. He complyed to Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſe
<hi>Timothy,</hi> leſt all the <hi>Jews</hi> with him ſhould have
forſaken the Chriſtian Faith, and for the ſame reaſon he
denied to Circumciſe <hi>Titus,</hi> leſt thoſe of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>
ſhould think he was of opinion, that the Jewiſh Law
held ſtill in force, and ſo the Croſs of Chriſt ſhould
become of no effect to them. He pleaſed indeed the
former for fear of driving them from Chriſtianity,
and for the ſame reaſon he diſpleaſed the latter, leſt
he ſhould give them occaſion to think the obſervation
of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law always neceſſary. He had truly
<hi>Scandalized</hi> them, if he had done as they would have
had him: He had <hi>Offended</hi> them in the true Scripture
ſenſe, if he had pleaſed and humoured them; and this
is the moſt ordinary way of <hi>Scandalizing</hi> Chriſtians a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:52667:17"/>
us, by not plainly telling Men of their faults and
miſtakes, by not ſpeaking freely and roundly to them,
nor acting couragiouſly, whereby they become hardned
and confirmed in their folly and ignorance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To this purpoſe I cannot but repeat the words of
Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>in the</hi> Book <hi>I have ſo often cited;</hi> Many a
time, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> I have the rather gone to the Common-Prayers
of the publick Aſſemblies for fear of being a
Scandal to thoſe ſame men that called the going to them
a Scandal: that is, for fear of hardning them in a ſinful
Separation and Error; becauſe I knew that was not
Scandal which they called Scandal; that is, diſpleaſing
them, and croſſing their opinions; but hardning them in
an Error or other ſin, is true Scandalizing. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtand
this, or you will diſpleaſe God under pretence of avoiding
Scandal, <hi>p.</hi> 135.</p>
            <p>Thus by complying with our Diſſenting Brethren
we really do them that miſchief which we would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void,
and fall into the ſin of giving <hi>Scandal,</hi> whileſt
we are running from it; We countenance and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
their ſinful Separation and Diviſion; we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
them in their dangerous Errors and Miſtakes;
we by our practice condemn thoſe things, which yet
in our Conſciences we allow and approve of, and by
our Authority and influence harden others in their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable
prejudices and oppoſition againſt the lawful
Commands of their Superiours. They think us of
the ſame mind with themſelves, whilſt we do the ſame
things, and that we judge as ill of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
as long as we refuſe to Communicate with it, as
themſelves do; and thus we give occaſion to their ſin,
and thoſe infinite miſchiefs which have happened both
to Church and State, upon the account of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
diſputes and diviſions; which ſurely ought to be
well thought of and conſidered by a ſort of Men amongſt
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:52667:18"/>
us, who ſhall go to Church in the Morning, and to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticle
in the Afternoon; who halt between both, and
would fain diſpleaſe neither ſide, but indeed give real
<hi>Offence</hi> to both. From all this I think it is very plain,
that he, who is ſatisfied in his own mind of the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
of Conformity, but is afraid of giving <hi>Offence</hi>
by it, if he be true to this principle, ought to haſten
the faſter to his Pariſh-Church, that he might not
<hi>Offend</hi> thoſe very Diſſenters of whom he would ſeem
to be ſo tender; and thus I have done with the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
thing I propounded to ſhew, what is meant by
<hi>Offending</hi> or <hi>Scandalizing,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. It remaineth in the Third and Laſt place to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire;
how far, and in what inſtances we are bound
to conſider the ignorance or <hi>weakneſs</hi> of our Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
In Anſwer to this, that I may proceed with all
the clearneſs I can, I ſhall now ſuppoſe notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all I have already ſaid, that our <hi>Diſſenting, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi>
are truly <hi>weak</hi> perſons, and that there may be
ſome danger of their being through their own fault
<hi>Offended</hi> by our Conformity; yet taking this for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
I ſhall plainly ſhew that he, who is in his own
mind convinced of the lawfulneſs of coming to
his Pariſh-Church, and uſing the Forms of Prayer and
Ceremonies by Law appointed, ought not to forbear
doing the ſame for fear of giving ſuch <hi>Offence</hi> to his
<hi>weak Brethren.</hi> There are many other things to be
conſidered in this Caſe, beſides this matter of private
<hi>Scandal;</hi> and if there be greater evil in, and greater
miſchief to others, and a more publick <hi>Scandal</hi> doth
follow our forbearing Communion with the Church
and withdrawing into private Aſſemblies, than can hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
by our leaving them and returning to the Church,
and complying with its orders, we ought then to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
notwithſtanding the <hi>Offence</hi> that is imagined may
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:52667:18"/>
be taken at it. For theſe two things, as I ſuppoſe
are agreed on all hands; one is, that nothing which
is ſinful may be done to avoid <hi>Scandalizing</hi> others;
the other is, that to avoid a leſs <hi>Scandal</hi> being taken
by a few, we muſt not give a greater <hi>Scandal</hi> and of
vaſtly more pernicious conſequence to a much bigger
number of perſons; and by theſe two Rules I ſhall
now judge of the Caſe at firſt propounded.</p>
            <p>1. Nothing that is ſinful may be done to avoid o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
being <hi>Scandalized,</hi> which is directly the <hi>Apoſtles
Doctrine,</hi> Rom. 3. 8. <hi>That we muſt not do evil, that
good may came;</hi> nor is any neceſſary duty to be omitted
out of prudence or charity to others, leſt they through
Error or Ignorance be hurt by it: We muſt not to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the greateſt ſin in another, commit the leaſt ſin
our ſelves, nor diſobey Gods Law, and ſo run the
hazard of our own damnation, tho it be to ſave the Soul
of our Brother. Thus <hi>Calvin</hi> tells us, <hi>Inſtit. lib. 3. c. 19.
Quae neceſſaria ſunt factu, nullius offendiculi timore
omittenda ſunt. Whatever is neceſſary to be done by
vertue of Gods Command is not to be omitted for fear
of Offence;</hi> and again in the ſame place, <hi>Hic Charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis
rationem haberi decet, ſed uſque ad aras. Our
charity to our Brother ought to be limited by this, that
we do not for his ſake diſpleaſe God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The very beſt things and actions may be perverted
by Men of ill-diſpoſed or weak minds, falſe conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
and unjuſt inferences may be ſtrained from
them; as we know the grace of God in the Goſpel
was abuſed into an argument for licentiouſneſs, and
<hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf is ſaid <hi>to be ſet for the fall of many,</hi> St.
<hi>Luke</hi> 2. 24. but ſtill this doth not Cancel our obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to univerſal obedience to Gods Law, nor can it
alter the nature of good and evil, duty and ſin; which
are no ſuch uncertain contingent things, as to depend
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:52667:19"/>
upon the conſtructions others ſhall make of our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
or the concluſions they ſhall draw from them.
God Almighty in the making of his Laws hath a
perfect comprehenſion of all the accidental events,
that may happen either through the weakneſs or wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs
of Men; and we muſt not think our ſelves to be
wiſer than God, taking upon our ſelves to diſpenſe with
his Commands without any allowance from him, as
if himſelf had not foreſeen thoſe inconveniences which
may ariſe from our doing our duty: it can therefore
never be, that obedience to God ſhould give any real
<hi>Scandal;</hi> and whatever <hi>Offence</hi> may be taken at my
doing of my duty, it is a contradiction to imagine
it imputable to me, as a ſin or fault, (for it is to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
one to diſobey God, in obeying him) but they
alone are chargeable who are <hi>Offended</hi> by it.</p>
            <p>Now by the expreſs Command of God, we are
obliged to obey the lawful injunctions of our Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours,
whether Civil or Eccleſiaſtical; and if any
are ſo hardy as to deny this, they muſt ſeek for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Bible</hi> out of which to judge of Gods will; for
there is hardly any one duty of Religion more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Commanded, more frequently and earneſtly preſſed
in the New Teſtament, than quiet and peaceable ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
to Authority, both in Church and State, in all
things lawful, and that not only to avoid puniſhment,
but for Conſcience ſake; and to refuſe obedience in
ſuch things, is a ſin againſt the fifth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
That the Conformity required by our Church,
contains not any thing in it unlawful, muſt be
granted, as I have already obſerved, by all thoſe who
make uſe of this Plea of <hi>Scandal,</hi> from all which the
neceſſary Concluſion is,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:52667:19"/>
Since we may not redeem a <hi>Scandal</hi> by diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to God, ſince God hath plainly required our ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
to thoſe whom he hath ſet over us in all things,
lawful; ſince it is acknowledged by thoſe I now diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
with, that Conformity to the Church is enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by a competent Authority, and is lawful; I ſay
the neceſſary concluſion is, that no Man can with a
good Conſcience refuſe to conform only for fear of
<hi>Scandal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our <hi>Diſſenting Brethren,</hi> when they are urged with
this Argument neither do nor can deny any of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
they muſt confeſs that no ſin may be committed
upon any account whatſoever, and that a Man is not
bound to provide for his Brothers ſafety by wounding
his own Soul; they cannot deny but that God hath
Commanded us to be ſubject to Lawful Authority in all
things lawful, but then to evade the force of this reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
they have endeavoured to load the concluſion
with ſome ſeeming difficulties and abſurdities, which
they pretend follow from this principle, that we are
bound to obey, notwithſtanding the <hi>Scandal</hi> that may
enſue upon it. The chief of theſe I ſhall mention,
and briefly return an Anſwer to them.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>It is pleaded that</hi> thoſe precepts, which contain
only rituals, are to give place to thoſe, which do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
the welfare of Mens Bodies, and much more to thoſe,
which do reſpect the welfare of our Brothers Soul; ſo
that, when both together cannot be obſerved, we muſt
neglect or violate the former, to obſerve the latter:
<hi>That this is true even of ſome Commands given by
God himſelf; to which purpoſe our</hi> Saviour <hi>doth
produce that ſaying of the</hi> Prophet <hi>Hoſea,</hi> I will have
Mercy and not Sacrifice. <hi>Now if</hi> Sacrifices <hi>preſcribed
by God himſelf, which were ſo conſiderable a part
of the Divine Worſhip under</hi> Moſes<hi>'s Law, yet were to
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:52667:20"/>
give place to acts of mercy, how much more are the
poſitive injunctions of Men, that concern only the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternals
and circumſtantials of Religion, to yield to the
Royal and indiſpenſable Law of Charity, of which
this duty of not giving</hi> Offence <hi>to others, is ſuch an
Eminent part. Thus ſaith Mr.</hi> Jeans <hi>in his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Part of</hi> Scholaſtical Divinity, What Laws of
any Earthly Wight whatſoever concerning Ceremonies
can be more obligatory, than the Commands of God
touching the externals of his Worſhip and Service; and
yet it is his will and pleaſure, that theſe externals of his
Worſhip ſhould be laid aſide for the performance of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
works of mercy: If therefore the ſacred Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of God are to give way unto works of mercy unto the
bodies of Men, ſurely then much more is the traſh of
human inventions to yield unto a work of mercy to the
Souls of Men.</p>
            <p>In anſwer to this, it is readily acknowledged that
when there doth happen any ſuch interfering between
two Commands of God, the one Poſitive, the other
Moral, the Poſitive ought always to give place to the
Moral; and by the ſame reaſon the poſitive Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of our Superiours ought certainly to give
way to the Moral Commands of God, which are of
eternal and immutable obligation. They ceaſe to bind
us either in caſe of abſolute neceſſity, or when they
plainly hinder our performance of any Moral duty to
God or our Neighbour; and the Church is preſumed to
diſpenſe with its orders, as God Almighty doth allow
the neglect of his own poſitive Inſtitutions in ſuch cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances.
But then this is only, where the neceſſity is
urgent and extream, the ſin we muſt otherwiſe
commit evident and certain; and at laſt our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
is diſpenſed withal only for that one time.</p>
            <p>Thus in a caſe of neceſſity, Our <hi>Saviour St.</hi> Matth.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:52667:20"/>
12. 5. acquits <hi>David</hi> and his followers of all blame,
who being ready to periſh for hunger, <hi>did eat of the
Shewbread, which otherwiſe, was not lawful for them
to eat;</hi> but had they taken a particular fancy to that
Bread, and refuſed to have eaten of any other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that beſt agreed with their Stomacks and was
moſt pleaſing to their Palate; can we think our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi>
would have ſo eaſily excuſed them? Or which
is nearer to our Caſe; becauſe God did prefer acts of
<hi>Mercy</hi> before <hi>Sacrifices</hi> where both could not be done,
yet this would not have juſtified any mans wholly leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
off <hi>Sacrificing,</hi> or refuſing to do it at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
another way of Worſhip, as more expedient
than Sacrificing, or chooſing another place to Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
in, which might be more convenient for all the
<hi>Jews</hi> than that City was. We may leave our Prayers,
forſake the Church to ſave the life of our Neighbour,
or to quench the firing of his Houſe, but ſtill this
would be but a pityful pretence for our wholly abſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our ſelves from Chruch, and conſtant neglect of our
Prayers, becauſe in the mean time our Neighbours
life may be invaded, or his houſe fired by ill Men, of
which there is great ſtore in the World, and ſo he may
ſtand in need of our help, which is a more acceptable
Service to God than any acts of Devotion. So that
however this Argument may ſerve to excuſe the omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of ſome things Commanded by lawful Authority,
by thoſe who otherwiſe are perfectly conformable, in
extraordinary caſes which very rarely happen, and
for which no proviſion could be made by Law; yet to
be ſure this will not at all help thoſe, who bid open
defiance to the Laws, ſtand out in manifeſt oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
againſt them, live in plain diſobedience and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
to them as it they were altogether free from
them, nay ſet up a diſtinct way and form of Worſhip
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:52667:21"/>
of their own, and all this becauſe they are loth to
<hi>Offend</hi> thoſe, who are not ſatisfied of the wiſdom and
goodneſs of what is appointed.</p>
            <p>Thus our Diſſenting Brethren can gain but little by
this Plea if granted to them; for upon this account of
exerciſing mercy and charity towards their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
they can be excuſed from Obedience to their
Superiours in ſuch caſes only, in which they may be
excuſed alſo from the obſervation of the Sabbath, from
Prayer publick or private, from Worſhipping of God
either in the Church or in a Conventicle, nay from
Obedience to God himſelf; had he pleaſed in the
Scriptures poſitively to have required whatever is at
preſent enjoyned by our Church; and let them well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,
whether if God had plainly in his Word pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
all that our Church doth Command, they
would have thought it ſafe to have refuſed compliance
with ſuch divine impoſitions, becauſe they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonably
<hi>offenſive</hi> to ſome Godly people: If our
<hi>Diſſenters</hi> will but acknowledge themſelves bound to
ſubmit to the determinations of their Superiours about
the things in controverſie between us, ſo far, as the
<hi>Jews</hi> were bound to obey the ordinances of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
his external Worſhip delivered by <hi>Moſes;</hi> and
that they are freed from ſuch obligation to obey the
Laws of their Governours only in ſuch caſes, as the <hi>Jews</hi>
were excuſed from offering their accuſtomed Sacrifices,
or as they think themſelves at liberty to break the
Sabbath, to omit Gods Publick Worſhip, I ſuppoſe
this diſpute would ſoon be at an end, for they dare not
own, that the <hi>Scandal</hi> others may take at ſuch things,
which yet are to give place to moral duties, is ſufficient
to void their obligation to the doing of them.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Jeans</hi> (whoſe objections I ſhall the rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
becauſe of his eminency amongſt the <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:52667:21"/>
tho I find my ſelf ſomewhat prevented by a late
Writer, who hath taken particular notice of them)
thus putteth the Queſtion, <hi>Suppoſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Monarch upon the face of the Earth ſhould command
the meaneſt and loweſt of his Slaves, upon ſome important
affair to ride Poſt through ſuch a City, without any of
the leaſt ſtay or diverſion, and then it ſhould happen
that a company of little Children ſhould be playing in
the Streets, can this Slave think that he is obliged to
ride over them?</hi> No ſurely, he ought to uſe all means,
and take all care poſſible to execute his Commiſſion
without doing any hurt, or damage to any perſon
whatever; but if he would have ſtated the caſe right,
it ſhould have been done thus; ſuppoſe this Slave
ſhould utterly refuſe to do as he was Commanded,
and for his juſtification ſhould plead, that he muſt be
forced to ride through many Towns are Cities, where
are many little Children, who are often playing at
the Doors or in the Streets; he knows not but that
ſome of them may be in his way, or chance to run be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
his Horſes legs, and therefore to avoid the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of this miſchief, which might poſſibly happen,
he reſolves not to ſtir one foot from his own home. Is
this pretence ſufficient to excuſe his diſobedience? No
more can our Nonconformity to the rules given us by
our Superiours be innocent, becauſe ſome may be
<hi>Scandalized</hi> at our Obedience.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>It is further ſaid that</hi> Scandal is in the nature of
it ſpiritual murder, and if where Authority hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
our choice, we muſt hold to their determination,
any Scandal to the contrary notwithſtanding, it ſeemeth
then in caſe the Magiſtrate command it, we may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
murther the Soul of our Brother, wound his weak
Conſcience, and deſtroy with our meats, our Ceremonies,
the work of God, and him for whom Chriſt died. It is
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:52667:22"/>
good, ſaith St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 14. 21. neither to eat Fleſh,
nor to drink Wine, nor any thing whereby thy Brother
ſtumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak. But our
Prelatiſts, ſaith Mr. <hi>Jeans,</hi> determine quite otherwiſe.
If Authority enjoyn it, it is good, ſay they, to eat Bread,
drink Wine, wear a Surplice, uſe the ſign of the Croſs
in Baptiſm, tho thereby never ſo many Brethren ſtumble,
or are offended, or made weak.</p>
            <p>But all this is meer bugbear, fitted only to fright
Children and ſuch weak perſons, as we are now treating
of; for it can never be ſhewen, how wearing a Surplice,
or Kneeling at receiving of the Sacrament, or
Croſſing the Infants forehead, hath any tendency to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the ſcaring Men from Chriſtianity, or making
them to deny Chriſt, and forſake and grow weary of
his Religion, which I have ſufficiently proved to be
the only proper <hi>Scandalizing</hi> of our Brother, which
St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſo highly aggravateth, and chargeth with the
guilt of deſtroying and murthering his Soul; none of
theſe things do directly and immediately lead or tempt
any man to any ſin: Whatever <hi>Scandal</hi> may follow
is wholly accidental, and the fault and miſtake of thoſe
only, who are <hi>Offended,</hi> and to provide always againſt
ſuch <hi>Scandals</hi> is an impoſſible undertaking; for they
may follow the moſt innocent actions, nay the moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
duties, and this Argument concludes as ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
againſt obedience to any other Command of God,
if by it my <hi>Brother may ſtumble, or be offended, or be
made weak,</hi> as it doth againſt ſubmiſſion to our Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours
in things lawful.</p>
            <p>They that make theſe Objections do not ſufficiently
conſider, that by Gods Law we are bound to obey the
Lawful Commands of our Superiours; and it is not
only the Law or Ordinance of Man, of which they
ſeem to make ſo little account, but it is the Law of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:52667:22"/>
God alſo, that is violated by our diſobedience to our
Governours in things Lawful: The Compariſon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ought not to be only, as they make it, between an
human Authority determining ſome indifferent things,
and the divine Law of charity to the Soul of our Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but between the divine Command of obedience to
our Superiours, and the avoiding of <hi>Scandal:</hi> Here we
affirm, that we cannot be bound to tranſgreſs a plain Law
of God, or which is all one in this Queſtion, a lawful
command of our Superiours for fear of ſome evil that
may by chance happen to ſome others through their
own fault; and we prove it by this reaſon, which our
Diſſenting Brethren muſt own for true and good, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<hi>every one is bound to have a greater care of his own
than others Salvation, and conſequently rather to avoid
ſin in himſelf, than to prevent it in his Brethren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If it be here asked, as it is by ſome, <hi>whether any
human Authority can make that action ceaſe to be Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous,
which if done without any ſuch Command had
been criminal upon the account of the Scandal that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
it,</hi> I Anſwer, that no Authority, whether di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
or human, can ſecure that others ſhall not be
<hi>Offended</hi> by what I do out of obedience to their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
but then it doth free me from all guilt and
blame, by making that to become my duty to do,
which if I had done needleſly without any great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and my Brother had been hurt and his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
wounded by it, might have been juſtly charged
with uncharitableneſs, greater or leſs according as the
<hi>Scandal</hi> was more or leſs probable to follow.</p>
            <p>This muſt be granted, that the Laws of God or
Man, otherwiſe obligatory, do not loſe their binding
force becauſe of ſome <hi>Scandal,</hi> that may poſſibly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
from our Complyance with them, or elſe all Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
is utterly void and inſignificant, and every Man
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:52667:23"/>
is at liberty to do all things as himſelf pleaſeth; for,
to borrow the words of the excellent Biſhop <hi>Sanderſon,
To allow Men under pretence that ſome offence may be
taken thereat, to diſobey Laws and Conſtitutions made
by thoſe that are in Authority over us, is the next
way to cut the ſinews of all Authority, and to bring
both Magiſtrates and Laws into contempt; for what
Law ever was made, or can be made ſo juſt and reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
but ſome Man or other either did or might take
offence thereat.</hi> Whether ſuch a Conſtitution or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of our Superiours be Scandalous or no, every
one muſt judge for himſelf; and ſo according to his
own private opinion of the goodneſs or hurtfulneſs of
what is required, he is free to obey it or not, which
is directly to diſſolve all Government, and to bring in
certain diſorder and everlaſting confuſion, every one
doing what is good in his own Eyes.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>It is ſaid, that</hi> Avoiding of Scandal is a main
duty of charity; May Superiours therefore at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
appoint, how far I ſhall ſhew my charity towards my
Brothers Soul? then ſurely an inferiour Earthly Court
may croſs the determinations of the High Court of
Heaven: <hi>This Mr.</hi> Jeans <hi>urgeth alſo out of</hi> Ameſius;
but it is eaſily replyed,</p>
            <p>That here is no Croſſing the determinations of God,
ſince it is his expreſs will, that in all lawful things we
ſhould obey our Governours, and he who hath made
this our duty, will not lay to our charge the miſchiefs,
that may ſometimes without our fault through the
folly and peeviſhneſs of Men follow from it, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
it is as equal and reaſonable, that our Superiours
ſhould appoint how far I ſhall exerciſe my charity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
my Brethren, as it is, that the miſtake and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
of any private Chriſtians ſhould ſet bounds to
their Power and Authority, Cancel the publick Laws,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:52667:23"/>
or that every ignorant and froward Brother ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin,
how far we ſhall be obedient to thoſe, whom
God hath ſet over us either in Church or State.</p>
            <p>But to give a more full Anſwer to this we muſt
know, that, tho charity be the great duty, eſpecially
of the Chriſtian Religion, yet duties of juſtice (as they
are commonly called) are of ſtricter obligation than
duties of charity, and we are bound to pay our debts,
before we give an alms. Now obedience to Superiours
is a debt we owe to them, which they have right to
exact of us, ſo that they may accuſe us of injury, if
we perform it not. But a great care to hinder ſin in
others, or not to Scandalize them is a duty of charity,
which indeed we are obliged unto as far as we can,
but not till after we have given to every one what is
his due and right. <hi>It is therefore no more Lawful for
me,</hi> ſaith the forenamed moſt Judicious Biſhop <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſon,
to diſobey the lawful Command of a Superiour,
to prevent thereby the offence of one or a few Brethren,
then it is lawful for me to do one man wrong to do ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
man a courteſie withal; or than it is lawful for me to
rob the Exchequer to relieve an Hoſpital.</hi> According
to that known ſaying of St. <hi>Auſtin, Quis eſt qui dicat,
ut habeamus quod demus pauperibus, faciamus furta
divitibus? Who is it, that ſiath it is lawful to ſteal from
the rich, what we may beſtow on the poor?</hi> or to refuſe
to pay Taxes, on pretence that you know thoſe who
have more need of your money?</p>
            <p>To this Mr. <hi>Jeans</hi> replies, <hi>Suppoſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the
care of not giving offence be in reſpect of our Brother
but a debt of charity, yet in regard of God it is a legal
debt, ſince he may and doth challenge it as due, and we
do him wrong if we diſobey him:</hi> Here I grant indeed,
that both are required by God at our hands, that we
ſhould be obedient to our Superiours, and that we
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:52667:24"/>
ſhould be always ready to ſhew charity to our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren;
but then I ſay, this is not the charity which
God requires, when I give to thoſe in want, what is
none of mine own. This is not an inſtance or expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of that love and kindneſs, which by the Law of
God we owe to our Brother, to do him good by
wronging our Superiours. God hath obliged Servants
to be merciful to the poor to their power, as well as
to be true and faithful to their Maſters; but that is
no part of the mercy which God requires from them;
to give away their Maſters goods without his leave;
tho it were to thoſe who ſtand in great need of relief.
God hath Commanded all Chriſtians to have a great
care of being any occaſion of their Brothers ſin or
fall; but then this muſt neceſſarily be underſtood only
of things ſubject to our own ordering and manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
In all caſes, wherein we are at our own diſpoſal,
we are bound charitably to regard our Brother. But
in inſtances, where our practice is determined by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
our Superiours only are to conſider the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of Scandal; we muſt conſider the duty we owe to
them, this being a matter wherein we cannot ſhew
our charity without violating the right of our Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours;
It remains then, in the words of another great
<hi>Biſhop, in what caſe ſoever we are bound to obey God
or Man, in that caſe and in that conjunction of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
we have nothing permitted to our choice,</hi> (and
conſequently there is no place for any act of charity)
<hi>and have no Authority to remit of the right of God or
our Superiour; and to comply with our Neighbour in ſuch
Queſtions, beſides that it cannot ſerve any purpoſes of
piety, if it declines from duty in any inſtance, it is like
giving Alms out of the portion of Orphans, or building
Hoſpitals with the Money and ſpoils of Sacrilege.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:52667:24"/>
4. <hi>It is further ſaid by Mr.</hi> Jeans <hi>out of</hi> Ameſius;
If determination by Superiours is ſufficient to take away
the ſin of Scandal, then they do very ill, that they do
not, ſo far as is poſſible, determine all things indifferent,
that ſo no danger may be left of giving Offence by the
uſe of them. Then the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is to be praiſed
in that ſhe hath determined ſo many indifferent things.
Then St. <hi>Paul</hi> might have ſpared all his directions about
forbearance out of reſpect to weak Brethren, and fully
determined the matters in debate, and ſo put an end to
all fear of Scandal.</p>
            <p>This truly ſeemeth a very odd way of arguing, and
all that I ſhall ſay to it is, that it ſuppoſeth nothing
elſe worthy to be conſidered in the making of Laws,
or in the determinations of Superiours about indifferent
things, but only this one matter of Scandal; and
the project it ſelf, ſhould it take, would prove very
vain and unſucceſsful. For tho we truly ſay, that we are
bound to comply with the Orders and Ceremonies of
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> they being but few and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
and ſo giving no real ground of <hi>Offence;</hi> yet we
do not ſay the ſame upon ſuppoſition our Church had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
all circumſtances in Gods Worſhip ſhe poſſibly
could, which would perhaps have been a yoke great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
than that of the Ceremonial Law to the <hi>Jews;</hi> nor if
ſhe had preſcribed as many Ceremonies as the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> hath done, which manifeſtly tend to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
and Scandal of our Chriſtian Religion; and as
for the courſe St. <hi>Paul</hi> took, it is plain that ſome things
upon good reaſons were determined by the Apoſtles, as
that the Gentile Converts ſhould <hi>abſtain from blood, and
things ſtrangled, and offered to Idols,</hi> which decree, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume,
they might not Tranſgreſs out of charity to any
of their Brethren, who might take <hi>Offence</hi> at ſuch ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence,
and other things for great reaſon were for a
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:52667:25"/>
time left at liberty, which reaſon was taken from the
preſent circumſtances of thoſe the Apoſtles had to deal
withal; tho afterwards, as I obſerved before, when
that reaſon ceaſed, determinations were made about
thoſe things which St. <hi>Paul</hi> had left at liberty, and
if St. <hi>Paul</hi> had determined the diſpute about <hi>meats</hi> and
<hi>days</hi> one way, they, who had followed ſo great an
Authority, whatever had happened, had ſurely been
free from the ſin of <hi>Scandal;</hi> but ſtill the <hi>Scandal</hi> had
not been prevented, but all the contrary part had been
in danger to have been utterly eſtranged from Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity;
and that was reaſon ſufficient why St. <hi>Paul</hi> did
not make any determinations in that caſe. For Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
are not only to take care to free thoſe that
obey them from the ſin of <hi>Scandal,</hi> but alſo to provide,
that as little occaſion, as is poſſible, may be given to
any to be <hi>Scandalized.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are other Objections offered by Mr. <hi>Jeans,</hi>
out of <hi>Ameſius</hi> and <hi>Rutherford,</hi> againſt this Doctrine
of our obligation to obedience to Superiours in things
lawful, notwithſtanding the Scandal that may follow;
but they either may be Anſwered from what I have
already ſaid, or elſe they chiefly concern the caſe of
Governours, and are brought to prove that they act
uncharitably, and give great <hi>Offence</hi> contrary to St.
<hi>Pauls</hi> rules, who take upon them determinately to
impoſe unneceſſary rites by which they know many
good Men will be <hi>Scandalized,</hi> but this is not my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
buſineſs to diſcourſe of, tho I cannot forbear ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
theſe two things, which I think very eaſie to make
out.</p>
            <p>1. That our Church of <hi>England</hi> hath taken all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
care not to give any just offence to any ſort of
perſons, and the offences that have been ſince taken at
ſome things in our Conſtitution could not poſſibly have
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:52667:25"/>
been foreſeen by thoſe who made our firſt Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
from Popery, and ſo they could not be any
reaſon againſt the firſt eſtabliſhment: Nor,</p>
            <p>2. Are they now a ſufficient reaſon for the altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it; unleſs we can imagine it reaſonable to alter
publick Laws made with great wiſdom and delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as often, as they are diſliked by, or prove <hi>Offenſive</hi>
to private perſons. If this be admitted, there then
can never be any ſetled Government and order in
the Church; becauſe there never can be any eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that will not be lyable to give ſuch <hi>Offence.</hi>
They who now take <hi>Offence</hi> at what the Church of
<hi>England</hi> enjoyns, on the ſame or a like account will
take <hi>Offence</hi> at whatever can be enjoyned, and the
ſame pretences of <hi>Scandal</hi> will be good againſt any
eſtabliſhment they themſelves ſhall make; for tho they
will not uſe theſe reaſons againſt their own eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
yet in a ſhort time others will take up their
weapons to fight againſt them, and what ſerved to
deſtroy the preſent Church will be as effectual to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
that, which ſhall be ſet up in its room: ſo that
whatever alteration is made, if this be allowed for a
ſufficient ground of it, <hi>viz.</hi> to avoid the <hi>Offence</hi> that
ſome men take at the preſent conſtitution, yet ſtill
we ſhall be but where we were, and new <hi>Offences</hi> will
ariſe, and ſo there muſt be continual changing and
altering, to gratifie the unreaſonable humours and
fancies of Men; and ſhould any one party of Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
amongſt us get their Form of Government and
Worſhip eſtabliſhed by Law, I doubt not but they would
Preach to us the very ſame Doctrine, we do now to
them. They would tell us that private perſons muſt
bend and conform to the Laws, and not the Laws to
private perſons; that it was our own fault that we
were <hi>Offended;</hi> that our <hi>weakneſs</hi> proceeded from our
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:52667:26"/>
unwillingneſs to receive inſtruction; that the <hi>weak</hi>
were to be governed, not to preſcribe to their Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours;
that we muſt not expect that what was with
good reaſon appointed and ordered ſhould be preſently
abrogated or changed out of complyance with Mens
fooliſh prejudices and miſtakes. It is ſufficiently
known how ſtrict and rigorous both the Presbyterians
and Independents are and have been where they have
had any advantage, and what little conſideration or
regard they have had of their <hi>Diſſenting Brethren,</hi> tho
they would have us ſo tender of them.</p>
            <p>Thus much I think ſufficient to ſhew that the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of Obedience to Superiours in things Lawful is
more obligatory, than the Precept of avoiding <hi>Scandal;</hi>
whence it follows that it is our duty to obey in ſuch
inſtances, tho <hi>Offence</hi> may be taken at it, becauſe no
ſin is to be committed for the avoiding <hi>Scandal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I might from this head further argue, that if we
muſt not commit any ſin to avoid giving <hi>Offence,</hi> then it
is not Lawful to Separate from our Pariſh-Churches upon
that account; becauſe all voluntary Separation from a
Church, in which nothing that is unlawful is required
as a condition of Communion, is the ſin of <hi>Schiſm,</hi> and
that is a ſin of the blackeſt dye and greateſt guilt, noted
the in <hi>Scriptures</hi> for <hi>an act of carnality, a work of the Fleſh
and of the Devil;</hi> for the neceſſity of our coming to
Church, and Worſhipping God in the ſame publick place
with our Neighbours, and ſubmitting to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
Diſcipline and Cuſtoms of that particular Church
we live in, doth not depend only upon the Statutes
of the Realm which enforce it, and the Command of
the Civil Magiſtrate who requires it; but by the Law
of our Religion all needleſs Separation or Diviſion
amongſt Chriſtians, breaking into little Parties and
Factions, <hi>from whence comes ſtrife, envying, confuſion
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:52667:26"/>
and every evil work,</hi> is to be moſt carefully avoided, as
the very bane of Chriſtianity, the rending of Chriſts
body, and as utterly deſtructive not only of the peace,
but of the being of a Church. So that ſhould all the
Laws about Conformity and againſt Conventicles be
reſcinded and voided, ſhould the Magiſtrate indulge
or connive at the Separate Aſſemblies, yet ſtill this
would not make our joyning with them not to be
ſinful. Since to preſerve the unity of Chriſtians
and one Communion, is the neceſſary duty of every
member of the Church, and it can never be thought
a juſtifiable thing, to cut off our ſelves from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of the Church or the Body of Chriſt, out of
complyance with any erring or ignorant Brethren. But
the ſinfulneſs of withdrawing from the Communion
of our Church, either totally or in part, hath been
ſo evidently ſhewn in ſome late diſcourſes written on
that ſubject, that I do deſpair of convincing thoſe of
the danger of it, who can withſtand the force of all
that hath been already offered to them: I only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
thus much, that there is far more of the ſin of
uncharitableneſs in ſuch Separation and Diviſion, than
there can be in all the <hi>Offence</hi> that is imagined to be
given by our Conformity.</p>
            <p>From what I have already at large diſcourſed it
plainly follows, that they are things meerly <hi>indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent,</hi>
not only in their own nature, but alſo in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
to us, in the uſe of which we are obliged to
conſider the <hi>weakneſs</hi> of our Brethren. What is our
duty muſt be done, tho <hi>Scandal</hi> follow it: What is
evil and ſinful ought to be left undone upon the ſcore
of a greater obligation, than that of <hi>Scandal;</hi> but
now in matters, wherein our practiſe is not determined
by any Command, we ought ſo to exerciſe our liberty,
as if poſſible to avoid giving any <hi>Offence</hi> to our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:52667:27"/>
This is an undoubted part of that charity,
which one Chriſtian ought always to be ready to
ſhew to another, by admonition, inſtruction, good
example, and by the forbearance of things Lawful,
at which he foreſeeth his Neighbour out of <hi>weakneſs</hi>
will be apt to be <hi>Scandalized,</hi> to endeavour to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
his falling into any ſin or miſchief; and this
we teach and preſs upon our People as much as Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters
themſelves can, in obedience to St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s rules
about <hi>meats and days,</hi> things neither in themſelves good
or evil, nor determined by any Authority, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they were every way a proper inſtance, wherein
Chriſtians might exerciſe their charity and compaſſion
one to the other; and in ſuch caſes St. <hi>Paul</hi> declares,
that he would rather wholly forego his liberty, than
by theſe indifferences endanger the Soul of his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
as in that famous place 1 <hi>Cor. 8. 13. If meat
make my Brother to offend, I will eat no Fleſh
while the World ſtandeth, leſt I make my Brother to
Offend;</hi> where by <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>meat</hi> is to be underſtood
ſuch as had been Offered unto <hi>Idols,</hi> which tho lawful
for a Chriſtian to eat at common meals, yet the
Apoſtle would wholly abſtain from, rather than wound
the weak Conſcience of a Brother. <hi>If I by the Law
of charity</hi> (as the Reverend Biſhop <hi>Taylour</hi> ſaith,
<hi>Great exemp.</hi> p. 420) <hi>muſt rather quit my own goods
than ſuffer my Brother to periſh, much rather muſt I
quit my priviledg.</hi> And, <hi>We ſhould ill die for our Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who will not loſe a meal to prevent his ſin, or
change a diſh to ſave his Soul; and if the thing be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
to us, yet it ought not to be indifferent to us
whether our Brother live or die.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this manner do we profeſs our ſelves ready to
do or forbear any thing in our own power, to win and
gain our <hi>Diſſenting Brethren</hi> to the Church. We
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:52667:27"/>
grant that thoſe, who conform, are obliged by this
Law of charity not needleſly to vex and exaſperate
our <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> nor to do any thing which they are not
bound to do, that may eſtrange them more from the
Church; but to reſtrain themſelves in the uſe of that
liberty God and the Laws have left them, for the ſake of
peace and out of condeſcenſion to their Brethren. We
dare not indeed omit any duty we owe to God, or our
Superiours either in Church or State, nor can we
think it fit and reaſonable, that our Apoſtolical Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
Excellent Liturgy, Orderly Worſhip of God
uſed in our Church, ſhould all be preſently condemned
and laid aſide, as ſoon as ſome <hi>Weak</hi> men take <hi>Offence</hi>
at them; but in all other things, ſubject to our own
ordering and diſpoſal, we acknowledge our ſelves
bound <hi>to pleaſe our Brother for his good unto Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I only add here, that this very rule of yielding to
our Brother in things indifferent and undetermined
ought to have ſome reſtrictions and limitations, ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
of which are mentioned by Mr. <hi>Jeans,</hi> whom I
have ſo often named; as Firſt, That we are not to
forbear theſe indifferent things, where there is only
a poſſibility of <hi>Scandal,</hi> but where the <hi>Scandal</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent
is probable; for otherwiſe <hi>we ſhould be at an
utter loſs and uncertainty in all our actions, and never
know what to do.</hi> Secondly, Our <hi>weak</hi> Brethren muſt
have ſome probable ground for their imagination that
what we do is evil and ſinful, or elſe we muſt wear no
Ribbands, nor put off our Hats, but come all to <hi>Thou</hi>
and <hi>Thee;</hi> and for this exception he gives this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial
reaſon, <hi>that if we are to abſtain from all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
things, in which another without probable
ground imagineth that there is ſin, the ſervitude of
Chriſtians under the Goſpel would be far greater and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:52667:28"/>
more intolerable, than that of the Jews under the Moſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical
adminiſtration.</hi> Thirdly, This muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
of indifferent things that are of no very great
importance; for if it be a matter of ſome weight
and moment, as yielding me ſome great profit, I muſt
only for a while forbear it, untill my Brother is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
informed. Laſtly, We muſt not wholly betray
our Chriſtian liberty to pleaſe peeviſh and froward
people, or to humour our Neighbour in an erroneous
and ſuperſtitious opinion; for which he quotes Mr.
<hi>Calvin,</hi> who in his Comment upon 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 13. tells
of ſome <hi>fooliſh Interpreters, that leave to Chriſtians
almoſt no uſe at all of things indifferent, upon pretence
to avoid the Offence of Superſtitious perſons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now tho all this is generally true, yet I think there
are no certain unalterable rules to be laid down to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
our practiſe in this affair. For it being an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
of charity, muſt be determined by the meaſures
of prudence according to circumſtances, and we may
as well go about to give certain rules for Mens charity
in other caſes, and fix the proportion, which every
Man ought to give of his eſtate towards the relief of
the poor, as poſitively to tell how far a Man muſt
deny himſelf in the uſe of indifferent things, and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go
his own liberty for the ſake of his Brother, and ſo
I end this head with thoſe words of the learned Dr.
<hi>Hammond</hi> in his little Treatiſe of <hi>Scandal: This whole
matter is to be referred to the Chriſtians pious diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or prudence, it being free to him either to abſtain,
or not to abſtain, from any indifferent action (remaining
ſuch) according as that piety, and that prudence ſhall
repreſent it to be moſt charitable and beneficial to other
Mens Souls.</hi> Thus I have done with the firſt propoſition,
that nothing ſinful is to be committed to avoid <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalizing</hi>
others.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:52667:28"/>
2. I proceed now to the Second, that to avoid a
leſs <hi>Scandal</hi> being taken by a few we muſt not give a
greater <hi>Offence,</hi> and of vaſtly more pernicious conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
to a much bigger number of perſons: Not that
ſuch a caſe can ever happen, wherein we muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
give <hi>juſt Offence</hi> to one ſide or other, and ſo are
uncharitable, whether we do or forbear to do the ſame
action; for then we ſhould be under a neceſſity of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
which implies a contradiction, but yet it may
and often doth happen, that ſome <hi>weak</hi> perſons may
take <hi>Offence</hi> at my doing, and others be more <hi>Offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
at my forbearing to do the ſame thing, and thus
whether I do it, or not, I ſhall give <hi>Offence,</hi> tho not
juſtly, nor through my own fault, to ſome one or
other. In ſuch circumſtances therefore we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,
which way is given the greater and more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
<hi>Offence,</hi> and it can never be either prudence or
charity to abſtain from that, which may <hi>Scandalize</hi>
our Brother, when by forbearance a greater and more
publick <hi>Scandal</hi> is miniſtred to others; for in this caſe
<hi>we have greater reaſon on the account of Scandal it ſelf
to do, than to forbear that action,</hi> as all that write on
this ſubject do and muſt acknowledge, and for which
they uſually quote that ſaying of <hi>Bernard, Prudenter
advertendum eſt ſcandalum ſcandalo non emendari, &amp;c.
We are prudently to mark that one Scandal is not mend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by another; which kind of emendation we ſhould
practiſe, if to take off offence from one party, we give
offence unto another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was the occaſion of that famous Conteſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the two great Apoſtles mentioned in the ſecond
Chapter of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi> had
freely converſed with the Gentile Chriſtians, and had
eat with them all kind of meats; but afterwards when
certain believing Jews from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> who were ſtill
<gap reason="missing" extent="2 pages">
                  <desc>〈2 pages missing〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:52667:29"/>
to the diſſatisfaction and <hi>Offence</hi> of all the other Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters,
who have as good a right to this Plea of
<hi>weakneſs</hi> as themſelves.</p>
            <p>3. Hereby great <hi>Offence</hi> is given to all thoſe who
do conform; for this Separation from the Church is a
publick condemning of the Government, Orders, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
or Doctrine of our Church, and is apt to breed
ſcruples and perplexities in well meaning, but leſs
knowing members of it, and by degrees produces a
diſtaſt or diſlike of our Worſhip, and plainly hinders
the efficacy of the ordinances of Chriſt as adminiſtred
in our Church, whileſt it creates prejudices in people
againſt them as impure and corrupt; and why there
ſhould not be a due regard had to thoſe many, who
are <hi>Offended</hi> at our Diſſenters Conventicle Worſhip, as
well as of thoſe, who are ſaid to be <hi>Scandalized</hi> by
our Church ſervice, I cannot at all gueſs. I ſhall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſay here, that irreverent ſitting at the receiving the
Sacrament of the Lords Supper, Mens unmannerly
wearing their Hats in time of Divine Worſhip, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
putting them off but half way at their Prayers,
their indecent poſtures and antick geſtures at their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions,
the extravagancies and follies (not to ſay worſe)
ſome of them are guilty of in their extemporary effuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
the ſtrange uncouth Metaphors and Phraſes they
uſe in their Preaching; in a word, the ſlovenly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of Divine Worſhip amongſt the Diſſenters
is much more <hi>Scandalous,</hi> then all the Ceremonies of
our Church can ever be.</p>
            <p>4. Conſider the <hi>Scandal</hi> that is hereby given to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
and our Superiours, by bringing their Laws
and Authority into contempt; concerning which the
forenamed Mr. <hi>Jeans</hi> in his firſt Edition of his Diſcourſe
about <hi>Abſtinence from all Appearance of Evil,</hi> hath
theſe words, <hi>If,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>it were better to be thrown
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:52667:29"/>
into the bottom of the Sea with a Millſtone about ones
Neck, than to offend a little one, a poor and illiterate
Artizan, what expreſſion ſhall we then find anſwerable to
the heinouſneſs of a Scandal given to a Pious Magiſtrate,
to a Religious Prince, to a Parliament, and Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to an whole Church and Commonwealth?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. By this Separation from the Church, great <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal</hi>
is given to the Papiſts; not that they are diſpleaſed at
it; they are not indeed offended in that ſenſe, but this
ſerves wonderfully to harden them in their falſe and
Idolatrous Worſhip; it increaſeth their confidence,
that their Church is the only true Church of Chriſt,
becauſe amongſt them only is found Peace and Unity;
and this is a mighty temptation to many wavering
Chriſtians to turn Papiſts: inſomuch that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>
hath told us, that <hi>Thouſands have been drawn to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,
or confirmed in it by this Argument already,</hi> and
he ſaith of himſelf, that <hi>he is perſuaded, that all the
Arguments elſe in</hi> Bellarmin, <hi>and all other Books that
ever were written, have not done ſo much to make Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
in</hi> England, <hi>as the multitude of Sects among our
ſelves.</hi> This indeed is a great <hi>Scandal</hi> to our Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Religion, and is that which the Papiſts are on all
occaſions ſo forward to object againſt us, and hit us
in the teeth with; and by our hearty uniting with the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> we may certainly wreſt out of
their hands the moſt dangerous weapon they uſe againſt
the Reformation.</p>
            <p>6. This tends to the <hi>Scandal</hi> of Religion in general.
It prejudiceth men againſt it as an uncertain thing,
a matter of endleſs diſpute and debate; it makes ſome
Men utterly reject it as conſiſting moſtly in little trifles
and niceties about which they obſerve the greateſt
noiſe and contention to be made or as deſtructive of
the Publick Peace of Societies, when they ſee what
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:52667:30"/>
dangerous feuds and quarrels commence from our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Differences, and all the diſorder and confuſion
that they have cauſed here in <hi>England,</hi> ſhall by ſome
be charged upon Chriſtianity it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Thus our cauſeleſs Separations and Diviſions open
a wide door to Atheiſme, and all kind of Prophaneneſs
and Irreligion: After this manner it was of old, and
always will be, where there are Parties in Religion,
and one contends that their Separation is lawful, and
the other that it is unlawful, the Common people
ſoon become doubtful and ready to forſake all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>I might add here, that ſuch Separations neceſſarily
occaſion breach of Charity; they beget implacable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
and animoſities: Hence cometh ſtrife, emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
envying, one Party continually endeavouring
to overtop the other, watching for one anothers halt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
rejoycing in one anothers ſins and misfortunes,
conſtant undermining one another, to the diſturbance
of the Publick Government, and endangering the
Civil Peace; of all which and much more than I can
now mention the preſent diſtracted condition of our
Nation is ſo great and undenyable an evidence, that
there need no more words to ſhew the miſchiefs that
attend ſuch Diviſions; and now let any one judge, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Peace and Unity of the Church, the maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Charity amongſt Brethren, the keeping out Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,
and Atheiſm, the preſervation of the Authority
of the Magiſtrate, and quiet of the Society we are
Members of, the honour and credit of our Religion.
Laſtly, Whether giving <hi>Offence</hi> to all both Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts
and Nonconformiſts, thoſe only excepted of our
own particular Sect and Diviſion, nay <hi>Scandalizing</hi>
them alſo in the true and proper ſenſe of <hi>Scandal,</hi> be
not of far greater and more weighty conſideration,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:52667:30"/>
than the fear of diſpleaſing or grieving ſome few <hi>weak</hi>
diſſatisfied Brethren; <hi>Wo to thoſe, by whom Offences
come.</hi> But theſe things I have very lightly touched,
becauſe they have been the ſubject of many Sermons
and diſcourſes lately publiſhed.</p>
            <p>To ſum up all I have ſaid,</p>
            <p>Since they, who diſſent from the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
are not ſuch <hi>weak</hi> perſons as St. <hi>Paul</hi> all along
deſcribes and provides for; ſince we cannot by our
Conformity really <hi>Scandalize</hi> or <hi>Offend</hi> them in that
ſenſe, in which the Scriptures uſe thoſe words; ſince
tho we did give <hi>Offence</hi> to them by our Conformity,
yet that would not excuſe us from doing our Duty,
and by refuſing to Conform we ſhould do both them
and others greater hurt and miſchief; I think I may
ſafely conclude, that <hi>there cannot lie any obligation
upon any private Chriſtian (as the caſe now ſtands a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
us) to abſent himſelf from his Pariſh-Church, or
to forbear the uſe of the Forms of Prayer or Ceremonies
by Law appointed, for fear of Offending his weak Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I end all with one word of Advice. Firſt, to thoſe
who are not convinced of the lawfulneſs of Conformity.
Secondly, to thoſe who are ſatisfied that it is lawful.</p>
            <p>1. To thoſe who are not convinced of the lawfulneſs
of Conformity, and therefore urge ſo hard that they
ought not to be <hi>Offended</hi> by us. I would beſeech
them that they would take ſome care and make ſome
Conſcience to avoid giving any needleſs <hi>Offence</hi> to thoſe
of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and this cannot but be
thought a reaſonable requeſt, ſince they require all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to be ſo tender of them. They ought not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to meet in ſuch numbers, nor at the ſame time
at which we aſſemble to Worſhip God in our publick
Churches. Let them not affront our Service and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayers,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:52667:31"/>
nor revile our Biſhops and Miniſters,
nor put on their Hats when at any time they chance
to be preſent at our Service in our Churches, nor talk
nor read in Books, nor make ſour faces at our Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and when they obſerve theſe and other the like
rules, they may then with a better grace (tho with little
reaſon) find fault with our Conformity as <hi>Offenſive</hi> to
them. I would be loth to ſay any thing, that ſhould
exaſperate or provoke any of the Diſſenters whoſe
ſatisfaction I deſign: I very well know their <hi>weakneſs,</hi>
that they cannot endure to be told of their faults. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
I muſt tell them, that there are no ſort of perſons
in the Chriſtian World profeſſing Religion and Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
that have done ſuch <hi>Scandalous</hi> things, as ſome
of thoſe who call themſelves Proteſtant Diſſenters. I
forbear to name particulars.</p>
            <p>2. As for thoſe who are ſatisfied concerning the
lawfulneſs of Conformity, I would deſire them ſo to
order their return to the Church, as not to give any
juſt <hi>Offence</hi> to thoſe whom they forſake; that is to ſay,
that they would do it heartily and ſincerely, that all
may ſee they Conformed with a willing mind, being
perſuaded that it is their duty ſo to do, and not meerly
to ſatisfie the Law, or to ſave their Purſes, or to get
into an Office, or to capacitate them to Vote or the
like. For ſuch a kind of Conformity, as ſome practiſe,
and call <hi>Occaſional Communion,</hi> which is coming to
Church and Sacrament to ſerve a turn, is truly <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous</hi>
to all good Men of what perſuaſion ſoever.</p>
