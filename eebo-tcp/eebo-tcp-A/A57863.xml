            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>AMong the Sermons lately Preached, at the
Meeting of the Governours of <hi>George
Heriot's</hi> Hospital, Some who heard them
thought fit to publish the two following, Hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they may be useful to excite people to Works
of Charity especially such good Works, the Fruit
of which is extended to many, and more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
such as tend to promote the Education of
Young Persons, who have none to care for them,
and who may be afterwards useful, whither
by publick or more private service to the Church
or Nation: It hath been observed of late Years,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62034:3"/>
since this course of Preaching on such subjects
began, more such Charity hath been given in
this City then in many Years before, And that
Fond designed for Erecting a Hospital for Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainance
and Education of Orphans of the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male
Sex hath much encreased, to which many Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Persons both Men and Women have contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
Liberally, beside other pious Mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Donations made in the City for other
publick Vses. The hope, that these and other
Sermons of the like Tendency may (by Gods
Blessing) have further influence on well disposed
Christians to whom God hath given Wealth, that
they may also have a Heart to use it, for his
Glory, and to serve the Lord with their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
and that people may be perswaded thus
to shew their Faith by their Works, Is that which
moved the Publishers to send these two Sermons
Abroad.</p>

SERMON
Preached by
Mr. GILBERT RVLE Minister of the
Gospel, and Principal of the Colledge of
Edinburgh. Munday, December 3d. 1694.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>Psal. 112. ver. 9.</bibl>
               <q>He hath dispersed, He hath given to the Poor, His Righteousness en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth
for ever, His Horn shall be exalted with Honour.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THIS Psalm Informeth us of the Great Blessings that
attend the Godly; As the Apostle also telleth us,
that <hi>it hath the Promises of this Life, and that
which is to come:</hi> And that it <hi>is profiteable for all
Things. 1 Tim.</hi> 4. 8. And the Psalmist doth also
give us some of the Characters of the Man that shall be thus Blessed,
that he is one that <hi>fears the Lord ver.</hi> 1. Aweful Thoughts of the
Holiness, Goodness, Power and Majesty of God do Influence him
in the Course of his Life, Also <hi>He delighteth in God's Commandments
ver.</hi> 1. his Will and Affections are gained to the practice of Holiness.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62034:4"/>
It is not barely the Terrours of a Natural Conscience that trouble him;
He is called an <hi>Vpright Man, ver.</hi> 4. an Unbyassed Man, who
singly mindeth Duty and the Glory of God. Likeways he is called
<hi>a Good Man, ver. 5:</hi> a Benign Person, and of a Loving and Lovely
Disposition. He is also <hi>Righteous ver.</hi> 6 Inclined to do Justice to
all, and give every one their due. But the Commendation of this Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
Man, that the Psalmist doth here most insist on, Is his <hi>Charity,</hi>
his Affection and Regard to the Necessities of Men; which maketh
him bestow liberally for their Relief, so far as he is able <hi>ver.</hi> 4. 5. and
in the Text.</p>
            <p>In the words read we have two Things to be considered. 1. The
practice of the Good Man. 2. The Blessings that follow on this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
The practice or Duty is set forth in two Expressions 1, <hi>he hath
dispersed.</hi> The Chaldee Paraphrase hath it, He hath Dispersed his
Money or Goods <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> for that is indeed meant, his work is not to
scrape and hoord, and to keep, as they who set their Heart on the
World, but as he is duely careful to get by good Means, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
of wicked Lavishing; so his great care is, how to lay out for the
Glory of God, and the good of Mankind; This word importeth. 1,
The Good Mans communicating of his Goods, neither laying them
up, not bestowing all on himself, his Pride, Vanity, or other Lusts; he
believes that as God made him not for himself, so he should not live
to himself, but for God's Glory, and the good of Men: this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating
is enjoined <hi>Heb. 13. 16. 2dly.</hi> It implyeth not a Spare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but a Liberal Giving, he hath a large Heart and an open Hand,
according to his Ability, and the Necessities of the Objects of Charity:
It was counted Liberality in the Poor Widow to give a Mite or two,
but it were penuriousness in a Richer Person. See <hi>2 Cor. 9. 6. 3dly</hi>
It implyeth giving to many, as <hi>Eccles.</hi> 11. 12. Not to make one poor-Body
Rich; and let many Starve, there is Discretion to be used in
Charity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Psal</hi> 112. 5. The other Expression qualifieth this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persing
of our Goods, the Good Man disperseth his Goods by <hi>Giving</hi>
of them <hi>to the Poor.</hi> There are some who disperse their Estate very
fast and profusely, they quickly (as the saying is) let the Wind
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62034:4"/>
among their Heaps of Treasure and Great Estates, but it is by Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eness,
Whoredom, Gameing, spent on their Back and Belly, or on mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken
Credit; and Honour; on high and Luxurious Living: Some peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
Cloaths, and House-hold Furniture Eat up what they should lay
out on the Necessitous Poor: Others disperse on their Superstition, and
out of a mistaken Zeal for Religion, as <hi>Isai 46. 6. They lavish Gold out
of the Bag:</hi> what incredible Riches hath the Blind Superstition of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
furnished some Churches and Monasteries with, while many
Poor want Bread: here is a dispersing with a Witness; but the Good
Man's dispersing is <hi>Giving to the Poor</hi> for their Relief: Which dispers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
does not use to Ruin Estates, and bring the giver to poverty, as the
other doth. The <hi>2d.</hi> part of the Text is the Blessings that follow on this
Liberality. 1. His <hi>Righteousness endureth for ever,</hi> Some expound
it thus: Bounty or Mercifulness (so the word is used, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4. 27.
and often in the Old Testament) shall never want a Fond, his Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
shall be like a Springing Fountain that goeth not dry: Others, the
reward of his Bounty shall never fail: Others, his Bountiful Disposition
will continue: Others, the effect of his Bounty is often abiding and
conspicuous to the Glory of God, and Commendation of the Liberal
Man, even after he is laid in the Dust. Many times the good works
of Men that are bountiful are a lasting Monument: an instance of this,
Wee have in the Famous Hospital that giveth the occasion to this
Meeting: how many great Estates of Citizens, and others, which they
had with great care gathered, are wasted by prodigal Heirs, since
this Hospital was founded, while it is yet lasting to the use, it
was appointed for. <hi>2dly.</hi> Another Blessing, <hi>his horn shall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted
with honour,</hi> That is, Strength, Prosperity and Honour shall
be the Fruit of such a practice; In a word, the Psalmist would have
us look on this, as the best way to raise, and to establish a Family,
which many are Ambitious of, but they take the wrong way to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
their Design, by defrauding the Poor of what the Lord hath made
their due out of Mens Estates. Several practical Truths may be here
observed, which time will not allow to insist on, I shall summe up
what Doctrine the Text affordeth, in this one Proposition, <hi>Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62034:5"/>
for the Relief the Poor, is a Duty, that God requireth and
will Reward.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For clearing this, and convincing you of this Truth, I shall first
prove this in the General, and then shall prove some particular Truths,
that are comprehended under the General Doctrine</p>
            <p>For the General proposition, It is plainly, peremptorily and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
commanded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Lev. 25. 35 Deut<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 15. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. Isai
58 7. Luke 11. 41. Luke. 3. 11. 1 Tim 6 18. Heb</hi> 13. 16. If
the Authority of God have any weight with us, this we will make
Conscience of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> The Lord hath declared Himself well pleased with this, as
a Christian Duty. <hi>Heb,</hi> 13. 16.</p>
            <p>3ly. <hi>It hath alwayes been esteemed in the Church, and pressed by
the Faithful Pastors of it. The Papists, it is true, carry it too high,
make it Meritorious, and insist mostly on it, perverting the peoples
Charity, which should relieve the Poor, to feed Idle Monks, and
adorn and Enrich Monasteries: But the Fathers, and the Faithful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
in all ages thought it their duty to press this good work on the
people: So doth the Apostle,</hi> 2 Cor. 8. 1. <hi>and 9. 1. And with what
Earnestness and strength of Argument, do the Fathers in their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
and Epistles urge this Duty on the people?</hi> Augustine <hi>sayeth,</hi>
The poor Man is a Fruitful field, it quickly yeildeth Fruit to the
Sower, <hi>Again,</hi> If thou be a good Merchant, an excellent Vsurer,
give that which thou canst not keep always, that thou may receive that
which thou canst not lose; give a little, that thou mayest receive a
hundred-fold; give a temporal possession, that thou mayest receive an
Eternal Inheritance. Ambrose, he is truely Blessed out of whose
house the poor never goeth empty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Again,</hi> to with-hold relief from
the Indigent for saving his Life is to kill him, Beware that thou
hoord not up in thy Bags the health or safety of the poor; <hi>That</hi> is to
Bury him, in thy heaps of Silver; <hi>Another saith,</hi> he doth in vain
stretch forth his hand to God in Prayer who stretcheth it not out to
the Poor by giving.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:62034:5"/>
               <hi>4ly.</hi> Nature teacheth this Duty. The Heathens both commended
and used this practice; to the Shame of many, who own the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
I shall forbear instances to spare time, only I cannot pass that
of <hi>Xenophon,</hi> who used to say, That <hi>it was more Glorious, for one
to leave many Deeds of Bounty behind him, than many Trophees of
Victory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>5ly.</hi> For this end, The Lord (who could have levelled all the
World) hath made some Poor, and others Rich, That the one may
Exercise Dependence upon God, who feedeth all, and the other
might shew their obedience to him in feeding the Poor, See <hi>Deut.
15.</hi> 10, 11 The Lord hath made the one His Stewards, and the
other His Receivers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>6ly.</hi> It is the constant and unfailing Fruit of the Grace of God,
And the footsteps that God's Flock hath always walked in: Abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of Instances may be given. See <hi>Prov<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 21: 26. Obadiah</hi> is one
Instance. <hi>1 Kings 18<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 13. Also <hi>Job<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 31. 16. And <hi>Zacheus Luke 19:
8. Cornelius Act: 10 12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 13. 4 Dorcas Acts 9 36<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> The Church
of Jerusalem in the time of great Persecution, had all things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<hi>Act:</hi> 2. 44, and 4 34. And we Read of Churches sending Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
to other Churches in Distress.</p>
            <p>Under this General Truth, some particulars are to be proved, for
further clearing the matter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>1st.</hi> It is certain, that this Liberal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowing
is not left at Liberty, it is not only a commendable thing, but a
necessary Duty; Actual Giving, is necessar to all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as they have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion:
and a Disposition or Inclination to it: is necessary in all <hi>Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply.</hi>
This is clear, first, from the command of God, of which before
considering, especially that breaking of one Command, is a Breach
of the whole Law, being a despising of Gods Authority, See <hi>Jam.
2.</hi> 10. 11.</p>
            <p>Also from the Threatnings of the Wrath of God, against Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glecters
of this Duty <hi>Prov.</hi> 21. 13. and 28. 27. A Curse not only
from the Poor who are defrauded, but from Angels and God Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
shall be on him, saith <hi>Gejerus</hi> (a Learned Interpreter) <hi>Matt,

Another Truth here comprehended is, As People must give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt
to God of all other Actings, or omissions; so especially of
this, how they have employed what God gave them in the World,
you are not Accomptable to Men, how you spend what is your
own (Though it is a pity that profuse Wasters are not punished as
Posts among Men, and Destroyers, or Weakners of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth)
yet God will surely call you to an Accompt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>arly
what proportion of your Goods you have given to the Poor, or
whether you have <hi>eaten your Morsel alone;</hi> This is no doubt a part
of our Stewardship, or trust, that we have from the Lord, of which
we must give an Accompt. <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 12. And that this is designed in
that Parable may be gathered from verse 9. where the Application
of the Parable is, That <hi>Men should make Friends of the Mammon,</hi>
(or Riches) of <hi>Unrighteousness</hi> (Riches are so called, because much
Unrighteousness is Acted in the World in getting, in keeping and in
useing them) in order to <hi>Everlasting Habitations;</hi> The meaning is,
that people should use their Riches, or what they Enjoy, with respect
to their appearance at Judgement: Which if it were minded, the Poor
would get a better share then they do; That this is aimed at, is also
clear from ver. 11. 12. Where Faithfulness in useing Worldly Goods
is mentioned, which could not be, if these were not a Trust, that
Men have from God, the Giver of them, of which they must give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
to him: This Truth is also manifest from the account we have
of the last Judgement, <hi>Math.</hi> 25. Where peoples Charity, in reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Poor and distressed, is the one thing mentioned about which
God will Reckon with Men: And surely it will be in a special manner
taken notice of.</p>
            <p>A Third particular included in the Doctrine is, <hi>God will reward
this Liberality to the Poor,</hi> the Text is a plain proof of this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Also <hi>Prov.
19.</hi> 17 where ye see, that they that lay out their Goods thus have Gods
Word for a sure and abundant payment, and his Word is surer than
Mens Bond, Yea then the surest Right, or even possession that ye
can have, <hi>Mat. 10. 42. Heb. 6. 10. Ecl.</hi> 11. 1. And this Giving
is called Sowing, which useth to yeild a plentiful Crop, much more
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62034:6"/>
income, then is laid out. <hi>2 Cor. 9. 6. Prov. 11. 24. Gal. 6, 7, 8,
9. 10. Prov. 3. 9. 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> This Reward is not of Debt, as if our Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
could merit, but of Grace; The Lords Gracious Testimony of
approving so good a Work. The Blessings that are the Reward of
this Good Work, are always real and sure, and to them who do it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
and from a good Principle, they are Eternal: But often they
are visible and observable by Men; sometimes the Lord Blesseth such
with Riches and Increase of Goods, Whereas there is a secret Moth
and invisible Consumption upon the Estates of them, who do no
good Works this Way.</p>
            <p>A Blessing to posterity is often the fruit of this Grace, <hi>Psal. 112:
2.</hi> It is spoken of the Charitable Man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Instances of this may be given;
if it were fit to mention the Names of persons so publickly.</p>
            <p>It is the way to raise or to Establish a Family, A good Name, Praise
and Esteem among Men is often the Reward of this good Work, the
Remembrance of such is savory and with respect; The Hospital hard
by is an Instance of this, <hi>George Heriot</hi> is Remembred with Honour,
when the Names of Hoording Misers, and profuse Wasters, on their
Lusts, do Wither, are forgotten that they were on Earth, or are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
spoken off to their Disgrace. And not only the founder, but such as
have improved and promoted this good Work, and made this Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to extend to 4 or 5 times as many moe as could have
the benefite of it a few Years agoe,<note place="margin">Tho. Fisher Treasurer.</note> such I say God
will Bless, and Man will praise.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse.</hi> That which I shall chiefly insist on by way of Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> To press this Duty on them that hear me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> many
things which may be used as Motives are already and occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally
mentioned: And I believe none of us, when we consider
the Duty in it self, will deny that it ought to be our care to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
it, but most Men notwithstanding make a shift to excuse them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
and quiet their Consciences in the shameful neglect of it, I
shall therefore speak but to Three Heads here. <hi>First.</hi> What Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
Liberality should we use. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Who should use it.
<hi>Thirdly,</hi> What usually hindereth it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:62034:7"/>
For the <hi>First.</hi> These Works Regard the Bodies of People, or
their Souls, or the publick state of the Nation or Church. Charity to
Peoples Bodies is manifold. By giving Liberally to the Weekly Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
at the Church door, it is God's Ordinance, <hi>2 Cor.</hi> 16. 1. 2.
And it is the stock out of which many Poor are Relieved. Giving to
particular needy persons, The Widows, the Fatherless, the Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
the Sick, and Infirm, these who by any cross providences have
had any such losses as bringeth them to need the Charity of others,
poor Families who do what they can to live, and yet cannot subsist
without the help of others. Lending to some without usury is as
really a Duty, and as great a Work of Charity, as giving a little to
others. <hi>Psal.</hi> 112. 5. Breeding of Young Ones, Boys, or Girles.
If every Family that is Rich, or can live well, should take a Young one
and feed them, and Cloath them, and breed them in Religion, and to
such Learning as they are capable of, or is fitt for them, and put them
to Trades, what a Blessing would it be to the Nation? There would
not be so many Idle persons, Theives and other Debauched persons,
who are a burden to City and Country, and it might entail a
Blessing on such Families.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly.</hi> We should mind that Charitable bestowing that contribut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to the good of peoples Souls, such as giving somewhat for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation
of the Gospel in places of Ignorance and Barbarity; As
great Men might contribute much to the Propagation of the Gospel
in the Heathen and Turkish parts of the World, so Mean Men might
do somewhat towards advancing Religion among our <hi>Highlanders:</hi>
An excellent and worthy person in our Neighbour-Nation, hath late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
caused print the Bible in the Highland Language, and sent a great
quantity of them to be distributed among that people O! that some
among our Selves would imitate so worthy a Pattern. Wayes enough
may be found how such Charity might be well employed; <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 's a good
Work to contribute to the placeing of Ministers, where they are
wanting, and Encourageing them where they are placed:
Alas the Covetousness and perverseness of Men in some
places of the Country doth much obstruct the Gospel, Some keep
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62034:7"/>
places, as long vacant as they can. Others defraud Ministers of
what is their due, so that in some places there is a necessity of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving
Ministers for want of Maintainance, as the <hi>Levits</hi> in <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiahs</hi>
time <hi>Neh. 13<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 10, 11. Its sad when there is none to
sh<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>w Charity in such a case, in setleing a Maintainance where it is not,
and sadder when justice is wanting in getting of what is due, and that
to the great detriment of the Souls of People, It's an Act of Charity
to buy Bibles and practical Books, and give them to the poor: as
some have done, and sent them from <hi>London</hi> unto the Remotest places
of that Nation, to be distributed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3dly.</hi> Publick Charity is a good Work, That is highly commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
such as Building and Endowing of Hospitals for the poor, the
Sick, the Aged, Strangers, but especially for Breeding of Young
Ones, whether Boys or Girles. Examples of this kind are rare and
followed but by few: In the Hospit<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l, that giveth occasion to our meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to day, we have a great instance of publick Charity for Breeding
of Boys. And I understand there is a design on Foot in this City
for the like Charity for Breeding of Girles, which is a pious and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable
work, and which every one that is capable should contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
toward setting it foreward, as some to their great Commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
have already done: It is a work, that may not only be of advantage
to the poor Young Ones, and their necessitous Parents, but may be
of publick advantage (if wisely and faithfully managed) by furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the City and other places with persons fit for service in Familys,
and for all other Employments that are competent to that Sex, instead
of a great many Theives and Whores, and persons good for nothing,
which grow up without being bred either to Religion, or to any thing
else that is good, It is a good Work to improve what is thus begun,
and to make it as useful and extensive as possible, for the ends that
it is <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> for. And when such Donations are embezled or dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidated,
whether by unfaithfulness, or Negligence, it is a Heynous
Sin. It is als<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> for the publick good to Erect Schools and Colledges to
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Bursarys, whereby many good Spirits, which through pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
might be lost, are trained up for the publick Service; and they who
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62034:8"/>
cannot do thus, might take a poor Student into their house for a time:
Also helping of publick Libraries and augmenting them, that
they may be stored with all the best Books for the help of them, that
cannot buy of their own: It is very strange, that this age is so far
short of former ages, in all these sorts of Liberality.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly.</hi> The second thing proposed is, Who should be thus Liberal<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
for private Charity all are obliged to it, according to their Capacity:
publick Charity is out of the reach of many, and there are more who
do not what they well might do this way, it is true, it is only to be
expected from them who have somewhat to spare from the Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainance
of their Familys: But if people were less profuse that way,
they would have more to give for a pious and good use. I shall then
shew you from whom such Charity might be expected, First, from
Childless persons, it is they who have been ordinarily most Eminent
in these good Works, especially if they have few necessitous Friends
to relieve, and even they who have these; The publick Necessities
should have a good share of their Means. <hi>Secondly,</hi> They who have
much Wealth and few Children, it is a great evil in many, that they
think nothing enough to provide for their Children, many give to
their<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Children so much, that it is a snare, maketh them mind no
Industry nor Vertue, yea they destroy it and their Souls to the boot,
in spending what their parents have laid up for them: Therefore it is
the wisdom of Rich parents to give their Children what they may
comfortably live on, useing Industry and Frugality, and the rest to
lay out for good uses, especially if Children be not so wise, Sober,
and Religious as they should be, they are to be entrusted with the less.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3ly,</hi> Thirdly, Even they who have much Wealth and many Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
they should not be wholly wanting to this Duty, a little taken
off every Childs portion and piously laid out may entail a Blessing on
the Children to their greater Wordly Advantage, See <hi>Prov.</hi> 20, 7. If
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> would consider that it is the Blessing of the Lord that maketh
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>; and it is that Blessing that raiseth and preserveth great Families,
they would be more careful to lay up a Blessing for them, then to
lay up great Riches for them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:62034:8"/>
               <hi>3ly.</hi> The third thing is, What doth usually hinder this Charitable
Liberality. The Love of the World: The Heart cleaving to it, too
high esteem of it, whereby having it is preferred to the Souls good
and peace, and to pleasing God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly,</hi> Want of, or defectiveness in the Love of God. <hi>1 Jo,</hi> 3, 17.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3dly.</hi> A narrow ſelfish temper, want of a publick Spirit; many act
as if nothing were to be regarded but themselves, as if themselves
were their last end.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4 Fourthly,</hi> Distrust of God's providence: people will not believe
that their Bread cast on the Waters shall be recovered, or that if they
Sow they shall Reap, they have no such perswasion of the Truth of
the Word, as that they can venture any thing upon it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Fifthly,</hi> Pride and Luxury: People that overvalue themselves
and despise others, think nothing enough for themselves, and any
thing too much for others, and people that profusely spend on their
pride, Vanity, pleasures and Lusts, can spare nothing for any
good use; It hath always been observed, that they who have done
most good, were such as were Frugal in their Expences on themselves,
they who spend least needlesly, do bestow most Charitably.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>6. Sixtly,</hi> It hath been often a lett and discouragement to Liberal
Charity when it is observed, that what is given that way is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
or used amiss, by them who were entrusted with it, this, as it is
a great guilt in it self, being Theft and Sacriledge, so it is the Ruin of
publick good Works, but it will be a Mo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h, wherever it is found, and
it is the part of them, who are in Capacity, to retrieve what others have
done amiss this way; <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> some are endeavouring to do.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse</hi> 2. What other Exhortation may be given on this occasion is
often spoken to, wherefore I hint at but a few words. <hi>2ly.</hi> Then, let
Overseers of the Hospital and of other Mortifications, take care that
what is given for so good Ends, may be employed to the best advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
according to the will of the Donor, it is a trust laid on them by
God and Man, and they must Answer for it; It is not only the duty of
such Trustees, to see that the Charity of others be not lost, or if lost,
that it may be recovered, but also that it be not mis-placed, either on
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62034:9"/>
such as need it nor: Exact Conscienciousness (is to be used here, so as
not to be byassed by any Interest, or Entreaties) or on such as are wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
inclined and debauched: (when such evils appear in them they
should be turned out) nor on them who are uncapable to learn or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect
to learn, what they are bred to: Benefices should be taken
from such and conferred upon them who are like to improve them
bette</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse.</hi> 3 Another Exhortation is to the <hi>Governours</hi> and <hi>Teachers</hi> of
the Youth, who are partakers of this Charity for their Education<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It
lyeth on you to teach them carefully what they ought to Learn, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
the grounds of Religion, that they may not only Repeat the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techism,
but understand it: you should put them in mind to pray and
to Read the Scriptures daily, and curb any budding of Vice that may
appear in them, as Swearing, Lying and such like: your Faithfulness
or neglect in this may have much influence to attain the ends for
which this Charity is given, or to defeat the design of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse.</hi> 4 The last Address shall be to the <hi>Young Ones</hi> on whom this
Charity is bestowed, and for whose good it is bestowed, Acknowledge
God's goodness in providing so for you: Labour to fear God,
without which it had been better for you ye had never been Born, or
that ye had Starv'd in stead of being cared for: And if ye can apply
your Minds to think on what is to come<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Think what will become
of Your Souls for ever, And consider also how ye shall live in the
World, if you neglect and mis-spend your time, wherein ye should
be sitted for Serving God, and providing for your selves, ye are like to
live Miserably<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in Contempt all <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

               </gap>: And if ye give your
selves to Wickedness now, Satan may go such hold on your Hearts
as never to leave Tempting you, till he bring you to a woeful End;
Pray that the Lord may win your Hearts to him betimes.</p>
