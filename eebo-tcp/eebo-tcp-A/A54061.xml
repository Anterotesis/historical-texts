            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Semphronia's Farewel,
OR AN
ELEGY</head>
            <byline>Written by D. P.</byline>
            <l>STay Gentle Thames, one moment ſtay thy Courſe,</l>
            <l>And of my Ruine view the Fatal Source.</l>
            <l>To Thee <hi>Semphronia</hi> will her ſorrow tell,</l>
            <l>And then for ever muſt thee bid farewel.</l>
            <l>In her the greateſt, ſaddeſt Scene thou'lt ſee,</l>
            <l>Of Love and Fortunes ſtrange Inconſtancy:</l>
            <l>They once did ſtrive my hours with Joys to Crown,</l>
            <l>But now Conſpire to pull my Glories down.</l>
            <l>Thou knoweſt, when firſt upon thy Banks I came.</l>
            <l>I ſet all thoſe who ſaw me in a flame,</l>
            <l>No Heart approacht me, but did Tribute pay,</l>
            <l>I made a thouſand Conqueſts every day.</l>
            <l>But more than Millions, one I much did prize,</l>
            <l>A Mighty Prince ſubdued by my Eyes.</l>
            <l>Heavens! with what Luſtre did he make his Courts?</l>
            <l>What Maid? what Goddeſs could maintain the Forts?</l>
            <l>Such Arts, ſuch tempting Forts he did employ,</l>
            <l>To ſuch a Lover, what Nymph could 'ere be coy.</l>
            <l>Him all my Virgin-Treaſure I did give,</l>
            <l>Gods! in what Bliſs and Rapture did we live.</l>
            <l>By every Courtier I was then Ador'd;</l>
            <l>And Offerings brought by each Aſpiring Lord.</l>
            <l>All Foreign Miniſters to me did crow'd;</l>
            <l>Nay, Zeal, Religion too, then to me bow'd:</l>
            <l>Even Thou thy ſelf, thy Streams wouldſt often ſtay;</l>
            <l>Curl, then run on, ſo ſmooth, ſo pleas'd and gay:</l>
            <l>All thoſe that ſaw Thee, ſaid thou wert inſpir'd,</l>
            <l>Thy waters ſparkling, they thought I thee had fir'd.</l>
            <l>Such were the Triumphs of my Blooming Reign,</l>
            <l>I thought I could do nothing then in vain.</l>
            <l>But now alas I find my ſelf deceiv'd,</l>
            <l>And of my pleaſant Joys and Hopes bereav'd.</l>
            <l>Envy, that conſtant Enemy to Bliſs,</l>
            <l>Was mad, my Ruin it ſo long ſhould miſs.</l>
            <l>It then Caball'd, New Beauties brought to Court,</l>
            <l>In Swarms they came, in Flocks they then Reſort;</l>
            <l>And each ambitious Courtier choſe ſome One,</l>
            <l>Expecting ſhe would all my Charms Dethrone;</l>
            <l>But all their Powers and Beauties I defi'd,</l>
            <l>Their Arts, Enchantments, Dazlings I out-vi'd;</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:99747:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
And did them all ſo utterly defeat,</l>
            <l>That they with ſhame and bluſhes did retreat.</l>
            <l>And when they ſaw that all this was in vain,</l>
            <l>They then did trye my Loyalty to ſtain.</l>
            <l>Of horrid Treachery I was accus'd,</l>
            <l>And that the Noble Favour I abus'd.</l>
            <l>That I French Intereſts did moſt promote,</l>
            <l>And Cabinet-Secrets to their Council wrote.</l>
            <l>That Plots and Treaſons did my thoughts all ſteer;</l>
            <l>That Popes and Jeſuites my chief Favourites were.</l>
            <l>In this their Malice did cruelly ſucceed,</l>
            <l>And the whole Nation cry'd I ought to bleed.</l>
            <l>Tho' I was brought into a wretched ſtate;</l>
            <l>The Great Ones horrour, and the Peoples hate.</l>
            <l>My Noble Lovers nothing would believe</l>
            <l>They bid me leave my Tears, and ceaſe to grieve.</l>
            <l>New Favours they beſtow'd, ſeem'd more inflam'd,</l>
            <l>And me they chid if the leaſt fears I nam'd;</l>
            <l>Yet I the Peoples fury to appeaſe,</l>
            <l>And that I might be ſafe and more at eaſe,</l>
            <l>The Plotting Party I did quite diſown,</l>
            <l>And the next Heir would have put by the Throne.</l>
            <l>The Parliament I ſeem'd to countenance,</l>
            <l>And for to check the Intereſt of <hi>France.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>By ſuch like courſes I the people pleas'd,</l>
            <l>And in few weeks all their fierce anger ſeiz'd.</l>
            <l>I fancy'd then I was for e're ſecure,</l>
            <l>That Love and Fortune muſt my Yoke endure.</l>
            <l>But they both my Ruin have contriv'd,</l>
            <l>And at one blow of all I had depriv'd.</l>
            <l>Love now New Beautys, has brought into play,</l>
            <l>To whom my Lovers now do honour pay.</l>
            <l>Now all my Glories will Ecclipſed be,</l>
            <l>And I muſt ſtoop to Fortunes Tyranny.</l>
            <l>Reſpects and Honours that to me were paid,</l>
            <l>Now at the Feet of others muſt be laid.</l>
            <l>And all the Incenſe I did e're receive,</l>
            <l>To other ſparkling Stars I now muſt leave,</l>
            <l>Each Fawning Courtier, their Triumphs do tend;</l>
            <l>And now, that my great Empires at an end,</l>
            <l>They ſmile and laugh, nay, and they ſcorn me too,</l>
            <l>Even thoſe who did with adoration woe.</l>
            <l>Such is the fickleneſs of this fond world,</l>
            <l>To day we're high, to morrow down we're hurl'd,</l>
            <l>But I forget, I Thee too long detain:</l>
            <l>And keep thee from the Boſom of the Main.</l>
            <l>Goe on, kind Thames, goe on, purſue thy way,</l>
            <l>And pardon me that I have made thee ſtay.</l>
            <l>To make amends, thy Streams I will encreaſe,</l>
            <l>With Flouds of Tears, that never, never ceaſe.</l>
            <l>And that thy Tide may the more ſwiftly flow,</l>
            <l>A Gale of Sighs ſhall like a Tempeſt blow.</l>
