            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
BELGICK SOVLDIER:
VVarre was a Bleſſing.</head>
            <p>WHen <hi>Athanatius</hi> oppoſed the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of <hi>Arrian</hi> Biſhops, it ſeemed ſo
dangerous to the eſtabliſhed gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Empire, that his caſtigation was threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tned
by expulſion or feare; Yea <hi>Liberius</hi> that tooke
his part, was checked by the Emperours owne letters
for affecting the opinion of that wicked man; But
when againe his faire demeanour and religious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy
drew away the veile of ſuperſtition, ignorance,
and hereſie: whereby the Emperours eyes were ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to reioyce in the ſunny ſplendor of truth; <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi>
admitted him within his embraces: and all
thoſe adherents of <hi>Arrius</hi> were confounded by their
owne wilfulnes.</p>
            <p>Thus hath it fared with all innouations; yea,
Chriſt himſelfe was ſubiect to traducing, for aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thoſe ceremonies on which the Iewes were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſotted,
for propheſing againſt that Temple, about
which the Prieſts were ſo puſſled, and for preaching
<pb facs="tcp:17489:3"/>
the doctrine of ſaluation, againſt which the people
were ſo enraged; and yet in the end, they that were
not credulous of his doctrine and miracles when he
was aliue, beleeued a few Fiſher-mens reports after
he was dead.</p>
            <p>Thus muſt I needs incurre the diſpleaſure of time
ſeruers, the ſcoffs and diriſion of Papiſts, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining
of Hiſpanoliſed Engliſh, when I goe about to
proue, that warre hath beene better then peace, and
the Common-wealth and religion of <hi>England,</hi> haue
had their fame and propagation by oppoſing Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,
and in plaine termes, muſt recouer her ecclipſed
proſperitie reputing <hi>Spaine</hi> our oppoſite. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
whom, let me remember what is reported of
<hi>Caeſar,</hi> who hearing of the death of a Roman Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
that had liued merrily and ſecurely, yet dyed
greatly in debt and mens dangers: he deſired to buy
his bed and pillow, deeming ſome rare vertue to be
therein, whereon a man could ſleepe ſo ſoundly that
liued in ſo manifeſt trouble. So though I deſire no
pillow nor bed from vnder the King of <hi>Spaine:</hi> yet
with <hi>Caeſar</hi> I proteſt, there is ſome wonder of nature
belongs to him, that can ſleepe at all, hauing ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
encombrances to wraſtle with, and intricate ſedgy
weedes of diſturbances to winde out of.</p>
            <p>For euer ſince <hi>Phillip</hi> the ſeconds marriage with
<hi>England,</hi> and that the ambitious humor in being an
Emperours ſonne, ſwelled beyond the degrees of
compariſon with other Princes: how hath <hi>Spaine</hi>
beſtird himſelfe to the affrighting of <hi>Europe,</hi> and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
of purpoſe out of his owne faire and ſerend ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to looke on his neighbours with retrograde
<pb facs="tcp:17489:3"/>
aſpects in contrarious orbes: ſo that other Kings may
demaund, what hath <hi>Spaine</hi> to do in moſt of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces
of <hi>Europe:</hi> which at this inſtant toucheth
<hi>France</hi> and <hi>England</hi> ſo neere, that they had need deale
with him; as <hi>Henry</hi> the 8 did of famous memory.</p>
            <p>At firſt by reaſon of conſanguinity (yet perſonall
mariages doe not rule Princes affaires,) he ioyned
with the Emperour againſt <hi>France,</hi> and by his anxili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary
forces <hi>Charles</hi> the 5 not onely expulſed the <hi>French</hi>
out of <hi>Italy,</hi> but at laſt ſacked <hi>Rome,</hi> and tooke the
Pope and his Cardinalls priſoners; as he had done
the <hi>French</hi> King at the battell of <hi>Pauy;</hi> but as he was
running away with theſe aduantages, King <hi>Henry</hi>
looked about him, and entertained a kinde of ielouſie
againſt his greatneſſe, as ſuſpecting what an ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
conquerour might effect: whereupon by degrees
he retracted, ſuppoſing it high time to rebate his
inſolency, and lay as it were a cooling card vpon his
forwardneſſe. So not onely the <hi>French</hi> King was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiued,
but Pope <hi>Clement</hi> ranſomed.</p>
            <p>If it be thus, and that there is a kinde of polliticall
neceſſitie among Princes to watch the affaires of one
another; I hope it is now time to looke vpon <hi>Spaines</hi>
intruſions, and not onely prouide for our ſelues, but
releeue our neighbours, leaſt we haue more danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
neighbours, then we either deſire, or ſhall be
able to preuent. But if we be ſenſible of preſent loſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
wrongs, diſgraces, affronts, and intollerable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignities,
let vs rouſe vp our ſelues, and redeeme
our loſt time with quick and ſeaſonable remedies: and
if peace haue abuſed vs, let warre a Gods name re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire
our credits, and reſtore our decay. There is
<pb facs="tcp:17489:4"/>
no poiſon againſt nature, but may be countermanded
by an antidote; Yea, it is an axiome in Philoſophy,
that preuenting Phiſicke is better then curing; and
the law of preſeruation is incident to all creatures.</p>
            <p>But heere me thinkes, ſome couetuous wretch,
churliſh Farmer, ſcurrulous Lawyer, or temporiſing
paraſite may interiect theſe doubts. 1. Whether we
haue ſufficient occaſion or no, to fall out with <hi>Spaine.</hi>
2. How ſhall a warre be maintained. 3. Where
the ſeate of this warre ſhall be. 4. Who ſhall be
called to our aſſiſtance. 5. And laſt of all, Whether
the Countrey be willing and able to ſuch a deſigne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
To all which I anſwer directly, the State, or
Councell of warre muſt deſide theſe things. For as
it is in Martiall affaires, let the Generall be neuer ſo
wiſe, and the Commanders neuer ſo valiant: yet
when proiects of conſequence are propoſed, a
Martiall Court is called, and an orderly debating the
matter concludeth for the beſt. So I referre this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
to the directer of princes hearts, and the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
cauſe of a countries proſperity, &amp; wiſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors.
And I pray all true hearted Engliſhmen, let
this my diſcourſe diſcouer my good intents; as for
other difficulties, I referre them to good ſucceſſe. But
becauſe mony is the ſinews of the war, and that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at
is our ſtop and repining, I anſwer the objector.
Why ſhould we be more vnfortunate now, then we
haue beene? the warre hath brought vs in treaſure:
and why ſhould we now diſpaire, or terrefie one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with ſuſpition, or diſhartning queſtions. When
the Scripture tells vs, that if <hi>Dauid</hi> will be ruled by
<hi>Ioab,</hi> and come to the taking of <hi>Rabbah,</hi> the Kings
<pb facs="tcp:17489:4"/>
Crowne ſhall be ſet on his head, which weighed a
tallent of gold, full of precious ſtones: beſides the
ſpoile of the Citty, which was in exceeding great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance.
As for the deceites of peace, and thoſe
bewitching flatteries of pollitick inſinnuation; let
it be the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> or whom it will, we muſt not truſt
either a reconciled enemy, or a diſſembling friend.</p>
            <p>But to come to the purpoſe, and ſome illuſtration
in the defence of warre; He that pleaded for peace,
<hi>Tully</hi> himſelfe I meane, and cryed out in an inſulting
brauery: that the armed caſſocks muſt giue way to
the Senators gownes, yet ſaies plainely: that warrs
may be vndertaken either for the propulſing of iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
or procuring of peace, not ſo much to giue way
to reuenge, as to keepe other princes in a good opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that we know what is wrong, and when it is time
to redreſſe iniuries. I could ſay, that warre ſometimes
may be vndertaken for enlarging Dominions. As
<hi>Salomon</hi> made all his neighbour Prouinces tributary
vnto him, and ſo he ruled from <hi>Euphrates</hi> to <hi>Sidon,</hi>
and the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea. I could alledge that all
the famouſſeſt Common-wealths in the world, haue
augmented their territories by the actiue imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Heroick ſpirits, and receiued a fulneſſe of
wealth and renowne from the raging Sea of
turbulency and warre. I could produce examples
of Scripture, to proue directly that <hi>Daniels</hi> Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies
ſucceeded one another by the preuailing of
mighty armies, and the ſtronger euer ſhouldred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
the weaker. I could adde, that the corruptions
of peace in all ages, haue like ſtanding pooles increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
durt and ſlime; that is, pleaſures and impieties:
<pb facs="tcp:17489:5"/>
which haue growne to that outragiouſneſſe, that men
haue forgot their firſt benefactor, and with a luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferion
rebellion continually defied God in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty,
liuing as if we ſhould neuer die, and dying as if
there were no after account to be made; And yet
we dote on peace. And I am afraid, will rather lep
on ſhore to be deſtroyed by the incantations of the
daughters of <hi>Achelous,</hi> then tie our ſelues to the maſt
of <hi>Vliſſes</hi> ſhip, to be ſecured from the temptation.</p>
            <p>But I purpoſe no ſuch diſcourſes, onely a ſmall
encheridion, to proue that warre was a bleſſing, and
hath beene allowed from heauen: and that a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
peace hath increaſed ſinnes, and ſin brought
Gods vengeance vpon ſuch tainted Kingdomes.
There was a warre in <hi>Rebeccas</hi> wombe betweene her
children: and <hi>Iacobs</hi> bleſſings proceeded from wra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtling
with God. There was a warre in deliuering the
Church out of bondage, or elſe <hi>Iſrael</hi> had beene ſtill
moyling in the brick-kills of <hi>Egipt,</hi> but at laſt <hi>Canaan</hi>
was ſubiected, and Gods people made glorious for
euer. It was a warre that charactered <hi>Salomon</hi> the
Prince of peace: or elſe why are <hi>Dauids</hi> worthies, and
their actions ſet downe by name. It was a warre that
finiſhed <hi>Octauius</hi> troubles, and ſurnamed him <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus.</hi>
And in many places you ſhall reade, that
God did fight from heauen againſt his peoples ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;
What ſhall warre come from heauen, and
ſhall we be afraid of it on earth: God forbid. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
that in the times of peace, when the warres
had ſet the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> downe in the chaire of
tranquillity, euen then forgat they both God and
themſelues, ſtretching out their limbs on beds of
<pb facs="tcp:17489:5"/>
iuory, carowſing in goblets of gold, and killing the fat
lambs of the flocke: but no man remembred the
affliction of <hi>Ioſeph;</hi> may I not well then conclude,
that warre was a bleſſing. And thus much for warre
before Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Now you ſhall ſee what warre and peace haue both
done, ſince Chriſtianity tooke a fairer progreſſe, and
God had determined that his Church ſhould floriſh
through the diſſention of the Nations; For although
by the firſt perſecutions it had a feareful diſhartning,
and by the augmentation the pompous Papacy, a
more fearefull ſuppreſſion and martirdome: yet ſuch
was the will of God. That as <hi>Siria, Edom, Moab, Egipt,</hi>
and the Iland <hi>Gentiles,</hi> one were their owne enemies,
and Gods inſtruments to deſtroy one another. So in
the beginning of Chriſtianity, the barbarous nations
that poſſeſſed <hi>Europe,</hi> although they made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
fortunate by the warres: yet in the end they
conſumed themſelues; and from their ruines the
Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> became great, and from their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
through the ſwelling proſperity of peace, the
true Church of God by little and little diſpelled the
clouds of their contempt, and deiected: and ſo at
laſt obtained that faire ſunſhine, which is now ſo tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlatent.</p>
            <p>Some 300 yeere after Chriſt, or there about, you
ſhall reade that in <hi>Goteland,</hi> and thoſe northen regions
now called <hi>Finmarck, Norway</hi> and <hi>Sweden,</hi> the peace
had ſo multiplied the people, and thoſe remote
healthfull Countries affoorded them ſo long liues,
that they could not liue one by another: ſo that the
aged, impotent, and beggers ſwarmed in euery place;
<pb facs="tcp:17489:6"/>
at which time one <hi>Stenio</hi> was the principall Monarch,
who called a councell to redreſſe theſe inconuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and they concluded to take them all that were
ſo vnprofitable to the Common-wealth, and tying
them backe to backe, throw them into the ſea. But
when the Queene whoſe name was <hi>Iuditha,</hi> heard of
ſo cruell and vnmercifull a doome, ſhe could not
containe her ſelfe, but at the Kings returne kneeled
before him, deſiring to haue it reuerſed: for ſhe
had found a better way of preuention and effect of
cha<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>itie: which was to ſhip the people, and let them
try their fortune in other places: which was both
nobly apprehended, and effectually practiſed; and
ſo in proceſſe of time they poſſeſſed thoſe Countries
which you now call <hi>Seruia, Bulgaria, Moldunia, Pedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia:</hi>
and at laſt became famous Nations of <hi>Gotes</hi> and
<hi>Lombards,</hi> infeſting <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> and diſpoſſeſſing
the Emperours, who had called them into their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours;
thus the warres made them famous, till by the
warres of Chriſtian Emperours they were diſpelled
and extirped againe. Afterward the <hi>Othoman</hi> fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
comming out of that Countrey you once called
<hi>Scithia,</hi> augmented their reputation by the warres
of <hi>Aſia.</hi> So did <hi>Tamberlaine</hi> conquer <hi>Perſia,</hi> and
claimed renowne to his Actions by famous battell.
So did the <hi>Turks</hi> come into <hi>Europe.</hi> And all the
beggerly Nations of the world became rich and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
by rayſing of warre, and were diminiſhed and
conſumed to nothing by the corruption of peace, and
bewitching of pleaſure.</p>
            <p>Thus receiued the Papacy the fulneſſe of her
progreſſion by the warres of the Countries,
<pb facs="tcp:17489:6"/>
eſpecially after the <hi>German</hi> Eagle had affoorded her
ſome feathers of her wings: then tooke ſhe a flight
beyond reach, and at laſt ſtradles ouer <hi>Rome,</hi> making
<hi>Rome</hi> haue roome of precidency before other King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes.
So that I may well ſay, the barren ſoile of
their potency was watred and manured with the
blood of Souldiers, as the Prouinces of <hi>Europe</hi> ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
together the ſcattered bodies of <hi>Pelops,</hi> and
made a more perfect body then the firſt. Thus
did the Popes floriſh by forreigne warres, and
ſetting Emperours on worke to deſtroy one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>But now what became of their owne peace
and eſtabliſhed greatneſſe? they fell to pride,
gurmundize, and riot, they ſupplanted one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
they proued incendiaries to Chriſtendome,
they intertained newmantict ſpells, with diueliſh
and exoptick Artes: they practiſed murther, whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and inceſts, they depoſed one another, they
attempted the humiliation of Emperours, and
made a ſport at the inauguration of Kings and
Princes, as if it lay in their power with a Prophets
hand, to tumble aſide their faſteſt Diadems. In
a word, they grew proud with peace and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and as warre had cauſed their greatneſſe, they
cauſed their ſinnes to be more great through the
corruption of proſperity: ſo that from morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
Preachers and Miniſters of Gods word,
they grow Statiſts, and diueliſh Pollititians:
then from Schollers, they proued proficients in
Villanie; rayſing Quarrells againſt Princes,
<pb facs="tcp:17489:7"/>
and exciting Princes one againſt another; So that I
may well ſay according to their owne computation,
that warre was a bleſſing. And if the Nations had
maintained their priſtinate quietneſſe and idolatry,
they had neuer floriſhed in ſuch outward brauery,
and viſibility as they now boaſt of. And thus you
ſee how the warres haue beene beneficiall to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy.</p>
            <p>Now it remaines to proue, how the true Church
of God hath receiued her beſt floriſhes by warres;
It is but ſuperfluous to repeate what other men haue
written in the defence of our Church, prouing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly,
that from the Primitiue Church to this houre,
God euer had a remnant of people: and in moſt
Countries there were ſuch as profeſſed the truth in
deſpight of fire. But I referre you to the Hiſtory of
the Church, and other learned tractate compoſed by
religious men.</p>
            <p>I come to the dayes of <hi>wickliffe,</hi> after whom fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the <hi>Bohemian</hi> warres: whith were the firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant
warres for the Goſpell that I reade of. For the
great <hi>Ziſea</hi> proued a conqueror; and although <hi>Iohn
Huſs,</hi> and <hi>Hierome</hi> of <hi>Prague</hi> ſacrificed themſelues, and
were expoſed to the fire for Chriſts ſake; which
might haue deterred men from taking their parts,
and profeſſing the truth: yet did the Goſpell increaſe
ouer <hi>Europe,</hi> and the warres taught thouſands of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
a ſong of conſtancy: and a burning zeale made
their hands fight for the liberty of their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
            <p>But when <hi>Luther</hi> came to act his part, the warres
of <hi>Germany</hi> made way to the peace of the Proteſtants;
<pb facs="tcp:17489:7"/>
And as you reade of many, that hearing <hi>Platos</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
of the immortallity of the ſoule, longed for the
ſame, and wiſhed, yea, procured to die. So whole
multitudes expoſed themſelues to torture for Chriſts
ſake: and as the warres and perſecutions augmented
their puniſhments, they augmented their ioy for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo perſecuted, and tooke a pleaſure in the diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of princes againſt them for Gods ſake. <hi>France</hi>
became a rare preſident, and very quickly the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
multiplied ſo faſt: that with the Iewes they
forgat the ceremonies of the Saboth, and applied the
Law of preſervation, whereby nature taught them to
take vp Armes in their owne defences; then ſtood
<hi>Geneua</hi> on their guard: then <hi>Denmarke, Norway, Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
England, Scotland,</hi> and diuers Ilands and Townes
from being ſlaues to the conclaue of Cardinalls, ſent
defiance to <hi>Rome,</hi> and breake the yoakes of their
captiuity: from impoueriſhing their Countrie, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching
their owne treaſures, to the augmentation of
the dignity of Common-wealths: from proſtituting
their wiues and daughters to the libidinous luſts of
Prieſts clenſed themſelues with the water of chaſtety,
and tooke a pleaſure in vndefiled beds: from the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
of the Cardinalls, and thundring of excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
they went with peace and contrition of foule
to Gods alter, obtaining ſo remiſſion of ſinnes, and
aſſurance of ſaluation. So that I may well ſay, the
hand that ſtretched to pul the Prophet by the throat,
is whithered and dried vp: yea, except the Prophet
pray to God, <hi>Iereboham</hi> ſhall not recover, not be able
to lift it vp againe. If it be thus, was not warre a
bleſſing? and hath not Religion beene propagated
<pb facs="tcp:17489:8"/>
by that meanes.</p>
            <p>But becauſe you looke for more moderne particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
let vs come neerer home, and obſerue how Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
hath proſpered, and the Nations bin enriched
by the warres and contentions with <hi>Spaine, Auſtria,</hi>
and the Papacy, 1. in <hi>Germany, 2. France, 3.</hi> the <hi>Low
Countries,</hi> 4. and <hi>England</hi> it ſelfe: and how peace, or
if you will diſſembling contracts of peace, haue abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
vs at all times.</p>
            <p>Concerning <hi>Germany</hi> and the Empire; when <hi>Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus
quintus</hi> perceiued the ſunny ſplendor of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtantiſme
to be more and more radiant, for all he
had interpoſed divers clouds and miſty vapours, and
became ſuſpitious of ſundry Princes greatneſſe, after
the Duke of <hi>Saxonies</hi> protecting of <hi>Luther,</hi> as obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
that the warres would not onely make them fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious,
which appeared by the impriſonment of the
<hi>Lantſgraue</hi> of <hi>Heſse,</hi> but teach them a way both of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
and oppoſition; he tooke another courſe to
corroborate his owne greatneſſe, and extenuate the
ſtrength of Religion, and this was by making a
peace, and withdrawing himſelfe from the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſomneſſe
of State: wherein, as it often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth
with cowardly polliticians, who by ſeeking
to hide their feare, diſcouer more the ſame. So
played this Emperour, after many famous exploits
and flatteries of fortune, he made the <hi>Germaines</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
he was ſo indulgent ouer the Common-wealth,
that he would affright or trouble them no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but leaue them in peace and libertie of
conſcience: when yet they knew he departed in a
rage, as diſappointed in his pretences, that he could
<pb facs="tcp:17489:8"/>
not incorporate the Empire to his Family. Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
then, that in his latter times he had ſome
checks, and his peace ſhewed not ſo beautifull a face
as his warres. So that he plainely ſaw, that if other
blocks and hindrances were not caſt into the ſmoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
walks, to hinder Religion from her handſome
progreſſe, and debarre the Proteſtant Princes from
vniting, the Maieſty of <hi>Auſtria</hi> would be diminiſhed,
and their potencie fruſtrated; yea his owne renowne
obſcured with malignitie of time, and cloudy threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
of a fatall end; which though it came not
to ſuch a miſery as <hi>Pompeys</hi> loſing his head: yet
might proue as bitter a receit as <hi>Scipios</hi> confining him<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelfe to a countrey grange, who had in his life obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the ſurname of <hi>Africanus,</hi> and in his actions the
renowne of a remarkable vertue. All which came to
paſſe in the harueſt of this Emperours huſbandry. So
that now you ſhall haue ſome particulars concerning
his diſcontents and obſeruations, which he himſelfe
propoſed for the eſtabliſhing the houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> in
the Empire.</p>
            <p>Touching his diſcontents; Firſt, Though he kept
correſpondency with the Duke of <hi>Saxons</hi> humors,
yet he much repined at his audaciouſneſſe, that durſt
maintaine a Frier againſt the Pope and himſelfe, as by
<hi>Luthers</hi> comming to <hi>Wormes</hi> was apparant. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
It amazed him to ſee a greater neglect of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
toward<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> him (for all the uniting of <hi>Spaine, Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy,</hi>
and <hi>Auſtria</hi>) then was before, and that the
declaring himſelfe an eneny to the Proteſtants, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
them the firme friends of the Goſpell of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt. Thirdly, Hee thought there was no
<pb facs="tcp:17489:9"/>
proceedings in the high projects of <hi>Germany.</hi> For
queſtionleſſe King <hi>Henry</hi> of England would take the
Proteſtants parts, and prouide that the Empire
ſhould be ſtill Electiue. Fourthly, That when the
Princes had denied the Diadem, and inveſture to
<hi>Phillip</hi> his ſonne, as diſcovering that he went about
to make it hereditary, and ſo kept all <hi>Europe</hi> in awe by
his treaſure and dominions, he ſtomacked their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnancy,
and would peraduenture haue threatned,
if his power ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d kept correſpondency with his wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſſe
to reuenge. Fiftly. That when the Pope
and the conclaue of Cardinalls would by no meanes
conſent, to haue him ſit in ſuch a chaire of greatneſſe,
as <hi>Spaine,</hi> the <hi>Indies,</hi> the <hi>Empire,</hi> and the <hi>Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries;</hi>
he wreaked his rage from <hi>Rome;</hi> and <hi>Burbon</hi> in
his behalfe ſacked the Citty, impriſoned the Prelates,
and ſet the Pope at a ranſome; whereupon followed
the excommunication both of himſelfe and <hi>Phillip</hi> his
ſonne, and the election of his yong brother <hi>Ferdinand</hi>
Emperour; all which augmented his diſcontents.
Sixtly, That hauing heard of the loſſe of his Nauy
at <hi>Algier,</hi> he ſuſpected a change of fortune, and grew
ſo diſquieted and melancholy, that comming to
<hi>Millaine,</hi> he forgat the ſtate of an Emperour, and
they forgat the duty of obſeruation; For when the
people perceiued that he was careleſſe to ſatisfie their
expectation, they were as careleſſe to gratifie or glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie
him as a Magnificent prince; for in the Citty
they left him all alone in his blacke Spaniſh cape
cloake, and would not attend him downe to his
Galſies. Laſt of all, Comming into <hi>Spaine,</hi> he
found the Clergie humorous againſt him for his
<pb facs="tcp:17489:9"/>
ranſomming Pope <hi>Clement,</hi> and other contumaces a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Church: whereupon perceiuiug his peace
to thriue worſe then his warres, he left all his honors
to his ſonne and brother, and retired himſelfe to the
Monaſtrey of Saint <hi>Laurance,</hi> or <hi>Eſcuriall:</hi> where
within three yeares he finiſhed his life: and yet he
liued to ſay, that warre was to him a bleſſing, farre
beyond his peace.</p>
            <p>2. Touching thoſe fruits of pollicy, it is well
knowne. Firſt, That he not onely proiected him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
but inſtructed his ſonne <hi>Phillip</hi> to make the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
hereditary to the houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and all <hi>Europe</hi>
to depend vpon <hi>Spaines</hi> Monarchy; as by the ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
actions of King <hi>Phillip</hi> was apparant. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
That <hi>Ferdinando</hi> Emperour, be eſpecially carefull
to firme and contract vnto himſelfe by one meanes
or other (eſpecially conſanguinity) the King of
<hi>Poland, Saxony,</hi> and <hi>Bauaria:</hi> as within ſhort time
after came to paſſe. Thirdly, That of all other
things a peace be ratefied with the Gran Signeur,
and correſpondency kept betweene them. Fourthly,
That a iealous eye be had ouer <hi>Prague, Preſburg,</hi> and
<hi>Glatz.</hi> For <hi>Prague</hi> was the abſolute commander of
<hi>Bohemia:</hi> and the Prouinces durſt not ſtart, if the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Citties were Gariſond with Spaniards. Fiftly,
That the Ieſuites be countenanced in their deſignes;
For although the Pope and conclaue of Cardinalls
might repine at their intruſion, and intermedling
with matters of State: yet by their meanes, and
ſanctified religious deuotion, ſuch buſineſſes might
be effected, as ſhould euer tend to the augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Spaines</hi> greatneſſe. Sixtly, That an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall
<pb facs="tcp:17489:10"/>
faction be ever nouriſhed in <hi>Luſatia, Sileſia,</hi>
and <hi>Morauia:</hi> eſpecially that the Catholick Biſhops
be maintained in the ſuppreſſion of the Proteſtants:
who elſe will follow the former Bohemians, in taking
vp Armes againſt their Princes; and therefore the
ſafeſt way were, to diſarme them by one meanes or
other. Seuenthly, That the Gouernour of <hi>Millaine</hi>
in his due time labour to get a footing in <hi>Swittzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
by building ſome fort or fortreſſe to ſecure the
paſſages: that ſo the Armies in <hi>Italy</hi> might march in
peace, or without preiudice ouer the <hi>Alpes</hi> into <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many.</hi>
Laſt of all, That the <hi>Grizons</hi> eſcape not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
viſitation, although it coſt pentions, reward, and
flattery; and if the protectors, which muſt be either
Imperiall or French, name it an intruſion: meanes
muſt be wrought, that neither of both haue leiſure
to preuent it.</p>
            <p>Thus ended this great Proiector his dayes; but
then began his Family: their Phaetons floriſh of
mightineſſe, which queſtionleſſe had runne ouer the
bancks of <hi>Europe</hi> like an inundation, had not that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
of mankinde, (I meane Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi>) with
the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> kept King <hi>Phillip</hi> and his ſonne
play 50. yeares at leaſt; whereby they were hindred
from either ſending forces into <hi>Germany;</hi> or growing
to faſt, like broade ſpredding burrs, which are not
onely noyſome in themſelues, but ſpoile the ſweeter
graſſe which neighbours them. Notwithſtanding
<hi>Ferdinando, Rodulphus,</hi> and <hi>Mathias,</hi> proceed in the
affaires of the Empire, with the former cautions, and
outward lenatiue courſes, laying aſide all forcible
Armes, and imperious ouerruling the Princes: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb facs="tcp:17489:10"/>
by in leſſe then forty yeares many things are effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
tending to combuſtion of gouernment, and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
of true religion: which may be contracted to
theſe heads, and ſerue to proue, that <hi>Warre was a
bleſsing:</hi> and peace a meere enemy to their procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Certaine marriages augment the inceſts of
<hi>Spaine,</hi> and reconcile <hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Saxony</hi> to the houſe
of <hi>Auſtria.</hi> Secondly, Vnder the colour of ſecuring
the confines of <hi>Hungary</hi> and <hi>Poland,</hi> againſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions
of the <hi>Turke,</hi> Spaniſh Gariſons are admitted
into <hi>Rab, Camora, Presburge, Camiſia, Glatz, Vienna,</hi>
and <hi>Prague</hi> it ſelfe. Thirdly, The free Citties of
<hi>Germany</hi> put vp a 100 grieuances againſt the Papiſts,
and neuer deſiſted, vntill they had obtained their
owne manuſtions, to haue the excerciſe of religion.
Fourthly, The Proteſtants increaſing both in <hi>Prague</hi>
and <hi>Vienna,</hi> a certaine tricke of the Popes is diſcouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by admiſſion of the Ieſuites and Prieſts into <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
Hungary,</hi> and <hi>Germany:</hi> whereby <hi>Saxony</hi> was
poyſoned with the infections of Popery: as diuers
other Prouinces. Laſt of all, The Inquiſitors and
Catholike Biſhops grew ſo preſumptuous of their
papall authoritie, and potent adherents, that they
began to tyrannizr ouer the Proteſtants. And
when <hi>Mathias</hi> had ouercome the iealouſie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
his Brother and himſelfe, whereby he was
inueſted King of <hi>Hungary</hi> in <hi>Rodulphus</hi> life time,
and within a while after abſolute Emperour;
they fell from threatnings to bloudy executions, not
ſparing the liues of men, women and children; nor
deſiſting from opening the graues of the reuerend
<pb facs="tcp:17489:11"/>
defunct, and burning their bones; yea the variety
of tortures, and exaſperating diſpleaſures was ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible:
that all ſortes exclamed on their coſſening
peace and proſperitie: confeſſing, warre was rather
a bleſſing unto them.</p>
            <p>Shall I follow now with <hi>Bohemias</hi> ſtory their diſtaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of <hi>Mathias</hi> government, the repinings at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auguration
of his couſin <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> now Emperour;
their reſolution to reduct the government to electiue
Suffrages, their apprehenſion of the <hi>Palſgraves</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe,
their preſumption of <hi>Englands</hi> coadjuteme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,
and at laſt their raiſing of ſeverall forces vnder the
government of the Protectors of <hi>Prague:</hi> in all which,
<hi>Warre was a bleſsing</hi> indeed, and the diſſimuled peace
of the Provinces with the confederate Princes trip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
downe (as it were) the ſtanding or rather ſtagge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
glorie of <hi>Bohemias</hi> proceedings. For while <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glands</hi>
embacies and ſlender preparations made <hi>Vien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>
ſmile at the protraction, <hi>Bauaria</hi> enters the <hi>Palati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi>
on the Eaſt, <hi>Leopoldus</hi> of <hi>Elſac Saueren</hi> on the
South, and <hi>Spinola</hi> with <hi>Gonzales de Cordua</hi> on the
North: yea before the reuolt and taking of <hi>Prague,</hi>
the myſtery of warre was not ſearched, and the hope
of peace ouerclouded King <hi>Fredercks</hi> good parts with
parcemonie and neglect of execution of diſcipline,
whereby the Citie of <hi>Prague</hi> grew factious, and the
inhabitants ſuſpected themſelues, yea were angrie
with their former iudgements, that had elected a
man, who ſtaggered in his opinion betweene peace
and warre, and committed a great ſolleciſme in State,
as leauing his country vnfurniſhed, and <hi>Heidelberg</hi> in
a manner vnfortified; when yet there was nothing
<pb facs="tcp:17489:11"/>
but warre, either to ſupport him ſtanding ſtill, or fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
him aduancing forward. But there is no reui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
of fearfull accidents, and vnſauory contingents
to deiected Princes. Yet come to <hi>Mansfields</hi> coming
into the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and Prince <hi>Fredericks</hi> returne with
<hi>Brunſwicks</hi> heroike and noble oppoſition: all the
while the armies lay watching one another, there
was hope of recouery, and the enemy ſeemed ſo farre
from inſulting, that he feared their incurſions into
his owne countrey of <hi>Bauaria.</hi> Yea <hi>Vienna</hi> knew not
what to ſay to the dangers threatning her triumphs:
and although the ſouldiers played the fiery meteors
on euery ſide with miſchiefe and terror, with afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the townes, with exacting diſburſements, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
inconueniences of a cruell miſery, yet did
the warre keep <hi>Bauaria, Tilley, Leopoldus,</hi> and the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike
Biſhops in awe, and might haue procured a
bleſſing to the much humbled Prince <hi>Palatine,</hi> if the
Fox had not brought the Lion into a trance, or if
you will, a labourinth. For no ſooner were the armies
recalled, and the Princes remoued, but <hi>Bauaria</hi> for
himſelfe, and <hi>Tilley</hi> for <hi>Bauaria</hi> ranne in fury to
extinguiſh his brand of light, and put out the
glory of the <hi>Palatine.</hi> So that I may well conclude,
<hi>Warre was a bleſsing;</hi> and the diſſemblings of
peace haue with <hi>Iacobs</hi> ſubtiltie preuented <hi>Eſau</hi> from
<hi>Iſacks</hi> benediction, who once thought it meete that
the firſt borne ſhould haue the preheminence of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fortunate. And thus for <hi>Germany.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Shall we ſtep into <hi>France,</hi> and that with eaſie paces,
to take the better ſuruey of thoſe times and actions.
Beleeue it then, the crueltie of perſecution and variety
<pb facs="tcp:17489:12"/>
of turmoiles haue dragged Religion by the haire, and
brought her out as forlorne and contemptible be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the people, of purpoſe to ſtone her, as if <hi>Suſanna</hi>
had committed folly in Iſrael: but thoſe eyes that bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with reuenge, vpon her approued innocencie
were turned to compaſſion; thoſe hearts which mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured
at her hypocriſie, were leniated with a more
iuſtifiable triable; and thoſe hands which had ſtones
ready to daſh out her braines, returned them vpon
her accuſers, and made them repent the warres, and
curſe <hi>Spaine,</hi> whoſe trechery and ambition onely
weakned <hi>France</hi> by inteſtine combuſtions, that <hi>France</hi>
might not weaken <hi>Spaine</hi> by publicke hoſtilitie.</p>
            <p>I will not deale with the French inventory, nor
make the long ſhadowes of ſtory make you beleeue,
there is ſome ill lucke behinde you: but that
you may ſee how many worthy men have taken
vp perſpectives, to ſhew the true harted French man
a far off, upon ſurmiſes of <hi>Spaines</hi> coadjutement, or
augmentation of his owne territories. For the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards
would ſerve him, as they once did the Duke
of <hi>Calabria</hi> againſt <hi>Charles</hi> the fift, to forſake him in
his extremitie. And when <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt ſent an
army to recover <hi>Nauarre,</hi> and <hi>Fonteraby</hi> upon Spaniſh
inſtigation, in the tumultuous times of divers inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
in <hi>Arragon</hi> and <hi>Caſtile,</hi> the troubles were
ſoone appeaſed, and the French driven out of the
Land.</p>
            <p>But let vs come to the tripping Pheries of all
times, whereby Princes are ſeduced to flattery
and priuate reſpect; How hath <hi>Spaine</hi> delt with
all Kings and their Minions, ever ſince the Duke
<pb facs="tcp:17489:12"/>
of <hi>Guiſes</hi> tyrannous Maſſacree at <hi>Vaſti,</hi> and that
unfortunate marriage of <hi>Navarre,</hi> and the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
baites of the King of <hi>Spaines</hi> Penſioners in
the Court of <hi>France:</hi> which I am afraid are ſtill ſo
venemous to all Nations, that they will corrupt the
ſoundeſt hearts, let there be never ſo great pollicy or
conveniency at their admiſſion. What ſay you to
the houſe of <hi>Loraine,</hi> the Cardinall, and Dukes of
<hi>Guiſe?</hi> What thinke you of the Duke <hi>De Maine,</hi> and
the Holy League? Shall I name <hi>Heſpernon,</hi> and the
advancing of his Family? Shall I recount the feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
ſtory of <hi>Birone?</hi> The life and death of the Marquis
<hi>De Ancre.</hi> The falls of <hi>Luiſnes</hi> and <hi>Cadinet</hi> his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
With divers other, whoſe lives made <hi>France</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid:
and actions were ſo many tortures to the hearts
of ſollid Chriſtians, and loyall Proteſtants. Were
not all theſe the inſtruments of <hi>Spaines,</hi> to keep <hi>France</hi>
buſied at home: though fortune geered at the temera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
proceedings of the Princes againſt their owne
ſubjects, and divert the ſeverall Kings from looking
toward <hi>Navarre, Millane, Naples,</hi> the ſuccoring of
the <hi>Switzers, Grizons,</hi> and thoſe territories: yea if
you will, the patronizing of the <hi>Palatinate</hi> it ſelfe:
which was once under the covert of the <hi>French</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fedracy.
Thus hath the cannon battered their owne
townes, and the mis-led Kings unſheathed their
owne ſwords of vengeance, to ſheath them in the
bowells of naturall and loyall ſubjects; wherein yet
they have prevailed no further, then to increaſe an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
hate and jealouſie againſt <hi>Rome, Spaine,</hi> the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition,
Ieſuites, Prieſts, and all the rablement of
Locuſts, who like vermine in a ſtanding ſtincking
<pb facs="tcp:17489:13"/>
water, infect the aire with fulſome and ill vapours.</p>
            <p>If you reade the life of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, you
ſhall ſee how famous were his actions, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markeable
his renowne all the while the warres
laſted, inſomuch that the attribute of greatneſſe
was made a Trophe of his everlaſting fame:
and yet ſtood like an impregnable rocke, againſt
which the waues did ruſh impetuouſly, but to
the breaking of themſelues in peeces; but when
peace was contracted, his honour was diſtracted,
his Countrey defiled, his Townes vitiated, his faith
violated, his Preachers ſhed teares, and <hi>Molines</hi> wept
over him for temporizing: his great officer <hi>Biron</hi>
fell into the ſnare of perfidiouſneſſe, the Proteſtants
hung their heads for his luke-warmeneſſe, the Papiſts
gnaſhed their teeth for his pollices, the newters fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him, the Atheiſts abhored him, his Wife diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
and an <hi>Italian</hi> vpſtart contrived his deſtruction:
as for his Sonne and his unlimited youthfulneſſe,
that muſt needs caſt a chain over the necks of <hi>Rochell,
Monpelier, Montalbon, Niſmes, Chartres,</hi> and other
Proteſtants Provinces and townes; what did thoſe
attemps beget but the faire birth of increaſe of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and firme oppoſition againſt unprincely cruelty,
and unnaturall enforcement? and he went away
affrighted at his owne handiworke, and curſing the
motives and ſetters on of his preſumption: which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated
his malice, and taught him to know there was
a God aboue princes, which could make the warre as
a bleſſing to propagate trve Religion, and augment
the glory of the Church. So that I may well ſay,
that peace to <hi>France</hi> proved like the Aſpes of <hi>Ethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opea,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:17489:13"/>
who doe not ſting at all, but by licking and
tickling breake their bladders of poyſon, which from
itches grow to ranckle the fleſh, til at laſt it exaeſtuates
and by burning heates proves incurable. Why then
ſhould we be afraid of warre; or for any cauſe tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porize
with Gods enemies, and a dangerous Nation:
for whoſe ſake we have ſuffered the <hi>Palatinate</hi> to be
loſt, and ſeene a Noble Prince dejected, as if we were
glad, that by ſuch courſes there ſhould no enuy be
raiſed for his thriving in greatneſſe, or going to faſt
in his race of Soveraignitie and powerfull Majeſty.
But I dare ſay that the Angel did curſſe <hi>Meros</hi> for not
aſſiſting of Iſrael.</p>
            <p>Concerning the Low Countries, I cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
them better, then to Camomile, which the
more it is troden, the more it ſpringeth. For
whether warre hath been a bleſſing unto them, iudge
your ſelues, conſidering they haue augmented their
fame and renown abroad, and increaſed their wealth
and territories at home. Abroad, the Weſt Indies
haue been frequented with their Navies; and the
ſtormes at ſeas are not ſo formidable to the mariners,
as their approches to the <hi>Spaniard;</hi> inſomuch that his
plate Fleets are many times detained in harbour from
their ordinary courſes, to the diſappointing of his
Garriſons in <hi>Europe,</hi> which hath cauſed many muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
and innouations amongſt the ſouldiers. The Eaſt
Indies haue been viſited by them, and ſo viſited, that
they haue planted Colonies in the Ilands in deſpight
of oppoſition; they haue dared the <hi>Portingals,</hi> and
ouertopped the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> their ſhips exceed in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and their Merchants in induſtrie and huſbandry:
<pb facs="tcp:17489:14"/>
their labours haue made way vnto continual thriuing;
and the ſeuerall Kings of the nations haue reputed
them greater then the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> The <hi>Philippines</hi> and
<hi>Molunes</hi> haue been ſearched by them, and neither
Iland nor harbour but reioyced at their trade and traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique.
The South ſeas with the ſtreights of <hi>Magellane</hi>
haue been adventured on, and their voyages ſet the
pens of learned Chronologers on worke. Both the
<hi>Guincies</hi> and the coaſts of <hi>Afrik</hi> are explored by them;
and if there be no more in the ſatisfaction of expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
then knowledge, experience, and augmentation
of wealth: they attained to all by their nauall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters
and adventures. The <hi>Leuant</hi> is ſtored with
their ſhippes, and the Streights of <hi>Gibraſter</hi> are not ſo
ſtraight, but in their defiances with <hi>Spaine</hi> they ruſhed
them open to giue them paſſage: ſo that both <hi>Turkey</hi>
and <hi>Italy</hi> have admitted their factories, and opened
the lapps of their plenty, to bid them take the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings
by ſhippes full. If you ſtep into <hi>France,</hi> you
ſhall finde, they not onely ſtepped thether, but viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
every towne of importance, yeelding an honeſt
account of their traueles. What thinke you of the
fiſhing in <hi>Newland,</hi> of Whales in <hi>Greeneland,</hi> of the
commodities of <hi>Iſland, Freezland,</hi> of the Herings of
<hi>Scotland, Ireland,</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> of the coaſts of <hi>America,</hi>
and all thoſe Nations which are acceſſable, yeelding
either pleaſure or profit, they haue euery where
ſuckt the hony with the Bee, and extended their
trauaile with the Ant, ſo that the ſummers labour
hath fed and cloathed them in winter, and the winter
it ſelfe never had ſuch fearefull blaſts, but the winde
either breathed good vpon them, or draue them to
<pb facs="tcp:17489:14"/>
ſeeke it in all the corners of the earth. If you are not
afraid of the Eaſterne violence and mountanous ice
of <hi>Ruſsia,</hi> you ſhall finde that they are not afraid of
winters ſnow, nor ſummers contagion: but viſit
<hi>Norway, Sweden, Goteland,</hi> the ſound of <hi>Denmarke,</hi>
the <hi>Haus</hi> Townes, <hi>Pruſsia, Poland, Muſcouia,</hi> and all
maritime coaſtes; Inſomuch, that like the honeſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorators
of the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> they not onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
with cluſters of grapes, but continue undaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
So that I may well ſay, warre hath beene a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
unto them, and the God of all bleſſings hath
multiplied <hi>Iſrael</hi> euen vnder their grieuances.</p>
            <p>But now if they kindly let you within their doores,
you will be amazed at the furniture of their houſes:
I meane the ſucceſſe of their affaires, and the noble
proceedings of the warres, which hath made them
famous in the ſucceſſe, and left their honeſt defences
exemplary to all poſterity. They haue expulſed the
<hi>Spaniard</hi> out of <hi>Zealand,</hi> &amp; <hi>Holland,</hi> and as it were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probrated
great Princes for not being content to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
ouer the obedienc of their ſubjects, but they muſt
tyranize their ſoules, either by Inquiſition or change
of religion; is it any other then the working of ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
patience, which being abuſed turneth to fury &amp;
diſobedience; They haue not onely preſerued their
virgin prouinces from the rauiſhings of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> but
reuenged the vſurpation, which challenged their cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuitie
by hereditary birthright: yea, beſides their
owne ordinary walkes to viſit <hi>Vtreck, Gelderland,</hi> and
many fortified Townes, they haue made larger ſteps
vpon their enemies Countries, and by maine force
ſhouldred open the Caſtillian gates, and throwne
<pb facs="tcp:17489:15"/>
the Portcullis on the ground which boaſted of <hi>Auſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias</hi>
faſting, and the Popes Benediction; ſo they
entred <hi>Hamlers,</hi> and ſtill keepe <hi>Sluice</hi> and the adiacent
places to depend vpon their garriſons; they poſſeſſe
<hi>Breda;</hi> diuers <hi>Bergens</hi> the fort of <hi>Lillo:</hi> and aboue
20 forts and fortreſſes in <hi>Brabant.</hi> What haue they
done in <hi>Cleue, Munſter, Weſtphalia,</hi> the Land of <hi>Luke,</hi>
and thoſe places of <hi>Freezland,</hi> wherein the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
are now politicke intruders?</p>
            <p>For what Papiſt or Hiſpanolized temporiſer, can
yeeld an accou<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t of any thriuing action, or preuail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſucceſſe againſt them theſe 50 yeares; yet the
Pope curſeth and excommunicateth, the Emperor
threats, the Archdutches proſcribes them, <hi>Spaine</hi>
aſſembles armies, the Ieſuites coniure, the Prieſts im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture:
and all the practiſes which pollicies, migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe,
treaſure, or friends haue hatched and brought
forth, was but to amaze them with ſome monſtrous
birth of treaſon, and perfidious reuenge; yea, thoſe
ſtrange hindrances of diuers reuolts and couert ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plantations,
haue proued their owne ſhame.</p>
            <p>Thus by the corruption of Spaniſh rewards, haue
diuers Engliſh themſelues proued traitors to <hi>Holland,</hi>
and onely abuſed their honors and loyalty by ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy:
which yet ended with <hi>Spaines</hi> ſcornes,
and their Countries eternall hate and baniſhment.
Yet for all this haue the <hi>Low Countries</hi> thriued by
ſuch exaſperating difficulties, and the following warrs
haue beene a bleſſing vnto them: inſomuch that the
Spaniard hath not onely admired theirs, and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi>
happy eſtate: but blaſphemed heauen, to
ſuppoſe we had a pulling hooke to bring proſperity
<pb facs="tcp:17489:15"/>
vnto vs.</p>
            <p>In the time of <hi>Don Lewis Requeſcens,</hi> Commander
and Captaine Generall for the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> by the
exciting of diuers Prieſts, certaine Engliſh reuolted:
which added life to the Spaniſh affaires. After this
<hi>Aegremont, Ratelife, Grey,</hi> and ſome others, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of Noble Families in <hi>England,</hi> went from the
<hi>Low Countries,</hi> and fell into the ſeruice of <hi>Spaine,</hi> as
if they had fallen into a deuouring graue. At the
ſiege of <hi>Audenard,</hi> 600 Engliſh vnder <hi>Norris, Barney,
Corniſh,</hi> and <hi>Gipſon,</hi> proued traytors to the States,
and violated their firſt alleageance, to be afterward a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed
by them which ſet them on worke. <hi>Aloſt</hi> was
betrayed to the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> by a whole Regiment
of Engliſh, ouer whom <hi>Pigot</hi> commanded, who

and <hi>We<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

who in the diuels name redeliuered them to <hi>Spaine.

ſold by the Burghers, before the enemy approached.
<hi>Newis</hi> loſt by treachery. <hi>Berck</hi> beſieged, and ſo aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned.
And many other places and perſons left the
ſeruice of the States, to ſtate themſelues in the King
of <hi>Spaines</hi> intertainment. Yea by perfidious practiſes
another Regiment vnder Sir <hi>William Stanley,</hi> whoſe
Captaines were <hi>Scurlock, Peter Winn, Hart, Guin, Salſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,
Eaton, Reignolds,</hi> and <hi>Hariſon,</hi> forſooke their

               </gap>es of <hi>Spaines Indies.</hi> I could alſo name
<pb facs="tcp:17489:16"/>
the failing and falling away from <hi>Englands</hi> loue, and
the <hi>Low Countrey</hi> embraces of the Earle of <hi>Weſtmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
Lord <hi>Paget, Charles Paget,</hi> Sir <hi>Francis Englefield,
Hugh Owen, Dakers, Tempeſt, Norton, Harman, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenfield,
Tremaine, Stradling, Carew, Allen, Southwell,
Fleming, Bulmer,</hi> with diuers others, whoſe reuoults
might haue been great diſcouragments to the States.
But for all this, they proued like the women of <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
ſtrong and quicke in their trauell, and doe what <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roah</hi>
could, they multiplied exceedingly: and God
built the Midwiues houſes for being honeſt to his
people.</p>
            <p>I haue not I proteſt cited theſe particulars by way
of renouation of diſpleaſure, and diſtaſting betweene
the Dutch and vs: but meerely to ſhow the error of
inconſtancy, and the vanity of diſpairing men, who
by ouerpriſing <hi>Spaines</hi> potency, diſtruſted the <hi>Low
Countries</hi> weakneſſe, or dazeled with a miſt caſt before
their eyes, or led on by wicked angells, miſtooke
ſhadowes for ſubſtances, and thought to repaire
their decayed eſtates, by repairing to a Prince, whoſe
petty officers laughed them to ſcorne, and in their
greateſt extremities ſaw them die in the ſtreets with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
compaſſion: as for religion, it was a poore ſhift,
and idle motiue to forſake the pure ſtreames and
cleane waters, by the reaſon of the coldneſſe and
aſperous quickneſſe, to fall into the pudled durt of
Atheiſme, ſuperſtition, and corruption; what is this
but with Swines to wallow in the mire, and lie bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
in filthy puddles, and beſmeering tromperies.
But was it thus with Souldiers in thoſe dayes, and
men of fiery ſpirits? I pray God it be not ſo ſtill with

with effaeminate Courtiers, and temporizing officers,

to thinke how ſlender a Nation ſhould beare a head
againſt the impetuous aſſaults of the warres.</p>
            <p>Yet for all this, experience goes beyond precept,
and examples ouercome poſitions. For if we may
apply a ſentence of diuinity to worldly affaires; as
there is no comming to heauen with dry eyes, or with

the glory of the States beene raiſed out of difficultie;

and their conſtancy in religion, made religion to

            <p>So that if the Mines of gold by the ſearches and

Fortune ſeemed to giue Vertue the check; yet it was
a braue attempt, worthy of memory and Illuſtration.
Remember the batteries of <hi>Roane,</hi> and the beſieging

            <p>I haue not breath enough to tell the reſt, but for
theſe and the reſt I will be bold to ſay, we were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding

            <p>But what hath the peace done? it hath made vs
drunke with eaſe and careleſneſſe, forget our God, be
vncharitable to our neighbours, neglect our calling,
ſleepe in ſecurity, accuſtome our ſelues to fooliſh ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes,
and by ſtudying euery man for his priuate,
the whole kingdome is confounded with pouerty
and wretchedneſſe; inſomuch, that the complaints
fly about like flies; and pollicy is aſhamed of her own
fallacies: for you ſee it hath inuented a trick by fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,
and drawne diuers worthy men into the net of
couetuouſneſſe, to aduenture the <hi>Indies:</hi> when I muſt
ſay it, the very exhauſting of our treaſure will be the
diſcomfort of our ſoules, I inſiſt not vpon the remote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the place, loſſe of ſhipps, decay of men, abuſe
of time, vnwholeſomneſſe of women, danger of ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracks,
and the want of our account in our owne
channells, things ſubiect to fearefull conſtruction,
and ſenſible to examination: but ſay plainly, that
the bringing in of a million of commodities, is not,
or cannot be ſo beneficiall, as the expo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

at many greater ſummes) is preiudiciall to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth:
a great diſparity I confeſſe, but expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
goes beyond apprehenſion. For it is well
knowne, that <hi>Henry</hi> 8. from one of the richeſt and
mightieſt Kings, became the diſcontenteſt and
meerly indigent to the turmoile of the ſubiect, by
reaſon of the ranſome of Pope <hi>Clement,</hi> ſo fooliſhly
and trecherouſly ſent out of <hi>England.</hi> And in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
dayes was not the wealth of this Land almoſt in
the hands of the Romaniſts, and how poore were
our people by reaſon of <hi>Peter</hi> pence paid vnto <hi>Rome.</hi>
Looke into the ſtory of <hi>Salomon,</hi> you ſhall reade of
great ſtore of gold brought into the Land, but neuer
any ſent out, or permitted to be tranſported: onely
commoditie for commoditie, or neceſſaries for their
gold and ſiluer in ſuch Countries as wanted them.
As for their obiections, or coſſenning their owne
hearts, that ſay, <hi>England</hi> hath no gold growing, and
therefore we may ſpare a little of a great deale which
is brought in; I anſwer, that becauſe <hi>England</hi> was
ſometimes barbarous, full of boggs, woods, and a
wilderneſſe for beaſts: therefore it matters not to
haue braue Citties, a reduction to ciuillity, and an
extraordinary beauty of Magnificenſe and glory: we
ſhould be no worſe then we were before; I hope
ſuch arguing is weake, poore, and full of moroſity:
ſeeing all the Maieſtie of <hi>Europe</hi> receiues exornation

            <p>Now ſince our peace, what hath that done to vs,
or we done to ourſelues? hath it not proued our
ſickneſſe, and wrought vpon our corrupt bodies like
a feuer, not onely obnoxions in it ſelfe, but bringing
on apace other diſeaſes. And haue not we taken a
libertie to ſinne, becauſe no puniſhment followed
ſuddenly. But hearken how the vengeance of God
comes vpon vs: the cry goes, the countrey is weighed,
and found lighter by 14 Millions in 15 yeares; we
are haunted with Beggers, vndone in our Trades,
peſtred in the priſons, the Common-wealth ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runne
with pouerty, the people cry out of miſery,
and feare and terrors make vs all amazed, inſomuch
that in many Countrey Townes, ſuch idle, laſie, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented
vagabonds abound, that the inhabitants
are affraid of ſpoiles and rapes, euen in the face of
Iuſtice: that is, though there be officers to threaten
them, ſo that if it were not for forreigne plantations,
and compulſiue ſending ſome people away, we might
deuoure one another. But marke withall, to what
inconueniences we are driuen in our cheefeſt Citties,
there are ſo many of all Trades, who confound one
another by vnderworke and indirect abuſes, that the
welthy are made poore, and the poore in a maner la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
for nothing: beſides, young men are growne
ſo proude and ſauering of liberty, that they muſt be
houſe-keepers the firſt hower, and conſume them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
with comparatiue expences to their ſuperiors:
filling their houſes with children, and the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
with bancke-routs; ſo that there is no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenting
of theſe miſchiefes but warre, warre muſt

cure this ſore, which if we looke to in time, we may
finde remedie with eaſe: either by disburthening the
Common wealth of vnneceſſary people, or enriching
the Common-wealth with ſurpriſalls vnlookt for.</p>
            <p>Let vs then reſolutely aſſiſt the Dutch, they and
we are all one, good neighbours and friends: and
ſo no doubt <hi>France</hi> will come in: and then a three
fold cable will be very ſtrong; otherwiſe, who would
not condemne his negligence that ſtandeth ſtill, while
his neighbours houſe is on a blaſe. But if we now
take opportunity by her faire foretop, and ioyne
heart and hand, wealth and courage, prayers, and
preuentions againſt the practiſes of <hi>Spaine,</hi> whoſe
very looke diſcouers the pride of his heart: we ſhall
finde his treaties are trecheries, his ſpeeches deceit,
his deuiſes ſcornes, his heart hollow, his dealings
double, and his whole courſe of his proceedings,
make but ſo many diſcourſes of abuſes and deceit; In
a word, they are the great diſſemblers of the world;
but let vs not diſſemble with our ſelues, eſpecially
take heed, and prepare againſt them.</p>
            <p>Let vs then take a veiw of our Countries, eſpecial-<hi>Ireland</hi>

            <p>Let vs with the <hi>Belgick Souldier</hi> alwayes be in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe,

Countries haue beene lately ouerrun, their Villages
deſtroyed, their houſes burnt, their Cattle pilledged,

            <p>Looke ouer ſtories, and peruſe them with iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and you ſhall find that <hi>Spaine</hi> hath ouer reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all Nations with treaties, becauſe he found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
to weake to deale with actiue imployment; ſo
that his greatneſſe hath beene the well ſpring and
head of all miſchiefe, the foundation and ground of
<hi>Europes</hi> troubles, and the meere author and proiector
of Religions ruine; I will goe no further then 88,
while we were treating of a peace, the Armado
comes vpon vs; while <hi>France</hi> lookes for a pacificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

While we are ſending to the Emperor for a reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

In 23 he treats of a match in ſigne of loue, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares
powder and match as effect of his mallice. In

match, and ſo no doubt euery true Engliſh heart will
affoord his helping hand, heart, purſe, prayers, and
all he hath to ouerthrow the boaſting pride of this
running enemy, and teach him a new leſſon for his
great ambition, and forward preſumption.</p>
            <p>As for me an old <hi>Belgick</hi> Souldier, I will pray from

            <p>To conclude, the <hi>Belgick Souldier</hi> once againe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treates
the reuerent Biſhops and Clergy to prepare

               <p>O Lord, glorious God, and euerlaſting Father, we
intreate thee mercifully to looke downe vpon vs,
and hearken to our complaint and deſires, and
grant we beſeech thee our requeſt; O gracious Father
<pb facs="tcp:17489:22"/>
thou knoweſt our ſinnes, and our iniquities are not hid
from thee, they lie open to thy iudgements: yet we know
that thy mercies are the cure of our miſeries, and when we
flie to thee, thou draweſt neere to vs; we beſeech thee
now to be fauorable, and ſpare vs for all our ſinnes paſt,
and be ready to deliuer vs from ſinnes to come; looke down
in mercy vpon vs, and as thou haſt beene our euerlaſting
defence, ſo now defend vs from the rage of our Enemies.
Go in and out O Lord before our Armies, before our Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall,
and grant we may he thy Souldiers, to fight vnder

enemy; defend thy afflicted flocke; Remember we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech

but break thou the knot of their malice, lay open their plots,
diſcouer their deuiſes, weaken their Armies, and ouerthrow
their inuentions, confound their councells, and conſume

O Lord prepare theſe thy creatures to aſsiſt and helpe vs,

Finally, O Lord bleſſe we beſeech thee vs, and
