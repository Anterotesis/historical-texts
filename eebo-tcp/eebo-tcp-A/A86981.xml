            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>HAving finiſht my Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition on <hi>2 Tim. 3.</hi> by way of Supplement to <hi>Mr. Barlow,</hi> when I came to the <hi>2 Tim. 4. 1.</hi> I perceived that Dr. <hi>Homes</hi> was tampering with it, forcing it to plead his <hi>Millena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> cauſe; upon this I encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred him, and have Vindicated the Text from the Vain Gloſſes which he put upon it. Afterwards
<pb facs="tcp:170226:3"/>
peruſing his whole book, I found it ſo jejune and empty, and his proofs ſo groſly wreſted, and impertinent, that I conceived it might be time well ſpent to Vindicate the Text which he abuſeth, eſpecially ſuch as have any ſeeming weight in them (as to his purpoſe) which here thou hast now preſented to thy view. I thought it good to give it thee ſingle by it ſelf, and the rather that ſuch as cannot buy the Expoſition of thoſe two Chapters, yet may have this little Antidote at hand againſt this Epidemical error which ſpreads ſo ſtrangely, and hath already brought forth the malignant fruit of Schiſme in the Church, and Sedition in the State, to the hazarding of both; as appears in that Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Declaration of the Fifth Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch men, who cry down Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy and Miniſtery as that <hi>Beaſt</hi>

2. The Apoſtle tells us when Chriſt will deliver up this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, <hi>viz.</hi> when he ſhall have put down all Rule, and all Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Authority.

            <p n="2">2. <hi>Reſtrictively,</hi> for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing of all theſe adverſary Powers and Potentats which oppoſe the Kingdom of Chriſt.

               <hi>All Rule, and all Authority be it good or bad.</hi> The Church will then have no need of good ones; and bad ones ſhall no longer moleſt her, for the time of her warfare is accompliſht.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Apoſtle having told us what ſhall be the future con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Chriſt Kingdom, now he tells us what ſhall be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Chriſt himſelf, V. 28. <hi>When all things ſhall be ſubdued unto him, then ſhall the Son him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf alſo be ſubject to him that put all things under him.</hi> Hence the <hi>Arrians</hi> ſubtilly cavil thus.</p>

            <p>Now let us ſee what Dr. <hi>Homes</hi> his Aquiline eyes can ſpy in this Text for this 1000. yeers Raigne on earth.</p>

            <p n="2">2. The Drs. Obſervation hath two parts. 1. That there ſhall be two dayes of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and therefore he tells you here of an ultimate day of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But how doth he prove it? Why <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>But how doth he proves this?

For then 'tis the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Kingdom.

earth, but of his coming to judge the quick and the dead in great power and glory. And we ſhall oft find in Scripture that the appearing of Chriſt in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and his coming to judgment are joyned together, as being one and the ſelf ſame thing at the ſame time. <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 30. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3. 4. So that this appearance of Chriſt in his Kingdom is nothing elſs but a more full and clear manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his glory when he ſhall come to judge the world.

ſalvation. But the Scripture ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver mentions but two comings of Chriſt corporally, <hi>viz.</hi> once to merit ſalvation, and at the laſt day to perfect it for ever.</p>
            <p>Thus we have ſeen the Drs. vanity. We have a ſaying, as the Fool thinks, ſo the Bell clinks. As Dr. <hi>Homes</hi> thinks, ſo the Scripture clinks.

The
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:170226:42"/>
Doctor tells you that in the year 1655. we muſt expect the calling of the Jews, yea, and before their Call, the Fall of Antichriſt (p. 562) To this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion you ſee the Doctor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines, his book was printed 1653. and he conceited that two yeers after both <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould down, and the <hi>Jews</hi> be called, which is as true as all the reſt of his book. If I were worthy to be of the Drs. Counſel, the next time that I Propheſied I would be ſure to ſet the time far e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough off, that ſo people might laugh at me (as they have done at ſome others) when I were dead, and not whilſt I lived. And therefore others, a little wiſer then their fellows, tells us that it ſhall begin about 27. yeers hence. Others ſay, about 41. yeers hence. Others about 83. yeers hence. <hi>Alſteed</hi> puts
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:170226:43"/>
the beginning of theſe thouſand yeers to 1694. Others put it to the yeer 1859. about 200 yeers hence. But the Dr. thinks this time too long to be kept out of his Mahumetan Paradiſe, and therefore he will temper this, and ſome other accounts which remove their Periods ſo far off, and this he doth by tampering with the Chronologers, telling <note place="margin">Pag. 562.</note>you that 'tis conceived the computation from the Creation to this day, ordinarily received, is not right, but far longer then it ought to be.

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> That the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall laſt a 1000. yeers, is <hi>grat is dictum,</hi> 'tis ſaid, but it can never be proved; 'tis a very bold and groundleſs aſſertion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Text which the</hi> Millena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries <hi>bring to prove this, is 2</hi> Pet. <hi>3. 8.</hi> one day with the Lord is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> AS a thouſand yeers, and a thouſand yeers is AS one day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> What is here to prove their Aſſertion? I ſee very weak grounds will ſatisfie ſome men to uphold what pleaſeth their fancy. The meaning of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle is no more but this, whereas ſome ſcoft at Chriſts delay, and thought that he would never come to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Apoſtle tells them they had no reaſon ſo to do; for <note place="margin">Numerus certus &amp; rotundus ponitur pro in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certo &amp; infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nito.</note>one day with the Lord is <hi>As</hi> a thouſand yeers, and a thouſand yeers <hi>As</hi> one day. God mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures not time as we do, what
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:170226:56"/>
ſeems long to us, is ſhort to him, <hi>Job.</hi> 10. 5. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90. 4. He doth not ſimply ſay one day is a thouſand yeers, but is <hi>As</hi> a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeers, 'tis onely a compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>q. d.</hi> although a thouſand yeers ſeem a long time to you, (and ſo the world ſeems to have continued long) yet 'tis not ſo with the Lord, to whom all time is ſhort, and with whom ten thouſand yeers are but as yeſterday when compared with his eternity.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Dr. <hi>Alſteed</hi> with his New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light goes further then all the reſt, and tells in that this thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeers raign ſhall be <hi>After</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Figmentum Chiliaſticum.</note>the day of judgement. This is like the reſt, hath no foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but neer fancy, and is dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly contrary to the Tenour of Scripture, which expreſly tells us that at that day of judegment every man ſhall receive his final

ſentence, and everlaſting doom of, <hi>Come ye bleſſed,</hi> and <hi>Go ye cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed:</hi> So ſaith Mr <hi>Mede,</hi> after the da y of judgement all is finiſht, the wicked are ſent to hell, and the Saints inherit glory.</p>
               <p>As for our ſelves, let us aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don <note place="margin">

               <p>What we ſay of vitious, is alſo true of erroneous perſons, The Scholars oft-times exceed their maſters: <hi>Arminius</hi> his followers out-went him, and our late Millenaries and fifth

                  <hi>thoſe who degenerate from the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituality of the rule of Chriſt, and delight therein, have degenerated into carnal apprehenſions of the glory and beauty of it, ſuch have for the moſt part been given up to carnal actings, ſuitable to ſuch ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, and have been ſo da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zled with gazing after temporal glory, that the Kingdom which comes not by obſervation, hath been vile in their eyes:</hi> ſo he. As the groſs and carnal Millenaries are led by their luſts, ſo 'tis obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that the moſt ſpiritual of that way have their errors. Our natures are very apt in times of proſperity, to think our moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſo ſtrong, that it will never

In Epiſcopal times, when ſuch men proſpered and carried the day, they began to ſing, <hi>Datur bodie Eccleſia trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans;</hi> but preſently after, they found they were miſtaken, for it was <hi>Eccleſia militans.</hi> In a fair day we are apt to think the clouds are gone to bed, and we ſhall ſee them again no more; when experience tells us, the hotter the gleam is, the ſooner the ſtorm comes; even the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles when they had but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle reſt, began to dream of ſome ſuch earthly Reigne; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ask Chriſt whether he would not now reſtore the Kingdom to <hi>Iſrael? Acts</hi> 1. 6, 7. But let not us ſo dream of reigning here, that we miſs of reigning hereafter, but in our greateſt peace and proſperity, let's remember the days of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, for they may be many.

Let's get our part in the firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, let Chriſt reigne in us, and over us; let him ſubdue our luſts, and ſet up his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in our hearts here, and then we ſhall reigne with him for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
               <p>'Tis the fault of many, they are ſo taken up with the thoughts of reigning here with Chriſt, that they forget they muſt ſhortly be judged by him: They ſtudy propheſies more then precepts, and enquire more after future events; then their preſent duty. But let no man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you with vain words, nor beguile you with empty, new notions, but enquire for the good old way of Truth and Holineſs, and walk therein, ſo ſhall you find reſt for your ſouls. <hi>Jer.</hi> 6. 16.</p>
