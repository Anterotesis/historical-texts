            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEREAS Illiterate men or ſuch as can but read the Engliſh Bible, in contempt of a
learned and ſetled Miniſtry, according to the variety of Sects, undertake publikely to preach
the word of God, and exerciſe other Miniſteriall Acts amongſtus, and pretend to receive coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
or at leaſt connivance, from the higher Powers for ſo doing; It is to be conſidered
that (what licence ſoever they may aſſume unto themſelves) they want both <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
ſo much as to preach the word.</p>
            <p>For Power or Ability,<note place="margin">I.</note> 1 The word of God not being to be known by it ſelfe, ſuch men are
not able without other Principles to diſcern and diſtinguiſh it from other writings. 2. God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
declared himſelfe in Hebrew and Greek, but not in Engliſh that wee know of; nor no
Tranſlation of holy Scripture by men ſubject to errour (however it render the ſence) being the
word of God; nor the Truth of a Tranſlation being to be known but by recourſe to original
Tongues and Copies, our Tranſlation eſpecially being the work of men otherwiſe condemned as
Antichriſtian; without skill in languages they cannot ſo much as underſtand his word. 3. Though
they were expert in the languages, As we diſtinguiſh betwixt Principal and Acceſſory parts in the
holy Scriptures the main of the Goſpel belonging unto all men taking up little room, and the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
part even of the New Teſtament bearing reference to Particulars, as Romanes, Corinthians, &amp;c. unto whom we are nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinne,
and not importing lawes but Judgements or reports of Judgements and practiſe in particular Caſes (legally binding us Engliſhmen
no more then Judiciall or Ceremoniall lawes given to the Iſraelites) they cannot conceive or explicate the ſence thereof as it was intended,
without skill in the Hiſtories and Antiquities of thoſe Nations. 4. Nor laſtly could they underſtand thus much of Scripture, can they
Apply and bring home theſe Preſidents to rule our collaterall Caſes (which is the proper uſe we are to make thereof) without Logick
and Diſcourſe to make the Parallel, which Explication and Application wee call Preaching. So that for want of Arts and Tongues and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
humane Learning, the People cannot approach the mount of Divinity as it ſtands expoſed unto all men in the prime Revelations,
the holy Scriptures; nor much leſſe bring us myſteries from thence, but borrow the light which they have thereof more remotely from
the Learned. And for private Spirits, or new revelations of the will God not having his Probat by miracles, or any other Goſpel
then is derived from theſe writings (which ſome well ſpoken under the name of gifted men to ſalve the matter by an extraordinary
manner without learning boaſt of) we paſſe not.</p>
            <p>And how then can wee conceive theſe are the men entruſted with the miniſtry of the Goſpel?<note place="margin">II.</note> where choyce is to be had, men
(while they are Reaſonable) delegate not uncapable ſubjects; eſpecially to a work whereto all the reverence that can be uſed (in chuſing
and raiſing Perſons, in regard of his Majeſty with, or for, whom they are to deal) is too little: And certainly God ſees ſuch as he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployes
qualified. Yet perſonall ſufficiency is not enough without a Politicall ordination; ſuppoſing theſe men had Ability, for Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
or commiſſion either from God or men to put that Faculty in office (which even in handicrafts for freedome in Trade is ſtood up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
they are ſtill to ſeek, and have no more to ſhew for Preaching then for further Judging or Ruling their Brethren, when (upon inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation
with the multitude) they ſhall dare to declare themſelves. <hi>Corah's</hi> ſinne <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. being the bottome of it. Wherefore ſuch <hi>lay
Ideots muſt keep their diſtance, and leave the diſpenſation of theſe ſacred ordinances unto their Spirituall Guides</hi> (men of nearer acceſſe and
intimacy with the minde of Chriſt ſeparated to that work) <hi>unto whom they properly belong.</hi> And however theſe men carry the matter,
wee cannot ſuſpect that the higher Powers are our Adverſaries herein; who though they have ſeen cauſe to reject the corrupt order that
was eſtabliſhed in the Church, have reaſon to be jealous of the Peoples motions; and though they have been willing to trie the ſpirits, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
not ſurely upon that ſcore (without all regard either of learning or modeſty) to let looſe ſuch incoherent tongues to advance confuſion,
and trie the maſtery amongſt themſelves; or to believe any Spirit but according to its qualifications, and the evidence men ſhall make
thereof.</p>
            <p>If it bee objected,<note place="margin">Object. I.</note> That the holy Scriptures were written to Perſons of ordinary Capacity and Literature. Wee muſt conſider.
1. That theſe men unto whom they were directed underſtood the Divinity, the Language, and all the Circumſtances of theſe Writings,
which made that eaſie unto them, which without ſtudy we cannot attain to. Secondly, They that were directly concern'd needed no ſuch
help of Logick and Diſcourſe to Apply them, and make collaterall Inferences and Deductions as we do.</p>
            <p>If it bee objected that the Holy Apoſtles,<note place="margin">II.</note> the primitive Paterns of our Miniſtry, were Illiterate men. It is to bee conſidered.
1. That all Illiterate men in thoſe dayes, were not Apoſtles; And though the twelve Apoſtles were ſuch Illiterate men, Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
was not, nor <hi>Barnabas,</hi> nor <hi>Timothy,</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> whom <hi>Paul</hi> Inſtituted: which ſhews that unlearnedneſſe is no proper qualification
for an Apoſtle or Preacher of the Goſpel. Secondly, Witneſſes and Publiſhers of things which they had ſeen and heard (ſuch as the
Apoſtles in a manner wholly were) needed no ſuch learning as Expounders and Appliers of Antient and forreigne Writings. And
laſtly, though our Saviour took ſuch Ignorant men, hee left them not ſuch; hee took Fiſher-men, whom he made Fiſhers of Men (that
his Power and the Grace of God might bee ſeen in their weakneſſe.) Yet hee took time for it; Hee called Diſciples, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. but made
them not Apoſtles till <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. As wee take Servants or Apprentices, whom wee afterwards make free of our Trades. Theſe
Teachers of the Times (wee deny not) may bee gifted men too, and gifted in ſome ſort for Preaching or Declaming roundly to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
But we ſee they are not gifted like Apoſtles for Preaching of the Word of God as now it ſtands (which is the onely thing which
ſhould beſtead them.) 1. The Apoſtles underſtood that they taught the Word of God, and that they had Commiſſion from God to
teach it. Secondly, As they were ſent to Preach, they were ſupplied with Arts and Tongues, where they were requiſite: And laſtly, they
had a further power of working Miracles, to witneſſe ſuch their Miſſion and Authority unto others. In all which theſe men remain as
defective as other mortalls.</p>
            <p>Wee do well indeed to be imitating the Apoſtles, but it muſt be in theſe things wherein they are imitable; not ſo much in their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Office, or Supernaturall workings, (which are not in our power) as their Chriſtian purity and holineſſe, their diligence and
humility, not judgings of our ſelves above that which is meet. Yet i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> nothing but their Spirit will ſerve the turn (conſidering that God
now adayes works not ordinarily, but by means) one would think that Divines (ſuch as with ſome reaſonable qualification upon their
Induſtry, by publike Ordination, orderly ſucceed the Apoſtles in their Charge of regulating and teaching others) might as well pretend
to the Spirit the Apoſtles wrought by, as thoſe men that ſee but with their eyes, and beleeve upon ſuch grounds as they afford them, and
have nothing Apoſtolicall but their own Preſumption and noyſe to ſhew for it.</p>
            <p>The Wife man gives good Adviſe, <hi>Prov. 26. 4, 5. Anſwer not a fool according to his folly, leſt thou alſo bee like unto him.</hi> And again,
<hi>Anſwer a fool according to his folly, leſt he be wiſe in his own conceit.</hi> And thus (I conceive) we may obſerve the latter part thereof; In
ſhewing theſe men the weakneſſe of their groundes in generall, and remonſtrating what blinde Guides they are like to make, to take
down their conceits of themſelves, and keep them to their Laſts. To deſcend with them to their particular Debates, upon theſe grounds,
(they being no better Diſputants then Preachers) were the way (I am ſure) to tranſgreſſe the former part, to enter a Brawl, and make
our ſelves like unto them. Whatſoever therefore their Provocations of Divines to Conference and Diſputations therein bee (till they
rectifie their Principles, and improve their Learning) they are to be eſteemed but as the extravagant workings of their Diſtempers; and
Indignities, as if a Carter ſhould challenge an Officer of the Army at Cudgels, or dare our renowned Generall to Cuffes. Such weapons
being fitter (with their noyſe and duſt) to offend even Spectators, then decide differences; And ſuch Challengers rather to bee kickt
then encountred.</p>
