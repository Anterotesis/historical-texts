            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>WHen I ſhall have told the Reader, that the following Diſcourſe was written in the year <hi>1665,</hi> while the Authour, to avoid the great Plague that then rag'd in <hi>London,</hi> was reduc'd with many others to go into the Countrey, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to paſs from place to place, unaccompanied with moſt of his Books; it will not, I preſume, be thought ſtrange, that in the mention of ſome things taken from other Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb facs="tcp:93740:3"/>
as his memory ſuggeſted them, he did not annex in the Margent the preciſe places that are referr'd to. And, upon the ſame ſcore, it ought not to ſeem ſtrange, that he has not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd ſome late Diſcoveries and Books that might have been pertinently taken notice of, and would well have accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated ſome parts of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; ſince things that may thus ſeem to have been omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, are of too recent a Date to have been known to him when He writ. But if it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, why then a Diſcourſe finiſhed ſo long ago, did not come abroad much ſooner? I muſt acquaint the Reader, That 'twas chiefly his real Concern for the welfare of the Study he ſeems to depreciate, that kept
<pb facs="tcp:93740:3"/>
theſe Papers ſo long by him. For he reſiſted for ſeveral years the deſires of Perſons that have much power with him, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd the following Diſcourſe, whilſt he fear'd it might be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apply'd by ſome Enemies to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental Philoſophy, that then made a noiſe againſt it, without ſuffering theſe Papers to come abroad, till the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes and <hi>Encomiums</hi> of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny eminent Forreign <hi>Virtuoſi,</hi> and their deſire to be admitted into the <hi>Royal Society,</hi> had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently manifeſted, how little its Reputation was prejudic'd, or like to be endanger'd, by the attempts of ſome envious or miſinform'd Perſons. And to this Reaſon muſt be added the Authors backwardneſs to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture abroad a Diſcourſe of an
<pb facs="tcp:93740:4"/>
unuſual Nature, on which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, among others, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd to have his Name pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix'd to it; though, now the Book is Printed, he finds cauſe to fear, that 'twill not be long conceal'd; ſince he meets with ſome Marginal References to other Tracts of His, which (theſe Papers having long lain by him) he forgot to have been ſet down for private uſe, and which ſhould not have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to publick view.</p>

                  <head>The Author's PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>I Am not ſo little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Temper of this Age, and of the Perſons that are likelieſt to be Peruſers of the following Tract, as not to foreſee it to be probable enough, that Some will ask, For what Reaſon a Diſcourſe of this Nature was written at all; and that Others will be diſpleas'd that it has been written by Me.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe that would know, by what Inducements my Pen was engag'd on this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, may be in great part in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
<pb facs="tcp:93740:6"/>
by the Epiſtle it ſelf, in divers places whereof, as eſpecially about the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and at the Cloſe, the Motives that invited me to put Pen to Paper are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently expreſs'd. And though ſeveral of thoſe Things are peculiarly apply'd, and (if I may ſo ſpeak) appropriated to the Perſon the Letter is addreſs'd to; yet that Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuation, I would diſſwade <hi>Him</hi> from, of the Study of Things Sacred, is not His fault alone, but is grown ſo riſe among many (otherwiſe Ingenious) Perſons, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Studiers of Phyſicks, that I wiſh the enſuing Diſcourſe were much leſs ſeaſonable than I fear it is.</p>
                  <p>But I doubt, that ſome Readers, who would not
<pb facs="tcp:93740:6"/>
think a Diſcourſe of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Needleſs or Uſeleſs, may yet not be pleaſed at its being written by One, whom they imagine the Acceptance his Endeavours have met with, ought to oblige to ſpend his whole Time in Cultivating that Natural Philoſophy, which in this Letter he would perſwade to quit the Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, they think it may well challenge, before all other ſorts of Learning.</p>
                  <p>I am not unſenſible of the favourable Reception that the Philoſophical Papers I have hitherto ventured Abroad, have had the Happineſs to receive from the Curious: But I hope, they will not be diſpleas'd, if I repreſent, that I am no Lecturer or Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor of Phyſicks, nor have ever
<pb facs="tcp:93740:7"/>
engag'd my ſelf by any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made to the Publick, to confine my ſelf, never to write of any other Subject; nor is it Reaſonable, that what I did or may write, to gratifie other mens Curioſity, ſhould deprive me of mine own Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and Confine me to <hi>One</hi> Subject; eſpecially ſince there are divers Perſons, for whom I have a great Eſteem and Kindneſs, who think they have as much Right to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licit me for Compoſures of the Nature of this, that They will now have to go abroad, as the <hi>Virtuoſi</hi> have to exact of me Phyſiological Pieces. And though I be not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, that (in particular) the following Diſcourſe, which ſeems to depreciate the Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Nature, may at firſt
<pb facs="tcp:93740:7"/>
ſight appear ſomewhat im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper for a Perſon, that has purpoſely written to ſhow the Excellence and Uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it; yet I confeſs, that, upon a more Attentive Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the Matter, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Reject, no, nor Reſiſt, Their Reaſons, who are of a quite differing Judgment.</p>
                  <p>And 1. My Condition, and my being a Secular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon (as they ſpeak) are look'd upon as Circumſtances that may advantage an Author that is to write upon ſuch a Subject as I have handled. I need not tell you, that as to Religious Books in general, it has been obſerv'd, that thoſe penn'd by Lay-men, and eſpecially Gentlemen, have (<hi>caeteris paribus</hi>) been better entertain'd, and more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
<pb facs="tcp:93740:8"/>
than thoſe of Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticks: And indeed 'tis no great wonder, that Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to Piety, and Diſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions from Vice, and from the Luſts and Vanities of the World, ſhould be the more prevalent for being preſs'd by Thoſe, who have, and yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline, the Opportunities to enjoy plentifully Themſelves the pleaſures They diſſwade Others from. And (to come yet cloſer to our preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) though I will not ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to ſay with an excellent Divine, That what ever comes out of the Pulpit, does with many paſs but for <hi>the fooliſhneſs of Preaching</hi>; yet it cannot well be deni'd, but that if all other Circumſtances be equal, He is the fitteſt to commend Divinity, whoſe
<pb facs="tcp:93740:8"/>
Profeſſion It is not; and That it will ſomewhat add to the Reputation of almoſt any Study, and conſequently to that of things Divine, That 'tis prais'd and preferr'd by Thoſe, whoſe Condition and Courſe of Life exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pting them from being of any particular Calling in the Common-wealth of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, frees Them from the uſual Temptations to Partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to this or that ſort of Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which Others may be engag'd to magnifie, becauſe 'tis their Trade or their Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, or becauſe 'tis Expected from them; whereas theſe Gentlemen are oblig'd to commend it, onely becauſe they really Love and Value it.</p>
                  <p>But there is another thing
<pb facs="tcp:93740:9"/>
that ſeems to make it yet more fit, that a Treatiſe on ſuch a Subject ſhould be Penn'd by the Authour of This: For profeſs'd Divines are ſuppos'd to be buſied about Studies, that even by their being of an Higher, are confeſs'd to be of Another, Nature, than thoſe that treat of things Corporeal. And ſince it may be obſerv'd, that there is ſcarce any ſort of Learned men, that is more apt to undervalue thoſe that are vers'd onely in other parts of Knowledge, than many of our Modern Naturaliſts, (who are conſcious of the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the Science they Cultivate,) 'tis much to be fear'd, that what would be ſaid of the Preeminences of Divinity above Phyſiology
<pb facs="tcp:93740:9"/>
by Preachers (in whom the Study of the Latter is thought either but a Preparatory thing, or an Excurſion) would be look'd upon as the Deciſion of an Incompetent, as well as Interreſſed, Judge; and their undervaluations of the Advantages of the ſtudy of the Creatures, would be (as their depreciating the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of the Creatures too often is,) thought, to proceed but from their not having had ſufficient opportunities to reliſh the pleaſures of them. But theſe Prejudices will not lie againſt a Perſon, who has made the Indagation of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſomewhat more than a <hi>Parergon,</hi> and having by a not-lazie nor ſhort Enquiry manifeſted, how much He loves and can reliſh the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
<pb facs="tcp:93740:10"/>
It affords, has had the good Fortune to make ſome Diſcoveries in it, and the Honour to have them Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly, and but too Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally, taken notice of by the <hi>Virtuoſi.</hi> And it may be not Impertinent to add, that thoſe who make Natural Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy their <hi>Miſtris,</hi> will probably be the leſs offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to find her in this Tract repreſented, if not as an <hi>Handmaid</hi> to Divinity, yet as a Lady of a lower Rank; becauſe the Inferiority of the Study of Nature is maintain'd by a Perſon, who, even whilſt he aſſerts it, continues (if not a Paſſionate) an Aſſidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Courter of Nature: So that, as far as his Example can reach, it may ſhow, that <hi>as</hi> on the one ſide a man need not
<pb facs="tcp:93740:10"/>
be acquainted with, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to reliſh, the Leſſons taught us in the Book of the Creatures, to think them leſs Excellent than thoſe, that may be learned in the Book of the Scriptures; <hi>ſo</hi> on the other ſide, the Preference of this laſt Book is very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with an high Eſteem and an Aſſiduous Study of the firſt.</p>
                  <p>And if any ſhould here object, that there are ſome Paſſages, (which I hope are but very few) that ſeem a little too unfavourable to the Study of Natural things; I might alledge for my excuſe the great difficulty that there muſt be in comparing two ſorts of Studies, both of which a man much eſteems, ſo
<pb facs="tcp:93740:11"/>
to behave ones ſelf, as to ſplit a hair between them, and never offend either of them: But I will rather repreſent, that in ſuch kind of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes as the enſuing, it may juſtly be hop'd, that equita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Readers will conſider, not onely what is ſaid, but on what occaſion, and with what deſign 'tis delivered. Now 'tis plain by the <hi>Series</hi> of the following Diſcourſe, that the <hi>Phyſeophilus,</hi> whom it moſt relates to, was by me look'd upon as a Perſon, both very partial to the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Nature, and ſomewhat prejudic'd againſt that of the Scripture; ſo that I was not always to treat with him, as with an indifferent man, but, according to the Advice, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb facs="tcp:93740:11"/>
in ſuch caſes by the Wiſe, I was (to uſe <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion) to bend the crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtick the contrary way, in order to the bringing it to be ſtraight, and to depreciate the ſtudy of Nature ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what beneath its true value, to reduce a great Over va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luer to a juſt Eſtimate of it. And to gain the more upon Him, I allow'd my ſelf now and then to make uſe of the contempt he had of the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripatetick</hi> and Vulgar Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, and in ſome paſſages to ſpeak of them more ſligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly, than my uſual Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per permits, and than I would be forward to do on another occaſion; that, by ſuch a Complaiſance for his Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, I might have Riſes to
<pb facs="tcp:93740:12"/>
Argue with him from them.</p>
                  <p>But to return to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives that were alledg'd to induce me to the Publication of theſe Papers, though I have not nam'd them all, yet all of them together would ſcarce have prov'd effectual, if they had not been made more prevalent by the juſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation I conceived, to ſee even Inquiſitive Men depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate that kind of Knowledge, which does the moſt Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, as well as the moſt Bleſs, Mankind, and look upon the Nobleſt and Wiſeſt Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Underſtanding, as Signs of weakneſs in it.</p>
                  <p>'Tis not that I expect, that whatever can be ſaid, and much leſs what I have had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſay Here, will make
<pb facs="tcp:93740:12"/>
Proſelytes of thoſe that are reſolved againſt the being made ſo, and had rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny themſelves the Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt kinds of Knowledge, than allow that there can be any more Excellent, than what they think themſelves Maſters of: But I deſpair not, that what is here repreſented, may ſerve to fortifie in a high Eſteem of Divine Truths thoſe that have already a juſt Veneration for them, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Others from being ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd by Injurious, though ſometimes Witty, Inſinuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to undervalue that kind of Knowledge, that is as well the moſt Excellent in it ſelf, as the moſt Conducive to Man's Happineſs. And for this Reaſon I am the leſs diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleas'd
<pb facs="tcp:93740:13"/>
to ſee, that the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Letter is ſwell'd to a Bulk far greater than its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but a Letter promiſes, and then I firſt intended. For I confeſs, that when the Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion hapned that made me put Pen to Paper, as I chanc'd to be in a very unſetled Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition (which I fear has had too much influence on what I have written,) ſo I did not deſign the inſiſting near ſo long upon my Subject as I have done; but new things ſpringing up (if I may ſo ſpeak) under my Pen, I was content to allow them room in my Paper, becauſe writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as well for my own ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, as for that of my Friend, I thought it would not be uſeleſs to lay before
<pb facs="tcp:93740:13"/>
my own Eyes, as well as His, thoſe Conſiderations that ſeem'd proper to juſtifie to My ſelf as well as to Him, the Preference I gave Divine Truths (before Phyſiologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ones) and to confirm my ſelf in the Eſteem I had for them. And though I freely confeſs, that the following Diſcourſe doth not conſiſt of nothing but Ratiocinations, and conſequently is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together of an Uniform Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texture; yet that will, I hope, be thought no more than was fit in a Diſcourſe, deſign'd not onely to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, but to Perſwade: Which if it prove ſo happy as to do, as I hope the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſer will have no cauſe to
<pb facs="tcp:93740:14"/>
regret the trouble of Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, ſo I ſhall not repent that of Writing it.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>I</hi> Hop'd you had known me better, than to doubt in good earnest, how I reliſh'd the Diſcourſe your Learned Friend entertain'd us with yeſter-night. And I am the more troubled at your Queſtion, becauſe your way of inquiring, how much your Friends Diſcourſe obtain'd of my Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, gives me cauſe to fear, that you vouchſafe it more of yours then I could wiſh it. But before I can ſafely offer you my ſenſe of the Diſcourſes, about which you deſire to know it, I muſt put you in mind, that they were not all upon one Subject, nor of the ſame Nature: And I am enough his Servant to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, without the leaſt reluctancy, that he is wont to ſhew a great deal of wit, when he ſpeaks like a Naturaliſt, onely of things purely Phyſical; and
<pb facs="tcp:93740:15"/>
when he is in the right, ſeldom wrongs a good cauſe by his way of managing it. But as for <hi>thoſe paſſages,</hi> wherein he gave himſelf the liberty of diſparaging the learned Dr. <hi>N.</hi> onely becauſe that Doctor cultivates Theological as well as Phyſical Studies and does both often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times read Books of Devotion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times write them; I am not ſo much a Courtier, as to pretend that I liked them. 'Tis true, he did not deny the Doctor to be a learned and a witty Man, as indeed the wiſe providence of God has ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it, That to ſtop the bold mouthes of ſome, who would be eaſily tempted to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, and more eaſily to give out, that none are Philoſophers, but ſuch as, like themſelves, deſire to be nothing elſe. Our Nation is happy in ſeveral men, who are as eminent for Humane, as ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious of Divine Learning; and as great a veneration as they pay to <hi>Moſes</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> are as well vers'd in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and of <hi>Euclid</hi>; nay, of <hi>Epicurus</hi> and <hi>Des Cartes</hi> too, as thoſe that care not to ſtudy any thing elſe. But though for this reaſon Mr. <hi>N.</hi> had not the confidence to deſpiſe the Doctor, and ſome of his Reſemblers, whom he took occaſion to mention; yet he too
<pb facs="tcp:93740:15"/>
plainly diſclos'd himſelf to be one of thoſe, who though they will not deny, but that ſome, who own a value for Theology, are men of parts; yet they talk, as if ſuch perſons were ſo, in ſpight of their being Religiouſly given; That being, in their opinion, ſuch a blemiſh, that a man muſt have very great Abilities otherwiſe, to make amends for the diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of valuing Sacred Studies, and ſurmount the diſparagement it procures him. Wherefore ſince this diſdainful hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour begins to ſpread much more than I could wiſh it did among differing ſorts of men, among whom I ſhould be glad not to find any Naturaliſts; and ſince the Queſtion you ask'd me, and the eſteem you have for your Friend, makes me fear you may look on it with very favourable eyes: I ſhall not decline the Opportunity you put into my hands of giving you, together with a profeſſion of my diſlike of this practice, ſome of my Reaſons for that diſlike; and the rather, becauſe I may do it without too much exceeding the limits of an Epiſtle, or thoſe which the haſte, wherewith I muſt write this, does preſcribe to me. For your Friend does not <hi>oppoſe,</hi> but onely <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalue</hi> Theology; and profeſſing to
<pb facs="tcp:93740:16"/>
believe the Scriptures (which I ſo far credit, as to think he believes himſelf when he ſays ſo) we agree upon the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples: So that I am not to diſpute with him as againſt an Atheiſt, that denies the Authour of Nature, but onely againſt a Naturaliſt, that over-values the ſtudy of it. And the Truths of Theology are things, which I need not bring Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <hi>for,</hi> but am allowed to draw Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <hi>from</hi> them.</p>
                  <p>But though, as I juſt now intimated, I deſign brevity; yet for fear the fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and importance of my Subject ſhould ſuggeſt things enough to me to make ſome little method, requiſite to keep them from appearing confuſed; I ſhall divide the following Epiſtle into two diſtinct parts. In the former of which I ſhall offer you the chief poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Conſiderations, by which I would repreſent to you the ſtudy of Divinity, as preferable to that of Phyſicks: And in the ſecond part I ſhall conſider the Allegations, that I foreſee your Friend may interpoſe: in favour of Natural Philoſophy. From which diſtribution you will eaſily gather, that the Motives on the one hand, and the Objections on the other will challenge to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb facs="tcp:93740:16"/>
diſtinct Sections in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective parts whereto they belong. So that of the Order of the particulars you will meet with, I ſhall not need to trouble you with any further Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>

                     <head>THE FIRST SECTION.</head>
                     <p>ANd firſt, The Excellency and Sublimity of the Object we are invited to contemplate, is ſuch, that none that does truly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a Deity can deny, but that there is no Speculation, whoſe Object is comparable in point of Nobleneſs, to the Nature and Attributes of God. The Souls of inquiſitive men are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſo curious, to learn the Nature and Condition of <hi>Spirits,</hi> as that the over-greedy deſire to diſcover ſo much as <hi>That there are other Spiritual Subſtances beſides the Souls of Men,</hi> has prevail'd with too many to try forbidden ways of attaining ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and many have choſen rather to venture the putting themſelves
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93740:18"/>
within the power of Daemons, than remain ignorant whether or no there are any ſuch Beings: As I have learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the private acknowledgments made me of ſuch unhappy (though not unſucceſsful) Attempts, by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers learned men (both of other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, and that of Phyſick,) who themſelves made them in differing places, and were perſons neither Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous nor Superſtitious: (But this onely upon the By.) And certainly that man muſt have as Wrong as Mean a Notion of the Deity, and muſt but very little conſider the Nature and Attributes of that infinitely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Being, and as little the Nature and infirmities of Man, who can imagine the Divine Perfections to be Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, whoſe inveſtigation a man may (inculpably) deſpiſe, or be ſo much as fully ſufficient for. Not onely the Scripture tells us,<note place="margin">Pſ. 145.</note> That his <hi>Greatneſs is incomprehenſible,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Pſ. 147.5. Pſ. 113.6.</note> and <hi>his wiſdom is inſcrutable</hi>; That <hi>he humbles himſelf to look into</hi> (or upon) <hi>the Heavens and the Earth</hi>; and, That not onely this or that man,<note place="margin">Iſa. 40.15.</note> but all the <hi>Nations of the World are, in compariſon of him, but like the ſmall Drop of a Bucket, or the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93740:19"/>
ſmaller Duſt of a Ballance:</hi> But even the Heathen Philoſopher, who wrote that eloquent Book <hi>De Mundo,</hi> aſcrib'd to <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his riper years, ſpeaks of the Power, and Wiſdom, and Amiableneſs of God, in terms little leſs lofty, though neceſſarily inferiour to ſo infinitely Sublime a Subject; which they that think they can, eſpecially without Revelation, ſufficiently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, do very little underſtand themſelves.</p>
                     <p>But perhaps your Friend will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, That to the knowledge of God there needs no other then Natural Theology; and I readily confeſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing warranted by an Apoſtle, that the <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>,<note place="margin">Rom. j.19.</note> was not unknown to the Heathen Philoſophers; and that ſo much knowledge of God is attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by the light of Nature, duly employ'd, as to encourage men to exerciſe themſelves more than moſt of them do in that nobleſt of Studies, and render their being no Proficients in it, injurious to themſelves as well as to their Maker. But notwithſtanding this, as God knows Himſelf infinitely better then purblind Man knows Him, ſo the Informations He is
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93740:19"/>
pleaſed to vouchſafe us, touching His own Nature and Attributes, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly preferable to any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, that we can give our ſelves of Him, without Him. And methinks, the differing Proſpects we may have of Heaven, may not ill adumbrate to us the differing Diſcoveries that may be made of the Attributes of its Maker. For <hi>as,</hi> though a man may with his naked eye ſee Heaven to be a very glorious Object, enobled with radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Stars of ſeveral ſorts; yet when his eye is aſſiſted with a good Tele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcope, he can not onely diſcover a number of Stars (Fix'd and Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring) which his naked eye would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have ſhown him; but thoſe Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets which he could ſee before, will appear to him much bigger, and more diſtinct: <hi>So,</hi> although bare Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon well improv'd will ſuffice to make a man behold many glorious Attributes in the Deity; yet the ſame Reaſon, when aſſiſted by Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, may enable a man to diſcover far more Excellencies in God, and perceive them, he contemplated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, far greater and more diſtinctly. And to ſhew how much a dim Eye,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93740:20"/>
illuminated by the Scriptures, is able to diſcover of the Divine Perfections, and how unobvious they are to the moſt piercing Philoſophical Eyes, that enjoy but the dim light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; we need but conſider, how much more ſuitable Conceptions and Expreſſions concerning God are to be met with in the Writings of thoſe Fiſhermen and others, that penn'd the New Teſtament, and thoſe illiterate Chriſtians that received it, than amongſt the moſt Civiliz'd Nations of the World (ſuch as anciently the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> and now the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſes</hi> and <hi>Eaſt-Indians</hi>) and among the eminenteſt of the Wiſe-men and Philoſophers themſelves, (as <hi>Ariſtotle, Homer, Heſiod, Epicurus,</hi> and others.)</p>
                     <p>Beſides that the Book of Scripture diſcloſes to us much <hi>more</hi> of the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes of God, than the Book of Nature; there is another Object of our Study, for which we muſt be <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely</hi> beholding to Theology: For though we may know ſomething of the <hi>Nature</hi> of God by the Light of Reaſon, yet we muſt owe the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of His <hi>Will,</hi> or <hi>Poſitive</hi> Laws, to His own Revelation. And we may
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93740:20"/>
gheſs, how curious great Princes and wiſe Men have been to inform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the Conſtitutions eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by wiſe and eminent Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; <hi>partly</hi> by the frequent Travels of the Ancient Sages and Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers into Forreign Countries, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their Laws and Government, as well as bring home their Learning; and <hi>partly</hi> by thoſe Royal and Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous Expences, at which that Great and Learned Monarch <hi>Ptolomeus Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphus</hi> ſtuck not to procure an Authentick Copy of the Law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> whom he conſidered but as an eminent Legiſlator. But certainly That, and other Laws recorded in the Bible, cannot but appear more noble and worthy Objects of Curioſity to us Chriſtians, who know them to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from an Omniſcient Deity, who being the Authour of Mankind, as well as of the reſt of the Univerſe, cannot but have a far perfecter knowledge of the Nature of Man, than any other of the Law-givers, or all of them put together can be conceived to have had.</p>
                     <p>But there is a farther Diſcovery of Divine Matters, wherewith we are
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:93740:21"/>
alſo gratified by Theology: For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides what the Scripture teaches us of the Nature and the Will of God, it contains divers Hiſtorical Accounts (if I may ſo call them) of His Thoughts and Actions. The Great <hi>Alexander</hi> thought himſelf nobly employ'd, when he read of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Actions in <hi>Homer</hi>'s Verſes; and, To know the Sentiments of great and wiſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, upon particular occaſions, is a curioſity ſo laudable, and ſo worthy of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> an Inquiſitive Soul, that the Southern Queen has been more prais'd than admir'd, for coming from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moter parts of the Earth, to hear the Wiſdom of <hi>Solomon.</hi> Now the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture does in many places give our Curioſity a nobler Employment, and thereby a higher Satisfaction, than the King of <hi>Macedon,</hi> or the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> could enjoy; for in many places it does, with great clearneſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity, give us accounts of what God Himſelf hath declar'd of <hi>His own Thoughts,</hi> of divers particular Perſons and Things, and relates, what He that knows and commands all things, was pleas'd to ſay &amp; do upon particular Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions. Of this ſort of Paſſages are the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:93740:21"/>
things recorded to have been ſaid by God to <hi>Noah,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Geneſ. vj.</note> about the ſinful Worlds ruine, and that <hi>Juſt Man's</hi> preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;<note place="margin">Numb. xxvij.7.</note> and to <hi>Moſes</hi> in the caſe of the Daughters of <hi>Zelophehad.</hi> And of this ſort are the Conferences, menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned to have paſs'd betwixt God and <hi>Abimelech,</hi>

And the being admitted to the knowledge of theſe Tranſactions of another World (if I may ſo call them) wherein God has been pleaſed to diſcloſe himſelf ſo very much, is an advantage afforded us by the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:93740:22"/>
of ſo noble a Nature, and ſo unattainable by the utmoſt improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we our ſelves can make of our own Reaſon, that, did the Scripture contain nothing elſe that were very Conſiderable, yet that Book would highly deſerve our Curioſity and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.</p>
                     <p>And on this occaſion, I muſt by no means leave unobſerv'd another Advantage that we have from ſome Diſcourſes made us in the Bible; ſince it too highly concerns us, not to be a very Great one; and it is, That the Scripture declares to us the Judgment, that God is pleas'd to make of ſome particular Men, upon the Eſtimate of their Life and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment. For though Reaſon alone, and the Grounds of Religion in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, may ſatisfie us in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, that God is Good and Merciful, and therefore <hi>'tis likely he may</hi> Pardon the ſins and frailties of Men, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of their Imperfect Services; yet, beſides that we do not know, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther He <hi>will</hi> Pardon, unleſs we have His Promiſe of it; beſides this (I ſay) though by vertue of general Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſuch as is pretended to in divers

And bating thoſe Divine Writings, I know no Books in the world, nor all of them put together, that can give a conſidering Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, who has due apprehenſions of the Inexpreſſible Happineſs or Miſery of an Immortal ſtate in Heaven or in Hell, ſo great and well grounded a Conſolation, as may be deriv'd from three or four lines in St. <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calypſe,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Revel. vij.9.</note> where he ſays, That <hi>he ſaw in Heaven a great multitude, not to be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, of all Nations, and Tribes, and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and Tongues, ſtanding before the Throne, and before the Lamb, clothed in white Robes, with Palms</hi> (the Enſigns of Victory) <hi>in their hands</hi>; and the Praiſes of God and of the Lamb in their mouthes.

                     <p>Though the Infinite Perfections and Prerogatives of the Deity be ſuch, that Theology it ſelf can no more than Philoſophy afford us <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Object</hi> for our Studies, any thing near ſo Sublime and Excellent, as what it diſcloſes to us <hi>of God</hi>; yet Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity favours us with ſome other Diſcoveries, namely, about Angels, the Univerſe, and our own Souls, which though they muſt needs be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to the knowledge of God Himſelf, are, for the nobleneſs of their Objects, or for their Importance, highly preferable to any that Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Philoſophy has been able to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford its Votaries.</p>
                     <p>But before I proceed to name any more particulars, diſclos'd to us by Revelation, 'twill be requiſite, for the prevention or removal of a Prejudice, to mind you, that we ſhould not make our Eſtimates of the worth of the things we owe to Revelation, by the Impreſſions they are wont now to make upon <hi>Us</hi> Chriſtians, who learned divers of them in our Catechiſms, and perhaps have ſeveral times met
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:93740:24"/>
with moſt of the <hi>Reſt</hi> in Sermons, or Theological Books. For 'tis not to be admir'd, that we ſhould not be ſtrongly affected at the mention of thoſe Truths, which (how valuable ſoever in themſelves) were for the moſt part taught us when we were either Children, or too Youthful to diſcern and prize their Excellency and Importance. So that though after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they were preſented to our ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per underſtanding, yet their being by that time become familiar, and our not remembring that we ignor'd them, kept them from making any vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Impreſſions on <hi>Us.</hi> Whereas if the ſame things had been (with Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances evincing their Truth) diſcover'd to ſome Heathen Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, or other vertuous and inquiſitive Man, who valu'd important Truths, and had nothing but his own Reaſon to attain them with, he would queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onleſs have receiv'd them with won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and joy. Which to induce us to ſuppoſe we have ſundry Inſtances, both in the Records of the Primitive Times, and in the recent Relations of the Converſion of men to Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity among the People of <hi>China, Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan,</hi>

and other Literate Nations. For though bare Reaſon cannot diſcover theſe Truths, yet when Revelation has once ſufficiently propos'd them to <hi>Her,</hi> ſhe can readily embrace, and highly value divers of them; which being here intimated once for all, I now advance to name ſome of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations themſelves.</p>
                     <p>And firſt, as for Angels, I will not now queſtion, whether bare Reaſon can arrive at ſo much as to aſſure us, <hi>That there are</hi> ſuch Beings in <hi>Rerum Naturâ.</hi> For though Reaſon may aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, that their Exiſtence is not Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, and perhaps too not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable; yet I doubt, whether 'twere to meer Ratiocination, or clear Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or any thing elſe but Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, convey'd to them by imperfect Tradition, that thoſe Heathen Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers, who believ'd that there were ſeparate Spirits other than Humane, ow'd that perſwaſion.

                     <p>We may farther conſider, That as to things Corporeal themſelves, which the Naturaliſt challenges as his peculiar Theme, we may name par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, and thoſe of the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive nature, and greateſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:93740:26"/>
whoſe knowledge the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turaliſt muſt owe to Theology.

                     <p>And firſt, Thoſe that admit the Truths reveal'd by Theology, do generally allow, that God is not onely the Author, but Creator of the World. I am not ignorant of what <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> taught, of what he call'd <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

Nor will I here examine (which I elſe-where do) whether, and how far by Arguments meerly Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, the Creation of the World may be evinc'd. But whether or no meer Natural Reaſon <hi>can</hi> reach ſo ſublime a Truth; yet it ſeems not that it <hi>did</hi> actually, where it was not excited by
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:93740:27"/>
Revelation-Diſcovery. For though many of the antient Philoſophers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd the <hi>World</hi> to have had a Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, yet they all took it for granted, that <hi>Matter</hi> had none; nor does any of them, that I know of, ſeem to have ſo much as imagin'd, that any Subſtance could be produced out of Nothing. Thoſe that aſcribe much more to God than <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> make Him to have given <hi>Form</hi> onely, not <hi>Matter,</hi> to the World, and to have but contriv'd the pre-exiſtent Matter into this orderly Syſteme we call the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe.</p>
                     <p>Next, whereas very many of the Philoſophers that ſucceeded <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> ſuppoſe the World to have been Aeternal; and thoſe that believ'd it to have been produc'd, had not the confidence to pretend to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how old it was; unleſs it were ſome extravagant ambitious People, ſuch as thoſe fabulous <hi>Chaldaeans,</hi> whoſe fond account reach'd up to 40000 or 50000 years: Theology teaches us, that the World is very far from being ſo old by 30 or 40 thouſand years as they, and by very many Ages, as divers others have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd;
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:93740:27"/>
and does, from the Scripture, give us ſuch an account of the age of the World, that it has ſet us certain Limits, within which ſo long a Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration may be bounded, without mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaking in our Reckoning. Whereas Philoſophy leaves us to the vaſtneſs of Indeterminate Duration, without any certain Limits at all.</p>
                     <p>The Time likewiſe, and the Order, and divers other Circumſtances of the Manner, wherein the Fabrick of the World was compleated, we owe to Revelation; bare Reaſon being evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently unable to inform us of <hi>Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars</hi> that preceded the Origine of the firſt Man; and though I do not think Religion ſo much concern'd, as many do, in their Opinion and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, that would deduce particular Theorems of Natural Philoſophy from this or that Expreſſion of a Book, that ſeems rather deſign'd to inſtruct us about Spiritual than Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal things. I ſee no juſt reaſon to embrace their Opinion, that would ſo turn the two firſt Chapters of <hi>Geneſis</hi> into an Allegory, as to overthrow the Literal and Hiſtorical ſenſe of them. And though I take the Scripture to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:93740:28"/>
be mainly deſign'd to teach us nobler and better Truths, than thoſe of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy; yet I am not forward to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn thoſe, who think the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>Geneſis</hi> contains divers parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, in reference to the Origine of things, which though not <hi>unwarily,</hi> or <hi>alone</hi> to be urg'd in Phyſicks, may yet afford very conſiderable <hi>Hints</hi> to an attentive and inquiſitive Peruſer.</p>
                     <p>And as for the Duration of the World, which was by the old Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers held to be Interminable, and of which the <hi>Stoicks</hi> Opinion, that the World ſhall be deſtroyed by fire (which they held from the <hi>Jews</hi>) was Phyſically precarious; Theology teaches us expreſly from Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,<note place="margin">

ſhall have an end.</p>
                     <p>And as Theology affords us theſe Informations about the Creatures in general; ſo touching the chiefeſt and nobleſt of the viſible ones, <hi>Men,</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation diſcovers very plainly divers very important things, where Reaſon muſt needs be in the dark.</p>
                     <p>And firſt, touching the Body of Man; The <hi>Epicureans</hi> attributed its Original, as that of all things elſe, to the Caſual Concourſe of Atoms; and the <hi>Stoicks</hi> abſurdly and injuriouſly enough (but much more pardonably than their follower herein, Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi>) would have Men to ſpring up like Muſhrooms out of the ground; and whereas other Philoſophers maintain conceits about it, too wild to be here recited; the Book of <hi>Geneſis</hi> aſſures us,<note place="margin">Gen. ij.7.</note> that the Body of Man was firſt form'd by God in a peculiar manner, of a Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrial Matter; and 'tis there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, as having been perfected be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Soul was united to it. And as Theology thus teaches us, how the Body of Man had its firſt beginning; ſo it likewiſe aſſures us, what ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of the Body after death,<note place="margin">Acts xxiv.15.</note> though bare Natural Reaſon will ſcarce be
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:93740:29"/>
pretended to reach to ſo abſtruſe and difficult an Article as that of a Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; which, when propos'd by St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Acts xvij.20, 32.</note> produc'd among the <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Philoſophers nothing elſe but won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or laughter.</p>
                     <p>Not to mention, that Theology teaches us divers other things about the Origine and Condition of Mens Bodies;<note place="margin">Gen. ij. Acts xvij.26.</note> as, <hi>That</hi> all Mankind is the Off-ſpring of One Man and one Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; <hi>That</hi> the firſt Woman was not made of the ſame Matter, nor after the ſame Manner as the firſt Man, but was afterwards taken from his ſide; <hi>That</hi> both <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were not,<note place="margin">Gen. ij.21, 22.</note> as many <hi>Epicureans</hi> and other Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers fanci'd that the firſt men were, firſt Infants; whence they did, as we do, grow by degrees to be mature and compleat Humane Perſons, but were made ſo all at once;<note place="margin">Acts xxv.15.

                     <p>And as for the Humane Soul, though I willingly grant, that much may be deduc'd from the Light of Reaſon onely, touching its Exiſtence,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:93740:29"/>
Properties, and Duration; yet Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation teaches it us with more clearneſs, and with greater Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; as, ſure, he that made our Souls, and upholds them, can beſt know what they are, and how long he will have them laſt. And <hi>as</hi> the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture expreſly teaches us, that the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Soul is diſtinct from the Body,<note place="margin">Matth. x.28.</note> as not being to be deſtroy'd by thoſe very Enemies that kill the Body; <hi>ſo</hi> about the Origine of this Immortal Soul (about which Philoſophers can give us but wide and precarious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures) Theology aſſures us, that the Soul of man had not ſuch an Origina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as thoſe of other Animals,<note place="margin">Gen. ij 7. Zek. xij.1.</note> but was Gods own immediate Workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and was united to the Body al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready form'd: And yet not ſo united,<note place="margin">Luke xx.35, 36. Matt. xxv.46.</note> but that upon their Divorce, ſhe will ſurvive, and paſs into a ſtate, in which Death ſhall have no power over her.</p>
                     <p>I expect you will here object, that for the knowledge of the Perpetual Duration of ſeparate Souls, we need not be beholding to the Scripture, ſince the Immortality of the Soul may be ſufficiently prov'd by the ſole Light
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:93740:30"/>
of Nature, and particularly has been demonſtrated by your great <hi>Des Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes.</hi> But you muſt give me leave to tell you, that, beſides that a matter of that weight and concernment cannot be too well prov'd, and conſequently ought to procure a welcome for all good Mediums of Probation; beſides this, I ſay, I doubt many <hi>Carteſians</hi> do, as well as others, miſtake, both the difficulty under conſideration, and the ſcope of <hi>Des Cartes</hi>'s Diſcourſe. For I grant, that by Natural Philoſophy alone, the Immortality of the Soul may be prov'd againſt its uſual Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, <hi>Atheiſts</hi> and <hi>Epicureans.</hi> For the ground, upon which theſe men think it mortal, being, That 'tis not a true ſubſtance, but onely a modification of Body, which conſequently muſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, when the frame or ſtructure of the Body, whereto it belongs, is diſſolv'd: Their ground being this, I ſay, if we can prove by ſome Intellectual Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the Rational Soul, which Matter, however modifi'd, cannot reach, <hi>That it is a Subſtance diſtinct from the Humane Body,</hi> there is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why the Diſſolution of the Latter ſhould infer the Deſtruction of the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:93740:30"/>
Former, which is a ſimple Subſtance, and as real a Subſtance as Matter it ſelf, which yet the Adverſaries affirm to be Indeſtructible. But though by the Mental Operations of the Rational Soul, and perhaps by other Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums it may, againſt the <hi>Epicureans,</hi> and other meer Naturaliſts, who will not allow God to have any thing to do in the caſe, be prov'd to be Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal in the ſenſe newly propos'd; yet the ſame Proofs will not evince, that abſolutely <hi>it ſhall never ceaſe to be</hi>
                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if we diſpute with Philoſophers, who admit, as the <hi>Carteſians</hi> and many others do, that God is the ſole Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and Preſerver of all things. For how are we ſure but that God may have ſo ordain'd, That, though the Soul of Man, by the continuance of his ordinary and upholding Concourſe, may ſurvive the Body, yet, as 'tis ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally believ'd, not to be created till it be juſt to be infus'd into the Body; ſo it ſhall be annihilated when it parts with the Body, God withdrawing at death that ſupporting influence, which alone kept it from relapſing to its firſt Nothing. Whence it may appear, that notwithſtanding the Phyſical

proofs of the Spirituality and ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of the Humane Soul, we are yet much beholding to Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation for aſſuring us, that its Duration <hi>ſhall be</hi> endleſs. And now to make good what I was intimating above, concerning the <hi>Carteſians,</hi> and the ſcope of <hi>Des Cartes</hi>'s Demonſtration, I ſhall appeal to no other than his own Expreſſions to evince, that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd this matter for the main as we have done, and pretended to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate, that the Soul is a Diſtinct Subſtance from the Body; but not that abſolutely ſpeaking it is Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal. <hi>Cur</hi> (anſwers that excellent Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor) <hi>de immortalitate Animae nihil ſcripſerim,</hi>

                        </gap> Natural Reaſon we may indeed make many conjectures to our own advantage, and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:93740:32"/>
have fair <hi>Hopes,</hi> but not <hi>any Aſſurance:</hi> And accordingly in the next clauſe he gives the imprudence, of quitting what is certain for an uncertainty, as the cauſe why, according to Natural Reaſon, we are never to ſeek Death.</p>
                     <p>Nor do I wonder he ſhould be of that mind. For all that meer Reaſon can demonſtrate, <hi>may</hi> be reduced to theſe two things; <hi>One,</hi> that the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Soul, being an Incorporeal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, there is no neceſſity that it ſhould periſh with the Body; ſo that, if God have not otherwiſe appointed, the Soul may ſurvive the Body, and laſt for ever: <hi>The other,</hi> that the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Soul, according to <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> conſiſting in its being a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance that thinks, we may conclude, that, though it be by death ſeparate from the Body, it will nevertheleſs retain the power of thinking. But now, whether either of theſe two things, or both, be ſufficient to endear the ſtate of ſeparation after death, to a conſidering man, I think may be juſtly queſtion'd. For, Immortality or Perſeverance in Duration, ſimply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd, is rather a thing preſuppos'd to, or a requiſite of, Felicity, than a part
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:93740:32"/>
of it; and being in it ſelf an adiapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous thing, aſſumes the nature of the ſtate or condition to which 'tis joyn'd, and does not make that ſtate happy or miſerable, but makes the poſſeſſors of it more happy or more miſerable than otherwiſe they would be. And though ſome School-men, upon Aery Metaphyſical Notions, would have men think it is more eligible to be wretched, than not to be at all; yet we may oppoſe to their ſpeculative ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>btilties the ſentiments of Mankind, and the far more conſiderable Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Saviour of Mankind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who ſpeaking of the Diſciple that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd him, ſays,<note place="margin">Mark xiv.21.</note> That <hi>it had been good for that man if he had never been born.</hi> And Eternity is generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to aggravate no leſs the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Hell, than it heightens the joys of Heaven. And here we may conſider, firſt, That meer Reaſon can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſo much as aſſure us abſolutely, that the Soul ſhall ſurvive the Body: For the Truth of which we have not onely <hi>Carteſius</hi>'s Confeſſion, lately recited, but a probable Argument, drawn from the nature of the thing, ſince, <hi>as</hi> the Body and Soul were
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:93740:33"/>
brought together, not by any meer Phyſical Agents, and ſince their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociation and Union whilſt they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued together, was made upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions that depended ſolely upon Gods free and arbitrary Inſtitution; <hi>ſo,</hi> for ought Reaſon can ſecure us of, one of the Conditions of that Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation <hi>may be,</hi> That the Body and Soul ſhould not ſurvive each other. Secondly, ſuppoſing that the Soul be permitted to outlive the Body, meer Reaſon cannot inform us what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of her in her ſeparate ſtate, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe will be vitally united to any other kind of Body or Vehicle; and if to ſome, of what kind that will be, and upon what terms the Union will be made. For poſſibly ſhe may be united to an unorganiz'd, or very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly organiz'd, Body, wherein ſhe cannot exerciſe the ſame Functions ſhe did in her Humane Body. As we ſee, that even in this Life the Souls of Natural Fools are united to Bodies, wherein they cannot diſcourſe, or at leaſt cannot Philoſophize. And 'tis plain, that ſome Souls are introduc'd into Bodies, which, by reaſon of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralytical and other Diſeaſes, they are
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:93740:33"/>
unable to move, though that does not always hinder them from being obnoxious to feel pain. So that, for ought we naturally know, a Humane Soul, ſeparated from the Body, may be united to ſuch a portion of Matter, that ſhe may neither have the power to move it, nor the advantage of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving any agreeable Informations by its interventions, having upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of that Union no other ſenſe than that of pain. But let us now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what will follow, if I ſhould grant that the Soul will not be made miſerable, by being thus wretchedly matched. Suppoſe we then, that ſhe be left free to enjoy what belongs to her own nature: That being onely the Power of always thinking, it may well be doubted, whether th'exerciſe of that Power wil ſuffice to make her hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py. You will perchance eaſily believe, that I love as well as another to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain my ſelf with my own thoughts, and to enjoy them undiſturbed by viſits, and other avocations; I would, onely accompanied by a Servant and a Book, go to dine at an Inn upon a Road, to enjoy my thoughts the more freely for that day. But yet, I think, the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:93740:34"/>
moſt contemplative men would, at leaſt in time, grow weary of think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if they received no ſupply of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects from without, by Reading, See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or Converſing; and if they alſo wanted the opportunity of executing their thoughts, by moving the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of their Bodies, or of imparting them, either by Diſcourſing, or Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Books, or by making of Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments. On this occaſion I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that I knew a Gentleman, who was, in <hi>Spain,</hi> for a State-crime, which yet he thought an Heroick action, kept cloſe priſoner for a year in a place, where though he had allowed him a Diet not unfit for a Perſon of Note, as he was; yet he was not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the benefit of any Light, either of the Day or Candles, and was not accoſted by any humane creature, ſave at certain times by the Jaylor, that brought him meat and drink, but was ſtrictly forbidden to converſe with him. Now though this Gentleman by his diſcourſe appear'd to be a man of a lively humour, yet being ask'd by me, how he could do to paſs the time in that ſad ſolitude, he confeſſed to me, that, though he had the liberty
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:93740:34"/>
of walking too and fro in his Priſon, and though by often recalling into his mind all the adventures and other paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of his former life, and by ſeveral ways combining and diverſifying his Thoughts, he endeavoured to give his mind as much variety of employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as he was able; yet that would not ſerve his turn, but he was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten reduc'd, by drinking large draughts of Wine, and then caſting himſelf upon his bed, to endeavour to drown that Melancholly, which the want of new objects caſt him into. And I can eaſily admit, he found a great deal of difference between the ſenſe he had of thinking when he was at liberty, and that which he had when he was confin'd to that employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whoſe delightfulneſs, like fire, cannot laſt long, when it is, as his was, denied both fuel and vent. And, in a word, though I moſt readily grant, that Thinking interwoven with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation and Action, may be a very pleaſant way of paſſing ones <hi>Time,</hi> yet Man being by nature a ſociable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, I fear, <hi>that</hi> alone would be a dry and weariſome <hi>Imployment</hi> to ſpend Eternity in.</p>

                        <pb n="36" facs="tcp:93740:35"/>Before I proceed to the next Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, I muſt not omit to take notice, That though the brevity I propos'd to my ſelf, keeps me from diſcourſing of any Theological Subjects, ſave what I have touch'd upon about the Divine Attributes, and the things I have mention'd about the Univerſe in general, and the Humane Soul; yet there are divers other things, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by the help of Revelation, and not without it, that are of ſo noble and ſublime a Nature, that the greateſt Wits may find their beſt Abilities both fully exercis'd, and highly gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifi'd by making Enquiries into them. I ſhall not name for proof of this the Adorable Myſtery of the Trinity, wherein 'tis acknowledg'd, that the moſt ſoaring Speculators are wont to be pos'd, or to looſe themſelves: But I ſhall rather mention the Redemption of Mankind, and the Decrees of God concerning Men. For though theſe ſeem to be leſs out of the Ken of our Natural Faculties; yet 'tis into ſome things that belong to the former of them, that the Scripture tells us, <hi>The Angels deſire to pry</hi>;<note place="margin">1 Pet. j.12.</note> and 'twas the conſideration of the latter of them,

                     <p>Not are theſe the onely things that the Scripture it ſelf terms Myſteries, though, for brevities ſake, inſtead of ſpecifying any of them, I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent my ſelf to repreſent to you in general; that, ſince Gods wiſdom is boundleſs, it may, ſure, have more ways than one to diſplay it ſelf. And though the material World be full of the Productions of his Wiſdom; yet that hinders not but that the Scripture may be enobled with many excellent Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes, and, as it were, Signatures of the ſame Attribute. For, as I was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to ſay, it cannot but be high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly injurious to the Deity, in whom all other True Perfections, as well as Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſcience, are both united and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent, to think, that he can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive no ways to diſcloſe his Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, beſides the ordering of Matter and Motion, and cannot otherwiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to be the Object of Mens ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and their Admiration, than in the capacity of a Creator.</p>
                     <p>And I think, I might ſafely add, that beſides theſe Grand and Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:93740:36"/>
Points I came from mentioning, there are many other noble and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant things, wherein unaſſiſted Reaſon leaves us in the dark; which though not ſo clearly reveal'd in the Scripture, are yet in an inviting meaſure diſcover'd there, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently deſerve the indagation of a Curious and Philoſophical Soul. Shall we not think it worth enquiring, whether the Satisfaction of Chriſt was neceſſary to appeaſe the Juſtice of God, and purchaſe Redemption for Mankind?

Learned Men of our times do believe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And ſhall not <hi>we</hi> be curious to know, whether, when the Soul leaves the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, it do immediately paſs to Heaven or Hell (as 'tis commonly believed,) or for want of Organs be laid, as it were, aſleep in an inſenſible and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active ſtate, till it recover the Body at the Reſurrection?

(which ſeems to have been the opinion of many, if not moſt of the Primitive Fathers and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.) Shall not <hi>we</hi> be curious to know, whether at that great Decretory Day, this vaſt Fabrick of the World, which all confeſs muſt have its frame quite ſhatter'd, ſhall be ſuffer'd to relapſe into its firſt Nothing, (as ſeveral Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines aſſert;) or ſhall be, after its Diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, renew'd to a better ſtate, and, as it were, Transfigur'd?

                     <p>But 'twere tedious to propoſe all the other Points, whereof the <hi>Divine</hi> takes cognizance, that highly merit an inquiſitive mans curioſity; and about which, all the Writings of the old <hi>Greek</hi> and other Heathen Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers put together, will give us far leſs information, than the ſingle Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume of Canonical Scripture. I foreſee indeed, that it may nevertheleſs be

objected, that in <hi>ſome</hi> of theſe Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Revelation incumbers Reaſon, by delivering things, which Reaſon is obliged to make its Hypotheſis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with. But, beſides that this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſo much as pretended of <hi>all</hi>; if you conſider how much unaſſiſted Reaſon leaves us in the dark about theſe matters, wherein ſhe has not been able to frame ſo much as proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble determinations, eſpecially in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of thoſe probabilities that Reaſon can deduce from what it finds one way or other delivered in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture: If you conſider this, I ſay, you will, I preſume, allow me to ſay, That the revealed Truths, which Reaſon is obliged to comply with, if they be burdens to it, are but ſuch Burdens as Feathers are to a Hawk, which inſtead of hindring his flight by their weight, enable him to ſoar to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Heaven, and take a larger pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of things, than, if he had not fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, he could poſſibly do.</p>
                     <p>And on this occaſion, Sir, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Reverence I owe to the Scripture it ſelf, than to its Expoſitors, prevails upon me to tell you freely, that you will not do right, either to Theology,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:93740:38"/>
or (the greateſt Repoſitory of its Truths) the Bible; if you imagine that there are no conſiderable Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to be made to the Theological Diſcoveries we have already, nor no clearer Expoſitions of many Texts of Scripture, or better Reflections on that matchleſs Book, than are to be met with in the generality of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentators, or of Preachers, without excepting the Antient Fathers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. For, there being in my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on two things requiſite, to qualifie a Commentator to do right to his Theme, a competency of Critical Knowledge, and a Concern for the Honour and Intereſt of Chriſtianity in general, aſſiſted by a good Judgment to diſcern and ſelect those things that may moſt conduce to it; I doubt, there are not many Expoſitors, as they are call'd, of the Scripture, that are not deficient in the former or the latter of theſe particulars, and I wiſh there be not too many that are defective in both.</p>
                     <p>That the knowledge of at leaſt <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Hebrew</hi> is requiſite to him, that takes upon him to expound Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings penn'd Originally in thoſe Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:93740:38"/>
if the nature of the thing did not manifeſt it, you might eaſily be perſwaded to believe, by conſidering with what groſs miſtakes the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Languages has oftentimes blemiſh'd not onely the Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the School-men and others, but even thoſe of the Venerable Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Church. For though <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally</hi> they were worthy men, and highly to be regarded, as the grand Witneſſes of the Doctrines and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the antient Churches; <hi>moſt</hi> of them very pious, <hi>many</hi> of them very eloquent, and <hi>ſome</hi> of them (eſpecially the two Criticks, <hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>Jerom</hi>) very Learned; yet ſo few of the <hi>Greek</hi> Fathers were skill'd in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and ſo few of the <hi>Latin</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers either in <hi>Hebrew</hi> or <hi>Greek,</hi> that many of their Homilies, and even Comments, leave hard Texts as ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure as they found them; and, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times miſled by bad Tranſlations, they give them ſenſes exceeding wide of the True: So that many times in their Writings they appear to be far better Divines then Commentators, and in an excellent Diſcourſe upon a Text, you ſhall find but a very poor
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:93740:39"/>
Expoſition of it. Many of their Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and devout Sermons being much better <hi>Encomiaſts</hi> of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Myſteries they treat of, than <hi>Unvailers.</hi> And though ſome Modern Tranſlations deſerve the Praiſe of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very uſeful, and leſs unaccurate than thoſe which the Latine Fathers us'd; yet when I read the Scriptures (eſpecially ſome Books of the Old Teſtament) in their Originals, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs I cannot but ſometimes wonder, what came into the mind of ſome, even of our Modern Tranſlators, that they ſhould ſo much Miſtake, and ſometimes Injure certain Texts as they do; and I am prone to think, that there is ſcarce a Chapter in the Bible (eſpecially that part of it which is written in <hi>Hebrew</hi>) that may not be better Tranſlated, and Conſequently more to the Credit of the Book it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>This Credit it miſſes of, not onely by mens want of ſufficient <hi>Skill</hi> in Critical Learning, but (to come to the ſecond Member of our late Diviſion) for want of their having <hi>Judgment</hi> enough to obſerve, and <hi>Concern</hi> enough to propoſe thoſe things in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:93740:39"/>
and in Theology, that tend to the Reputation of either.

For men that want either That, or a good Stock of Critical Learning, may eaſily over-ſee the beſt Obſervations (which uſually are not Obvious) or propoſe as Myſteries, things that are either not Grounded, or not Weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty enough; and ſo (notwithſtanding their good meaning) may bring a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement upon what they deſire to Recommend. And I am willing to grant, that 'tis rather for want of good Skill and good Judgment, than good Will, that there are ſo few that have been careful to do right to the Reputation of the Scripture, as well as to its Senſe. And indeed when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, how much more to the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of thoſe Sacred Writings, and of Chriſtian Theology in general, divers Texts have been explain'd and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd of by the Excellent <hi>Grotius,</hi> by <hi>Epiſcopius, Maſius,</hi> Mr. <hi>Mede,</hi> and Sir <hi>Francis Bacon,</hi> and ſome other Late <hi>great Wits</hi> (to name now no Living ones) in their ſeveral kinds; than the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:93740:40"/>
ſame places have been handled by vulgar Expoſitors, and other Divines: And when I remember too, that none of theſe newly named Worthies was at once a great Philoſopher, and a great Critick; (the three firſt being not ſo well vers'd in Philoſophical Learning, and the laſt being unacquainted with the Eaſtern Tongues:) I cannot but hope, that when it ſhall pleaſe God to ſtir up perſons of a Philoſophical Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, well furniſh'd with Critical Learning, and the Principles of true Philoſophy, and ſhall give them a hearty Concern for the Advancement of his Truths; theſe men, by exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing upon Theological matters, that Inquiſitiveneſs and Sagacity that has made in our Age ſuch a happy Progreſs in Philoſophical ones, will make Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications and Diſcoveries, that will juſtifie more than I have ſaid in praiſe of the ſtudy of our Religion and the Divine Books that contain the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of it. For theſe want not Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, but onely skilful Unvailers. And if I do not tell you, that you ſhould no more meaſure the Wiſdom of God couch'd in the Bible, by the Gloſſes or Syſtems of common Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:93740:41"/>
and Preachers, than Eſtimate the Wiſdome he has expreſs'd in the contrivance of the World by <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>'s or <hi>Euſtachius</hi>'s Phyſicks; yet I ſhall not ſcruple to ſay, That you ſhould as little think, that there are no more Myſteries in the Books of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, beſides thoſe that the School-Divines and Vulgar Commentators have taken notice of, and unfolded; as that there are no other Myſteries in the Book of Nature, than thoſe which the ſame School-men (who have taken upon them to interpret <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and Nature too) have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd and explain'd. All the fine things, that Poets, Orators, and even Lovers have Hyperbolically ſaid in praiſe of the Beauty of Eyes, will no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing near ſo much recommend them to a Philoſophers eſteem, as the ſight of one Eye skilfully diſſected, or the unadorn'd Account given of its Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, and the admirable uſes of its ſeveral parts, in <hi>Scheiner</hi>'s <hi>Oculus,</hi> and <hi>Des-Cartes</hi>'s Excellent <hi>Dioptricks.</hi> And though I do not think my ſelf bound to acquieſce in, and admire eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing that is propos'd as Myſterious and Rare by many Interpreters and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:93740:41"/>
Preachers; yet I think, I may ſafely compare ſeveral things in the Books we call the Scripture, to ſeveral others in that of Nature, in (at leaſt) one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard. For, though I do not believe all the Wonders, that <hi>Pliny, Aelian, Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> and other Writers of that ſtamp, relate of the Generation of Animals; <hi>yet</hi> by peruſing ſuch faithful and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate accounts, as ſometimes <hi>Galen, De uſu Partium,</hi> ſometimes <hi>Veſalius,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times our <hi>Harvey (de Ovo)</hi> and our later Anatomiſts, and ſometimes other true Naturaliſts, give of the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Animals, and of the admirable Structure of their Bodies, eſpecially thoſe of Men, and ſuch other parts of <hi>Zoology,</hi> as <hi>Pliny,</hi> and the other Writers I nam'd with him, could make nothing conſiderable of; by peruſing theſe (I ſay) I receive more pleaſure and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, and am induc'd more to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the works of Nature, than by all their Romantic and Superficial Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratives. And thus (to apply this to our preſent Subject) a cloſe and critical account of the more vail'd and preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant parts of Scripture, and Theologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Matters, with ſuch Reflections on them, as their Nature and Collation
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:93740:42"/>
would ſuggeſt to a Philoſophical, as well as Critical, Speculator, would far better pleaſe a Rational Conſiderer, and give him a higher, as well as a better grounded, Veneration for the things explain'd, than a great many of thoſe ſleighter or ill-founded Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks, wherewith the Expoſitions and Diſcourſes of Superficial Writers, though never ſo florid or witty, gain the applauſe of the leſs diſcerning ſort of men.</p>
                     <p>And here, on this occaſion, I ſhall venture to add, that I deſpair not, but that a further uſe may be made of the Scripture, than either our Divines or Philoſophers ſeem to have thought on. Some few Theologues indeed have got the name of <hi>Supralapſarians,</hi> for venturing to look back beyond the Fall of <hi>Adam</hi> for God's Decrees of Election and Reprobation. But, beſides that their boldneſs has been diſlik'd by the generality of Divines, as well as other Chriſtians, the Object of their Speculation is much too narrow to be any thing near and adequate to ſuch an Hypotheſis as I mean. For me-thinks, that the <hi>Encyclopedia's</hi> and <hi>Panſophia's,</hi> that even men of an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated

                        <hi>Genius</hi> have aimed at, are not diffus'd enough to comprehend all that the Reaſon of a Man, improv'd by Philoſophy, and elevated by the Revelations already extant in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, may, by the help of free Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocination, and the hints contain'd in thoſe pregnant. Writings (with thoſe aſſiſtances of God's Spirit, which he is ſtill ready to vouchſafe to them that duly ſeek them,) attain unto in this life. The Goſpel com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes indeed, and unfolds the whole Myſtery of Man's Redemption,<note place="margin">Acts xx.27.</note> as far forth as 'tis neceſſary to be known for our Salvation: And the <hi>Corpuſcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riùm</hi> or Mechanical Philoſophy, ſtrives to deduce all the <hi>Phoenomena</hi> of Nature from Adiaphorous Matter, and Local Motion. But neither the Fundamental Doctrine of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, nor that of the Powers and Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of Matter and Motion, ſeems to be more than an Epicycle (if I may ſo call it) of the Great and Univerſal Syſtem of God's Contrivances, and makes but a part of the more general Theory of things, knowable by the Light of Nature, improv'd by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the Scriptures: So that
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:93740:43"/>
both theſe Doctrines, though very general, in reſpect of the ſubordinate parts of Theology and Philoſophy, ſeem to be but members of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Hypotheſis, whoſe Objects, I conceive, to be <hi>the Nature, Counſels, and Works of God, as far as they are diſcoverable by us</hi> (for I ſay not <hi>to us) in this Life.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For thoſe, to whom God has vouchſafed the priviledge of mature Reaſon, ſeem not to enlarge their thoughts enough, if they think, that the Omniſcient and Almighty God has bounded the Operations of his Power, and Wiſdom, and Goodneſs, to the Exerciſe that may be given them for ſome Ages, by the Produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Government of Matter and Motion, and of the Inhabitants of the Terreſtrial Globe, which we know to be but a Phyſical Point in compariſon of that Portion of Univerſal Matter, which we have already diſcover'd.</p>
                     <p>For I account, that there are four grand Communities of Creatures, whereof things meerly Corporeal make but one; the other three, differing from theſe, are diſtinct alſo from one another. Of the firſt ſort are the Race
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:93740:43"/>
of Mankind, where Intellectual Beings are vitally aſſociated with Groſs and Organical Bodies. The ſecond are Daemons, or evil Angels; and the third, good Angels; (whether in each of thoſe two kinds of Spirits, the Rational Beings be perfectly free from all uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Matter, though never ſo fine and ſubtile; or whether they be united to Vehicles, not Groſs, but Spirituous, and ordinarily inviſible to Us.)</p>
                     <p>Nor may we think, becauſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Devils are two names quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly utter'd, and thoſe Spirits are ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome or never ſeen by us, there are therefore but few of them, and the Speculation of them is not conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. For, <hi>as</hi> their Excellency is great, (as we ſhall by and by ſhew) ſo for their number, they are repreſented in Scripture as an Heavenly Hoſt, ſtanding on the right and left hand of the Throne of God.<note place="margin">Matth. xxvj.53.</note> And of the good Angels, our Saviour Speaks of having more than twelve Legions of them at his command. Nay, the Prophet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> ſaith, that to the <hi>Antient of days,</hi>

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:93740:44"/>
the Goſpel informs us, that enough to call them a Legion (which you know is uſually reckon'd,<note place="margin">Mark v.9. Luke viij.30.</note> at a moderate rate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to conſiſt of betwixt ſix and ſeven thouſand) poſſeſs'd one ſingle man. For my part, when I conſider, that matter, how vaſtly extended, and how curiouſly ſhap'd ſoever, is but a brute thing, that is onely capable of Local motion and its effects and conſequents on other Bodies, or the Brain of man, without being capable of any True, or at leaſt any Intellectual, Perception, or true Love or Hatred; and when I conſider the Rational Soul as an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material and immortal Being, that bears the Image of its Divine Maker, being indow'd with a capacious Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, and a Will that no Creature can force: I am by theſe Conſiderations diſpos'd to think the Soul of Man a nobler and more valuable Being, than the whole Corporeal World; which though I readily acknowledge it to be admirably contriv'd, and worthy of the Almighty and Omniſcient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, yet it conſiſts but of an Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregate of Portions of brute Matter, variouſly ſhap'd and connected by Local Motion (as Dow, and Roles,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:93740:44"/>
and Loves, and Cakes, and <hi>Vermicel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li,</hi> Wafers, and Pie-cruſt, are all of them diverſified Meal;) but without any knowledge either of their own Nature, or of that of their Author, or of that of their Fellow-creatures. And as the Rational Soul is ſomewhat more noble and wonderful, than any thing meerly Corporeal, how vaſt ſoever it can be, and is of a more excellent Nature, than the curiouſeſt piece of Mechaniſm in the world, the Humane Body; ſo to enquire what ſhall become of it, and what Fates it is like to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo hereafter, does better deſerve a man's Curioſity, than to know what ſhall befall the Corporeal Univerſe, and might juſtly have been to <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar</hi> a more deſirable part of knowledge, than that he was ſo trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for want of,<note place="margin">Dan. ij.31, 32, &amp;c.</note> when it was adum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated to him in the myſterious Dream, that contain'd the Characters and Fates of the four Great Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies of the World. And as man is intruſted with a Will of his own, whereas all material things move onely as they are mov'd, and have no ſelf-determining power, on whoſe account they can reſiſt the Will of God; and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:93740:45"/>
as alſo of Angels, at leaſt ſome Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of them, are of a higher Quality (if I may ſo ſpeak) than Humane Souls; ſo 'tis very probable, that in the Government of Angels, whether good or bad, that are Intellectual Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Agents, there is requir'd and employ'd far greater diſplays of Gods Wiſdom, Power, and Goodneſs, than in the guidance of Adiaphorous Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and the method of God's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct in the Government of theſe, is a far nobler Object for men's Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, than the Laws, according to which the parts of Matter hit againſt, and juſtle, one another, and the effects or reſults of ſuch Motions.</p>
                     <p>And accordingly we find in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, that, whereas about the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the material World, and the ſetting of the frame of Nature, God employ'd onely a few commanding Words, which ſpeedily had their full effects; to govern the Race of Mankind, even in order to their own Happineſs, he employ'd not onely Laws and Commands, but Revelations, Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, Promiſes, Threats, Exhortations, Mercies, Judgments, and divers other Methods and Means; and yet often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:93740:45"/>
when he might well ſay,<note place="margin">Iſa. v.4.</note> as he did once by his Prophet, <hi>What could I have done more to my Vineyard that I have not done it?</hi> he had juſt cauſe to expoſtulate as he did in the ſame place, <hi>Wherefore, when I looked that it ſhould bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?</hi> and to complain of men, as by that very Prophet he did even of <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Iſa. lxv.2.</note> 
                        <hi>I have ſpread out my hands all the day to a rebellious people.</hi> But not to wander too far in this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion; what we have ſaid of Men, may render it probable, that the grand Attributes of God are more ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally exercis'd, and made more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous in the making and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of each of the three Intellectual Communities, than in the framing and upholding the Community of meer bodily things. And ſince all Immate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Subſtances are for that reaſon na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally Immortal, and the Univerſal Matter is believ'd ſo too, poſſibly thoſe Revolutions, that will happen after the Day of Judgment, wherein though probably not the Matter, yet that ſtate and conſtitution of it, on whoſe account it is <hi>This World,</hi> will be deſtroyed, and make way for quite

new <hi>Frames</hi> and <hi>Sets</hi> of things corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real, and the Beings that compoſe each of theſe Intellectual Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, will, in thoſe numberleſs Ages they ſhall laſt, travel through I know not how many ſucceſſive changes and adventures; perhaps, I ſay, theſe things will no leſs diſplay, and bring glory, to the Divine Attributes, than the Contrivance of the world, and the Oeconomy of Man's Salvation, though theſe be (and that worthily) the Objects of the Naturaliſts and the Divines Contemplation. And there are ſome paſſages in the Prophetical part of the Scripture, and eſpecially in the Book of the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> which, as they ſeem to intimate, that <hi>as</hi> God will perform great and noble things, which Mechanical Philoſophy never reach'd to, and which the generality of Divines ſeem not to have thought of; <hi>ſo</hi> divers of thoſe great things may be, in ſome meaſure, diſcover'd by an attentive Searcher into the Scriptures, and that ſo much to the advantage of the devout Indagator, that St. <hi>John,</hi> near the beginning of his <hi>Revelations,</hi> pronounces them <hi>hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,</hi> that <hi>read</hi> the matters contain'd in

                     <p>And here, Sir, let me freely confeſs to you, that I am apt to think, that, if men were not wanting to Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and their own ſatisfaction, there would be far more Diſcoveries made,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:93740:47"/>
than are yet attain'd to, of the Divine Attributes. When we conſider the moſt ſimple or uncompounded Eſſence of God, we may eaſily be perſwaded, that what belongs to Any of His At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes (ſome of which thinking men generally admire) muſt be an Object of Enquiry exceeding Noble, and worthy of our knowledge. And yet the abſtruſeneſs of this knowledge is not in All particulars ſo invincible, but that I ſtrongly hope, a Philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Eye, illuſtrated by the Revelations extant in the Scripture, may pierce a great deal farther than has yet been done, into thoſe myſterious Subjects, which are too often (perhaps out of a miſtaken Reverence) ſo poorly hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by Divines and Schoolmen, that not onely what they have taught, is not worthy of God (for that's a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and therefore excuſable, defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency) but too frequently it is not worthy of Men, I mean, of Rational Creatures, that take upon them to treat of ſuch high Points, and inſtruct others about them. And I queſtion not but your Friend will the leſs ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at this, if he call to mind thoſe new and handſome Notions about
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:93740:48"/>
ſome of the Attributes of God, that his Maſter <hi>Carteſius,</hi> though but mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately vers'd in the Scriptures, has preſented us with. Nor do I doubt but that a much greater progreſs might be made in the Diſcovery of Subjects, where, though we can never know <hi>all,</hi> we may ſtill know <hi>farther,</hi> if Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative Genius's would propoſe to themſelves particular Doubts and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries about particular Attributes, and frame and examine Hypotheſes, eſtabliſh Theorems, draw Corollaries; and (in ſhort) apply to this ſtudy the ſame ſagacity, affiduity, and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mind, which they often im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy about Inquiries of a very much inferiour nature; inſomuch as <hi>Des-Cartes</hi> (how profound a Geometrician ſoever he were) confeſſes in one of his Epiſtles, that he employ'd no leſs then <hi>ſix weeks</hi> to find the ſolution of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem or queſtion of <hi>Pappus.</hi> And <hi>Pythagoras</hi> was ſo addicted to, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd for Geometrical Speculations, that when he had found that famous Propoſition, which makes the 47<hi>th.</hi> in <hi>Euclid</hi>'s I. Book, he is recorded to have offer'd a <hi>Hecatomb,</hi> to expreſs his joy and gratitude for the Diſcovery:
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:93740:48"/>
which yet was but of one Property of one ſort of Right-lin'd Triangles. And certainly if Chriſtian Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers did rightly eſtimate, how noble and fertile Subjects the Divine Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes are, they would find in them wherewithall to Exerciſe their beſt parts, as well as to Recompence the Imployment of them. But becauſe what I would diſſwade, does not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps proceed onely from Lazineſs, but from a Miſtake; as if there were little to be known of ſo Incomprehenſible an Object as God, ſave that in General all his Attributes are like himſelf, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, and conſequently not to be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Known by Humane Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, becauſe They are Finite; I ſhall add, that though it be true, that by Reaſon of God's Infinity, we cannot <hi>Comprehend</hi> him, that is, have <hi>a full and adequate knowledge</hi> of him; yet we may not onely know very many things concerning him, but, which is more, <hi>may</hi> make an Endleſs Progreſs in that Knowledge. As, no doubt, <hi>Pythagoras</hi> (newly mention'd) knew very well what a Triangle was, and was acquainted with divers of its Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Affections before he diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:93740:49"/>
that famous One. And though ſince him, <hi>Euclid, Archimedes,</hi> and other Geometricians have demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated, I know not how many other Affections of the ſame Figure, yet they have not to this day <hi>Exhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted</hi> the Subject: And poſſibly, I, (who pretend not to be a Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician) may now and then in managing certain Aequations I had occaſion for, have lighted upon ſome Theorems about Triangles, that occurr'd not to any of them. The Divine Attributes are ſuch fruitful Themes, and ſo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of our Admiration, that the whole Fabrick of the Univerſe, and all the <hi>Phenomena</hi> exhibited in it, are but Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Expreſſions of Gods Wiſdom, and ſome few of his other Attributes. And I do not much marvel, that the Angels themſelves are repreſented in Scripture as imploy'd in Adoring God,<note place="margin">Iſa. vj.2, 3. Luke ij.13, 14. Revel. v.11, 12.</note> and Admiring his Perfections. For even <hi>they</hi> being but Finite, can frame but inadequate Conceptions of <hi>Him</hi>; and conſequently muſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour by <hi>many</hi> of them to make amends for the Incompleatneſs of <hi>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> one of them; which yet they can never but Imperfectly do. And yet

Gods Infinity can but very impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be made a Diſcouragement of our Enquiries into his Nature and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes. For (not now to examine whether <hi>Infinity,</hi> though expreſs'd by a Negative word, be not a Poſitive thing in God) we may, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Infinity, diſcover as much of him as our Nature is capable of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: And what harm is it to him that is drinking in a River, that he cannot drink up all the water, if he have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty fully to quench his thirſt, and take in as much Liquor as his ſtomack can contain. Infinity therefore ſhould not hinder us from a Generous Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition to learn as much as we can of an Object, whoſe being Infinite does but make our knowledge of it the more noble and deſirable, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is in ſuch a degree, that we need not wonder that the Angels are repreſented as never weary of their Employment of contemplating and praiſing God. For, as I lately intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that they can have but inadequate Idea's of thoſe boundleſs Perfections, and by no number of thoſe Idea's can arrive to make amends for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compleatneſs of them; ſo it need not

ſeem ſtrange that in freſh Diſcoveries of new Parts (if I may ſo call them) of the ſame Object, it being <hi>ſuch a one,</hi> they ſhould find nobler and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier Entertainments than any where elſe variety could afford them.</p>

                     <p>HAving thus taken notice of ſome Particulars of thoſe many which may be employ'd to ſhew, how <hi>Noble</hi> the <hi>Objects</hi> are, that Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy propoſes to be contemplated; I now proceed to ſome Conſiderations that may make us ſenſible how great an <hi>Obligation</hi> there lies on us, to addict our ſelves to the ſtudy of them.</p>
                     <p>Yet of the Particulars whereon this Obligation may be grounded, I ſhall now name but two, they being indeed comprehenſive ones, <hi>Obedience,</hi> and <hi>Gratitude.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And firſt let me repreſent, that it needs not, I ſuppoſe, be ſolicitouſly proved, That 'tis the Will and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God, that men ſhould learn thoſe Truths that he has been pleaſed
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:93740:50"/>
to teach, whether concerning his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or Attributes, or the way where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he will be Served and Worſhipped by Man. For if we had not Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Scripture to that purpoſe, yet your Friend is too Rational a Man to believe, that God would ſo ſolemnly cauſe his Truths to be publiſhed to Mankind, both by Preaching and Writing, without Intention to Oblige, thoſe (at leaſt) that have the capacity and opportunity to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into ſome of them; and if it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be <hi>His will,</hi> that a perſon ſo qualified, ſhould ſearch after the moſt important Truths that he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd, it cannot but be <hi>their duty</hi> to do ſo. For though the nature of the thing it ſelf did not lay any Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation on us, yet the Authority of Him that Commands it, would: ſince being the Supreme and Abſolute Lord of all His Creatures, he has as well a full right to make what Laws he thinks fit, and enjoyn what ſervice he thinks fit, as a power to puniſh thoſe that either violate the one, or deny the other; and accordingly 'tis very obſervable, that before <hi>Adam</hi> fell, and had forfeited his happy ſtate by
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:93740:51"/>
his own tranſgreſſion, he not onely had a Law Impos'd upon him, but ſuch a Law,<note place="margin">Gen. ij.16, 17.</note> as, being about a matter it ſelf Indifferent (for ſo it was to eat or not to eat of the Tree of Life as well as of any other,) derived its whole power of obliging from the meer will and pleaſure of the Law-giver. Whence we may learn, that Man is ſubject to the Laws of God, not as he is Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to him, but as he is a Rational Creature, and that the thing that is not a duty in its own nature, may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an indiſpenſible one barely by its being commanded. And indeed, if <hi>our first Parent</hi> in the ſtate of Innocency and Happineſs, wherein he taſted of Gods Bounty, without, as yet, ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in need of his Mercy, was moſt ſtrictly obliged out of meer Obedience to conform to a Law, the matter of which was indifferent in it ſelf; ſure <hi>we,</hi> in our laps'd condition, muſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a high Obligation to obey the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared will of God, whereby we are enjoyned to ſtudy his Truths, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form that which has ſo much of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſick Goodneſs in it, that it would be a duty, though it were not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded; and has ſuch Recompences
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:93740:51"/>
propoſed to it, that it is not more a Duty, then it will be an Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
                     <p>But it is not onely Obedience and Intereſt that ſhould engage us to the ſtudy of Divine things, but <hi>Gratitude,</hi> and that exacted by ſo many impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Motives, that he who ſaid, <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratum ſi dixeris, omnia dixeris,</hi> could not think Ingratitude ſo much worſe than ordinary Vices, as a contempt of the Duty I am preſſing, would be worſe than an ordinary Ingratitude.</p>
                     <p>It were not difficult on this occaſion to manifeſt, that we are extremely great Debtors unto God, both as he is the Authour and the Preſerver of our very Beings; and as he (immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately or mediately) fills up the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of thoſe continual Benefits with all the Prerogatives and other Favours we <hi>do</hi> receive from him as Men; and the higher Bleſſings, which (if we are not wanting to our ſelves) we <hi>may</hi> receive from him as Chriſtians.</p>
                     <p>But to ſhew, in how many Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and to how high a Degree, God is our Benefactor, were to lanch out into too Immenſe a Subject; which 'twere the leſs proper for me to do,

becauſe I have in other Papers diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd of thoſe matters already.<note place="margin">Seraph. Love.</note> I will therefore ſingle out a Motive of Gratitude, which will be peculiarly pertinent to our preſent purpoſe. For whereas your Friend does ſo highly value himſelf upon the Study of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Philoſophy, and deſpiſes not onely Divines, but States-men, and even the Learned'ſt Men in other parts of Philoſophy and Knowledge, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not vers'd in Phyſicks; he ows to God that very Skill, among many other Vouchſafements. For it is God who made Man <hi>unlike the Horſe and the Mule,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. xxxij.9.</note> 
                        <hi>who have no understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and endow'd him with that noble power of Reaſon, by the exerciſe of which he attains to whatever know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge he has of Natural things above the Beaſts that periſh. For, that may juſtly be applied to our other Acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, which <hi>Moſes,</hi> by Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, told the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Acquiſts of Riches; where he bids the people beware, That when their Herds, and their Flocks, and other Treaſures were multipli'd, their heart be not lifted up,<note place="margin">Deut. viij.10, 11, 12,</note> and prompt them to ſay, <hi>My power, and the might
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:93740:52"/>
of my hand hath gotten me this wealth.</hi> But, (ſubjoyns that excellent Perſon,<note place="margin">13, 14,</note> as well as Matchleſs Law-giver) <hi>Thou ſhalt remember the Lord thy God, for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">18,</note> But to make Men Rational Creatures, is not all God has done towards the making them Philoſophers. For, to the knowledge of particular things, Objects are as well requiſite as Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and if we admit the probable Opinion of Divines, who teach us, that the Angels were created before the Material World, as being meant by thoſe <hi>Sons of God,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Job xxxviij.5, 6, 7.</note> and <hi>Morning Stars,</hi> that with glad Songs and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations celebrated the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Earth; we muſt allow, that there were many creatures endowed with at leaſt as much Reaſon as your Friend, who yet were unacquainted with the Myſteries of Nature, ſince She her ſelf had not yet receiv'd a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Wherefore God having as well made the World, as given Man the Faculties whereby he is enabled to contemplate it; Naturaliſts are as much obliged to God for their Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as we are for our Intelligence to thoſe that write us Secrets in Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:93740:53"/>
and teach us the skill of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyphering things ſo written; or to thoſe who write what would fill a Page in the compaſs of a ſingle Peny, and preſent us to boot a Microſcope to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able us to read it. And as the Natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt hath peculiar Inducements to Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude for the Endowment of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; ſo Ingenuity lays this peculiar Obligation on him to expreſs his Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude in the way I have been recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending, That <hi>'tis one of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptableſt ways it can be expreſs'd in</hi>; eſpecially ſince by this way, Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers may not onely exerciſe their own gratitude towards God, but procure him that of others. How pleaſing mens hearty Praiſes are to God, may appear among other things, by what is ſaid and done by that Royal Poet, whom God was pleaſed to declare <hi>a man after his own heart</hi>; for he intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces God pronouncing,<note place="margin">Pſa.

                        <hi>Whoſo offereth Praiſe, glorifieth me</hi>; where the word our Interpreters render <hi>offereth,</hi> in the Hebrew ſignifies to <hi>Sacrifice</hi>; with which agrees, that elſe-where thoſe that pay God their Praiſes, are ſaid to Sacrifice <hi>to him the calves of their lips.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Hoſ. xiv.2.</note> And that excellent Perſon, to whom
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:93740:53"/>
God vouchſafed ſo particular a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, was ſo aſſiduous in this Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, that the Book which we, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Greek,</hi> call <hi>Pſalms,</hi> is, in the Original, from the things it moſt abounds with, called <hi>Sepher Tehillim,</hi> i. e. <hi>The Book of Praiſes.</hi> And to let you ſee, that many of his Praiſes were ſuch, as the Naturaliſt may beſt give, he exclaims in one place,<note place="margin">Pſal. civ.24.</note> 
                        <hi>How manifold are thy works, O Lord?</hi> how wiſely haſt thou made them, (as <hi>Junius</hi> and <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mellius</hi> render it, and the Hebrew will bear) and elſe-where,<note place="margin">Pſal. xix.1.</note>

                        <hi>I will praiſe thee, becauſe I am fearfully and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully made. Marvellous are thy works, and that my ſoul knoweth right well.</hi> And not content with many of the like Expreſſions, he does ſeveral times in a devout Tranſport, and Poetical ſtrain, invite the Heavens, and the Stars, and the Earth, and the Seas, and all the other Inanimate Creatures, to joyn with him in the celebration of their common Maker. Which though it ſeem to be meerly a Poetical Scheme, yet in ſome ſort it might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:93740:54"/>
a Naturaliſt, who by making out the Power, Wiſdom, and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Creator, and by reflecting thence on thoſe Particulars wherein thoſe Attributes ſhine, may, by ſuch a devout Conſideration of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, make them, in a ſenſe, joyn with him in glorifying their Author.</p>
                     <p>In any other caſe, I dare ſay, your Friend is not ſo ill natur'd, but that he would think it an unkind piece of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude, if ſome great and excellent Prince, having freely and tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently obliged him, he ſhould not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern himſelf to know what manner of Man his Benefactor is; and ſhould not be ſolicitous to inform himſelf of thoſe particulars, relating to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Affairs of that obliging Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, which were not onely in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves worthy of any mans Curioſity, but about which the Prince had ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly declar'd he was very deſirous to have men Inquiſitive. And ſure 'tis very diſingenious, to undervalue or neglect the knowledge of God Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for a Knowledge which we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not attain without him, and by which he deſign'd to bring us to that ſtudy we neglect for it: which is not onely
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:93740:54"/>
not to uſe him as a Benefactor, but as if he meant to puniſh him (if I may ſo ſpeak) for having oblieged us, ſince we ſo abuſe ſome of his Favours, as to make them Inducements to our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankful Diſregard of his Intentions in the reſt. And this Ingratitude is the more culpable, becauſe the Laws of Ingenuity, and of Juſtice it ſelf, charge us to Glorifie the Maker of all things viſible, not onely upon our own account, but upon that of all his other works. For by Gods endowing of none but Man here below with a Reaſonable Soul, not onely he is the ſole viſible Being that can return Thanks and Praiſes in the World, and thereby is oblieged to do ſo, both for himſelf, and for the reſt of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <hi>but</hi> 'tis for <hi>Mans advantage,</hi> that God has left no other viſible Beings in the World, by which he can be ſtudied and celebrated. For, Reaſon is ſuch a Ray of Divinity, that, if God had vouchſafed it to other parts of the Univerſe beſides Man, the abſolute Empire of Man over the reſt of the World muſt have been ſhar'd, or abridg'd. So that he, to whom it was equally eaſie to make Creatures Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:93740:55"/>
to Man (as the Scripture tells us of Legions, and Myriads of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels) as to make them Inferiour to him, dealt ſo obligingly with Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, as rather to Truſt (if I may ſo ſpeak) our Ingenuity, whether he ſhall reap any Celebrations from the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures we converſe with, than Leſſen our Empire over them, or our Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives above them.</p>
                     <p>But I fear, that, notwithſtanding all the Excellency of reveal'd Truths, and conſequently of that onely Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentic Repoſitory of them, the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, you, as well as I, have met with <hi>ſome</hi> (for I hope there are not <hi>many) Virtuoſi,</hi> that think to excuſe the neglect of the ſtudy of it, by al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging, that to them who are Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, not Eccleſiaſticks, there is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd to Salvation the Explicit knowledge but of very few Points, which are ſo plainly ſumm'd up in the Apoſtles Creed, and are ſo often and conſpicuouſly ſet down in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, that one needs not much ſearch or ſtudy it to find them there.</p>
                     <p>In anſwer to this Allegation, I rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily grant,<note place="margin">1 Tim. ij.4.</note> that through the great goodneſs of God, <hi>who is willing to
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:93740:55"/>
have all men ſaved, and come to the knowledge of the Truth,</hi> that is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be ſo, there are much fewer Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles abſolutely neceſſary to be by all men diſtinctly believed, than may be met with in divers long Confeſſions of Faith, ſome of which have, I fear, leſs promoted Knowledge than im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair'd Charity. But then it may be alſo conſider'd, 1. That 'tis not ſo eaſie for a Rational Man, that will trouble himſelf to enquire no farther than the Apoſtles Creed, to ſatisfie himſelf upon good grounds, that all the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Articles of Chriſtianity are contain'd in it. 2. That the Creed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes onely the <hi>Credenda,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Joh. xiij.7. Heb. v.9.</note> not the <hi>Agenda</hi> of Religion; whereas the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures were deſigned, not onely to teach us what Truths we are to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, but by what Rules we are to live; the obedience to the Laws of Chriſtianity being as neceſſary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, as the belief of its Myſteries. 3. That beſides the things which are abſolutely neceſſary, there are ſeveral that are highly uſeful, to make us more clearly underſtand, and more ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally and firmly believe, and more ſteadily practiſe, the points that are
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:93740:56"/>
neceſſary. 4. And ſince, whether or no thoſe words of our Saviour to the Jews, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed 'tis far more pardonable to want or miſs the knowledge of Truths, than to deſpiſe or neglect it. And the goodneſs of God to illiterate or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken perſons, is to be ſuppos'd meant in pity to our Frailties, not to encourage our Lazineſs; nor is it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that he that <hi>pardons</hi> thoſe Seekers of his Truths that miſs them, ſhould <hi>excuſe</hi> thoſe Deſpiſers that will not ſeek them.</p>
                     <p>But whether or no by this deſign'd neglect of Theology the perſons, I deal with, do ſufficiently conſult their own ſafety, I doubt they will not much recommend their Ingenuity.
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:93740:56"/>
For to have received from God a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er meaſure of Intellectual Abilities than the generality of Chriſtians, and yet willingly to come ſhort of very many of them, in the knowledge of the Myſteries and other Truths of Chriſtianity, which he often invites us, if not expreſly commands, to ſearch after, is a courſe that will not reliſh of over-much gratitude. Is it a piece of That, and of Ingenuity, to receive ones Underſtanding and ones Hopes of Eternal Felicity from the Goodneſs of God, without being ſollicitous of what may be known of his Nature and Purpoſes by ſo excellent a way as his own Revelation of them? To diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute anxiouſly about the Properties of an Atome, and be careleſs about the Inquiry into the Attributes of the <hi>great God, who formed all things</hi>;<note place="margin">Prov. xxvj.10.</note> to inveſtigate the ſpontaneous genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch vile Creatures as Inſects, than the Myſterious Generation of the Adorable Son of God; and, in a word, to be more concern'd to know every thing that makes a Corporeal part of the World, than the Divine and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporeal Authour of the whole?</p>
                     <p>And then, is it not, think you, a
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:93740:57"/>
great piece of reſpect, that theſe men pay to thoſe Truths, which God thought fit to ſend ſometimes Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apoſtles, ſometimes An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and ſometimes his onely Son himſelf to reveal, that ſuch Truths are ſo little valued by them, that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than take the pains to ſtudy them, they will implicitly, and at ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures believe, what that Society of Chriſtians, they chance to be born and bred in, have (truly or falſly) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered concerning them? And does it argue a due regard to points of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that thoſe, who would not believe a Propoſition in <hi>Staticks,</hi> perhaps about a meer Point, the Centre of Gravity, or in Geometry, about the Properties of ſome nameleſs curve Line, or ſome ſuch other things, (which to ignore, is uſually not a ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh, and about which, to be miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, is more uſually without danger,) ſhould yet take up the Articles of Faith, concerning matters of great and everlaſting Conſequence, upon the Authority of Men, Fallible as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, when ſatisfaction may be had without them from the Infallible Word of God? In this very unlike

                     <p>Again, if a man ſhould refuſe to learn to read any more, than juſt as much as may ſerve his turn, by inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuling him to the benefit of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, to ſave him from hanging, would theſe men think ſo ſmall a meaſure of Literature, as he had acquir'd on ſuch an account, could prove that man to be a Lover of Learning; and yet a neglecter of the ſtudy of all not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary-Divine Truths, during ones life, becauſe the belief of the Articles of the Creed may make a ſhift to keep him from being doom'd to Hell for Ignorance after his death, will not by (what in a Learned man muſt be) ſo pitiful a degree of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge be much better intitled to that Ingenuous Love of God and his Truths, that becomes a Rational Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and a Chriſtian.</p>

                     <p>I Come now to our third and laſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement to the ſtudy of Divine things, which conſiſts in, and compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the <hi>Advantages</hi> of that ſtudy, which do as much ſurpaſs thoſe of all other Contemplations, as Divine things tranſcend all other Objects. And indeed, the utility of this ſtudy is ſo pregnant a Motive, and contains in it ſo many Invitations, that your Friend muſt have as little ſenſe of Intereſt as of Gratitude, if he can neglect ſuch powerful and ſuch ingaging Invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                     <p>For, in the firſt place, Theological ſtudies ought to be highly endeared to us by the Delightfulneſs of conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch noble and worthy Objects as are therein propos'd.</p>
                     <p>The famous Anſwer given by an excellent Philoſopher, who being ask'd what he was born for, repli'd, <hi>To contemplate the Sun,</hi> may juſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend their choice, who ſpend their time in contemplating the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:93740:59"/>
of the Sun, to whom that glorious Planet it ſelf is but a ſhadow. And perhaps that Philoſopher failed more in the Inſtance than in the Notion: For his Anſwer implies, That Man's End and Happineſs conſiſts in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of his nobleſt Faculties on the nobleſt Objects. And ſurely the ſeat of <hi>Formal Happineſs</hi> being the Soul, and that Happineſs conſequently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in the Operations of her Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; as the Supreme Faculty of the Mind is the Underſtanding, ſo the higheſt Pleaſures may be expected from the due Exerciſe of it upon the ſublimeſt and worthieſt Objects. And therefore I wonder not, that though ſome of the School-men would aſſign the Will a larger ſhare in Mans Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, than they will allow the Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect; yet the generality of them are quite of another mind, and aſcribe the Preheminence in point of Felicity to the Superiour Faculty of the Soul. But, whether or no this Opinion be true in all Caſes, it may at leaſt be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in ours: For, the chief Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of a Chriſtian Philoſophers Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, being as well the Infinite Goodneſs, as the other boundleſs Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:93740:59"/>
of God, they are naturally fitted to excite in his mind an ardent love of that adorable Being, and thoſe other joyous Affections and virtuous Diſpoſitions, that have made ſome men think Happineſs chiefly ſeated in the Will. But having intimated thus much by the way, I paſs on to add, That the contentment afforded by the aſſiduous diſcovery of God and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Myſteries, has ſo much of affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity with the Pleaſures, that ſhall make up mens Bleſſedneſs in Heaven it ſelf, that they ſeem rather to differ in Degree than in Kind. For, the happy ſtate even of Angels is by our Saviour repreſented by this Imployment, that <hi>they continually ſee the face of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther who is in Heaven.</hi> And the ſame infallible Teacher, intending elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where to expreſs the Celeſtial Joys that are reſerv'd for thoſe, who for Their ſake deny'd themſelves ſenſual Pleaſures, imploys the Viſion of God as an Emphatical Periphraſe of Felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>Bleſſed,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>are the pure in heart,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Matth. v.8.</note> 
                        <hi>for they ſhall ſee God.</hi> And as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> teaches, that the Soul doth after a ſort become that which it Speculates, St. <hi>Paul</hi> and St. <hi>John</hi> aſſure us, that
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:93740:60"/>
God is a transforming Object, and that in Heaven <hi>we ſhall be like him,</hi>

                        </note> 
                        <hi>for</hi> (or, <hi>becauſe) we ſhall ſee him as he is.</hi> And though I readily admit, that this Beatiſick Viſion of God, wherein the Underſtanding is the proper Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, includes divers other things which will concur to the compleat Felicity of the future Life; yet I think, we may be allowed to argue, that that raviſhing Contemplation of Divine Objects, will make <hi>no ſmall part</hi> of that happy Eſtate, which in theſe Texts take its Denomination from it.</p>
                     <p>I have above intimated, that the Scripture attributes to the Angels themſelves Tranſports of Wonder and Joy upon the Contemplation of God, and the Exerciſes they conſider of his Wiſdom, Juſtice, or ſome other of his Attributes. But leaſt in referring you to the Angels, you ſhould ſay, that I do in this Diſcourſe lay aſide the Perſon of a Naturaliſt, in favour of Divines; I will refer you to <hi>Des Cartes</hi> himſelf, whom I am ſure your Friend will allow to have been a rigid Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher, if ever there were any. Thus then ſpeaks he in that Treatiſe, where
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:93740:60"/>
he thinks he imploys a more than Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical Rigor; and where he was obliged to utter thoſe (I had almoſt ſaid Paſſionate) words, I am going to cite from him, onely by the Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions made on him by the tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Excellency of the Ob<gap reason="illegible: blotted" resp="#PDCC" extent="2+ letters">

Ut enim in hac ſola Divinae Majeſtatis Contemplatione ſummam alterius vitae felicitatem ex conſiſtere fide credimus; ita etiam jam ex eadem, licet multo minus perfecta, maximam, cujus in hac vita capaces ſimus, voluptatem, percipi poſſe experimur.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But as high a ſatisfaction as the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Divine things affords by the Nobleneſs of its Object, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment is not much Inferiour that accrues from the ſame ſtudy upon the ſcore of the Senſe of a mans having in it performed his Duty. To make
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:93740:61"/>
actions of this nature ſatisfactory to us, there is no need, that the things we are employ'd about, ſhould in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves be Excellent or Delightful; the inward gratulations of Conſcience for having done our Duties is able to <gap reason="illegible: blotted" resp="#PDCC" extent="2+ letters">

Thoſe antient Pagan <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes,</hi> whoſe Vertues may make us bluſh, being guided but by natural Reaſon, and innate Principles of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Virtues, could find the moſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult and moſt troubleſome Duties, upon the bare account of their being Duties, not onely Tolerable but Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant. And though to deny ſome Luſts be, in our Saviours eſteem, no leſs uneaſie, then for a man to <hi>pluck out his right eye,</hi>

                        <hi>or cut off his right hand</hi>; yet even Ladies have with ſatisfaction choſen, not onely to deny themſelves the greateſt Pleaſures of the Senſes, but to Sacrifice the Seat of them, the Body it ſelf, to preſerve the Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of being Chaſte. Nor are they onely the Dictates of Obedience that we comply with in this ſtudy, but
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:93740:61"/>
thoſe of Gratitude; and that is a Vertue that has ſo powerful an Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant upon Ingenuous Minds, that thoſe, whoſe Principles and Aims were not elevated by Religion, have, in acknowledgment to their Parents and their Countrey, courted the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Hardſhips, and Hazards, and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, as if they were as great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights and Advantages. And a grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Perſon ſpends no part of his Life to his greater ſatisfaction, than that which he ventures or imploys for thoſe to whom he is oblieged for it; and oftentimes finds a greater Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment even in the difficulteſt Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments of a favour, than he did in Receiving of it.</p>
                     <p>Another Advantage, and that no mean one, that may accrue from the Contemplation of Theological Truths, is, the Improvement of the Contemplator himſelf in point of Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Virtue. For, <hi>as</hi> the Goſpel is ſtyl'd, <hi>The myſtery of godlineſs</hi>;<note place="margin">1 Tim. iij.16.</note> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> elſewhere calls what it teaches, <hi>The truth which is according to godlineſs,</hi> that is,<note place="margin">Tit. j.1.</note> a Doctrine fram'd and fitted to promote the Intereſt of Piety and Virtue in the World: <hi>ſo</hi>
                        <pb n="90" facs="tcp:93740:62"/>
this Character and Encomium be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs (though perhaps not equally) to the more Retir'd Truths diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd by Speculation, as well as to thoſe more Obvious ones, that are familiarly taught in Catechiſms and Confeſſions of Faith. I would by no means leſſen the Excellency and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives of Fundamentals; but, ſince the grand and nobleſt Engagements to Piety and Virtue, are a high Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration for God and his Chriſt, and an ardent Love of them; I cannot but think, that thoſe <hi>particular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries, that tend</hi> to make greater Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries of the Attributes of God, of the Nature, and Offices, and Life of our Saviour, and of the Wiſdom and Goodneſs they have diſplay'd in the Contrivance and Effecting of Man's Redemption; <hi>do likewiſe tend</hi> to Increaſe our Admiration, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame our Love, for the Poſſeſſors of ſuch Divine Excellencies, and the Authors of ſuch invaluable Benefits. And as the Brazen Serpent,<note place="margin">Numb. xxj.9.</note> that was but a Type of one of the Goſpel My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, brought Recovery to thoſe that look'd up to it; ſo the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries themſelves, being duly conſider'd,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:93740:62"/>
have had a very Sanative Influence on many that contemplated Them. Nor is it likely, that he that diſcerns more of the depth of Gods Wiſdom and Goodneſs, ſhould not, <hi>caeteris pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus,</hi> be more diſpoſed than others to Admire him, to Love him, to Truſt him, and ſo to reſign up himſelf to be Governed by him: Which frame of mind <hi>both is</hi> it ſelf a great Part of the Worſhip of God, <hi>and doth</hi> directly tend to the Production and Increaſe of thoſe Vertues, without the practiſe of which, the Scripture plainly tells us, that we can neither Obey God, nor expreſs our Love to him. And from this Bettering of the mind by the ſtudy of Theology, will flow (to add that upon the by) an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Benefit, namely, that by giving us a higher value for God and his Truths, it will endear Heaven to us, and ſo not onely aſſiſt us to come Thither, but heighten our Felicity There.</p>
                     <p>I know it may be ſaid, that the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lioration of the mind is but a Moral Advantage. But give me leave to Anſwer, that, beſides that 'tis ſuch a
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:93740:63"/>
Moral Advantage as ſuppoſes an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual Improvement whoſe fruit it is, a Moral Benefit may be great enough, even in the Judgment of a meer Philoſopher, and an <hi>Epicurean,</hi> to deſerve as much ſtudy as Natural Philoſophy it ſelf. And that you may not think that I ſpeak this onely, becauſe I write in this Epiſtle as a Friend to Divines, I will tell you, that <hi>Epicurus</hi> himſelf, who has now adays ſo numerous a Sect of Naturaliſts to follow him, ſtudied Phyſicks, and writ ſo many Treatiſes about them for this End, that by knowing the Natural Cauſes of Thunder, Lightning, and other dreadful <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> the Mind might be freed from the diſquieting Apprehenſions Men commonly had, that ſuch ſtrange and formidable things proceeded from ſome incenſed Deity, and ſo might trouble the Mind, as well as the Air. This account I have been giving of <hi>Epicurus</hi> his Deſign, is but what ſeems plainly enough intimated by his own words, preſerved us by <hi>Laertius,</hi> near the end of his Phyſiological Epiſtle to <hi>Herodotus,</hi> where recommending to
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:93740:63"/>

And ſince it hence appears, that a meer Philoſopher, who admitted no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, may think it worth his pains, to ſearch into the abſtruſeſt parts of Phyſicks, and the difficulteſt <hi>Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena</hi> of Nature, onely to eaſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of one troubleſome Affection, <hi>Fear</hi>; it need not be thought Unphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical, to proſecute a Study, that will not onely Reſtrain One undue Paſſion, but Advance All Vertues, and free us from all <hi>Servile</hi> Fears of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:93740:64"/>
the Deity; and tend to give us a ſtrong and well-grounded Hope in Him; and make us look upon Gods greateſt Power, not with Terrour, but with Joy.</p>
                     <p>There is yet another Advantage belonging to the ſtudy of Divine Truths, which is too great to be here pretermitted. For whereas there is ſcarce any thing more incident to us whilſt we inhabit our (<hi>Batté Chómer) Cottages of Clay,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Iob iv.19.</note> and dwell in this <hi>vale of tears,</hi> than Afflictions; it ought not a little to endear to us the newly mention'd Study, that it may be eaſily made to afford us very power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Conſolations in that otherwiſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie ſtate.</p>
                     <p>I know it may be ſaid, that the Speculations about which the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſt is buſied, are as well pleaſing Diverſions, as noble Imployments of the Mind. And I deny not that they are often ſo, when the Mind is not hinder'd from applying it ſelf atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively to them; ſo that Afflictions ſlight and ſhort may well be weather'd out by theſe Philoſophical Avoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; but the Greater and Sharper
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:93740:65"/>
ſort of Afflictions, and the approaches of Death, require more powerful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, than theſe Diverſions can afford us. For in ſuch caſes, the Mind is wont to be too much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compos'd, to apply the attention re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to the finding a pleaſure in Phyſical Speculations; and in Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, the Soul is oftentimes as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpos'd to reliſh the Pleaſures of meerly Humane Studies, as the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Body is to reliſh thoſe Meats, which at other times were delightful: And there are but few that can take any great pleaſure to ſtudy the World, when they apprehend themſelves to be upon the point of being driven out of it, and in danger of loſing all their ſhare in the Objects of their Contemplation. It will not much qualifie our Senſe of the burning heat of a Feaver, or the painful gripes of the Cholick, to know, <hi>That the three Angles of a Triangle are equal to two Right ones</hi>; or that Heat is not a real Quality (as the Schools would have it,) but a Modification of the Motion of the Inſenſible parts of Matter; and Pain not a Diſtinct, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:93740:65"/>
Quality in the things that produce it, but an Affection of the Sentiment. The Naturaliſts Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations afford him no Conſolations that are extraordinary in, or peculiar to, the ſtate of Affliction; and the Avocations they preſent him with, do rather Amuſe the mind from an Attention to leſſer Evils, than bring it any Advantages to Remove or Compenſate them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo work rather in the nature of Opiates, than of true Cordials.</p>
                     <p>But now, if ſuch a Perſon as Dr. <hi>N.</hi> falls into Adverſity, the caſe is much otherwiſe; for we muſt conſider, that when the ſtudy of Divine things is ſuch as it ought to be, though, That in it ſelf, or in the Nature of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, be an act or exerciſe of Reaſon; yet being apply'd to, out of Obedience, and Gratitude, and Love to God, it is upon the account of its Motives, and its Aim, an act of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; and as it proceeds from Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and Thankfulneſs, and Love to God, ſo it is moſt acceptable to him; and upon the account of his own Appointment, as well as Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:93740:66"/>
is a moſt proper and effectual means of obtaining his Favour; and then I preſume, it will eaſily be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he who is ſo happy as to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy That, can ſcarce be made mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable by Affliction. For not now to enter upon the Common-place of the Benefits of Afflictions to them that love God, and to them that are lov'd by him, it may ſuffice, that he who (as the Scripture ſpeaks) <hi>knows our frame,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Pſal. ciij.14.</note> and has promiſed thoſe that are his,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.13.</note> that they ſhall not be <hi>Over-burden'd,</hi> is diſpos'd and wont to give his afflicted Servants, both extraordinary Comforts in Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Comforts appropriated to that ſtate.

For the employing of ones time and parts, to admire the Nature and Providence of God, and contemplate the Divine Myſteries of Religion, as it is one of the chief of thoſe Homages and Services, whereby we Venerate and Obey God; ſo it is one of thoſe, to which he hath been pleaſed to apportion no leſs a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence,<note place="margin">Dan. ix.21, 22.

And doubtleſs, though Heaven abound with unexpreſſible Joys, yet it will be none of the leaſt that ſhall make up the Happineſs even of that Place, that the Knowledge of Divine things, that was here ſo zealouſly Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſu'd, ſhall there be compleatly At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd. For thoſe things that do here moſt excite our Deſires, and quicken the Curioſity and Induſtry of our Searches, will not onely there Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, but be Improv'd to a far greater meaſure of Attractiveneſs and Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.

For Theology is like a Heaven, which wants not more Stars than appear in it, but we want Eyes, quick-ſighted and piercing enough to reach them. And as the Milky Way, and other Whiter parts of the Firmament, have been full of Immortal Lights from the beginning, and our new Teleſcopes have not plac'd, but found them, there; ſo, when our Saviour, after his glorious Reſurrection, inſtructed his Apoſtles to teach the Goſpel, 'tis not ſaid that he alter'd any thing in the Scriptures of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> but onely <hi>open'd</hi> and enlarg'd <hi>their Intellects,</hi>

And in regard that the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuation <hi>Phyſiophilus</hi> expreſſes for that excellent Imployment, ſeems to flow (chiefly at leaſt) from his fondneſs and partiality for Natural Philoſophy; it will next concern us to <hi>compare</hi> the ſtudy of <hi>Theology</hi> with that of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicks, and ſhow, that the Advantages which your Friend alledges in favour of the Latter, are <hi>partly</hi> much leſſen'd by diſadvantageous Circumſtances, and partly much out-weigh'd by the Tranſcendent Excellencies of Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical Contemplations: The ſtudy whereof will thereby appear to be not onely <hi>Eligible</hi> in it ſelf, but <hi>Preferri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> to its Rival.

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:93740:73"/>
would, the pleaſantneſs of Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical Diſcoveries. And to deal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuouſly with you, I ſhall not ſcruple to acknowledge, that though the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs I have made to Nature has laſted ſeveral years, and has been toil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome enough, and not unexpenſive; yet I have been pleas'd enough with the favours, ſuch as they are, that ſhe has from time to time accorded me, not to complain of having been unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly imploy'd. But though I readily allow the attainments of Naturaliſts to be able to give Philoſophical Souls ſincerer Pleaſures, than thoſe that the more undiſcerning part of Mankind is ſo fond of; yet I muſt not therefore allow them to ſurpaſs, or even equal, the Contentment, that may accrue to a Soul qualified by Religion, to reliſh the beſt things moſt from ſome kind of Theological Contemplations.</p>
                  <p>This, I preſume, will ſufficiently appear, if I ſhew you, that the Study of Phyſiology is not unattended with conſiderable Inconveniencies, and that the pleaſantneſs of it may be, by a Perſon ſtudious of Divinity, enjoy'd with endearing Circumſtances.</p>
                  <p>But before I name any of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:93740:73"/>
Reaſons that I am to repreſent, I fear it may be requiſite to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a few words, to obviate a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, which, if not prevented, may have an ill aſpect, not onely upon the firſt Section, but upon a great part of the following Diſcourſe. For I know that it may be ſaid, that whereas I alledge divers things, to leſſen the lately mentioned delightfulneſs of the ſtudy of Phyſic, and to depreciate ſome other advantages, by which the following Sections would recommend it, ſome of the ſame things may be objected againſt the delightfulneſs of the ſtudy of Divinity. But this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection will not, I preſume, much move you, if you conſider the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſcope of the two parts of this Letter. For in the former I have ſhewn by poſitive Proofs, that the ſtudy of Theology is attended with divers advantages, which belong to it, either <hi>onely</hi> as ſome of them do, or <hi>principally</hi> as others. And now in the ſecond part I come to conſider, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther what is alledged in behalf of the ſtudy of Philoſophy, deſerve to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-ballance thoſe Prerogatives or Advantages; and therefore it neither
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:93740:74"/>
need be, nor is my deſign, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare, for inſtance, the delightfulneſs of the two ſtudies, Philoſophy and Phyſicks, but by ſhewing the Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences that allay the latter, to weaken the Argument that is drawn from that delightfulneſs, to conclude it preferrable to the ſtudy of Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy. So that my work, in this and the following Sections, is, not ſo much to inſtitute Compariſons, as to obviate or anſwer Allegations. For ſince I have in the paſt Diſcourſe grounded the Excellency of the ſtudy of Divinity, chiefly upon thoſe great advantages that are peculiar to it; my Reaſonings would not be fruſtrated, though it ſhould appear, that in point of Delightfulneſs, Certainty, &amp;c. that Study ſhould, in many caſes, be liable to the ſame Objections with the Study of Nature, ſince 'tis not mainly for theſe Qualities, but, as I was ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for other and peculiar Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies that I recommended Divinity, And therefore, ſuppoſing the Delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, &amp;c. of that and of Phyſicks, to be allayed by the ſame, or equal Inconveniences or Imperfections; that Suppoſition would not hinder the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:93740:74"/>
Scales to be ſwayed in favour of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, upon the ſcore of thoſe Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages that are unqueſtion'd, and peculiarly belong to it. I know not whether I need add, that, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this, you are not to expect, that I ſhould give Philoſophy the wounds of an Enemy. For my deſign being not to diſcourage you, nor any Ingenious man, from courting Her <hi>at all,</hi> nor from courting Her <hi>much,</hi> but from courting her <hi>too much,</hi> and deſpiſing Divinity for her, I employ againſt her not a Sword to wound her, but a Ballance, to ſhew, that her Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies, though ſolid and weighty, are leſs ſo, than the preponderating ones of Theology. And this temper and purpoſe of mine renders my Task difficult enough to have, perhaps, ſome right to your pardon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as well as ſome need of it, if I do not every where ſteer ſo exactly, as equally to avoid injuring the Cauſe I am to plead for, and diſparaging a Study, which I would ſo little depreciate, that I allow it a great part of my Inclinations, and not a little ſhare of my Time. And having ſaid this, to keep the Deſign of this Diſcourſe from being miſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:93740:75"/>
I hope we may now proceed to the particulars, whoſe ſcope we have been declaring.</p>
                  <p>Returning then to what I was about to ſay before this long, but needful, Advertiſement interrupted me, I ſhall reſume my Diſcourſe of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfulneſs of the Study of Phyſicks, about which I was going in the firſt place to tell you, that I know you and your Friend will freely grant me, that the knowledge of the empty and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren Phyſiology, that is taught in the Schools, as it exacts not much pains to be acquir'd, ſo it affords but little ſatisfaction when attain'd. And as I know you will give me leave to ſay this; ſo, being warranted by no ſlight experience of my own, I ſhall take leave to ſay alſo, that the ſtudy of that Experimental Philoſophy, which is that whereof your Friend is ſo much enamour'd, is, if it be duly proſecuted, a very troubleſome and laborious Imployment. For, (to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at preſent but This) that great variety of Objects the Naturaliſt is not onely by His Curioſity, but by Their ſecret dependances upon one another, engag'd to conſider, and
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:93740:75"/>
ſeveral ways to handle, will put him upon needing, and conſequently upon applying himſelf to ſuch a Variety of Mechanick People, (as Diſtillers, Drugſters, Smiths, Turners, &amp;c.) that a great part of his time, and perhaps all his Patience, ſhall be ſpent in waiting upon Trades-men, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing the loſſes he ſuſtains by Their diſappointments, which is a Drudgery greater than any, who has not try'd it, will imagine, and which yet being as inevitable as unwelcome, does very much counter-ballance and allay the Delightfulneſs of the Study we are treating of. In which ſo great a part of a mans care and time muſt be laid out in providing the <hi>Apparatus'es</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the trying of Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>But this is not all. For when you have brought an Experiment to an Iſſue, though the Event may often prove ſuch as you will be pleas'd with; yet it will ſeldome prove ſuch as you can acquieſce in. For it fares not with an Inquiſitive mind in ſtudying the Book of Nature, as in reading of <hi>Aeſop</hi>'s Fables, or ſome other collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Apologues of differing ſorts, and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:93740:76"/>
independant one upon another; where when you have read over as many at one time as you think fit, you may leave off when you pleaſe, and go away with the pleaſure of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe you have perus'd, without being ſollicited by any troubleſome Itch of Curioſity to look after the reſt, as thoſe which are needful to the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter underſtanding of thoſe you have already gone over, or that will be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated <hi>by</hi> them, and ſcarce <hi>without</hi> them. But in the Book of Nature, as in a well contriv'd Romance, the parts have ſuch a connection and relation to one another, and the things we would diſcover are ſo darkly or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compleatly knowable by thoſe that precede them, that the mind is never ſatisfied till it comes to the end of the Book; till when all that is diſcover'd in the progreſs, is unable to keep the mind from being moleſted with Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience to find that yet conceal'd, which will not be known till one does at leaſt make a further progreſs. And yet the full diſcovery of Natures My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, is ſo unlikely to fall to any mans ſhare in this Life, that the caſe of the Purſuers of them is at beſt like
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:93740:76"/>
theirs, that light upon ſome excellent Romance, of which they ſhall never ſee the latter parts. For indeed (to ſpeak now without a <hi>Simile</hi>) there is ſuch a Relation betwixt Natural Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and they may in ſo many ways (and divers of them unobſerv'd) work upon, or ſuffer from, one another, that he who makes a new Experiment, or diſcovers a new <hi>Phaenomenon,</hi> muſt not preſently think, that he has diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd a new Truth, or detected an old Error. For, (at leaſt if he be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering man) he will oftentimes find reaſon to doubt, whether the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment or Obſervation have been ſo skilfully and warily made in all cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, as to afford him ſuch an Account of the matter of fact, as a ſevere Naturaliſt would deſire. And then, ſuppoſing the Hiſtorical part no way defective, there are far more Caſes than are taken notice of, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſo many differing Agents may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the exhibited <hi>Phaenomenon,</hi> or have a great Influence upon the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment or Obſervation, that he muſt be leſs jealous than becomes a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher, to whom Experiments doe not oftentimes as well ſuggeſt new
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:93740:77"/>
doubts, as preſent new <hi>Phaenomena.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And even thoſe Trials, that end in real Diſcoveries, do, by reaſon of the connection of Phyſical Truths, and the relations that Natural Bodies have to one another, give ſuch hopes and ſuch deſires of improving the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſts we have already made, to the explicating of other Difficulties, or the making of further Diſcoveries, that an Inquiſitive Naturaliſt finds his work to increaſe daily upon his hands, and the event of his paſt Toils, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be good or bad, does but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage him into new ones, either to free himſelf from his ſcruples, or improve his ſucceſſes. So that, though the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of making Phyſical Diſcoveries, is, in it ſelf conſider'd, very great; yet this does not a little impair it, that the ſame attempts which afford that delight, do ſo frequently beget both anxious Doubts, and a diſquieting Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity. So that, if knowledge be, as ſome Philoſophers have ſtyl'd it, the Aliment of the Rational Soul, I fear I may too truly ſay, that the Natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt is uſually fain to live upon Sallads and Sauces, which though they yield ſome nouriſhment, excite more appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:93740:77"/>
than they ſatisfie, and give us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the pleaſure of eating with a good ſtomach, but then reduce us to an unwelcome neceſſity of always riſing hungry from the Table.</p>
                  <p>Of divers things, that leſſen the Delightfulneſs of Phyſiological Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, I do ſo amply diſcourſe in other Papers, that I might well remit you thither; but indeed it is not neceſſary that I ſhould inſiſt on this Argument any further. 'Tis true, that ſuch a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference might be very proper, if the Myſteries of Theology and Phyſick were like thoſe of Theology and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cromancy, or ſome other part of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful Magick, whereof the former could not be well reliſh'd without an abhorrence of the latter. But as the two great Books, of Nature and of Scripture, have the ſame Authour; ſo the ſtudy of the latter does not at all hinder an Inquiſitive man's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the ſtudy of the former. The Doctor I am pleading for, may as much reliſh a Phyſical Diſcovery, as <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiophilus</hi>; nay, by being addicted to Theology and Religion, he is ſo far from being uncapable of the content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments accruing from the ſtudy of
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:93740:78"/>
Nature, that beſide thoſe things that recommend it to others, there are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral things that peculiarly endear it to Him.</p>
                  <p>For I. he has the contentment to look upon the wonders of Nature, not onely as the Productions of an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably wiſe Author of things, but of ſuch an one as he intirely honours and loves, and to whom he is related. He that reads an excellent Book, or ſees ſome rare Engine, will be otherwiſe affected with the ſight or the peruſal, if he knows it to have been made by a Friend, or a Parent, than if he conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it but as made by a ſtranger, whom he has no particular reaſon to be concern'd for. And if <hi>Rehoboam</hi> did not as well degenerate from the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of Mankind, as from his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, he could not but look upon that Magnificent Temple of <hi>Solomon</hi> with another Eye, than did the throngs of Strangers that came onely to gaze at it, as an admirable piece of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture, whilſt he conſider'd that 'twas his Father that built it. And if (as we ſee) the ſame Heroick Actions, which we read in Hiſtory, of ſome great Monarch, that ſtrangers barely
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:93740:78"/>
and unconcernedly admire, the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of his Countrey do not onely venerate, but affectionately intereſt themſelves therein, becauſe they are his Countrey-men, and their Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors were his Subjects: How much may we ſuppoſe the ſame Actions would affect them, if they had the honour to be that Prince's Children? We may well therefore preſume, that 'tis not without a ſingular ſatisfaction, that the Contemplator, we are ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of, does in all the Wonders of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture diſcover, how wiſe, and potent, and bountiful that Author of Nature is, in whom he has a great Intereſt, and that ſo great an one, as both to be admitted into the number of his Friends, and adopted into the number of his Sons, and is thereby in ſome meaſure concern'd in all the Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Praiſes, that are paid either by himſelf or others, to thoſe Adorable Attributes that God has diſplayed in that great Maſter-piece of Power and Wiſdom, the World. And when he makes greater diſcoveries in theſe Expreſſes and Adumbrations of the Divine Perfections, the delightfulneſs of his Contemplation is proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:93740:79"/>
increas'd upon ſuch an Account, as that, which indears to the paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Lover of ſome charming Beauty an Excellent, above an Ordinary, Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of her; becauſe that the ſame things that make him, as it does other Gazers, look upon it as a finer piece, make Him look upon it as the more like his Miſtreſs, and thereby entertain him with the ſublimer Idea's of the belov'd Original; to whoſe tranſcendent Excellencies he ſuppoſes that the Nobleſt Repreſentations muſt be the moſt reſembling.</p>
                  <p>And there is a farther Reaſon, why our Contemplator ſhould find a great deal of contentment in theſe Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries. For we have in our nature ſo much of Imperfection, and withall ſo much of Inclination to ſelf-love, that we do too confidently proportion our Idea's of what God can do for us, to what we have already the knowledge or the poſſeſſion of. And though, when we make it our buſineſs, we are able with much ado ſomewhat to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large our apprehenſions, and raiſe our expectations beyond their wonted pitch; yet ſtill they will be but ſcant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly promoted and heightned, if thoſe
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:93740:79"/>
things themſelves be but mean and ordinary, which we think we have done enough if we make them ſurpaſs. A Countrey Villager, born and bred in a homely Cottage, cannot have any ſuitable apprehenſions of the Pleaſures and Magnificence of a great Monarchs Court. And if he ſhould be bid to ſcrue up his Imagination to frame Idea's of them, they would be borrow'd from the beſt Tiled Houſe he had ſeen in the Market-towns where he had ſold his Turnips or Corn, and the Wedding-feaſt of ſome neighbouring Farmers Daughter. And though a Child in the Mother's womb had the perfect uſe of Reaſon, yet could it not in that dark Cell have any Idea's of the Sun or Moon, or Beauties or Banquets, or Algebra or Chymiſtry, and many other things, which his Elder Brothers, that breath freſh Air, and freely behold the Light, and are in a more mature Eſtate, are capable of knowing and enjoying. Now among Thinking men, whoſe thoughts run much upon that future ſtate which they muſt ſhortly enter into, but ſhall never paſs out of; there will frequently and naturally ariſe a
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:93740:80"/>
diſtruſt, which though ſeldome own'd, proves oftentimes diſquieting enough! For ſuch men are apt to queſtion, how the future condition which the Goſpel promiſes, can afford them ſo much happineſs as it pretends to; ſince they ſhall in Heaven but Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template the Works of God, and praiſe him, and converſe with him, all which they think may, though not immediately, be done by men here below, without being happy: But he that by Teleſcopes and Microſcopes, dexterous Diſſections, and well im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd Furnaces, &amp;c. diſcovers, the wondrous power and skill of him that contriv'd ſo vaſt and immenſe a Maſs of Matter, into ſo curious a piece of Workmanſhip as this World, will pleaſingly be convinc'd of the bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs power and goodneſs of the great Architect. And when he ſees how ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably every Animal is furniſh'd with parts requiſite to his reſpective nature; and that there is particular care taken, that the ſame Animal, as for example, Man, ſhould have differing proviſions made for him according to his differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtates within the womb, and out of it, (a humane Egg, and an Embrio,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:93740:80"/>
being much otherwiſe nouriſhed and fitted for action, than is a (compleat) Man;) He, I ſay, who conſiders this, and obſerves the ſtupendious Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and excellent Contrivances, that the curious Priers into Nature (and none but they) can diſcover, will be as well enabled as invited to reaſon thus within himſelf: That ſure God, <hi>who</hi> has with ſuch admirable Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice fram'd Silk-worms, Butterflies, and other meaner Inſects, and with ſuch wonderful providence taken care, that the nobler Animals ſhould as little want any of all the things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to the compleating of their reſpective Natures; and <hi>who,</hi> when he pleaſes, can furniſh ſome things with Qualifications, quite differing from thoſe which the knowledge of his other works could have made us ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, (as is evident in the Load-ſtone and in Quick-ſilver among Minerals, and the Senſitive Plant among Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables, the Camelion among Animals, &amp;c.) This God, I ſay, muſt needs be fully able to furniſh thoſe he delights to honour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with Objects ſuitable to their improv'd. Faculties, and with all that is requiſite to the Happineſs he
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:93740:81"/>
intends them in their glorifi'd ſtate; and is able to bring this to paſs by ſuch amazing contrivances, as perhaps will be quite differing from any, that the things we have yet ſeen ſuggeſt to us any Idea's of. And ſure he, that has in ſo immenſe, ſo curious, and ſo magnificent a Fabrick, made ſuch proviſion for Men, who are either deſperately wicked, or but very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly good, and in a ſtate where they are not to Enjoy happineſs, but by Obedience and Sufferings to Fit themſelves for it, may ſafely be truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with finding them in Heaven Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments and Delights becoming the Felicity he deſigns them There; as we ſee that here below, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides as well for the ſoaring Eagle, as for the creeping Caterpillar, (and is able to keep the Ocean as fully ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd with Rivers, as Lakes or Ponds are with Springs and Brooks.) And as a ſtate of Celeſtial happineſs is ſo great a Bleſſing, that thoſe things that afford us either greater aſſurances, or greater foretaſtes of it, are of the number of the greateſt Contentments and Advantages, that ſhort of It we can enjoy; ſo 'tis hard for any Divine
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:93740:81"/>
to receive ſo much of this kind of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, as he who by skilfully looking into the Wonders of Nature, has his apprehenſions of God's power and <hi>manifold wiſdom</hi> (as an Apoſtle calls it) elevated and enlarg'd.<note place="margin">Epheſ. iij.10.</note> As when the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> had parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly ſurvey'd the aſtoniſhing Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that <hi>Solomon</hi> diſplay'd in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of his Magnificent Court; ſhe tranſportedly concluded thoſe Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of his to be happy enough to deſerve a Monarchs Envy, that were allowed the Honour and Priviledge of a conſtant and immediate Attendance on him.</p>

                     <p>I Doubt not but you have too good an Opinion of your Friend, not to think that you may alledge in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, that the chief thing which makes him prefer Phyſiology to all other kind of knowledge, is, That it enables thoſe who are Proficients in it to do a great deal of good, both by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving of Trades, and by promoting
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:93740:82"/>
of Phyſick it ſelf. And I am too mindful of what I writ to <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> to deny, either that it can aſſiſt a man to advance Phyſick and Trades, or that, by ſo doing, he may highly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage Mankind. And this, I, (who would not leſſen your Friends Eſteem for Phyſicks, but onely his Partiality) willingly acknowledge to be ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable an Endearment of Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Philoſophy, that I do not know any thing, that to men of a Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, as well as Ingenious Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ought more to recommend the ſtudy of Nature; except the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity it affords men to be Juſt and Grateful to the Author both of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and of Man. I do not then deny, that the true Naturaliſt may very much benefit Mankind; but I affirm, that, if men be not wanting to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, the Divine may benefit them much more. It were not perchance either unſeaſonable, or impertinent to tell you on this occaſion, that he who effectually teaches men to ſubdue their Luſts and Paſſions, does as much as the Phyſician contribute to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of their Bodies, by exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pting them from thoſe Vices, whoſe
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:93740:82"/>
no leſs uſual than deſtructive Effects are Wars, and Duels, and Rapines, and Deſolations, and the Pox, and Surfets, and all the train of other Diſeaſes that attend Gluttony and Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Idleneſs and Luſt; which are not Enemies to Mans Life and Health barely upon a Phyſical account, but upon a Moral one, as they provoke God to puniſh them with Temporal as well as Spiritual Judgments; ſuch as Plagues, Wars, Famines, and other publick Calamities, that ſweep away a great part of Mankind; beſides thoſe perſonal afflictions of Bodily Sickneſs, and diſquiets of Conſcience, that do both Shorten mens Lives, and Imbitter them. Whereas Piety hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as the Scripture aſſures us) Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes both of this Life, and of that which is to come, thoſe Teachers that make men Virtuous and Religious, by making them Temperate, and Chaſte, and Inoffenſive, and Calm, and Contented, do not onely procure them great and excellent Diſpoſitions to thoſe Bleſſings, both of the Right hand and of the Left, which God's Goodneſs makes him forward to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow on thoſe, who by Grace and
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:93740:83"/>
Virtue are made fit to receive them; but do help them to thoſe Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that by preſerving the Mind in a calm and cheerful temper, as well as by affording the Body all that Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance can confer, do both Lengthen their Lives, and Sweeten them. Theſe things, I ſay, 'twere not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent to inſiſt on, but I will rather chuſe to repreſent to you, That the Benefits which men may receive from the Divine, ſurpaſs thoſe which they receive from the Naturaliſt, both in the Nobleneſs of the Advantages, and in the Duration of them.</p>
                     <p>Be it granted then, that the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſt may much improve both Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick and Trades; yet ſince theſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves were deviſed for the ſervice of the Body, (the one to preſerve or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore his Health, and the other to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh it with Accommodations or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights;) the boaſted uſe of Natural Philoſophy, by its advancing Trades and Phyſick, will ſtill be to ſerve the Body; which is but the Lodging and Inſtrument of the Soul, and which, I preſume, your Friend, and which I am ſure your ſelf, will be far from thinking the nobleſt part of Man. I know it
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:93740:83"/>
may be ſaid, nor do I deny it, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Mechanical Arts are highly Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial, not onely to the Inventors, but to thoſe Places, and perhaps thoſe States, where ſuch Improvements are found out and cheriſh'd. But though I moſt willingly grant, that this Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration ought to recommend Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimental Philoſophy, as well to States as to private Perſons; yet, beſides that many of theſe Improvements do ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Transfer than Increaſe Mankind's goods, and prejudice one ſort of Men as much as they Advantage another, (as in the caſe of the Eaſtern Spices, of whoſe Trade the <hi>Portugals</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> by their later Navigations, did, by appropriating it to themſelves, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive the <hi>Venetians</hi>) or elſe does but increaſe that, which, though very Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial to the Producers, is not really ſo to Mankind in general: Of which we have an Example in the Invention of Extracting Gold and Silver out of the Oar, with <hi>Mercury.</hi> For though it have vaſtly enrich'd the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> yet 'tis not of any ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid advantage to the World; no more than the Diſcovery of the <hi>Peruvian</hi> and other <hi>American</hi> Mines; by which,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:93740:84"/>
(eſpecially reckoning the multitudes of unhappy men that are made miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and deſtroyed in working them,) Mankind is not put into a better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition than it was before. And if the Philoſopher's Stone it ſelf, (ſuppoſing there be ſuch a thing) were not an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable Medicine, but were onely capable of tranſmuting other Metalls into Gold, I ſhould perhaps doubt, whether the Diſcoverer of it would much advantage Mankind; there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing already Gold and Silver enough to maintain Trade and Commerce among men; and for all other purpoſes, I know not, why a plenty of Iron, and Braſs, and Quick-ſilver, which are far more uſeful Metalls, ſhould not be more deſirable. But not to urge this; we may conſider, that theſe Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of inriching Trades do ſtill bring Advantages but to the outward man, and thoſe many Arts and Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that aim at the heightning the pleaſures of the Senſes,<note place="margin">See Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of this in my Notes about Senſation and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</note> belong but to the Body; and even in point of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying That, are not ſo requiſite and important, as many ſuppoſe: Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, Cuſtome, &amp;c. having a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Intereſt than moſt imagine in the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:93740:84"/>
relliſh men have even of Senſitive pleaſures. And as for Phyſick, not to mind you, that it has been Lowdly (how Juſtly, I here examine not,) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd of, that the new Philoſophy has made it far greater promiſes than have yet been perform'd; I ſhall onely take notice, that ſince all that Phyſick is wont to pretend to, is, to preſerve health, or reſtore it, there are multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes in the world that have no need of the aſſiſtance the Naturaliſt would give the Phyſician; and a healthy man, as ſuch, is already in a better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, than the Philoſopher can hope to place him in, and is no more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantag'd by the Naturaliſt's contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution to Phyſick, than a ſound man that ſleeps in a whole skin, is by all the fine Tools of a Chirurgeons Caſe of Inſtruments, and the various Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of his Cheſt.</p>
                     <p>And as the Benefits that may be derived from Theology, much ſurpaſs thoſe that accrue from Phyſicks, in the Nobleneſs of the Subject they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to; ſo have they a great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in point of Duration. For all the ſervice that Medicines, and Engines, and Improvements can do a man, as
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:93740:85"/>
they relate but to this Life, ſo they determine with it. Phyſick indeed and Chymiſtry do, the one more faintly, and the other more boldly, pretend ſometimes not onely to the Cure of Diſeaſes, but the Prolongation of Life: But ſince none will ſuſpect, but that the Maſters of thoſe parts of knowledge would employ their utmoſt skill to protract their own Lives, thoſe that remember, that <hi>Solomon</hi> and <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> liv'd no longer, than millions that were ſtrangers to Philoſophy; and that even <hi>Paracelſus</hi> himſelf, for all his boaſted <hi>Arcana,</hi> is by <hi>Helmont</hi> and other Chymiſts confeſſed to have died ſome years ſhort of 50; we may very juſtly fear, that Nature will not be ſo kind to her greateſt Votaries, as to give them much more time than other men, for the payment of the laſt Debt all men owe her. And if a few years reſpite could by a ſcrupulous and troubleſome uſe of Diet and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies be obtain'd; yet that, in compariſon of the Eternity that is to follow, is not at all conſiderable. But, whereas within no great number of years, (a little ſooner, or a little later) all the Remedies, and Reliefs, and
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:93740:85"/>
Pleaſures, and Accommodations, that Philoſophical Improvements can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford a man, will not keep him from the Grave, (which within very few days will make the body of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt <hi>Virtuoſo</hi> as hideous and as loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome a Carcaſe as that of any ordinary man;) the Benefits that may accrue to us by Divinity, as they relate Chiefly, though not Onely, to the other World; ſo they will follow us out of this, and prove then incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably greater than ever, when they alone ſhall be capable of being enjoy'd. So that Philoſophy, in the capacity we here conſider it, does but as it were provide us ſome little Conveniences for our paſſage (like ſome Accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations for a Cabbin, which out-laſts not the Voyage,) but Religion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides us a vaſt and durable Eſtate, or, as the Scripture ſtyles it, an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaken Kingdom,</hi> when we are arriv'd at our Journeys end. And therefore the Benefits accruing from Religion, may well be concluded preferible to their Competitors, ſince they not onely reach to the Mind of Man, but reach beyond the End of Time it ſelf; whereas all the variety of Inventions
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:93740:86"/>
that Philoſophy ſo much boaſts of, as whilſt they were in ſeaſon they were devis'd for the ſervice of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, ſo they make us buſie, and pride our ſelves about things, that within a ſhort time will not (ſo much as upon Its ſcore) at all concern us.</p>

my ſelf in a Diſquiſition of the ſeveral kinds, or, if you pleaſe, Degrees, of Demonſtration, (which yet is a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject that I judge far more conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than cultivated,) yet I muſt tell you, that <hi>as</hi> a Moral certainty (ſuch as we may attain about the Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals of Religion) is enough in many caſes for a wiſe man, and even a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher to acquieſce in; <hi>ſo</hi> that Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Certainty, which is pretended for the Truths demonſtrated by Natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, is, even where 'tis rightfully claim'd, but an inferiour kind or degree of certainty, as Moral certainty alſo is. For even Phyſical Demonſtrations can beget but a Phyſical Certainty, (that is, a Certainty upon ſuppoſition that the Principles of Phyſick be true,) not a Metaphyſical Certainty, (wherein 'tis abſolutely impoſſible, that the thing believ'd ſhould be other than true.) For inſtance, All the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical Demonſtrations of the Antients about the cauſes of particular <hi>Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena</hi> of Bodies, ſuppoſe, that <hi>ex nihilo nihil fit</hi>; and this may readily be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in a Phyſical ſenſe, becauſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the courſe of Nature, no Body can be produc'd out of Nothing,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:93740:87"/>
but ſpeaking univerſally it <hi>may</hi> be falſe, as Chriſtians generally, and even the <hi>Carteſian</hi> Naturaliſts, aſſerting the Creation of the World, muſt believe, that, <hi>de facto,</hi> it <hi>is.</hi> And ſo whereas <hi>Epicurus</hi> does, I remember, prove, that a Body once dead cannot be made alive again, by reaſon of the diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and diſperſion of the Atoms, 'twas, when alive, compos'd of; though all men will allow this aſſertion to be Phyſically demonſtrable, yet the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary may be true, if God's Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence intervenes, as all the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers that acknowledge the Authority of the New Teſtament, where <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> and others are recorded to have been raiſed from the dead, muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that it actually did appear, and even all unprejudic'd Reaſoners muſt allow it to be Poſſible, there being no Contradiction impli'd in the Nature of the thing. But now to affirm, that ſuch things as are indeed Contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries cannot be both true, or, that <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum infectum reddi non potest,</hi> are Metaphyſical Truths, which cannot poſſibly be other than true, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently beget a Metaphyſical and abſolute Certainty. And your Maſter
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:93740:88"/>
                        <hi>Carteſius</hi> was ſo ſenſible of a depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Phyſical Demonſtrations up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Metaphyſical Truths, that he would not allow any certainty not onely to them, but even to Geometri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Demonſtrations, till he had evinc'd, that there is a God, and that he cannot deceive men that make uſe of their Faculties aright.</p>
                     <p>To which I may add, that even in many things that are look'd upon as Phyſical Demonſtrations, there is really but a Moral Certainty. For when, for inſtance, <hi>Des-Cartes</hi> and other Modern Philoſophers, take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them to demonſtrate, That there are divers Comets that are not Mete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, becauſe they have a Parallax leſſer than that of the Moon, and are of ſuch a bigneſs, and ſome of them move in ſuch a Line, &amp;c. 'tis plain, that divers of theſe Learned men had never the opportunity to obſerve a Comet in their Lives, but take theſe Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances upon the credit of thoſe Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomers that had ſuch Opportunities. And though the Inferences, as ſuch, may have a Demonſtrable Certainty; yet the Premiſſes they are drawn from having but an Hiſtorical one, the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:93740:88"/>
preſumed Phyſico-Mathematical De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration can produce in a wary mind but a Moral Certainty, and not the greateſt neither of that kind that is poſſible to be attain'd; as he will not ſcruple to acknowledge, that knows by experience, how much more difficult it is, than moſt men imagine, to make Obſervations about ſuch nice Subjects, with the exactneſs that is requiſite for the building of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Theory upon them. And there are I know not how many things in Phyſicks, that men preſume they believe upon Phyſical and Cogent Arguments, wherein they really have but a Moral aſſurance; which is a Truth heeded by ſo few, that I have been invited to take the more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular notice of them in other Papers, written purpoſely to ſhow the doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and incompleatneſs of Natural Philoſophy; of which Diſcourſe, ſince you may command a ſight, I ſhall not ſcruple to refer you thither for the Reaſons of my affirming here, that the moſt even of the modern <hi>Virtuoſi</hi> are wont to fancy more of Clearneſs and Certainty in their Phyſical Theories, than a Critical Examiner will find.
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:93740:89"/>
Onely that you may not look upon this as a put off, rather than a refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, I will here touch upon a couple of Subjects, which men are wont to <hi>believe</hi> to be, and which indeed ought to <hi>be,</hi> the moſt throughly underſtood; I mean the Nature of Body in general, and the Nature of Senſation.</p>
                     <p>And for the firſt of theſe, ſince we can turn our ſelves no way, but we are every where environ'd, and inceſſantly touch'd by Corporeal Subſtances, one would think that ſo familiar an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, that does ſo aſſiduouſly, and ſo many ways affect our Senſes, and for the knowledge of which we need not inquire into the diſtinct Nature of particular Bodies, nor the properties of any one of them, ſhould be very perfectly known unto us. And yet the Notion of Body in general, or <hi>what it is that makes a thing to be a Corporeal Subſtance, and diſcriminates it from all other things,</hi> has been very hotly diſputed of, even among the modern Philoſophers, <hi>&amp; adhuc ſub judice lis eſt.</hi> And though your Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite <hi>Des-Cartes,</hi> in making the nature of a Body to conſiſt in Extenſion eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way, has a notion of it, which 'tis
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:93740:89"/>
more eaſie to find fault with, than to ſubſtitute a better; yet I fear, 'twill appear to be attended, not onely with <hi>this</hi> Inconvenience, That God cannot, within the compaſs of this World, wherein if any Body vaniſh into No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, the place or ſpace left behind it muſt have the three Dimenſions, and ſo be a true Body, <hi>annihilate</hi> the leaſt particle of Matter, at leaſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, at the ſame inſtant and place, <hi>creating</hi> as much, (which agrees very ill with that neceſſary and continual dependance, which he aſſerts Matter it ſelf to have on God for its very Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;) but with <hi>ſuch other</hi> inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, that ſome Friends of yours, otherwiſe very inclinable to the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſian</hi> Philoſophy, know not how to acquieſce in it: and yet I need not tell you, how Fundamental a Notion the deviſer of it aſſerts it to be. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do I ſee, how this Notion of a Corporeal Subſtance will any more, than any of the formerly received De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions of it, extricate us out of the Difficulties of that no leſs perplexed, than famous Controverſie, <hi>de Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitione Continui.</hi> And though ſome ingenious men, who perhaps perceive
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:93740:90"/>
better than others, how intricate it is, have of late endeavoured to ſhew, that men need not be ſollicitous to determine this Controverſie, it not being rightly propos'd by the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that have ſtarted it; and though I perhaps think, that Natural Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy may be daily advanc'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the deciſion of it, becauſe there is a multitude of conſiderable things to be diſcover'd and perform'd in Nature, without ſo much as dreaming of this Controverſie; yet ſtill, <hi>as I would propoſe the Queſtion,</hi> the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, till removed, will ſpread a thick night over the Notion of Body in general. For, either a Corporeal and extended Subſtance is (either really or mentally) diviſible into parts en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow'd with Extenſion, and each of theſe parts is diviſible alſo into other Corporeal parts, leſſer and leſſer, <hi>in infinitum</hi>; or elſe this ſubdiviſion muſt ſtop ſomewhere, (for there is no mean between the two members of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction;) and in either caſe the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion pitch'd upon will be liable to thoſe Inconveniences, not to ſay Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities, that are rationally urg'd againſt it by the maintainers of the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:93740:90"/>
Oppoſite; the Objections on both ſides being ſo ſtrong, that ſome of the more Candid, even of the Modern Metaphyſicians, after having tir'd themſelves and their Readers with ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing <hi>Pro</hi> and <hi>Con,</hi> have confeſs'd the Objections on both ſides to be inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luble.</p>
                     <p>But though we do not clearly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Nature of Body in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral; yet ſure we cannot but be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly acquainted with what paſſes within our ſelves in reference to the particular Bodies we daily See, and Hear, and Smell, and Taſte, and Touch. But alas, though we know but little, ſave by the Informations of our ſenſes; yet we know very little of the manner by which our Senſes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us. And to avoid prolixity, I will at preſent ſuppoſe with you, that the Ingenious <hi>Des Cartes</hi> and his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers have given the faireſt account of Senſation, that is yet extant. Now according to him, a Man's Body being but a well organiz'd Statue, that which is truly called Senſation is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd by the Organ, but by the Mind, which perceives the motion produc'd in the Organ; (for which reaſon he
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:93740:91"/>
will not allow Brutes to have Senſe properly ſo call'd;) ſo that if you ask a <hi>Carteſian,</hi> how it comes to paſs that the Soul of Man, which he juſtly aſſerts to be an immaterial Subſtance, comes to be wrought upon, and that in ſuch various manners, by thoſe external Bodies that are the objects of our Senſes, he will tell you, that by their Impreſſions on the Senſories, they variouſly move the Fibres or Threds of the Nerves, wherewith thoſe parts are endow'd, and by which the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is propagated to that little Kernel in the Brain, call'd by many Writers the <hi>Conarion,</hi> where theſe differing mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions being perceiv'd by the there reſiding Soul, become Senſations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the intimate union, and, as it were, Permiſtion (as <hi>Carteſius</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf expreſſes it) of the Soul with the Body.</p>
                     <p>But now, Sir, give me leave to take notice, that this Union of an Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal with a Corporeal Subſtance, (and that without a Medium) is a thing ſo unexampled in Nature, and ſo difficult to comprehend, that I ſomewhat queſtion, whether the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Secrets of Theology, not to
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:93740:91"/>
ſay the adorable Myſtery it ſelf of the Incarnation, be more abſtruſe than this. For how can I conceive, that a Subſtance purely immaterial, ſhould be united without a Phyſical <hi>Medium,</hi> (for in this caſe there can be none,) with the Body, which cannot poſſibly lay hold on It, and which It can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade and flie away from at pleaſure, as <hi>Des-Cartes</hi> muſt confeſs the Soul actually does in Death. And 'tis al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as difficult to conceive, how any part of the Body, without excepting the Animal Spirits, or the <hi>Conarion,</hi> (for theſe are as truly Corporeal as other parts of the Humane Statue,) can make Impreſſions upon a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance perfectly Incorporeal, and which is not immediately affected by the motions of any other parts, beſides the <hi>Genus Nervoſum.</hi> Nor is it a ſmall difficulty to a meer Naturaliſt (who, as ſuch, does not in Phyſical matters take notice of Revelations about An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,) to conceive how a finite Spirit can either move, or, which is much the ſame thing, regulate and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the motion of a Body. But that which I would on this occaſion invite you to conſider, is, that ſuppoſing the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:93740:92"/>
Soul does in the Brain perceive the differing motions communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the outward Senſes; yet this, however it may give ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Senſation in general, will not at all ſhow us a ſatisfactory Reaſon of particular and diſtinct Senſations. For if I demand, why, for Inſtance, when I look upon a Bell that is ringing, ſuch a motion or impreſſion in the Cona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion produces in the mind that peculiar ſort of perception, <hi>Seeing,</hi> and not <hi>Hearing</hi>; and another motion, though coming from the ſame Bell at the ſame time, produces that quite differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſort of perception that we call <hi>Sound,</hi> but not <hi>Viſion</hi>; what can be anſwered, but that it was the good pleaſure of the Author of Humane Nature to have it ſo? And if the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion be ask'd about the differing Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of any one particular Senſe; as, Why the great plenty of unperturbed Light that is reflected from Snow, Milk, &amp;c, does produce a Senſation of whiteneſs, rather than redneſs or yellowneſs? Or why the ſmell of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor,</hi> or <hi>Aſſa foetida,</hi> produces in moſt perſons that which they call a <hi>Stink,</hi> rather than a Perfume? (eſpecially
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:93740:92"/>
ſince we know ſome Hyſterical Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that think it not onely a whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, but a pleaſing ſmell.) And if alſo you further ask, why Melody and ſweet things do generally delight us? and diſcords and bitter things do generally diſpleaſe us? Nay, why a little more than enough of ſome Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects that produce pleaſure, will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce pain? (as may be exemplifi'd in a cold hand, as it happens to be held out at a juſt, or at too near a diſtance from the fire:) If, I ſay, theſe, and a thouſand other queſtions of the like kind, be ask'd, the Anſwer will be but the general one, that is already given, that ſuch is the nature of Man. For to ſay, that moderate Motions are agreeable to the nature of the Senſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry they are excited in, but violent and diſorderly ones, (as j<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ring Sounds, and ſcorching Heat) do put it into too violent a motion for its Texture; will by no means ſatisfie. For, beſides that this Anſwer gives no account of the variety of Senſations of the ſame kind, as of differing Colours, Taſtes, &amp;c. but reaches onely to Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and Pain; even as to theſe, it will reach but a very little way; unleſs the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:93740:93"/>
Givers of it can ſhow, how an Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Subſtance ſhould be more harm'd by the brisker motion of a Body, than by the more languid.</p>
                     <p>And <hi>as</hi> you and your Friend think, you may juſtly ſmile at the <hi>Ariſtoteli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> for imagining that they have given a tolerable account of the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of Bodies, when they have told us, that they ſpring from certain ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Forms, though when they are ask'd particular Queſtions about theſe Incomprehenſible Forms, they do in effect but tell us in general, that they have ſuch and ſuch Faculties, or Effects, becauſe Nature, or the Author of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, endow'd them therewith; <hi>ſo</hi> I hope you will give me leave to think, that it may keep us from boaſting of the Clearneſs and Certainty of our knowledge about the Operations of ſenſible Objects, whilſt, as the <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telians</hi> cannot particularly ſhow, how their Qualities are produc'd, ſo we cannot particularly explicate, how they are perceiv'd; the principal thing that we can ſay, being, in ſubſtance, this, that our Senſations depend upon ſuch an union or permiſtion of the Soul and Body, as we can give no Example of
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:93740:93"/>
in all Nature, nor no more diſtinct ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of, than that it pleaſed God ſo to couple them together. But I beg your pardon for having detain'd you ſo long upon one Subject, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it will not prove time mis-ſpent, if it have made you take notice, that in ſpight of the clearneſs and certainty, for which your Friend ſo much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers Phyſicks before Theology, we are <hi>Yet</hi> to ſeek, (I ſay <hi>Yet,</hi> becauſe I know not what Time may Hereafter diſcover) both for the Definition of a Corporeal Subſtance, and a ſatisfactory account of the manner of Senſation: though without the true Notion of a Body we cannot underſtand that Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Phyſicks in general, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowing the Nature of Senſation, we cannot know That, from whence we derive almoſt all that we know of any Body in particular.</p>
                     <p>If after all this your Friend ſhall ſay, That <hi>Des-Cartes</hi>'s account of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and other things in Phyſicks, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the beſt that men can give, if they be not ſatisfactory, it muſt be imputed to Humane Nature not to the <hi>Carteſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Doctrine, I ſhall not ſtay to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute how far the allegation is true;
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:93740:94"/>
eſpecially ſince, though it be admitted, it will not prejudice my Diſcourſe. For, whatſoever the Cauſe of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection of our Knowledge about Phyſical matters be, that there is an Imperfection in that Knowledge is manifeſt; and that ought to be enough to keep us from being puffed up by ſuch an imperfect Knowledge, and from undervaluing upon its account the ſtudy of thoſe myſteries of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, which, by reaſon of the Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Remoteneſs of the Objects, may much better than the Nature of Corporeal things, (which we ſee, and feel, and continually converſe with,) have their obſcurity attributed to the weakneſs of our humane Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. And if it be a neceſſary Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Humane Nature, that, whilſt we remain in this mortal condition, the Soul being confin'd to the dark priſon of the Body, is capable (as even <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſomewhere confeſſes) but of a dim knowledge; ſo much the greater value we ought to have for Chriſtian Religion, ſince by its means (and by no other without it) we may attain a condition, wherein, as our Nature will otherwiſe be highly bleſſed and
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:93740:94"/>
advanced; ſo our Faculties will be Elevated and Enlarged, and probably made thereby capable of attaining degrees and kinds of knowledge, to which we are here but ſtrangers. In favour of which I will not urge the received Opinion of Divines, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Fall (which yet is a leſs noble condition than is reſerved for us in Heaven,) <hi>Adam</hi>'s knowledge was ſuch, that he was able at firſt ſight of them to give each of the Beaſts a name expreſſive of its Nature; becauſe that in ſpight of ſome skill (which my Curioſity for Divinity, not Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, gave me) in the holy Tongue, I could never find, that the Hebrew names of Animals, mention'd in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> argued a (much) clearer inſight into their Natures, than did the names of the ſame or ſome other Animals in Greek, or other Languages; wherefore, (as I ſaid) I will not urge <hi>Adam</hi>'s knowledge in Paradiſe for that of the Saints in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, though the notice he took of <hi>Eve</hi> at his firſt ſeeing of her, (if it were not convey'd to him by ſecret Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation) may be far more probably urg'd, than his naming of the Beaſts:
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:93740:95"/>
But I will rather mind you, that the Proto-martyr's ſight was ſtrengthened ſo,<note place="margin">Acts vij.56.</note> as to <hi>ſee the heavens open'd, and Jeſus ſtanding at the right hand of God</hi>; and when the Prophet had pray'd,<note place="margin">2 Kings vj.17.</note> that his Servant's Eyes might be open'd, he immediately ſaw the Mountain, where they were, all co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd with Chariots and Horſemen, which, though mention'd to be of Fire, were altogether inviſible to him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. To which, as a higher Argument, I ſhall onely add a couple of paſſages of Scripture, which ſeem to allow us even vaſt Expectations as to the knowledge our glorifi'd Nature may be advanc'd to. The one is that which St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. xiij.12.</note> 
                        <hi>For now we ſee through a glaſs darkly, but then face to face: Now I know in part, but then ſhall I know even as alſo I am known.</hi> And the other, where Chriſt's Favourite-Diſciple tells Believers, <hi>Beloved,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Joh. iij.2.</note> 
                        <hi>now we are the Sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we ſhall be; but we know, that when he ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, we ſhall be like him: for we ſhall ſee him as he is.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>What has hitherto been diſcours'd, contains the firſt Conſideration, that
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:93740:95"/>
I told you might be propos'd about the Certainty aſcrib'd to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge we are ſaid to have of Natural things; but this is not all I have to repreſent to you on this Subject. For I conſider further, that 'tis not onely by the Certainty we have of them, that the knowledge of things is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dear'd to us, but alſo by the Worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Object, the Number of thoſe that are unacquainted with it, the Remoteneſs of it from common Apprehenſions, the Difficulty of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring it without peculiar Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, the Uſefulneſs of it when at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd, and other particulars, which 'tis not here neceſſary to enumerate. I preſume, you doubt not but your Friend does very much prefer the knowledge he has of the Myſteries of Nature (at many of which we have as yet but Ingenious Conjectures) to the knowledge of one that underſtands the Elements of Arithmetick, though He be Demonſtratively ſure of the Truth of moſt of his Rules and Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. And queſtionleſs <hi>Copernicus</hi> received a much higher ſatisfaction in his Notion about the Stability of the Sun, and the Motion of the Earth,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:93740:96"/>
though it were not ſo clear but that <hi>Tycho, Ricciolus,</hi> and other eminent Aſtronomers have rejected it, than in the knowledge of divers of the Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rems about the Sphere, that have been demonſtrated by <hi>Euclid, Theodoſius,</hi> and other Geometricians. Our diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering that ſome Comets are not, as the Schools would have them, Sublu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Meteors, but Celeſtial Bodies, and the Conjectural Theory, which is all that hitherto we have been able to attain of them, do much better pleaſe both your Friend, and you, and me, than the more certain knowledge we have of the time of the Riſing and Setting of the Fixed Stars. And the Eſtimates we can make, by the help of Parallaxes, of the Heights of thoſe Comets, and of ſome of the Planets, though they are uncertain enough, (as may appear by the vaſtly different diſtances that are aſſigned to thoſe Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies by eminent Aſtronomers;) yet theſe uncertain meaſures of ſuch Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated and Celeſtial Lights do far more pleaſe us, than that we can by the help of a Geometrical Quadrant, or ſome ſuch Inſtrument, take with far greater Certainty the height of a Tower or
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:93740:96"/>
a Steeple. And ſo a Mathematician, when he probably conjectures at the compaſs of the Ter<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now, that the knowledge of God, and of thoſe Myſteries of Theology, that are ignor'd by far the greateſt part of Mankind, has more ſublime and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Objects, and is unattain'd to by much the greateſt part even of Learned men, and nevertheleſs is of unvaluable Importance, and of no leſs Advantage towards the purifying and improving of us here, and the making us perfect and happy hereafter, the paſt Diſcourſe has very much miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carried if it have not evinc'd.

and thereby be enabled to give a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable gheſs at thoſe thoughts and deſigns of his, that Govern King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, and make the Fates of Nations, is judged preferrable to that clearer knowledge that a Notary can have of the dying thoughts and intentions of an ordinary Perſon whoſe Will he makes: And <hi>as</hi> the knowledge of a skilful Phyſician, whoſe Art is yet conjectural, is preferrable to that of a Cutler that makes his Diſſecting Knives, though this man can more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly perform what he deſigns in his own profeſſion, than the Phyſician can in his: And (in fine) <hi>as</hi> the skill of a Jeweller, that is converſant about Diamonds, Rubies, Saphires, and ſome other ſorts of ſmall Stones, which being for the moſt part brought us out of the <hi>Indies,</hi> we muſt take many things about them upon report, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Nobleneſs of the Object, preferr'd to that of a Maſon that deals in whole Quarries of common Stones, and may be ſure upon his own Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of divers things concerning them, which as to Jewels we are allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to know but upon Tradition: <hi>So</hi> a more dimm and imperfect knowledge
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:93740:97"/>
of God, and the Myſteries of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, may be more deſirable, and upon that account more delightful, than a clearer knowledge of thoſe Inferior Truths that Phyſicks are wont to teach.</p>
                     <p>I muſt now mention one particular more, which may well be added to thoſe that peculiarly indear Phyſicks to the Divine that is ſtudious of them. For, as he contemplates the works of Nature not barely for themſelves, but to be the better qualified and excited to admire and praiſe the Author of Nature; ſo his Contemplations are delightful to him, not barely as they afford a pleaſing Exerciſe to his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but as they procure him a more welcome approbation from his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, theſe diſtinct ſatisfactions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not at all inconſiſtent. And que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionleſs, though <hi>Eſau</hi> did at length miſs of his aim, yet, while he was hunting Veniſon for the good old Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triark that deſired it of him, beſides the pleaſure he was us'd to take in purſuing the Deer he chas'd,<note place="margin">Gen. xxxvij.</note> he took a great one in conſidering, that now he hunted to pleaſe his Father, and in order to obtain of him an ineſtimable
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:93740:98"/>
Bleſſing. So, when <hi>David</hi> imployd his skilful Hand and Voice in praiſing God with Vocal and Inſtrumental Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, he receiv'd in one Act a double ſatisfaction, by exerciſing his Skill and his Devotion; and was no leſs pleas'd with thoſe melodious ſounds, as they were Hymns, than as they were Songs. And this Example prompts me to add, that as the devout Student of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture we were ſpeaking of, does Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally refer the knowledge he ſeeks of the Creatures to the glory of the Creator; ſo in his Diſcoveries, that which moſt contents him, is, that the Wonders he obſerves in Nature, heighten that Admiration he would fain raiſe to a leſs diſproportion to the Wiſdom of God; and furniſh him with a nobler Holocauſt for thoſe Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices of Praiſe he is juſtly ambitious to offer up to the Deity. And <hi>as</hi> there is no doubt to be made, but that, when <hi>David invented</hi> (as the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture intimates that he did) new <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of Muſick,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Amos vj.5.</note> there was nothing in that Invention that pleas'd him ſo much, as that they could aſſiſt him to praiſe God the more melodiouſly; <hi>go</hi> the pious Student of Nature finds
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:93740:98"/>
nothing more welcome in the Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries he makes of her Wonders, than the Riſes and Helps they may afford him, the more worthily to celebrate and glorifie the Divine Attributes ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umbrated in the Creatures. And <hi>as</hi> a Huntſman or a Fowler, if he meets with ſome ſtrange Bird or Beaſt, or other Natural Rarity, thinks himſelf much the more fortunate if it happen to be near the Court, where he may have the King to preſent it to, than if he were to keep it but for himſelf or ſome of his Companions; <hi>So</hi> our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Naturaliſt has his Diſcoveries of Natures Wonders indear'd to him, by having the Deity to preſent them to, in the Veneration they excite in the Finder, and which they inable him to ingage others to joyn in.</p>

                     <p>BUt I confeſs (Sir) I much fear, that That which makes your Friend have ſuch detracting thoughts of Theology, is a certain ſecret Pride, grounded upon a Conceit, that the Attainments of Natural Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers are of ſo noble a kind, and argue ſo tranſcendant an Excellency of Parts in the Attainer, that he may juſtly undervalue all other Learning, without excepting Theology it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>You will not, I ſuppoſe, expect, that a perſon, who has written ſo much in the praiſe of Phyſiques, and laboured ſo much for a little skill in it, ſhould now here endeavour to depretiate that ſo uſeful part of Philoſophy. But I do not conceive, that it will be at all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to it, to prefer the knowledge of Supernatural, to that of meer Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural things, and to think, that the Truths, which God indiſcriminately expoſes to the whole Race of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and to the bad as well as to the good, are inferiour to thoſe Myſterious
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:93740:99"/>
ones, whoſe Diſcloſure he reckons among his peculiar Favours, and whoſe Contemplation employs the Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, and, in ſome points, exacts the wonder of the very Angels. That I may therefore repreſs a little the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weening Opinion your Friend has of his Phyſical Attainments, give me leave to repreſent a few particulars con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducive to that purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>And firſt, as for the Nobleneſs of the Truths taught by Theology and Phyſicks, thoſe of the former ſort have manifeſtly the Advantage, being not onely converſant about far nobler Objects, but diſcovering things that Humane Reaſon of it ſelf can by no means reach unto; as has been ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently declared in the foregoing part of this Letter.</p>
                     <p>Next, we may conſider, that, whatever may be ſaid to excuſe <hi>Pride</hi> (if there were any) in <hi>Moſcus</hi> the <hi>Phoenician,</hi> who is affirmed to have firſt Invented the Atomical Hypotheſis, and in <hi>Democritus</hi> and <hi>Leucippus,</hi> (for <hi>Epicurus</hi> ſcarce deſerves to be named with them,) that highly Advanc'd that Philoſophy; and in Monſieur <hi>Des-Cartes,</hi> who either Improv'd, or at

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ian Hypotheſis: Whatever (I ſay) may be alledged on the behalf of theſe Mens pride; I ſee no great Reaſon, why it ſhould be allowed in ſuch as your Friend; who, though Ingenious Men, are neither Inventors, nor emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Promoters of the Philoſophy they would be admir'd for, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themſelves to Learn what others have Taught, or at leaſt to make ſome little further Application of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples that others have Eſtabliſhed, and the Diſcoveries they have made. And whereas your Friend is not a little proud of being able to confute ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Errours of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, it were not amiſs if he conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, that many of the chief Truths that overthrow thoſe Errours, were the Productions of Time and Chance, and not of his daring Ratiocinations: For, there needs no great Wit to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove thoſe that maintain the Unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitableneſs of the Torrid Zone, or deny the Antipodes, ſince Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors have found many Parts of the former well Peopl'd, and Sailing round the Earth, have found men living in Countreys Diametrically oppoſite to
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:93740:100"/>
Ours. Nor will it warrant a man's Pride, that he believes not the Moon to be the onely Planet that ſhines with a borrowed Light, or the Galaxy to be a Meteor; ſince that now the Tele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcope ſhows us, that <hi>Venus</hi> has her Full and Wain like the Moon, and that the Milky way is made up of a vaſt multitude of little Stars, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous to the naked Eye. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of thoſe other Diſcoveries that overthrow the Aſtronomy of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, and much of their Philoſophy about the Celeſtial Bodies, few or none have any cauſe to boaſt, but the excellent <hi>Galileus,</hi> who pretends to have been the Inventor of the Tele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcope: For that Inſtrument once diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd; to be able to reject the Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenary number of the Planets by the Detection of the four <hi>Satellites</hi> of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter,</hi> or talk of the Mountains and Valleys in the Moon, requires not much more excellency in your Friend, than it would to deſcry in a Ship, where the naked Eye could diſcern but the Body of the Veſſel, (to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcry, I ſay) by the help of a Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Glaſs, the Maſts, and Sails, and Deck, and perceive a Boat tow'd at
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:93740:101"/>
her Stern: Though indeed <hi>Galileo</hi> himſelf had no great cauſe to boaſt of the Invention, though we are much oblig'd to him for the Improvement of the Teleſcope, ſince no leſs a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of Dioptricks than <hi>Des-Cartes,</hi> does acknowledge with other Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that Perſpective-Glaſſes were not firſt found out by Mathematici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans or Philoſophers, but caſually by one <hi>Metius,</hi> a <hi>Dutch</hi> Spectacle-maker. On which occaſion I ſhall mind you, that to hide Pride from Man, divers others of the chief Diſcoveries that have been made in Phyſicks, have been the Productions, not of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, but Chance, by which Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder, Glaſs, and, for ought we know, the Verticity of the Load-ſtone, (to which we owe both the <hi>Indies</hi>) came to be found in theſe later Ages; as (more recently) the Milky Veſſels of the Meſentery, the new Recepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the Chyle, and that other ſort of Veſſels which moſt men call the <hi>Lymphae-ducts,</hi> were lighted on but by Chance, according to the Ingenious Confeſſion of the Diſcoverers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                     <p>We may farther conſider, that
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:93740:101"/>
thoſe very things which are juſtly are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd in the praiſe of the Corpuſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larian Philoſophy it ſelf, ought to leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen the pride of thoſe that but make uſe of it. For that Hypotheſis, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the whole Univerſe (the Soul of Man excepted) to be but a great <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomaton,</hi> or ſelf-moving Engine, wherein all things are perform'd by the bare motion (or reſt) the ſize, the ſhape, and the ſcituation or tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the parts of the Univerſal Matter it conſiſts of; all the <hi>Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena</hi> reſult from thoſe few Principles, ſingle or combin'd, (as the ſeveral Tunes or Chimes that are rung on five Bells,) and theſe fertile Principles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing already eſtabliſh'd by the Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and Promoters of the Particula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Hypotheſis; all that ſuch Perſons as your Friend, are wont farther to do, is but to inveſtigate or gueſs, by what kind of Motions the three or four other Principles are varied. So that the World being but, as it were, a great piece of Clock-work, the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turaliſt as ſuch, is but a Mechanitian; however the parts of the Engine, he conſiders, be ſome of them much lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and others much minuter, than
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:93740:102"/>
thoſe of Clocks or Watches. And for an ordinary Naturaliſt to deſpiſe thoſe that ſtudy the Myſteries of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as much inferiour to Phyſical Truths, is no leſs unreaſonable, than it were for a Watch-maker, becauſe he underſtands his own Trade, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe Privy-Counſellers, who are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the ſecrets of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs, and Myſteries of State; or than it were for a Ship-carpenter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he underſtands more of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick of the Veſſel, to deſpiſe the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral, that is acquainted with the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Deſigns of the Prince, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd about his moſt important af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs.</p>
                     <p>That great Reſtorer of Phyſicks, the illuſtrious <hi>Verulam,</hi> who has trac'd out a moſt uſeful way to make Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries in the Intellectual Globe, as he calls it, confeſſes, that his work was (to ſpeak in his own terms) <hi>partus temporis potius quám ingenii.</hi> And though I am not of his opinion, where he ſays in another place, that his way of Philoſophizing does <hi>exaequare in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genia</hi>; yet I am apt to think, that the fertile Principles of the Mechanical Philoſophy being once ſetled, the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:93740:102"/>
Methods of inquiring and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting being found out, and the Phyſico-mechanical Inſtruments of working on Natures and Arts Produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions being happily invented, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of ſeveral leſſer improvements, eſpecially by rectifying of ſome almoſt obvious or ſupine Errours<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the Schools, by the aſſiſtance of ſuch fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitating helps, may fall to the lot of perſons not endow'd with any extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Sagacity, or acuteneſs of parts. And though the Inveſtigation and clear eſtabliſhment of the true Principles of Philoſophy, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing the Inſtruments of Knowledge, be things that may be allowed to be the proper work of ſublimer Wits; yet, if a man be furniſh'd with ſuch aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtances, 'tis not every Diſcourſe that he makes, or thing which he does by the help of them, that is difficult enough to raiſe him to that illuſtrious rank. And indeed, divers of the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Errours, as well as of Scholars as other men, being mainly grounded upon the meer, and often miſtaken, Authority of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and perhaps ſome frivolous Reaſons of his Schola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtic Interpreters of ſuch precarious
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:93740:103"/>
and ungrounded things, that to ruine them, does oftentimes require more of boldneſs than skill; it may perhaps be ſaid of your Friend, in relation to his Philoſophical Succeſſes againſt ſuch vulgar Errours, as I am ſpeaking of, what a <hi>Roman</hi> ſaid of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Triumph over the effeminate <hi>Aſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, Quod nihil aliud quám bene au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus ſit Vana contemnere.</hi> And in ſome caſes it happens, that, when once a grand Truth, or a happy way of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimenting has been found, divers <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Nature, that had been left unexplain'd, or were left mis-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd by the Schools, did, in my opinion, require a far leſs ſtraining Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of the mind to unriddle and explain them, <hi>than</hi> muſt have been requiſite to diſpel the darkneſs that attended divers Theological Truths that are now clear'd up, and perhaps <hi>than</hi> I have my ſelf now and then im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in ſome of thoſe Attempts, to illuſtrate Theological Matters, that you may have met in ſome Papers that I have preſum'd to write on ſuch Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. And indeed the Improvements, that ſuch <hi>Virtuoſi</hi> as your Friend are wont to make of the fertile Theorems
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:93740:103"/>
and Hints, that have been preſented them by the Founders or prime Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactors of true Natural Philoſophy, are ſo poor and ſlender, and do ſo much oftner proceed from Induſtry and Chance, than they argue a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent ſagacity, or a ſublimity of Reaſon, that, though ſuch perſons may have cauſe enough to be Delighted with what they have done, yet they have none to be Proud of it; and their Performances may deſerve our Thanks, and perhaps ſome of our Praiſe, but reach not ſo high as to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit our Admiration; which is to be reſerv'd for Thoſe, that have been either Framers, or Grand Promoters, of True and Comprehenſive Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſes, or (elſe) the Authors of other noble and uſeful Diſcoveries, many ways applicable.</p>
                     <p>It will not perhaps be improper to add on this occaſion, that, <hi>as</hi> our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is not very <hi>deep,</hi> not reaching with any certainty to the bottom of Things, nor penetrating to their inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate or innermoſt Natures; <hi>ſo</hi> its Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent is not very <hi>large,</hi> not being able to give us, with any Clearneſs and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularity, an account of the Celeſtial
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:93740:104"/>
and deeply Subterraneal parts of the World, of which all the others make but a very <hi>ſmall</hi> (not to ſay <hi>contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>) portion.</p>
                     <p>For, as to the very Globe that we inhabit, not to mention, how many Plants, Animals, and Minerals, we are as yet wholly ignorant of, and how many others we are but ſlenderly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with; I conſider, that the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects about which our Experiments and Inquiries are converſant, do all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the <hi>Superficial parts</hi> of the Terreſtrial Globe, of which the Earth, known to us, ſeems to be but as it were the Cruſt or Scurf. But what the Internal part of this Globe is made up of, is no leſs diſputable than of what Subſtance the remoteſt Stars we can deſcry, conſiſt: For even among the modern Philoſophers ſome think, the internal Portion of the Earth to be pure and Elementary Earth, which (ſay they) muſt be found there, or no where. Others imagine it to be Fiery, and the Receptacle either of Natural or Helliſh Flames. Others will have the Body of the Terreſtrial Globe to be a great and ſolid Magnet. And the <hi>Carteſians</hi> on the other ſide, (though
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:93740:104"/>
they all admit ſtore of Subterraneal Loadſtones) teach, that the ſame Globe was once a Fix'd Star, and that, though it have ſince degenerated into a Planet, yet the Internal part of it is ſtill of the ſame Nature that it was before; the change it has received proceeding onely from having had its outward parts quite cover'd over with thick ſpots (like thoſe to be often obſerv'd about the Sun,) by whoſe Condenſation the firm Earth we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit was form'd. And the miſchief is, that each of theſe jarring Opinions is almoſt as difficult to be demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively prov'd Falſe as True. For, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as to the Centre of the Earth there is, according to the modeſteſt account of our late Coſmographers, above three thouſand and five hundred miles; my Inquiries among Navigators and Miners have not yet ſatisfi'd me, that mens Curioſity has actually reached above one mile or two at moſt down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, (and that not in above three or four places,) either into the Earth or into the Sea. So that as yet our Experience has ſcarce grated any thing deep upon the Husk, (if I may ſo ſpeak) without at all reaching the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:93740:105"/>
Kernel of the Terraqueous Globe.</p>
                     <p>And alas! what is this Globe of ours, of which it ſelf we know ſo little, in compariſon of thoſe vaſt and Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous Globes that we call the Fix'd Stars, of which we know much leſs? For, though former Aſtronomers have been pleaſed to give us, with a ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accurateneſs, their Diſtances and Bigneſſes, as if they had had certain ways of meaſuring them; yet Later and Better Mathematicians will (I know) allow me to doubt of what Thoſe have deliver'd. For ſince 'tis confeſs'd, that we can obſerve no Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallax in the Fix'd Stars (nor perhaps in the higheſt Planets,) men muſt be yet to ſeek for a Method to meaſure the diſtance of thoſe Bodies. And not onely the <hi>Copernicans</hi> make it to be I know not how many hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of miles greater than the <hi>Ptolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>means,</hi> and very much greater than even <hi>Tycho</hi>; but <hi>Ricciolus</hi> himſelf, though a great <hi>Anti-Copernican,</hi> makes the diſtance of the Fix'd Stars vaſtly greater, than not onely <hi>Tycho,</hi> but (if I mis-remember not) than ſome of the <hi>Copernicans</hi> themſelves. Nor do I wonder at theſe ſo great Diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pances,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:93740:105"/>
(though ſome amount per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps to ſome millions of miles,) when I conſider, that Aſtronomers do not meaſure the diſtance of the Fix'd Stars by their Inſtruments, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate it to their particular Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſes. And by this uncertainty of the remoteneſs of the Fix'd Stars you will eaſily gather, that we are not very ſure of their Bulk, no not ſo much as in reference to one another; ſince it remains doubtful, whether the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Sizes, they appear to us to be of, proceed from a real Inequality of Bulk, or onely from an Inequality of Diſtance, or partly from one of thoſe cauſes, and partly from the other.</p>
                     <p>But 'tis not my deſign to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of thoſe Things, which the famous Diſputes among the Modern Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomers manifeſt to be dubious. For I conſider, that there are divers things relating to the Stars, which are ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from our knowledge, that the Cauſes of them are not ſo much as diſputed of, or inquired into, ſuch as may be among others, Why the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Stars is neither greater nor leſſer than it is? Why ſo many of thoſe Celeſtial Lights are ſo plac'd, as
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:93740:106"/>
not to be viſible to our naked eyes, nor even when they are help'd by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Teleſcopes? (which extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary good ones have aſſured me of.) Why among the familiarly viſible Stars, there are ſo many in ſome parts of the Sky, and ſo few in others? Why their Sizes are ſo differing, and yet not more differing? Why they are not more orderly plac'd, ſo as to make up Conſtellations of regular or handſome Figures (of which the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle is, perhaps, the ſingle Example) but ſeem to be ſcatter'd in the Skie as it were by Chance, and have as confus'd Configurations, as the Drops that fall upon ones Hat in a ſhower of Rain? To which divers other Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons might be added, as about the Stars, ſo about the Interſtellar part of Heaven, which ſeveral of the Modern <hi>Epicureans</hi> would have to be empty, ſave where the beams of Light (and perhaps ſome other Celeſtial Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluvia) paſs through it; and the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſians</hi> on the contrary think to be full of an Aethereal matter, which ſome, that are otherwiſe favourers of their Philoſophy, confeſs they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to take up but as an Hypotheſis.

So that our knowledge is much ſhort of what many think, not onely if it be conſider'd Intenſively, but Extenſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, (as a Schoolman would expreſs it.) For there being ſo great a diſpropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between the Heavens and the Earth, that ſome Moderns think the Earth to be little better than a Point in compariſon even of the Orb of the Sun; and the <hi>Carteſians,</hi> with other <hi>Copernicans,</hi> think the great Orb it ſelf, (which is equal to what the <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomeans</hi> call'd the Sun's Orb) to be but a Point in reſpect of the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and all our Aſtronomers agree, that at leaſt the Earth is but a Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Point in compariſon of the Starry Heaven: Of how little extent muſt our knowledge be, which leaves us igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of ſo many things, touching the vaſt Bodies that are above us, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrates ſo little a way even into the Earth that is beneath us, that it ſeems confin'd to but a ſmall ſhare of the ſuperficial part of a Phyſical Point! Of which conſideration the natural reſult will be, that, though what we call our Knowledge, may be allowed to paſs for a high Gratification to our minds, it ought not to puff them up;
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:93740:107"/>
and what we know of the Syſtem, and the Nature of things Corporeal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is not ſo perfect and ſatisfactory, as to juſtifie our deſpiſing the Diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Spiritual things.</p>
                     <p>One of the former parts of this Letter may furniſh me with one thing more, to evince the Excellencies and Prerogatives of the knowledge of the Myſteries of Religion; and that One thing is ſuch, that I hope I ſhall need to add nothing More, becauſe it is not poſſible to add any thing Higher; and that is, That the Preeminence above other Knowledge, adjudg'd to that of Divine Truths by a Judge above all Exception, and above all Compariſon, namely, by <hi>God</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                     <p>This having been but lately ſhown, I ſhall not now repeat it, but rather apply what hath been there evinc'd, by repreſenting, that if He, who deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines in favour of Divine Truths, were ſuch an one, as was leſs acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, than our over-weening Natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts with the ſecrets of their Idoliz'd Phyſicks; <hi>or</hi> if he were, though an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent, yet (like an Angel) a Bare Contemplator of what we call the
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:93740:107"/>
Works of Nature, without having any Intereſt in their Productions, your Friends not acquieſcing in his eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of things might have, though not a fair Excuſe, yet a ſtronger Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation.</p>
                     <p>But when he, by whoſe direction we prefer the higher Truths revealed in the Scripture, before thoſe which Reaſon alone teaches us concerning thoſe comparatively mean Subjects, things Corporeal, is the ſame God that not onely underſtands the whole Univerſe, and all its parts, far more perfectly, than a Watch-maker can underſtand one of his own Watches, (in which he can give an account one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Contrivance, and not of the Cauſe of the Spring, nor the Nature of the Gold, Steel, and other Bodies his Watch conſiſts of,) but did make both this great <hi>Automaton,</hi> the World, and Man in it: We have no colour to imagine, that he ſhould either be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of, or injuriouſly diſparage, his own Workmanſhip, or impoſe upon his Favourite-Creature, Man, in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting him what ſort of Knowledge he ought moſt to covet and prize. So that ſince 'tis He who fram'd the
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:93740:108"/>
World, and all thoſe things in it we moſt admire, that would have us pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the knowledge he has vouchſafed us in his Word, before that which he has allow'd us of his Works, ſure 'tis very unreaſonable and unkind to make the Excellencies of the Workmanſhip a diſparagement to the Author, and the Effects of his Wiſdom a Motive againſt acquieſcing in the Deciſions of his Judgment; as if, becauſe he is to be admir'd for his Viſible Produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, he were not to be believ'd, when he tells us, that there are Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries that contain Truths more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable than thoſe which relate but to the Objects, that he has expos'd to all men's Eyes.</p>

                     <p>I Doubt, I ſhould be guilty of a moſt important Omiſſion, if I ſhould here forget to conſider One thing, which I fear has a main ſtroak in the Partiality your Friend expreſſeth in his preference of Phyſicks to The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ology; and that is, That he ſuppoſes
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:93740:108"/>
he ſhall by the Former acquire a Fame, both more Certain and more Durable, than can be hop'd for from the Latter.</p>
                     <p>And I acknowledge, not onely with readineſs, but with ſomewhat of Gratulation of the felicity of this Age, That there is ſcarce any ſort of Knowledge more in requeſt, than that which Natural Philoſophy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to teach; and that among the awaken'd and inquiſitive part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, as much Reputation and Eſteem may be gain'd by an inſight into the Secrets of Nature, as by being intruſted with thoſe of Princes, or dignifi'd with the ſplendid'ſt marks of their favour.</p>
                     <p>But though I readily confeſs thus much, and though perhaps I may be thought to have had, I know not by what fate, as great a ſhare of that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fum'd Smoak, <hi>Applauſe,</hi> as (at leaſt) <hi>ſome</hi> of thoſe, which among the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that are now alive, your Friend ſeems moſt to Envy for it; yet I ſhall not ſcruple to tell you, partly from obſervation of what has happen'd to others, and partly too upon ſome little Experience of my own, that <hi>neither</hi> is it ſo eaſie as your Friend ſeems to
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:93740:109"/>
believe it, to get by the ſtudy of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture a ſure and laſting Reputation, <hi>neither</hi> ought the Expectation of it, in reaſon, make men undervalue the ſtudy of Divinity. Nor would it here avail to object (by way of prevention) that the Difficulties and Impediments of acquiring and ſecuring Reputation, lie as well in the way of Divines as Philoſophers, ſince this Objection has been already conſider'd at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this Second Part of our preſent Tract. Beſides, that the progreſs of our Diſcourſe will ſhew, that the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turaliſt, aſpiring to fame, is liable to ſome Inconveniences, which are either not at all, or not near equally incident to the Divine. Wherefore without ſtaying to take any further notice of this preventive Allegation, I ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to make good the firſt part of the Aſſertion that preceded it; which that I may the more fully do, give me leave (after having premiſed, <hi>That a man muſt either be a Writer, or forbear to Print what he knows</hi>;) to propoſe to you the following Conſiderations.</p>
                     <p>And firſt, if your <hi>Phyſeophilus</hi> ſhould think to ſecure a great Reputation, by forbearing to couch any of his
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:93740:109"/>
Thoughts or Experiments in Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he may thereby find himſelf not a little miſtaken. For if once he have gain'd a repute (upon what account ſoever) of knowing ſome things that may be uſeful to others, or of which ſtudious men are wont to be very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous, he will not avoid the Viſits and Queſtions of the Curious. Or, if he ſhould affect a Solitude, and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to hide himſelf, that he may hide the things he knows; yet he will not eſcape the ſollicitations that will be made him by Letters. And if theſe ways of tempting him to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe himſelf, prevail not at all with him to do ſo, he will <hi>provoke</hi> the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that have employ'd them; who finding themſelves diſoblieg'd by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing defeated of their Deſires, if not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo their Expectations, will for the moſt part endeavour to revenge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on him, by giving him the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of an uncourteous and ill-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd perſon; and will endeavour, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſucceſsfully enough, to decry his parts, by ſuggeſting, That his affected Concealments proceed but from a Conſcientiouſneſs, that the things he is preſum'd to poſſeſs, are but ſuch, as,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:93740:110"/>
if they ſhould begin to be known, would ceaſe to be valu'd.</p>
                     <p>You will ſay (perchance,) that ſo much reſervedneſs is a fault: Nor ſhall I diſpute it with you, whether it be or not; but, if he be open and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicative in Diſcourſe to thoſe Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers that come to pump him, ſuch is the diſingenious temper of too too many, that he will be in great danger of having his Notions or Experiments arrogated by thoſe to whom he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts them, or at leaſt by others, to whom thoſe may (though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance deſignleſsly) happen to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of them. And then, if either <hi>Phyſeophylus,</hi> or any of his Friends that know him to be Author of what is thus uſurp'd, ſhould mention him as ſuch, the Uſurpers and their Friends would preſently become his Enemies; and, to ſecure their own Reputation, will be ſollicitous to leſſen and blemiſh his. And if you ſhould now tell me, that your Friend might here take a Middle way, as that which in moſt caſes is thought to be the beſt, by diſcourſing at ſuch a rate of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries, as may ſomewhat gratifie thoſe that have a Curioſity to learn
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:93740:110"/>
them, and yet not ſpeak ſo clearly as diveſt himſelf of his Propriety in them; I ſhould reply, That neither is this Expedient a ſure one, nor free from Inconveniences. For moſt men are ſo ſelf-opinionated, that they will eaſily believe themſelves Maſters of things, if they do but half underſtand them. And however, though the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to whom the Diſcourſe was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately made, ſhould not have too great an Opinion of themſelves, no more than too great a Sagacity; yet they may eaſily, by repeating what they heard and obſerv'd, give ſome more piercing Wit a hint ſufficient to enable him to make out the whole Notion, or the Diſcovery, which he will then without ſcruple, and without almoſt any poſſibility of being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd, aſſume for his own. But if it happen, (as it often will in Extempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneous Diſcourſe) that a Philoſopher be not rightly underſtood; either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he has not the leiſure, no more than a deſign, to explain himſelf fully, or becauſe the Perſons he converſes with bring not a competent Capacity and Attention, he then runs a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter danger than before. For the vanity
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:93740:111"/>
moſt men take in being known to have convers'd with eminent Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers, makes them very forward to repeat what they heard ſuch a famous Wit ſay; and oftentimes being ſecure of not being contradicted, ignorantly to miſrecite it, or wittingly to wreſt it in favour of the Opinion they would countenance by it. So that, whereas by the formerly mention'd franckneſs of Diſcourſe he is onely in danger to have the Truths he diſcover'd arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated by Others, this reſervedneſs expoſes him to have Opinions and Errours that he never dream'd of, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd on Him. And when a man's Opinions or Diſcoveries come once to be publickly diſcours'd of, without being propos'd by himſelf, or ſome Friend well inſtructed by him, he knows not, what Errours or Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies may be imputed to him (and that without a Moral poſſibility left to moſt men to diſcern them, (by the miſtake of the Weak, or the diſinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity of the Partial, or the Artifices of the Malitious. And even the greatneſs of a mans Reputation does ſometimes give ſuch countenance to vain Reports and Surmiſes, as by degrees to ſhake,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:93740:111"/>
if not ruine, it. As we ſee, that Fryer <hi>Bacon,</hi> and <hi>Trithemius,</hi> and <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> who for their times were knowing as well as famous men, had ſuch feats aſcrib'd to them, as by appearing Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous to moſt of the Judicious, have tempted many to think, that all the great things that were ſaid of them were ſo too.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are ſome of the Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences that a Naturaliſt may be liable to, if he forbear the communicating of his Thoughts and Diſcoveries <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi>: But if <hi>Phyſeophilus</hi> ſhould, to ſhun theſe, aſpire to Fame by the uſual way of writing Books, he may indeed avoid <hi>theſe,</hi> but perhaps not without running into <hi>other</hi> inconveniences and hazards, very little inferiour to them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt</hi> then, we may conſider, that whether a man writes in a Syſtematical way, as they have done who have publiſh'd entire Bodies of Natural Philoſophy, or Methodical Treatiſes of ſome conſiderable part of it, or whether he write in a more looſe and unconfin'd way, of any particular Subject that belongs to Phyſicks; whichſoever, I ſay, of theſe two ways of writing Books he ſhall make choice
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:93740:112"/>
of, he will find it liable to Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence enough.</p>
                     <p>For if he write Syſtematically, <hi>firſt,</hi> he will be obliged (that he may leave nothing neceſſary undeliver'd) to ſay divers things that have been ſaid (perhaps many times) by others al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, which cannot but be unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, not onely to the Reader, but (if he be Ingenious) to the Writer. <hi>Next,</hi> there are ſo many things in Nature, whereof we know little or Nothing, and ſo many more of which we do not know Enough, that our Syſtematical Writer, though we ſhould grant him to be very Learned, muſt needs, either leave divers things that belong to his Theme untreated of, or diſcourſe of them ſlightly, and oftentimes (in likelihood) Erroneouſly. So that in this kind of Books there is always much ſaid that the Reader <hi>did</hi> know, and commonly not a little that the Writer <hi>does not</hi> know. And to this I muſt add in the <hi>third</hi> place, that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Philoſophy, being ſo vaſt and pregnant a Subject, that (eſpecially in ſo Inquiſitive an Age as this) almoſt every day diſcovers ſome new thing or other about it, 'tis ſcarce poſſible
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:93740:112"/>
for a Method, that is adapted but to what is Already known, to continue Long the moſt proper; as the ſame Clothes will not long fit a Child, whoſe Age will make him quickly out-grow them. And therefore ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Writers will have a fair pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to compile new Syſtems, that may be more adequate to Philoſophy improv'd ſince the publication of the former. And though there were little of New to be added, and it were more eaſie to Alter than to Mend the Method of our ſuppoſed Authour; yet Novelty it ſelf is a thing ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and inviting to the generality of men, that It often recommends things that have nothing elſe to recommend them; and we may apply to a great many other things, what I remember a famous Courtier of my acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance uſed to ſay of Miſtreſſes, That <hi>Another</hi> was preferable to a <hi>Better,</hi> (the Better being but the ſame.)</p>
                     <p>But now if, declining the Syſtema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical way, one ſhall chooſe the other of writing looſe Tracts and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, he may indeed avoid ſome of the lately mention'd Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, but will ſcarce avoid the being
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:93740:113"/>
plunder'd by Syſtematical Writers: For theſe will be apt to cull out thoſe things that they like beſt, and inſert them in their Methodical Books, (perhaps much curtal'd, or otherwiſe injur'd in the repeating,) and will place them, not as their own Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour did, where they may beſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm or adorn his Diſcourſe, and be illuſtrated or upheld by it; but where it may beſt ſerve the turn of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piler: And theſe Methodical Books promiſe ſo much more Compendious a way than others to the Attainment of the Sciences they treat of, that though really for the moſt part they prove greater helps to the Memory, than the Underſtanding; yet moſt Readers, being, for want of Judgment or of Patience, of another mind, they are willing to take it for granted, that in former Writers, if there have been any thing conſiderable, it has been all carefully extracted, as well as or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly digeſted by the later Compi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers: And though I take this to be a very Erroneous and Prejudicial Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, yet it obtains ſo much, that <hi>as</hi> Gol<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſmiths that onely give ſhape and luſtre to Gold are far more eſteem'd,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:93740:113"/>
and in a better Condition, than Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, who find the Ore in the bowels of the Earth, and with great pains and induſtry dig it up, and refine it into Metall; <hi>ſo</hi> thoſe that with great ſtudy and toil ſucceſsfully penetrate into the hidden Receſſes of Nature, and diſcover latent Truths, are uſually leſs regarded or taken notice of by the Generality of Men, than thoſe who by plauſible Methods and a neat Style reduce the Truths, that others have found out, into Syſtems of a Taking Order and a Convenient Bulk.</p>
                     <p>I conſider in the <hi>ſecond</hi> place, That as the Method of the Books one writes, ſo the Bulk of them may prove prejudicial to the Naturaliſt that aſpires to Fame: For if he write large Books, 'tis odds but that he will write in them many things unaccu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, if not impertinent, or that he will be oblig'd to repeat many things that others have ſaid before; and if he write but ſmall Tracts, as is the cuſtome of the Judiciouſeſt Authors, who have no mind to publiſh but what is New and Conſiderable, as their Excellency will make them to be
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:93740:114"/>
the ſooner diſpers'd, ſo the ſmallneſs of the Bulk will endanger them to be quickly loſt; as Experience ſhows us of divers Excellent little Tracts, which, though publiſh'd not many years ago, are already out of Print, (as they ſpeak) and not to be met with, ſave by chance, in Stationers Shops. So that theſe Writings (which deſerve a better fate) come, after a while, either to be loſt, (which is the caſe of divers,) or to have their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory preſerv'd onely in the larger Volume of ſome Compiler, whoſe Induſtry is onely preferable to his Judgment; it being obſervable, that (by I know not what unlucky fate) very few (for I do not ſay, <hi>None</hi>) that addict themſelves to make Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions out of others, have the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to cull out the choiſeſt things in them; and the ſmall Tracts, we are ſpeaking of, being preſerv'd but in ſuch a Quoter or Abridger, will run a very great danger of being convey'd to poſterity but under ſuch a Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation as it pleaſes the Compiler.</p>
                     <p>And This (that I may proceed to my <hi>third</hi> Conſideration) may make the Naturaliſts Fame very uncertain,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:93740:114"/>
not onely becauſe of the want of Judgment, that (as I newly ſaid) is too often obſervable in Compilers, whereby they frequently leave far better things than they take, but for the want of skill to underſtand the Author they Cite and Epitomize, or Candor to do him right. For ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times mens Phyſical Opinions, and ſeveral Paſſages of their Writings, are ſo miſrepreſented by Miſtake or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, eſpecially if thoſe that recite their Opinions be not Of them, that men are made to teach or deliver things quite differing from their Senſe, and perhaps quite contrary to it; of which, I my ſelf have had ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welcome Experience, a Learned Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pretending, I know not how often, that I aſſerted an Opinion, about which I did expreſsly <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. And an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other noted Writer having (not out of deſign, but unacquaintedneſs with Mechanicks, and the Subject I writ of,) given me commendations for having, by a new Experiment, prov'd a thing, the quite contrary whereof I intended thereby to evince, and am not Alone miſtaken, if I did not do it. Other Naturaliſts I have met with,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:93740:115"/>
whoſe Writings Compilers have tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd out of hatred to their Perſons, or their Religion; as if Truth could in nothing be a Friend to one that is the Traducers's Enemy; or as if a man that falls into an Errour in Religion, could not light upon a good Notion in Philoſophy, in ſpite of all the Truths we owe to <hi>Ariſtotle, Epicurus,</hi> and the other Heathen Philoſophers. Nay, ſome there are, that will ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to decry a man's Writings, not becauſe they are directly His Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, but becauſe He is <hi>eſteem'd</hi> by Theirs; as you may remember an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in a Servant of yours, who had divers things written againſt Him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this very Account. Nor is it onely by the Citations of profeſs'd Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries or Opponents, that a worthy Writer's Reputation may be preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic'd, ſince 'tis not unfrequently ſo by thoſe, that mention him with an <hi>Encomium,</hi> and ſeem diſpos'd to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him. For I have obſerv'd it to be the Trick of certain Writers, to name an Author with much Complement, onely for ſome one or few of the leaſt conſiderable things they borrow of Him; by which artifice they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:93740:115"/>
to conceal their being Plagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries of more and better; which yet is more excuſable than the Practiſe of ſome, who proceed to that pitch of diſingenuity, that they will rail at an Author, to whom indeed they owe too much, that they may not be thought to be beholden to him.</p>
                     <p>But (4.) I muſt add, that beſides theſe dangers that a Naturaliſts Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation with poſterity may run through the Ignorance or Perverſneſs of men, it is liable to divers other hazards, from the very Nature both of Men, of Opinions, and of Things.</p>
                     <p>For, as men's Genius's and Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are naturally various in reference to Studies, one man paſſionately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting one ſort of them, and another being fond of quite differing ones; ſo thoſe Inclinations are oftentimes va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly and generally determin'd by external and accidental Cauſes. As when ſome great Monarch happens to be a great Patron, or a Deſpiſer, and perhaps Adverſary, of this or that kind of Learning: And when ſome one man has gain'd much applauſe for this or that kind of Study; Imitation, or Emulation oftentimes makes many
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:93740:116"/>
others addict themſelves to it. Thus though <hi>Rome</hi> under the Conſuls was inconſiderable for Learning, yet the Reputation of <hi>Cicero,</hi> and Favour of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> brought Learning into re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt there; where the ſmall counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance it met with among moſt of the ſucceeding Emperours, kept it far in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to what it had been among the <hi>Greeks</hi> about <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Age. And the Age of the ſame <hi>Auguſtus</hi> was enobled with ſtore of Poets, not onely by the countenance which He and <hi>Maecenas</hi> afforded them, but proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly alſo by the Examples they gave to, and the Emulation they excited in, one another. And after the decay of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, in the Fourth <hi>Century,</hi> Natural Philoſophy and the Mathematicks being very little va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued, and leſs underſtood, by reaſon that mens Studies were, by the Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us of thoſe Ages apply'd to other Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, every hundred years ſcarce pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd One Improver, (not to ſay one Eminent Cultivator) either of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks or of Phyſicks: By which you may ſee, how little Certainty there is, that, becauſe a man is skill'd in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Philoſophy, and that Science is
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:93740:116"/>
now in Requeſt, his Reputation ſhall be as great as now, when perhaps the Science it ſelf will be grown out of Repute.</p>
                     <p>But beſides the Contingencies that may happen to a Naturaliſt's Fame upon this Account, That the Science He cultivates, is, as well as others, ſubject to Wanes and Eclipſes in the general eſteem of men; there is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other uncertainty ariſing from the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſitudes that are to be met with in the Eſtimates men make of differing Hypotheſes, Sects, and ways of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophizing about the ſame Science, and particularly about Natural Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy. For during thoſe Learned Times, when Phyſicks firſt and moſt flouriſh'd among the <hi>Grecians, Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critus, Leucippus, Epicurus, Anaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras, Plato,</hi> and almoſt all the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turaliſts that preceded <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> were Corpuſcularians, endeavouring, though not all by the ſame way, to give an account of the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Nature, and even of Qualities themſelves, by the Bigneſs, Shape, Motion, &amp;c. of Corpuſcles, or the minuteſt active parts of Matter: Whereas <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> having attempted to deduce the <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena</hi>
                        <pb n="200" facs="tcp:93740:117"/>
from the four firſt Qualities, the four Elements, and ſome few other barren Hypotheſes, aſcribing what could not be explicated by them, (and conſequently far the greateſt part of Natures <hi>Phaenomena</hi>) to Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Forms and Occult Qualities; (Principles that are readily nam'd, but ſcarce ſo much as pretended to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood,) and having upon theſe ſlight and narrow Principles reduc'd Phyſicks into a kind of Syſtem, which the judicious Modeſty of the Corpuſcularians had made them back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to do; the Reputation that his great Pupil <hi>Alexander,</hi> as well as his Learning gave him; the Eaſineſs of the way he propos'd to the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Natural Philoſophy; the good luck his Writings had to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive thoſe of <hi>Democritus,</hi> and almoſt all the reſt of the Corpuſcularians, when <hi>Charles</hi> the Great began to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh Learning in <hi>Europe</hi>: Theſe, I ſay, and ſome other lucky Accidents that concurr'd, did for about ſeven or eight hundred years together, make the Corpuſcularian Philoſophy not onely be Juſtled, but even Exploded out of the Schools by the Peripate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick;
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:93740:117"/>
which in our Times is, by very many, upon the Revival of the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcularian Philoſophy, rejected, and, by more than a few, derided as preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, unintelligible, and uſeleſs. And to give an inſtance in a particular thing, (which, though formerly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, deſerves to be again mention'd to our preſent purpoſe,) <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſomewhere confeſſes, (not to ſay brags) that the <hi>Greek</hi> Philoſophers, his Predeceſſors did, unanimouſly teach, that the World was (I ſay not Created, but) Made, and yet He, almoſt by his ſingle Authority, and the ſubtile Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments (as ſome have been pleaſed to think them,) that he employ'd, (though divers of them were borrow'd of <hi>Ocellus Lucanus,</hi>) was able for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Ages to introduce into the Schools of Philoſophers that Irreligious and Ill-grounded Opinion of the Eternity of the World, which afterwards the Chriſtian Doctrine made men begin to queſtion, and which now both that and Right Reaſon have perſwaded moſt men to reject.</p>
                     <p>And this invites me to conſider far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, That the preſent ſucceſs of the Opinions that your <hi>Phyſeophilus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friends,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:93740:118"/>
ought not to make him ſo ſure as he thinks he is, that the ſame Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions will be always in the ſame, or greater Vogue, and have the ſame Advantages, in point of General Eſteem that they now have, over their Corrivals. For, Opinions ſeem to have their Fatal Seaſons and Viciſſitudes, as well as other things; as may appear, not onely by the Examples of it new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given, but alſo by the Hypotheſis of the Earths Motion, which having been in great requeſt before <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras,</hi> (who yet is commonly thought the Inventor of it,) had its Reputation much increas'd by the ſuffrage of the famous Sect of the <hi>Pythagoreans,</hi> (whom <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf takes notice of as the Patrons of that Opinion;) and yet afterwards for near 2000 years it was laugh'd at, as not onely falſe, but ridiculous. After all which time, this ſo long antiquated Opinion being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viv'd by <hi>Copernicus,</hi> has in a little time made ſo great a progreſs among the modern Aſtronomers and Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, that if it go on to prevail at the ſame rate, the Motion of the Earth will be acknowledg'd by all its Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical Inhabitants. But though
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:93740:118"/>
it be often the Fate of an oppreſs'd Truth, to have at length a Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet 'tis not always its peculiar pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge; for, Obſolete Errours are ſometimes reviv'd, as well as diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited Truths: So that the general diſrepute of an Opinion in one Age will not give us an abſolute ſecurity, that 'twill not be in as general Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt in another, in which it may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps not onely Revive, but Reign.</p>
                     <p>Nor is it onely in the Credit of mens Opinions about Philoſophical Matters, that we may obſerve an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy and Viciſſitude, but in the very Way and Method of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phizing; for <hi>Democritus, Plato, Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras,</hi> and others, who were of the more ſincere and ingenious Cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of Phyſicks among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> exercis'd themſelves chiefly either in making particular Experiments and Obſervations, as <hi>Democritus</hi> did in his manifold Diſſections of Animals; or elſe apply'd the Mathematicks to the Explicating of a particular <hi>Phaenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> of Nature, as may appear (not to mention what <hi>Hero</hi> teaches in his <hi>Pneumaticks,</hi>) by the Accounts, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocritus, Plato,</hi> and others, give of
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:93740:119"/>
Fire and other Elements, from the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure and Motion of the Corpuſcles they conſiſt of. And although this way of Philoſophizing were ſo much in requeſt before <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> that (albeit he unluckily brought in another, yet) there are manifeſt and conſiderable footſteps of it to be met with in ſome of his Writings, (and particularly in his Books of Animals, and his Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Queſtions;) yet the Scholaſtick followers of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> did, for many Ages, neglect the way of Philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing of the Antients, and (to the great prejudice of Learning) introduc'd every where in ſtead of it a quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary way of Writing. For, not onely they laid aſide the Mathematicks, (of which they were for the moſt part very ignorant,) but inſtead of giving us Intelligible and Explicite (if not Accurate) Accounts of particular Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, grounded upon a diſtinct and heedful Conſideration of them, they contented themſelves with hotly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting, in general, certain unneceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or at leaſt unimportant queſtions about the Objects of Phyſicks, about <hi>Materia Prima,</hi> Subſtantial Forms, Privation, Place, Generation, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:93740:119"/>
and other ſuch general things, with which when they had quite tyr'd themſelves and their Readers, they uſually remain'd utter ſtrangers to the particular Productions of that Nature, about which they had ſo much wran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled, and were not able to give a man ſo much true and uſeful Information about Particular Bodies, as even the meaneſt Mechanicks, ſuch as Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diggers, Butchers, Smiths, and even Dary-maids, could do. Which made their Philoſophy appear ſo Imperfect and Uſeleſs, not onely to the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Men, but to the more Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated and Philoſophical Wits, that our great <hi>Verulam</hi> attempted with much Skill and Induſtry, (and not without ſome Indignation) to reſtore the more modeſt and uſeful way pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd by the Antients, of Inquiring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to particular Bodies, without haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make Syſtems, into the Requeſt it formerly had; wherein the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Induſtry of two of our <hi>London</hi> Phyſicians, <hi>Gilbert</hi> and <hi>Harvey,</hi> has not a little aſſiſted him. And I need not tell you, that ſince Him, <hi>Des-Cartes, Gaſſendus,</hi> and others, having taken in the Application of Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trical
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:93740:120"/>
Theorems, for the Explication of Phyſical Problems; He, and They, and Other Reſtorers of Natural Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, have brought the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental and Mathematical way of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring into Nature into at leaſt as high and growing an Eſteem, as ever it poſſeſs'd when it was moſt in Vogue among the Naturaliſts that preceded <hi>Aristotle.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To the Conſiderations I have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto deduc'd, which (perhaps) might alone ſuffice for my purpoſe, I ſhall yet ſubjoyn one that I take to be of greater weight than any of them, for the manifeſting how difficult it is to be ſure, that the Phyſical Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which at preſent procure a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion or Promoter of them Venerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſhall be ſtill in requeſt. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that inconſtant Fate of applaud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Opinions, which may be imputed to the Inconſtancy of Men, there is a greater danger that threatens the Aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers Reputation from the very Nature of things: For the moſt general Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of all, <hi>viz.</hi> the Figure, Bigneſs, Motion, and other Mechanical Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the ſmall parts of Matter, being (as your Friend believes) ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:93740:120"/>
and clearly eſtabliſh'd already; he muſt expect to raiſe his Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from ſubordinate Hypotheſes and Theories; and in theſe I ſhall not ſcruple to ſay, that 'tis extremely diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, even for thoſe that are more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercis'd than He, in framing Them and in making of Experiments to have ſo reaching and attentive a proſpect of all things fit to be known, as not to be liable to have their Doctrine made doubtful, or diſprov'd by ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that He <hi>did not</hi> diſcover, or that After-times may. This, I doubt not, but you would eaſily be prevail'd with to allow, if I had leiſure and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency to tranſmit to you my Scepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Naturaliſt. And without having recourſe to that Tract, it may poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſuffice, that we conſider, that one of the Conditions of a good <note n="*" place="margin">See the Requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites of a good Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis.</note> Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis is, that It fairly comport not onely with all other Truths, but with all other <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Nature, as well as thoſe 'tis fram'd to explicate. For this being granted, (which cannot be deny'd,) He that eſtabliſhes a Theory, which he expects ſhall be acquieſc'd in by all ſucceeding Times, and make Him famous in them, muſt not onely
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:93740:121"/>
have a care, that none of the <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena</hi> of Nature, that are already taken notice of, do contradict his Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis at the preſent, but that no <hi>Phaenomena</hi> that may be hereafter diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd, ſhall do it for the future. And I very much queſtion, whether <hi>Phyſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus do know,</hi> or, upon no greater a number and variety of Experiments than moſt men build upon, <hi>can know,</hi> how incompleat the Hiſtory of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture we yet have, is, and how difficult it is to build an Accurate Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis upon an Incompleat Hiſtory of the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> 'tis to be fitted to; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially conſidering that (as I was ſaying) many things may be diſcover'd in After-times by Induſtry or Chance, which are not now ſo much as dream'd of, and which may yet overthrow Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines ſpeciouſly enough accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated to the Obſervations that have been hitherto made.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe Antient Philoſophers, that thought the Torrid Zone to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inhabitable, did not eſtabliſh their Opinion upon wild Reaſonings; and as it continu'd uncontrol'd for many Ages, ſo perhaps it would have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways done, if the Diſcoveries made
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:93740:121"/>
by Modern Navigations had not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted it to be Erroneous. The So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity of the Celeſtial Orbs was, for divers Centuries above 1000 years, the general opinion of Aſtronomers and Philoſophers, and yet in the laſt Age and in Ours, the free Trajection, that has been obſerv'd in the Motion of ſome Comets from one of the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Orbs to another, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate Motions in the Planet <hi>Mars,</hi> (obſerv'd by <hi>Kepler</hi> and others, to be ſometimes nearer, as well as ſometimes remoter from the Earth than is the Sun;) theſe, I ſay, and other <hi>Phenomena</hi> undiſcover'd by the Antients, have made even <hi>Tycho,</hi> as well as moſt of the recent Aſtronomers, exchange the too long receiv'd Opinion of ſolid Orbs for the more warrantable belief of a Fluid Aether. And though the Celeſtial part of the World, by reaſon of its remoteneſs from us, be the moſt unlikely of any other to afford us the means of overthrowing old Theories by new Diſcoveries; yet even in that we may take notice of divers Inſtances to our preſent purpoſe, though I ſhall here name but this One, <hi>viz.</hi> That, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>Ptolemaick</hi> Number and Order
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:93740:122"/>
of the Planets had paſt uncontradicted for very many Ages; and even the <hi>Tychonians</hi> and <hi>Copernicans,</hi> (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they did by their differing Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſes diſſent from the <hi>Ptolemaick</hi> Syſtem (as to the Order,) did (yet) acquieſce in it as to the number of the Planets; by the happy Diſcoveries, made by <hi>Galilaeo</hi> of the <hi>Satellites</hi> of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and by the excellent <hi>Huge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> of the New Planet about <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,</hi> (which I think I had the luck to be the firſt that obſerv'd and ſhew'd Disbelievers of it in <hi>England,</hi>) the Aſtronomers of all perſwaſions are brought to add to the old Septenary number of the Planets, and take in Five others that their Predeceſſors did not dream of. That the Chyle pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd in the Stomach paſs'd through the Meſaraick Veins to the Liver, and ſo to the Heart, was for many Ages the unanimous Opinion, not onely of Phyſicians, but Anatomiſts, whoſe numerous Diffections did not tempt them to queſtion it; and yet, ſince the caſual, though lucky, Diſcoveries made of the Milky Veſſels in the Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rax by the dextrous <hi>Pecquet,</hi> thoſe that have had with you and I the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:93740:122"/>
to make the requiſite Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, are generally convinc'd, that (at leaſt) a good part of the Chyle goes from the Stomach to the Heart, without paſſing through the Meſaraick Veins, or coming at all to the Liver.</p>
                     <p>'Twere eaſie to multiply Inſtances of this kind, but I rather chooſe to add, that 'tis not onely about the Qualities, and other Attributes of things, but about their Cauſes alſo, that New and oftentimes Acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Diſcoveries may deſtroy the credit of Long and generally approv'd Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.

And whereas the Notion of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures abhorrence of a <hi>Vacuum,</hi> has not onely ever ſince <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s time made a great noiſe in the Schools, but ſeems to be Confirmable by a multitude of <hi>Phaenomena</hi>; the Experiments of <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricellius,</hi> and ſome of <note n="*" place="margin">Now publiſh'd in the Book of New Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſico-Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> Ours, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencing, that the Air has a great Weight and a ſtrong Spring, have, I think, perſwaded almoſt all, that have impartially conſider'd them, that, whether there be or be not ſuch a thing as they call <hi>Fuga Vacui,</hi> yet Suction, and the Aſcenſion of Water in Pumps, and thoſe other <hi>Phaenomena</hi> that are generally aſcrib'd to It, may be very well Explicated without it, and are indeed caus'd by the Weight of the Atmoſphere, and the Elaſtical power of the Air.</p>
                     <p>And this puts me in mind to take notice, that even practical Inventions, where one would think the Matter of
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:93740:123"/>
Fact to be Evident, may by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dream'd of Diſcoveries be brought to loſe the general Reputation they had for compleatneſs in their kind. For to endear the Invention of Sucking Pumps and of Syphons, it has been generally preſum'd, that by means of either of theſe, Water and any other Liquor may, <hi>ob fugam vacui,</hi> be rais'd to what height one pleaſes; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly ways have been propos'd by famous Authors, to convey Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from one ſide of an high Mountain to the other: Whereas firſt the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected Diſappointments that were met with by ſome Pump-makers, and afterwards Experiments purpoſely made, ſufficiently evince, that neither a Pump nor a Syphon will raiſe Water to above 35 foot or thereabouts, nor Quickſilver to ſo many Inches.</p>
                     <p>And as to the Invention of Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-glaſſes, which has been ſo much and juſtly applauded and us'd, <hi>as</hi> it has been generally receiv'd for the trueſt Standard of the Heat and Cold of the Weather; <hi>ſo</hi> it ſeems to be lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to no ſuſpition of deceiving Us: For not onely 'tis evident, that in Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when the Air is very Cold, the
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:93740:124"/>
Water riſes much higher than in Summer and other Seaſons, when 'tis not ſo; but if you but apply your warm hand to the Bubble at the top, the Water will be viſibly depreſs'd by the rarifi'd Air, which upon the removal of the Hand returning to its former Coldneſs, the Water will forthwith as manifeſtly aſcend again. And yet by finding,<note place="margin">See a Tract on this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour to his Book of Cold.</note> that, as the <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphaere</hi> has a conſiderable weight, ſo this weight is not always the ſame, but varies much, and that, as far as I can yet diſcover, uncertainly enough; I have had the luck to ſatisfie many of the Curious, that theſe Open Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mometers are not to be ſafely rely'd on, ſince in them the Liquor is made to riſe and fall, not onely, as men have hitherto ſuppos'd, by the Cold and Heat of the Ambient Air, but (as I have ſhewn by divers new Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments) according to the varying Gravity of the <hi>Atmoſphaere</hi>; which Variation has not onely a Senſible, but a very Conſiderable Influence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Weather-glaſs.

For frequently men of great parts may ſucceſsfully apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to more than one Study; and few of them have their thoughts and hours ſo much ingroſs'd by that one Subject or Imployment, but that, if they have great Inclinations as well as Fitneſs for the ſtudy of Nature, they will find time, not onely to Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate it, but to Excel in it. You need not be told, That <hi>Copernicus,</hi> to whom our late Philoſophers owe ſo much, was a Churchman; That his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion <hi>Lansbergius</hi> was a Miniſter, and that <hi>Gaſſendus</hi> himſelf was a Doctor of Divinity. Among the Jeſuites you know, that <hi>Clavius</hi> and divers others
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:93740:126"/>
have as proſperouſly addicted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to Mathematicks as Divinity. And as to Phyſicks, not onely <hi>Schei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, Aquilonius, Kircher, Schottus, Zucchius,</hi> and others, have very lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dably cultivated the Optical and ſome other Parts of Philoſophy; but <hi>Ricciolus</hi> himſelf, the Learned Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piler of that Voluminous and Judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Work of the <hi>Almageſtum novum,</hi> wherein he has inſerted divers accurate Obſervations of his own, is not onely a Divine, but a Profeſſor of Divinity. And without going out of our own Countrey, I could, if I durſt for fear of offending the modeſty of thoſe I ſhould name, or injuring the merit of thoſe I ſhould omit; I could (I ſay) if it were not for this, among our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Eccleſiaſticks name you divers, who though they apply themſelves ſo much to the ſtudy of the Scripture, as to be not onely ſolid Divines, but Excellent Preachers, have yet been ſo happily converſant with Nature, that, if they had liv'd in the Learned times of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> they would have rivall'd, if not eclips'd, ſome of them, <hi>Pythagoras</hi> and <hi>Euclid</hi>; others of them, <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> and <hi>Epicurus</hi>; and ſome
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:93740:126"/>
of them, even <hi>Archimedes</hi> and <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critus</hi> themſelves.</p>
                     <p>And certainly, provided there be Curioſity and Induſtry enough im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in the <hi>ſtudy</hi> of Nature, it is not Neceſſary, that the <hi>knowledge</hi> of Nature ſhould be the ultimate End of that Study; a Fondneſs of the Object being requir'd onely in order to the Engaging the mind to ſuch a ſerious Application, as a higher aim May ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently invite us to; and Will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther promote than diſcourage. <hi>David</hi> became no leſs skilful in Muſick,<note place="margin">Amos vj.5.</note> than thoſe that were addicted to it onely to pleaſe themſelves in it; though we may reaſonably ſuppoſe, that ſo pious an Authour of Pſalms and Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments aſpired to an Excellency in that delightful Science, that he might Apply and Prefer it to the Service of the Temple, and promote the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of God's Praiſes with it. And <hi>as</hi> Experience has manifeſted, that the Heathen Philoſophers, that court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Moral Vertue for her ſelf, did not raiſe it to that pitch, to which 'twas advanc'd by the Heroick Practiſes of thoſe true Chriſtians, that in the higheſt Exerciſe of Vertue had a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:93740:127"/>
aim at the pleaſing and injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God; <hi>ſo</hi> I ſee not, why Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Knowledge muſt be more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperouſly cultivated by thoſe ſelfiſh Naturaliſts, that aim but at the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of themſelves in the attainment of that Knowledge, than thoſe Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Naturaliſts, who are invited to Attention and Induſtry, not onely by the pleaſantneſs of the Knowledge it ſelf, but by a higher and more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging Conſideration; namely, that by the Diſcoveries they make in the Book of Nature, both themſelves and others may be excited and qualifi'd the better to admire and praiſe the Authour, whoſe Goodneſs does ſo well match the Wiſdom they cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate, that he declares in his Word, That <hi>thoſe that honour him, he will honour.</hi>

                     <p>And as a man that is not <hi>in love</hi> with a fair Lady, but has onely a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect</hi> for her, may have as true and perfect, though not as diſcompoſing an Idea of her face, as the moſt paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate <hi>Inamorato</hi>; ſo I ſee not, why a Religious and Inquiſitive Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plator of Nature may not be able to give a good account of her, without
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:93740:127"/>
preferring her ſo far to all other Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of his ſtudy, as to make her his Miſtreſs, and perhaps too his Idol.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. And now I proceed to conſider in the ſecond place, That matters of Divinity may, as well as thoſe of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, afford a Reputation to Him that diſcovers, or illuſtrates them. For though the Fundamental Articles of Chriſtian Religion be, as I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly declar'd, little leſs Evident than Important; yet there are many other points in Divinity, and paſſages in the Scripture, which (for Reaſons that I have elſewhere mention'd) are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding hard to be clear'd, and do not onely poſe ordinary Readers, and the common ſort of Scholars, but will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently exerciſe the Abilities of a Great Wit, and give him opportunity enough to manifeſt that He is One. For divers of the points I ſpeak of are much benighted upon the ſcore of the Sublimity of the Things they treat of; ſuch as are the Nature, Attributes, and Decrees of God, which cannot be eaſie to the dimm underſtandings of Us that are but Men: And many other particulars that are not Abſtruſe in their own Nature, are yet made
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:93740:128"/>
Obſcure to us by our Ignorance, (or at leaſt Imperfect Knowledge,) of the diſus'd Languages wherein they are deliver'd, and the great remoteneſs of the Ages when, and the Countreys where, the things recorded were done or ſaid. So that oftentimes a man may need and ſhow as great Learning and Judgment to diſpel the Darkneſs, wherein Time has involv'd Things, as that which Nature has caſt on them: And in effect we ſee, that St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> St. <hi>Hierom, Origen,</hi> and others of the Fathers, have acquir'd no leſs a Reputation, than <hi>Empedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, Anaxagoras,</hi> or <hi>Zeno</hi>; And <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, Salmaſius,</hi> Mr. <hi>Mede,</hi> Dr. <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> and ſome other Critical Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounders of difficult Texts of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, have thereby got as much Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, as <hi>Fracaſtorius</hi> by his Book <hi>De Sympathia &amp; Antipathia; Levinus Lemnius</hi> by his <hi>De Occultis rerum Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculis</hi>; or <hi>Cardanus</hi> (and his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary <hi>Scaliger</hi>) by what they writ <hi>De Subtilitate</hi>; or even <hi>Fernelius</hi> himſelf by his Book <hi>De Abditis Rerum Cauſis.</hi> And it will contribute to the Credit which Theological Diſcoveries and Illuſtrations may procure a Man, that
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:93740:128"/>
the Importance of the Subjects, and the earneſtneſs wherewith men are wont to buſie themſelves about them, ſome upon the ſcore of Piety, and others upon that of Intereſt, ſome to Learn Truths, and others to Defend what they have long or publickly taught for Truth, does make greater numbers of Men take notice of ſuch Matters, and concern themſelves far more about them, than about almoſt any other things, and eſpecially far more, than about matters purely Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical, which but few are wont to think themſelves fit to judge of, and concern'd to trouble themſelves about. And accordingly we ſee, that the Writings of <hi>Socinus, Calvin, Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine, Padre Paulo, Arminius, &amp;c.</hi> are more famous, and more ſtudied, than thoſe of <hi>Teleſius, Campanella, Severinus Danus, Magnenus,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other Innovators in Natural Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy. And <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> though a very Learned Phyſician, is much leſs fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for all his Elaborate Diſputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> than for the little Tract againſt particular Forms of Church-Government. And I preſume You have taken notice, as well as I,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:93740:129"/>
that there are ſcarce any Five new Controverſies in all Phyſicks, that are known to, and hotly contended for by ſo many, as are the Five Articles of the <hi>Remonſtrants.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">III. My ſecond Conſideration be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus diſpatch'd, it remains, that I tell you in the Third place, that Suppoſing, but not Granting, that to proſecute the Study of Divinity, one muſt of neceſſity neglect the Acquiſt of Reputation; yet this Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence it ſelf ought not to deter us from the Duty it would diſſwade. For in all Deliberations, wherein any thing is propos'd to be quitted or declin'd, to obey or pleaſe God; me thinks, we may fitly apply that of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet to the Jewiſh King, who being perſwaded (to expreſs his Concern for God's Glory) to decline the Aſſiſtance of an Idolatrous Army of <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and objecting, that by complying with the Advice given Him, he ſhould loſe a Sum of Money, amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to no leſs than the Hire of a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Army; receiv'd from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet this brisk, but rational, Anſwer, <hi>The Lord is able to give thee far more than this.</hi>

The loſs of an Advantage, and much more the bare miſſing of it, being uſually but a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative Affliction, in compariſon of the Actual ſufferance of Evil. Chriſt did not onely tell his Diſciples, that He who ſhould give the leaſt of his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers ſo much as a cup of cold water upon the ſcore of their relation to Him, ſhould not be unrewarded; but when the ſame perſons asked Him,

                  <head>The Concluſion.</head>
                  <p>BY this time, Sir, I have ſaid as much as I think <hi>fit</hi> (and therefore, I hope, more than upon your ſingle account was <hi>neceſſary</hi>) to manifeſt, that <hi>Phyſeophilus</hi> had no juſt cauſe to undervalue the ſtudy of Divinity, nor our Friend the Doctor, for addicting himſelf to it. I hope you have not forgotten what I expreſsly enough de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd at the beginning of this Letter, That both your Friend and you ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the holy Scriptures, I knew my ſelf thereby to be warranted to draw Proofs from their Authority. And if I need not remind you of this, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps I need not tell you by way of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, that I am not ſo unacquainted with the Laws of Diſcourſing, but that, if I had been to argue with <hi>Atheiſts</hi> or <hi>Scepticks,</hi> I ſhould have forborn to make uſe of divers of the Arguments I have imploy'd, as fetch'd from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceded Topicks, and ſubſtituted others for ſuch as yet I think it very allowable for me to urge, when I deal
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:93740:132"/>
with a Perſon, that, as your Friend does onely <hi>undervalue the ſtudy</hi> of the Scriptures, <hi>not reject their Authority.</hi> And if the prolixity I have been guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of already did forbid me to increaſe it by Apologies not abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, I ſhould perchance rather think my ſelf obliged to excuſe the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Style of this Diſcourſe; which both upon the Subject's ſcore, and yours, may ſeem to challenge a richer Dreſs. But the matter is very ſerious, and you are a Philoſopher, and when the things we treat of are highly important, I think Truths clearly made out to be the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſive pieces of Oratory. And a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of this Nature is more likely to prove Effectual on Intelligent Peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers, by having the Reaſons it preſents perſpicuouſly propos'd, and unpreju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic'dly entertain'd, than by their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pathetically urg'd, or curiouſly adorn'd. And I have the rather for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born expreſſions that might ſeem more proper to <hi>move</hi> than to <hi>convince</hi>; becauſe I foreſee, I may very ſhortly have occaſion to employ ſome of the former ſort in another Letter to a Friend of yours and mine, who will, I
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:93740:132"/>
doubt, make you a ſharer in the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of reading it. But writing this for you and <hi>Phyſeophilus,</hi> I was far more ſollicitous to give the Arguments I imploy a good temper, than a bright gloſs. For even when we would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite Devotion, if it be in rational men, the moſt effectual pieces of Oratory are thoſe, which like Burning-glaſſes inflame by nothing but numerous and united Beams of Light. If this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter prove ſo happy as to give you <hi>any</hi> ſatisfaction, it will thereby bring me a <hi>great</hi> one. For prizing you as I do, I cannot but wiſh to ſee you Eſteem thoſe things now, which I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent we ſhall always have cauſe to eſteem; and then moſt, when the Light of Glory ſhall have made us better Judges of the true worth of things. And it would extremely trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble me to ſee you a Diſeſteemer of thoſe Divine things, which as long as a man undervalues, the Poſſeſſion of Heaven it ſelf would not make him happy. And therefore, if the Bleſſing of Him whoſe Glory is aim'd at in it, make the Succeſs of this Paper an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the Wiſhes, the Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:93740:133"/>

But, ſince your deſires confine me to deliver in few words, not what I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve reſolvedly, but what I think may be probably ſaid for the Prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence or the Preeminence of the

                     <hi>Corpuſcular</hi> Philoſophy above <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotles,</hi> or that of the <hi>Chymiſts,</hi> you muſt be content to receive from me, without any Preamble, or exact Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, or ample Diſcourſes, or any other thing that may coſt many words, a ſuccinct mention of ſome of the chief Advantages of the <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis</hi> we incline to. And I the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther comply, on this occaſion, with your Curioſity, becauſe I have often obſerv'd you to be allarm'd and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted, when you hear of any Book that pretends to uphold, or repair the decaying Philoſophy of the Schools, or ſome bold Chymiſt, that arrogates to thoſe of his Sect the Title of Philoſophers, and pretends to build wholly upon Experience, to which he would have all other Naturaliſts thought ſtrangers. That therefore you may not be ſo tempted to deſpond, by the Confidence or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of thoſe Writers, that do ſome of them applaud, and others cenſure, what, I fear, they do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, (as when the Peripateticks cry up, <hi>Subſtantial Forms,</hi> and the Chymiſts, <hi>Mechanical Explications</hi>) of Nature's <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93740:137"/>
ſome Conſiderations, that, I hope, will not onely keep you kind to the Philoſophy you have embrac'd, but perhaps, (by ſome Conſiderations which you have not yet met with,) make you think it probable, that the new Attempts you hear of from time to time, will not overthrow the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcularian Philoſophy,</hi> but either be foiled by it, or found reconcilable to it.</p>
                  <p>But when I ſpeak of the <hi>Corpuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular</hi> or <hi>Mechanical</hi> Philoſophy, I am far from meaning with the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureans,</hi> that <hi>Atoms,</hi> meeting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by chance in an infinite <hi>Vacuum,</hi> are able of themſelves to produce the World, and all its Phaenomena; nor with ſome Modern Philoſophers, that, ſuppoſing God to have put into the whole Maſs of Matter ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>variable quantity of Motion, he needed do no more to make the World, the material parts being able by their own unguided Motions, to caſt themſelves into ſuch a Syſtem (as we call by that name); But I plead onely for ſuch a Philoſophy, as reaches but to things purely Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal, and diſtinguiſhing between
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93740:138"/>
the firſt <hi>original of things,</hi> and the ſubſequent <hi>courſe of Nature,</hi> teaches, concerning the <hi>former,</hi> not onely that God gave Motion to Matter, but that in the beginning He ſo guided the various Motions of the parts of it, as to contrive them into the World he deſign'd they ſhould compoſe, (furniſh'd with the <hi>Seminal</hi> Principles and Structures or Models of Living Creatures,) and eſtabliſh'd thoſe <hi>Rules of Motion,</hi> and that order amongſt things Corporeal, which we are wont to call the <hi>Laws of Nature.</hi> And having told this as to the <hi>former,</hi> it may be allowed as to the <hi>latter</hi> to teach, That the Univerſe being once fram'd by God, and the Laws of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being ſetled and all upheld by His inceſſant concourſe and general Providence; the Phaenomena of the World thus conſtituted, are Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally produc'd by the Mechanical affections of the parts of Matter, and what they operate upon one another according to Me<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:93740:138"/>I. The <hi>firſt</hi> thing that I ſhall men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to this purpoſe, is the Intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs or Clearneſs of Mechanical Principles and Explications. I need not tell you, that among the <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pateticks,</hi> the Diſputes are many and intricate about <hi>Matter, Privation, Subſtantial Forms,</hi> and their <hi>Educti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> &amp;c. And the <hi>Chymiſts</hi> are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently puzled, (as I have elſewhere ſhewn,) to give ſuch definitions and accounts of their Hypoſtatical Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, as are reconcileable to one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and even to ſome obvious <hi>Phaenomena.</hi> And much more dark and intricate are their Doctrines about the <hi>Archeus, Aſtral Beings, Gas, Blaſs,</hi> and other odd Notions, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps have in part occaſion'd the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ambiguity of their expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, that could not be very clear, when their Conceptions were far from being ſo. And if the Principles of the <hi>Ariſtotelians</hi> and <hi>Spagyriſts</hi> are thus obſcure, 'tis not to be expected, the Explications that are made by the help onely of ſuch Principles ſhould be clear. And indeed many of them are either ſo general and ſlight, or otherwiſe ſo unſatisfactory, that grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93740:139"/>
their Principles, 'tis very hard to underſtand or admit their applications of them to particular <hi>Phaenomena.</hi> And even in ſome of the more ingenious and ſubtle of the <hi>Peripatetick</hi> Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes upon their ſuperficial and narrow Theories, me thinks, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors have better plaid the part of <hi>Painters</hi> than <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> and have onely had the skill, like Drawers of Landskips, to make men fancy, they ſee Caſtles and Towns, and other Structures that appear ſolid and magnificent, and to reach to a large extent, when the whole Piece is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial, and made up of Colours and Art, and compris'd within a Frame perhaps ſcarce a yard long. But to come now to the <hi>Corpuſcular</hi> Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, men do ſo eaſily underſtand one anothers meaning, when they talk of <hi>Local Motion, Reſt, Bigneſs, Shape, Order, Situation,</hi> and <hi>Contexture</hi> of Material Subſtances; and theſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples do afford ſuch clear accounts of thoſe things, that are rightly deduc'd from them onely, that even thoſe <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripateticks</hi> or <hi>Chymiſts,</hi> that maintain other Principles, acquieſce in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications made by theſe, when they
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93740:139"/>
can be had, and ſeek not any further, though perhaps the effect be ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable, as would make it paſs for that of a hidden Form, or Occult Quality. Thoſe very <hi>Ariſtotelians,</hi> that believe the Celeſtial Bodies to be mov'd by Intelligences, have no recourſe to any peculiar agency of theirs to account for <hi>Eclipſes.</hi> And we laugh at thoſe <hi>Eaſt-Indians,</hi> that, to this day, go out in multitudes, with ſome Inſtruments that may relieve the diſtreſſed Luminary, whoſe loſs of Light they fancy to proceed from ſome fainting fit, out of which it muſt be rouz'd. For no Intelligent man, whether <hi>Chymiſt</hi> or <hi>Peripatetic,</hi> flies to his peculiar Principles, after he is informed, that the Moon is E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſed by the interpoſition of the Earth betwixt her and it, and the Sun by that of the Moon betwixt him and the Earth. And when we ſee the Image of a Man caſt into the Air by a Concave Spherical Looking-glaſs, though moſt men are amaz'd at it, and ſome ſuſpect it to be no leſs than an effect of Witchcraft, yet he that is skill'd enough in <hi>Catoptricks,</hi> will, without conſulting <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> or <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racelſus,</hi>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:93740:140"/>
or flying to Hypoſtatical Principles and Subſtantial Forms, be ſatisfied, that the <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd by the beams of Light reflected, and thereby made convergent accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Optical, and conſequently Mathematical Laws.</p>
                  <p>But I muſt not now repeat what I elſewhere ſay, to ſhew, that the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcular Principles have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd by Philoſophers of different Sects, not becauſe they think not our Explications clear, if not much more ſo, than their own; but becauſe they imagine, that the applications of them can be made but to few things, and conſequently are inſufficient.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. In the next place I obſerve, that there cannot be <hi>fewer</hi> Principles than the two grand ones of Mechanical Philoſophy, <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Motion.</hi> For, Matter alone, unleſs it be moved, is altogether unactive; and whilſt all the parts of a Body continue in one ſtate without any Motion at all, that Body will not exerciſe any action, nor ſuffer any alteration it ſelf, though it may perhaps modifie the action of other Bodies that move againſt it.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. Nor can we conceive any Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:93740:140"/>
more <hi>primary,</hi> than <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Motion.</hi> For, either both of them were immediately created by God, or, (to add that for their ſakes that would have Matter to be unproduc'd,) if <hi>Matter</hi> be eternal, <hi>Motion</hi> muſt either be produc'd by ſome Immaterial Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural Agent, or it muſt imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately flow by way of Emanation from the nature of the matter it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertains to.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. Neither can there be any Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical Principles more <hi>ſimple</hi> than Matter and Motion; neither of them being reſoluble into any things, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it may be truly, or ſo much as to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerably, ſaid to be compounded.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. The next thing I ſhall name to recommend the Corpuſcular Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, is their great Comprehenſiveneſs. I conſider then, that the genuine and neceſſary effect of the ſufficiently ſtrong Motion of one part of Matter againſt another, is, <hi>either</hi> to drive it on in its intire bulk, <hi>or</hi> elſe to break or divide it into particles of determinate <hi>Motion, Figure, Size, Poſture, Reſt, Order,</hi> or <hi>Texture.</hi> The two firſt of theſe, for <hi>inſtance,</hi> are each of them capable of numerous varieties. For
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:93740:141"/>
the <hi>Figure</hi> of a portion of Matter may <hi>either</hi> be one of the five Regular Figures treated of by Geometricians, or ſome determinate <hi>Species</hi> of ſolid Figures, as that of a <hi>Cone, Cylinder,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>or</hi> Irregular, though not perhaps Anonymous, as the Grains of Sand, Hoops, Feathers, Branches, Forks, Files, &amp;c. And as the <hi>Figure,</hi> ſo the <hi>Motion</hi> of one of theſe particles may be exceedingly diverſified, not onely by the determination to this or that part of the world, but by ſeveral other things, as particularly by the almoſt infinitely varying degrees of Celerity, by the manner of its progreſſion with, or without, Rotation, and other modifying Circumſtances; and more yet by the Line wherein it moves, as (beſides Streight) Circular, Elli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptical, Parabolical, Hyperbolical, Spiral, and I know not how many others. For, <hi>as</hi> later Geometricians have ſhewn, that thoſe crooked Lines may be compounded of ſeveral Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, (that is, trac'd by a Body whoſe motion is mixt of, and reſults from, two or more ſimpler Motions,) <hi>ſo</hi> how many more curves may, or rather may not be made by new Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:93740:141"/>
and Decompoſitions of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is no eaſie task to determine.</p>
                  <p>Now, ſince a <hi>ſingle</hi> particle of Matter, by vertue of two onely of the Mechanical affections, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to it, be diverſifiable ſo many ways; how vaſt a number of varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may we ſuppoſe capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing produc'd by the Compoſitions and Decompoſitions of <hi>Myriads</hi> of ſingle inviſible Corpuſcles, that may be contained and contex'd in one ſmall Body, and each of them be imbued with more than two or three of the fertile Catholick Principles above mention'd? Eſpecially ſince the aggregate of thoſe Corpuſcles may be farther diverſifi'd by the <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xture</hi> reſulting from their Convention into a Body, which, as ſo made up, has its own Bigneſs, and Shape, and Pores, (perhaps very many, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious) and has alſo many capacities of acting and ſuffering upon the ſcore of the place it holds among other Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies in a World conſtituted as ours is: So that, when I conſider the almoſt innumerable diverſifications, that Compoſitions and Decompoſitions may make of a ſmall number, not
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:93740:142"/>
perhaps exceeding twenty of diſtinct things, I am apt to look upon thoſe, who think the Mechanical Principles may ſerve indeed to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of this or that particular part of Natural Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, as <hi>Staticks, Hydrostaticks,</hi> the <hi>Theory of the Planetary Motions,</hi> &amp;c. but can never be applied to all the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of things Corporeal; I am apt, I <hi>ſay,</hi> to look upon thoſe, otherwiſe Learned, men, as I would do upon him, that ſhould affirm, that by putting together the Letters of the <hi>Alphabet,</hi> one may indeed make up all the words to be found in one Book, as in <hi>Euclid,</hi> or <hi>Virgil</hi>; or in one Language, as <hi>Latine,</hi> or <hi>Engliſh</hi>; but that they can by no means ſuffice to ſupply words to all the Books of a great Library, much leſs to all the Languages in the world.</p>
                  <p>And whereas there is another ſort of Philoſophers, that, obſerving the great efficacy of the bigneſs, and ſhape, and ſituation, and motion, and connexion in Engines, are willing to allow, that thoſe Mechanical Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples may have a great ſtroke in the Operations of Bodies of a ſenſible
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:93740:142"/>
bulk, and manifeſt Mechaniſm, and therefore may be uſefully imploy'd in accounting for the effects and Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena of ſuch Bodies, who yet will not admit, that theſe Principles can be apply'd to the hidden Tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that paſs among the minute Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Bodies; and therefore think it neceſſary to refer theſe to what they call <hi>Nature, Subſtantial Forms, Real Qualities</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the like Un-mechanical Principles and Agents.</p>
                  <p>But this is not neceſſary; for, both the Mechanical affections of Matter are to be found, and the Laws of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion take place, not onely in the great Maſſes, and the middle-ſiz'd Lumps, but in the ſmalleſt Fragments of Matter; and a leſſer portion of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as well a Body as a greater, muſt, as neceſſarily as it, have its determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Bulk and Figure: And he that looks upon Sand in a good Microſcope, will eaſily perceive, that each minute Grain of it has as well its own ſize and ſhape, as a Rock or Mountain. And when we let fall a great ſtone and a pibble from the top of a high Building, we find not but that the latter as well as the former moves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formably
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:93740:143"/>
to the Laws of accelera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in heavy Bodies deſcending. And the Rules of Motion are obſerv'd, not onely in Canon Bullets, but in Small Shot; and the one ſtrikes down a Bird according to the ſame Laws, that the other batters down a Wall. And though <hi>Nature</hi> (or rather its Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Author) be wont to work with much finer materials, and employ more curious contrivances than <hi>Art,</hi> (whence the Structure even of the rareſt Watch is incomparably inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to that of a Humane Body;) yet an Artiſt himſelf, according to the quantity of the matter he imploys, the exigency of the deſign he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes, and the bigneſs and ſhape of the Inſtruments he makes uſe of, is able to make pieces of work of the ſame nature or kind of extremely differing bulk, where yet the like, though not equal, Art and Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, and oftentimes Motion too, may be obſerv'd: As a Smith, who with a Hammer, and other large In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, can, out of maſſes of Iron, forge great Bars or Wedges, and make thoſe ſtrong and heavy Chains that were imploy'd to load Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:93740:143"/>
and even to ſecure Streets and Gates, may, with leſſer Inſtruments, make ſmaller Nails and Filings, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as minute as Duſt; and may yet, with finer Tools, make Links of a ſtrange Slenderneſs and Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, inſomuch that good Authors tell us of a Chain of divers Links that was faſtned to a Flea, and could be mov'd by it; and, if I mis-remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber not, I ſaw ſomething like this, beſides other Inſtances that I beheld with pleaſure of the Littleneſs that Art can give to ſuch pieces of Work, as are uſually made of a conſiderable bigneſs. And therefore to ſay, that, though in Natural Bodies, whoſe bulk is manifeſt and their ſtructure viſible, the Mechanical Principles may be uſefully admitted, that are not to be extended to ſuch portions of Matter, whoſe parts and Texture are inviſible; may perhaps look to ſome, as if a man ſhould allow, that the Laws of Mechaniſm may take place in a Town-Clock; but cannot in a Pocket-Watch; or (to give you an inſtance, mixt of Natural and Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial,) as if, becauſe the Terraqueous Globe is a vaſt Magnetical Body of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:93740:144"/>
ſeven or eight thouſand miles in Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter, one ſhould affirm, that Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netical Laws are not to be expected to be of force in a ſpherical piece of Loadſtone that is not perhaps an inch long: And yet Experience ſhews us, that notwithſtanding the ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable diſproportion betwixt theſe two Globes, the <hi>Terrella,</hi> as well as the <hi>Earth,</hi> hath its Poles, Aequator, and Meridians, and in divers other Magnetical Properties, emulates the Terreſtrial Globe.</p>
                  <p>They that, to ſolve the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Nature, have recourſe to Agents which, though they involve no ſelf-repugnancy in their very Notions, as many of the Judicious think <hi>Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Forms</hi> and <hi>Real Qualities</hi> to do; yet are ſuch that we conceive not, how they operate to bring effects to paſs: Theſe, I ſay, when they tell us of ſuch indeterminate Agents, as the <hi>Soul of the World,</hi> the <hi>Univerſal Spirit,</hi> the <hi>Plaſtic Power,</hi> and the like; though they may in certain caſes tell us ſome things, yet they tell us no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that will ſatisfie the Curioſity of an Inquiſitive Perſon, who ſeeks not ſo much to know, what is the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:93740:144"/>
                     <hi>general</hi> Agent, that produces a <hi>Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomenon,</hi> as, <hi>by what Means,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>what Manner,</hi> the <hi>Phenomenon</hi> is produc'd. The famous <hi>Senner<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>us,</hi> and ſome other Learned Phyſicians, tell us of Diſeaſes which proceed from Incantation; but ſure 'tis but a very ſlight account, that a ſober Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, that comes to viſit a Patient reported to be bewitch'd, receives of the ſtrange Symptoms he meets with, and would have an account of, if he be coldly anſwer'd, That 'tis a Witch or the Devil that produces them; and he will never ſit down with ſo ſhort an account, if he can by any means reduce thoſe extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Symptoms to any more known and ſtated Diſeaſes, as <hi>Epilepſies, Convulſions, Hyſterical Fits,</hi> &amp;c. and, if he can not, he will confeſs his knowledge of this Diſtemper to come far ſhort of what might be expected and attain'd in other Diſeaſes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he thinks himſelf bound to ſearch into the Nature of the Morbific Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and will not be ſatisfi'd till he can, probably at leaſt, deduce from that, and the ſtructure of an Humane Body, and other concurring Phyſical
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:93740:145"/>
Cauſes, the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady. And it would be but little ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to one, that deſires to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the cauſes of what occurrs to obſervation in a Watch, and how it comes to point at, and ſtrike, the hours, to be told, That 'twas ſuch a Watch-maker that ſo contriv'd it: Or to him that would know the true cauſe of an <hi>Eccho,</hi> to be anſwer'd, That 'tis a Man, a Vault, or a Wood that makes it.</p>
                  <p>And now at length I come to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that which I obſerve the moſt to alienate other Sects from the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical Philoſophy; namely, that they think it pretends to have Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples ſo Univerſal and ſo Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, that no other Phyſical Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis can comport with it, or be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated by it.</p>
                  <p>But this I look upon as an eaſie indeed, but an important, miſtake; becauſe by this very thing, that the Mechanical Principles are ſo univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, and therefore applicable to ſo many things, they are rather fitted to <hi>include,</hi> than neceſſitated to <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,</hi> any other Hypotheſis that is founded in Nature, as far as it is ſo.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:93740:145"/>
And ſuch <hi>Hypotheſes,</hi> if prudently conſider'd by a skilful and moderate perſon, who is rather diſpos'd to unite Sects than multiply them, will be found, as far as they have Truth in them, to be either Legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately, (though perhaps not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately,) deducible from the Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Principles, or fairly reconcilable to them. For, ſuch Hypotheſes will probably attempt to account for the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Nature, <hi>either</hi> by the help of a determinate number of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Ingredients, ſuch as the <hi>Tria Prima</hi> of the Chymiſts, by participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof other Bodies obtain their Qualities; <hi>or</hi> elſe by intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing ſome general Agents, as the <hi>Platonic Soul of the World,</hi> or the <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Spirit,</hi> aſſerted by ſome Spagy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſts; <hi>or</hi> by both theſe ways together.</p>
                  <p>Now to diſpatch <hi>firſt</hi> thoſe, that I named in the ſecond place; I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that the chief thing, that Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Naturaliſts ſhould look after in the explicating of difficult <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> is not ſo much what the <hi>Agent</hi> is or does, as, what changes are made in the <hi>Patient,</hi> to bring it to exhibit the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> that are propos'd; and by
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:93740:146"/>
what means, and after what manner, thoſe changes are effected. So that the <hi>Mechanical</hi> Philoſopher being ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, that one part of Matter can act upon another but by vertue of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Motion, or the effects and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of Local Motion, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders, that <hi>as,</hi> if the propos'd Agent be not Intelligible and Phyſical, it can never Phyſically <hi>explain</hi> the <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena; ſo,</hi> if it be Intelligible and Phyſical, 'twill be reducible to <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and ſome or other of thoſe onely Catholick affections of Matter, alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy often mentioned. And, the inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite diviſibility of Matter, the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful efficacy of Motion, and the almoſt infinite variety of Coalitions and Structures, that may be made of minute and inſenſible Corpuſcles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing duly weighed, I ſee not why a Philoſopher ſhould think it impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to make out by their help the Mechanical poſſibility of any corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Agent, how ſubtil, or diffus'd, or active ſoever it be, that can be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidly proved to be really exiſtent in Nature, by what name ſoever it be call'd or diſguis'd. And though the <hi>Carteſians</hi> be Mechanical Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:93740:146"/>
yet, according to them, their <hi>Materia Subtilis,</hi> which the very name declares to be a corporeal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, is, for ought I know, little (if it be at all) leſs diffus'd through the Univerſe, or leſs active in it than the Univerſal Spirit of ſome Spagyriſts, not to ſay, the <hi>Anima Mundi</hi> of the Platoniſts. But this upon the by; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which I proceed, and ſhall venture to add, That whatever be the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical Agent, whether it be inanimate or living, purely Corporeal, or united to an Intellectual Subſtance, the above mention'd changes, that are wrought in the Body that is made to exhibit the Phaenomena, may be effected by the ſame or the like means, or after the ſame or the like manner; as, <hi>for inſtance,</hi> if Corn be reduc'd to Meal, the Materials and ſhape of the Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones, and their peculiar Motion and Adaptation, will be much of the ſame kind, and (though they ſhould not, yet) to be ſure the grains of Corn will ſuffer a various contrition and comminution in their paſſage to the form of Meal; whether the Corn be ground by a Water-mill, or a Wind-mill, or a Horſe-mill, or a
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:93740:147"/>
Hand-mill; that is, by a Mill whoſe Stones are turned by Inanimate, by Brute, or by Rational, Agents. And, if an Angel himſelf ſhould work a real change in the nature of a Body, 'tis ſcarce conceivable to us Men, how he could do it without the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Local Motion; ſince, if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing were diſplac'd or otherwiſe mov'd than before, (the like hapning alſo to all external Bodies to which it related,) 'tis hardly conceivable, how it ſhould be in it ſelf other, than juſt what it was before.</p>
                  <p>But to come now to the other ſort of Hypotheſes formerly mention'd; if the <hi>Chymists,</hi> or others that would deduce a compleat Natural Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy from <hi>Salt, Sulphur,</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> or any other ſet number of Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents of things, would well conſider what they undertake, they might eaſily diſcover, <hi>That</hi> the material parts of Bodies, as ſuch, can reach but to a ſmall part of the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whilſt theſe Ingredients are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd but as Quieſcent things, and therefore they would find themſelves neceſſitated to ſuppoſe them to be active; and <hi>That</hi> things purely Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:93740:147"/>
cannot be but by means of Local Motion, and the effects that may reſult from that, accompanying variouſly ſhap'd, ſiz'd, and aggrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted parts of Matter: So that the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts and other Materialiſts, (if I may ſo call them,) muſt (as indeed they are wont to do) leave the greateſt part of the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe unexplicated by the help of the Ingredients, (be they fewer or more than three,) of Bodies, without ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in the Mechanical and more comprehenſive affections of Matter, eſpecially Local Motion. I willingly grant, that <hi>Salt, Sulphur,</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> or ſome Subſtances analogous to them, are to be obtain'd by the action of the Fire, from a very great many diſſipable Bodies here below; nor would I deny, that, in explicating di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of ſuch Bodies, it may be of uſe to a skilful Natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt to know and conſider, that this or that Ingredient, as Sulphur, <hi>for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi> does abound in the Body pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſ'd, whence it may be probably argu'd, that the Qualities, that uſually accompany that Principle when Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant, may be alſo, upon its ſcore,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:93740:148"/>
found in the Body that ſo plentifully partakes of it. But not to mention, what I have elſewhere ſhown, that there are many <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> to whoſe explication this knowledge will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute very little or nothing at all; I ſhall onely he<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e obſerve, that, though Chymical Explications be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the moſt obvious and ready, yet they are not the moſt fundamental and ſatisfactory: For, the Chymical Ingredient it ſelf, whether Sulphur or any other, muſt owe its nature and other qualities to the union of inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible particles in a convenient Size, Shape, Motion or Reſt, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texture; all which are but Mechani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Affections of convening Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles. And this may be illuſtrated by what happens in Artificial Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works. For, though in moſt of thoſe many differing ſorts that are made either for the uſe of War, or for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation, Gunpowder be a main In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient, and divers of the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> may be deriv'd from the greater or leſſer meaſure, wherein the Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions partake of it; yet, beſides that there may be Fire-works made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Gun-powder, (as appears by thoſe
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:93740:148"/>
made of old by the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>) Gun-powder it ſelf owes its aptneſs to be fir'd and exploded to the Mechanical Contexture of more ſimple portions of Matter, <hi>Nitre, Charcoal,</hi> and <hi>Sulphur</hi>; and Sulphur it ſelf, though it be by many Chymiſts miſtaken for an Hypoſtatical Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, owes its Inflammability to the convention of yet more ſimple and primary Corpuſcles; ſince Chymiſts confeſs, that it has an inflammable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient, and experience ſhews, that it very much abounds with an acid and uninflammable Salt, and is not quite devoide of Terreſtreity. I know, it may be here alledg'd, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of Chymical Analyſes are ſimple Bodies, and upon that account irreſoluble. But, that divers Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, which Chymiſts are pleaſed to call the <hi>Salts,</hi> or <hi>Sulphurs,</hi> or <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curies</hi> of the Bodies that afforded them, are not ſimple and homogene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, has elſewhere been ſufficiently proved; nor is their not being eaſily diſſipable or reſoluble a clear proof of their not being made up of more pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive portions of matter. For, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded and even decompounded
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:93740:149"/>
Bodies, may be as difficultly reſoluble, as moſt of thoſe that Chymiſts ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain by what they call their <hi>Analyſis</hi> by the Fire; witneſs common green Glaſs, which is far more durable and irreſoluble than many of thoſe that paſs for Hypoſtatical Subſtances. And we ſee, that ſome <hi>Amels</hi> will be ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times even vitrified in the Fire, without loſing their Nature, or often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſo much as their colour; and yet <hi>Amel</hi> is manifeſtly not onely a compounded, but a decompounded Body, conſiſting of Salt and Powder of Pebbles or Sand, and calcin'd Tinn, and, if the <hi>Amel</hi> be not white, uſually of ſome tinging Metall or Mineral. But how indeſtructible ſoever the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Principles be ſuppos'd, divers of the Operations aſcrib'd to them will never be well made out, without the help of Local Motion, (and that diverſified too;) without which, we can little better give an account of the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of many Bodies, by know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what Ingredients compoſe them, than we can explain the Operations of a Watch, by knowing of how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and of what Metalls the Balance, the Wheels, the Chain, and other
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:93740:149"/>
parts, are made; or than we can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive the Operations of a Wind-mill from the bare knowledge, that 'tis made up of Wood, and Stone; and Canvas, and Iron. And here let me add, that 'twould not at all overthrow the Corpuſcularian Hypotheſis, though either by more exquiſite Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifications, or by ſome other Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons than the uſual <hi>Analyſis</hi> of the Fire, it ſhould be made appear, that the Material Principles or Elements of mixt Bodies ſhould not be the <hi>Tria Prima</hi> of the vulgar Chymiſts, but either Subſtances of another nature, or elſe fewer, or more in number; as would be, if that were true, which ſome Spagyriſts affirm, (but I could never find,) that from all ſorts of mixt Bodies, five, and but five, differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſimilar Subſtances can be ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: Or, as if it were true, that the <hi>Helmontians</hi> had ſuch a reſolving Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruum as the <hi>Alkaheſt</hi> of their Maſter, by which he affirms, that he could reduce Stones into Salt of the ſame weight with the Mineral, and bring both that Salt and all other kind of mixt and tangible Bodies into inſipid Water. For, what ever be the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>number
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:93740:150"/>
or qualities of the Chymical Principles, if they be really exiſtent in Nature, it may very poſſibly be ſhewn, that they may be made up of inſenſible Corpuſcles of determinate bulks and ſhapes; and by the various Coalitions and Contextures of ſuch Corpuſcles, <hi>not onely</hi> three or five, <hi>but</hi> many more material Ingredients, may be compos'd or made to reſult: But, though the <hi>Alkaheſtical</hi> Redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions newly mention'd ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, yet the Mechanical Principles might well be accommodated, even to them. For, the Solidity, Taſte, &amp;c. of Salt, may be fairly accounted for, by the Stifneſs, Sharpneſs, and other Mechanical Affections of the minute Particles, whereof Salts conſiſt; and if, by a farther action of the <hi>Alkaheſt,</hi> the Salt or any other ſolid Body, be reduc'd into inſipid Water, this alſo may be explicated by the ſame Principles, ſuppoſing a further Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution of the parts, and ſuch an attrition, as wears off the edges and points that inabled them to ſtrike briskly the Organ of Taſte: For, as to Fluidity and Firmneſs, thoſe mainly depend upon two of our grand Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:93740:150"/>
                     <hi>Motion</hi> and <hi>Reſt.</hi> And I have elſe-where ſhewn, by ſeveral proofs, that the Agitation or Reſt, and the looſer contact, or cloſer cohaeſion, of the particles, is able to make the ſame portion of Matter, at one time a firm, and at another time, a fluid Body. So that, though the further Sagacity and Induſtry of Chymiſts (which I would by no means diſcourage) ſhould be able to obtain from mixt Bodies homogeneous ſubſtances differing in number, or nature, or both, from their vulgar Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury; yet the Corpuſcular Philoſophy is ſo <hi>general</hi> and <hi>fertile,</hi> as to be fairly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilable to ſuch a Diſcovery; and alſo ſo <hi>uſeful,</hi> that theſe new material Principles will, as well as the old <hi>Tria Prima,</hi> ſtand in need of the more Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Principles of the <hi>Corpuſcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> eſpecially Local Motion. And indeed, what ever Elements or Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients men have (that I know of) pitched upon, yet if they take not in the Mechanical Affections of Matter, their Principles have been ſo deficient, that I have uſually obſerv'd, that the Materialiſts, without at all excepting the Chymiſts, do not onely, as I was
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:93740:151"/>
ſaying, leave many things unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d, to which their narrow Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples will not extend; but, even in the particulars they preſume to give an account of, they either content themſelves to aſſign ſuch common and indefinite Cauſes, as are too ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral to ſignifie much towards an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitive mans ſatisfaction; or if they venture to give particular Cauſes, they aſſign precarious or falſe ones, and liable to be eaſily diſproved by Circumſtances, or Inſtances, whereto their Doctrine will not agree, as I have often elſewhere had occaſion to ſhew. And yet the Chymiſts need not be frighted from acknowledging the Prerogative of the Mechanical Philoſophy, ſince that may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable with the Truth of their own Principles, as far as theſe agree with the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> they are apply'd to. For theſe more confind <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> may be ſubordinated to thoſe more general and fertile Principles, and there can be no Ingredient aſſign'd, that has a real exiſtence in Nature, that may not be deriv'd either imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, or by a row of Decompoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, from the Univerſal Matter, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difi'd
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:93740:151"/>
by its Mechanical Affections<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For, if with the ſame Bricks, diverſly put together and rang'd, ſeveral Walls, Houſes, Furnaces, and other Structures, as Vaults, Bridges, Pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mids, &amp;c. may be built, meerely by a various contrivement of parts of the ſame kind; how much more may great variety of Ingredients be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd by, or, according to the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Nature, reſult from, the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious coalitions and contextures of Corpuſcles, that need not be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, like Bricks, all of the ſame, or near the ſame, ſize and ſhape, but may have amongſt them, both of the one and the other, as great a variety as need be wiſh'd for, and indeed a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than can eaſily be ſo much as imagin'd. And the primary and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute Concretions that belong to theſe Ingredients, may, without Oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the Mechanical Philoſophy, be ſuppos'd to have their particles ſo minute and ſtrongly coherent, that Nature of her ſelf does ſcarce ever tear them aſunder; as we ſee, that <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> and <hi>Gold</hi> may be ſucceſſively made to put on a multitude of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſes, and yet ſo retain their nature,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:93740:152"/>
as to be reducible to their priſtine forms. And you know, I lately told you, that common Glaſs and good Amels, though both of them but fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitious Bodies, and not onely mix'd, but decompounded Concretions, have yet their component parts ſo ſtrictly united by the skill of illiterate Trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, as to maintain their union in the vitrifying violence of the Fire. Nor do we find, that common Glaſs will be wrought upon by <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> or <hi>Aqua Regis,</hi> though the former of them will diſſolve <hi>Mercury,</hi> and the later <hi>Gold.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From the fore-going Diſcourſe it may (probably at leaſt) reſult, That if, beſides Rational Souls, there are any Immaterial Subſtances (ſuch as the Heavenly Intelligences, and the Subſtantial Forms of the <hi>Ariſtotelians</hi>) that regularly are to be numbred among Natural Agents, their way of working being unknown to us, they can but help to conſtitute and effect things, but will very little help us to conceive <hi>how</hi> things are effected; ſo that, by what ever Principles Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural things be <hi>constituted,</hi> 'tis by the Mechanical Principles that their <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena</hi>
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:93740:152"/>
muſt be clearly <hi>explicated.</hi> As for inſtance, though we ſhould grant the <hi>Ariſtotelians,</hi> that the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets are made of a quinteſſential mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and moved by Angels, or Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Intelligences; yet, to explain the Stations, Progreſſions, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trogradations, and other <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of the Planets, we muſt have recourſe either to Eccentricks, Epicycles, &amp;c. or to motions made in Elliptical or other peculiar Lines; and, in a word, to Theories, wherein the Motion, and Figure, Scituation, and other Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical or Mechanical Affections of Bodies are mainly employ'd. But if the Principles propos'd be corporeal things, they will be then fairly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible, or Reconcilable, to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical Principles; theſe being ſo general and pregnant, that, among things corporeal, there is nothing <hi>real,</hi> (and I meddle not with <hi>Chymerical</hi> Beings, ſuch as ſome of <hi>Paracelſus</hi>'s,) that may not be deriv'd from, or be brought to, a ſubordination to ſuch comprehenſive Principles. And when the Chymiſts ſhall ſhew, that mix'd Bodies owe their qualities to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominancy of this or that of their
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:93740:153"/>
three grand Ingredients, the <hi>Corpuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularians</hi> will ſhew, that the very Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of this or that Ingredient flow from its peculiar Texture, and the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical affections of the Corpuſcles 'tis made up of. And to affirm, that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Furnaces of Chymiſts afford a great number of uncommon Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions and Phaenomena, there are Bodies or Operations amongſt things purely Corporeal, that cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd from, or reconcil'd to, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive and pregnant Principles of the Mechanical Philoſophy, is, as if, becauſe there are a great number and variety of Anthems, Hymns, Pavins, Threnodies, Courants, Gavots, Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, Sarabands, Jigs, and other (grave and ſprightly) Tunes to be met with in the Books and Practiſes of Muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, one ſhould maintain, that there are in them a great many Tunes, or at leaſt Notes, that have no depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence on the Scale of Muſic; or, as if, becauſe, beſides Rhombuſſes, Rhomboids, Trapeziums, Squares, Pentagons, <hi>Chiliagons, Myriagons,</hi> and innumerable other <hi>Polygons,</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and Irregular, one ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to affirm, that there are among
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:93740:153"/>
them ſome Rectilinear Figures, that are not reducible to Triangles, or have Affections that will overthrow what <hi>Euclid</hi> has taught of <hi>Triangles</hi> and <hi>Polygons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To what has been ſaid, I ſhall add but one thing more; That, <hi>as,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what I formerly intimated, Mechanical Principles and Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are for their clearneſs preferr'd, even by Materialiſts themſelves, to others in the caſes where they can be had; <hi>ſo,</hi> the Sagacity and Induſtry of modern Naturaliſts and Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, having happily apply'd them to ſeueral of thoſe difficult <hi>Phaenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> (in <hi>Hydrostaticks,</hi> the practical part of <hi>Opticks, Gunnery,</hi> &amp;c.) that before were, or might be referr'd to <gap reason="illegible: bleedthrough" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

And on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion let me obſerve, that 'tis not always neceſſary, though it be always deſirable, that he that propounds an <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> in Aſtronomy, Chymiſtry, Anatomy, or other part of Phyſicks,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:93740:154"/>

For, though one man by his ſagacity have found out the right Key, it will be very difficult for him, <hi>either</hi> to prove otherwiſe than by trial, that this or that word is not ſuch as 'tis gheſs'd to be by others according to their Keys; <hi>or</hi> to evince, <hi>à priori,</hi> that theirs are to be rejected, and his to be preferr'd; yet, if due trial being made, the Key he propoſes, ſhall be found ſo agreeable to the Characters of the Letter, as to enable one to underſtand them, and make a coherent ſenſe of them, its ſuitableneſs to what it ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipher,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:93740:154"/>
is, without either confutations, or extraneous poſitive proofs, ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to make it be accepted as the right Key of that Cypher. And ſo, in Phyſical <hi>Hypotheſes,</hi> there are ſome, that, without noiſe, or falling foul upon others, peaceably obtain diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning mens approbation onely by their fitneſs to ſolve the <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> for which they were devis'd, without croſſing any known Obſervation or Law of Nature. And therefore, if the Mechanical Philoſophy go on to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate things Corporeal at the rate it has of late years proceeded at, 'tis ſcarce to be doubted, but that in time unprejudic'd perſons will think it ſufficiently recommended by its conſiſtency with it ſelf, and its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicableneſs to ſo many Phenomena of Nature.</p>

                  <p>PErceiving, upon a review, of the foregoing Paper, that the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and importance of the Subject, has ſeduc'd me to ſpend many more words about it that I at firſt deſign'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> twill not now be amiſs to give you this ſhort Summary of what came into my mind to recommend to you the <hi>Mechanical Pheloſophy,</hi> and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate your fears of ſeeing it ſupplant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; having firſt premis'd once for all, that preſuppoſing the Creation and general Providence of God, I pretend to treat but of things <hi>Corporeal,</hi> and do abſtract in this Paper from <hi>Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Beings,</hi> (which otherwiſe I very willingly admit,) and all Agents and Operations Miraculous or Superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. Of the Principles of things Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal, none can be more <hi>few,</hi> without being inſufficient, or more <hi>primary</hi> than <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Motion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">II. The natural and genuine effect of variouſly determin'd <hi>Motion</hi> in por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:93740:155"/>
of <hi>Matter,</hi> is, to divide it into parts of differing ſizes, and ſhapes, and to put them into different Motions, and the Conſequences, that flow from theſe, in a World fram'd as ours is, are, as to the ſeparate fragments, poſture, order, and ſituation, and, as to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions of many of them, peculiar Compoſitions and Contextures.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. The parts of Matter endow'd with theſe Catholick affections are by various aſſociations reduc'd to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Bodies of ſeveral kinds, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the plenty of the Matter, and the various Compoſitions and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſitions of the Principles; which all ſuppoſe the common matter they diverſifie: And theſe ſeveral kinds of Bodies, by vertue of their Motion, Reſt, and other Mechanical Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which fit them to act on, and ſuffer from, one another, become in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow'd with ſeveral kinds of Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, (whereof ſome are call'd Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, and ſome Occult,) and thoſe that act upon the peculiarly fram'd Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans of Senſe, whoſe Perceptions by the Animadverſive faculty of the Soul are Senſations.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. Theſe Principles, <hi>Matter, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
                     <pb n="40" facs="tcp:93740:156"/>
(to which <hi>Reſt</hi> is related) <hi>Big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Shape, Poſture, Order, Texture,</hi> being ſo ſimple, clear, and <hi>comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive,</hi> are applicable to all the real <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena</hi> of Nature, which ſeem not explicable by any other not conſiſtent with ours. For, if recourſe be had to an Immaterial Principle or Agent, it may be ſuch an one, as is not intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible; and however it will not enable us to <hi>explain</hi> the <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> becauſe its <hi>way</hi> of working upon things Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial would probably be more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to be Phyſically made out, than a Mechanical account of the <hi>Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena.</hi> And, notwithſtanding the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>materiality of a <hi>created</hi> Agent, we cannot conceive, how it ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce changes in a Body, without the help of Mechanical Principles, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <hi>Local Motion</hi>; and accordingly we find not, that the Reaſonable Soul in Man is able to produce what changes it pleaſes in the Body, but is confin'd to ſuch, as it may produce by determining or guiding the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Spirits, and other parts of the Body, ſubſervient to voluntary Motion.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. And if the Agents or active
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:93740:156"/>
Principles reſorted to, be not Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial, but of a Corporeal Nature, they muſt <hi>either</hi> in effect be the ſame with the Corporeal Principles above-nam'd; <hi>or,</hi> becauſe of the great Univerſality &amp; Simplicity of ours, the new ones pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd muſt be leſs general than <hi>they,</hi> and conſequently capable of being ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinated or reduc'd to <hi>ours,</hi> which by various Compoſitions may afford mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ſeveral Hypotheſes, and by ſeveral Coalitions afford minute Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretions exceedingly numerous and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and conſequently fit to become the Elementary Ingredients of more compounded Bodies, being in moſt Trials Similar, and as it were the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical parts, which may, after ſeveral manners, be diverſified; as in <hi>Latin,</hi> the Themes are by Prepoſitions, Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, &amp;c. and in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> the Roots by the Haeemantic Letters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So that the fear, that ſo much of a <hi>New</hi> Phyſical Hypotheſis, as is <hi>true,</hi> will overthrow or make uſeleſs the Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Principles, is, as if one ſhould fear, that there will be a Language pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, that is diſcordant from, or not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible to, the Letters of the Alphabet.</p>
