         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

How powerfully hath he lately preuailed with the Emperour and the King of Spaine and Poland in this bloody qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell,
<pb facs="tcp:2742:3"/>
who with barbarous hearts and sacrilegious hands haue played their prises in oppressing and de-pressing these Churches in their Countries, and (now by a policie as subtile, as execrable) hath likewise drawne the French King to make himselfe guiltie of the same impious and bloody crimes; to ruine the Protestants of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, whose Valours and Fidelities placed the Crowne on his Fathers head; and to exterminate those Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches which with so much Pietie and wisedome hee had established in the Meridian of their perfection and glorie.</p>
            <p>The which to preuent, and oppose, God hath inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the heart of our Gracious King <hi>CHARLES</hi> to reach them out the hand and Scepter of his Royall assis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and so to proue himselfe a true Defender of the Faith, as well in Fact as Title. Knowing therefore that by the Lawes of Honour and Religion we are bound to ayde and asist them, and not to suffer the Vineyard of Gods Church to be thus miserably trampled ore, and rooted vp by the Champions of Rome and Hell, it will be a pious and a Noble worke for you Illustrious Lords and Gentlemen, the Great Senators, and Elders of our Israell, to contribute the meanes, as our King hath the Will, to the preseruation and building vp of so Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and glorious a Worke; by affecting it tenderly in your selues, and by cheerishing it carefully and dearely in the hearts of all the parts and members of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; For as the Protestants of France call on our King, so doth his Maiestie on you (who are the essentiall and figuratiue body thereof) and God on you all, for the speedy and vigorous assistance of this his afflicted Spouse the Church, and hee who is the searcher of all hearts the
<pb facs="tcp:2742:4"/>
witnesse of all soules, and the Iudge of all actions, will infallibly iudge betwixt you and him, with what true Deuotion and Zeale you performe this part of his seruice and glorie.</p>
            <p>Warres are made as well with Gold as Iron, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in assisting this our afflicted Sister the Church of France, wee must second our words with deedes; our promises with effects, and our Prayers with our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. Their Enemies are strong and powerfull, their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions and dangers great, so therefore must our assis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance be to them. They are neere to vs by Cituation, but farre neerer in Religion, for as their cause and quarell is ours, so should the sence and feeling of their calamities, and in this sence I may iustly affirme, that they are a great part of our selues, because we generally belong all to one Church, as that Church doth particularly and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly to God.</p>
            <p>As truth is the best eloquence to perswade vs to this assistance, so Religion is the best truth, and it would bee an act not onely of Impietie, but of shame in vs, if these our three flourishing Churches, of England, Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and Ireland, should not now powerfully assist that afflicted one of France, which sues to them for it, with teares and prayers. But Illustrious Lords and generous Gentlemen, my Iudgement prompts mee that I should wrong yours, in seeking to perswade your affections to so charitable and religious a worke, from which I know nothing is capable to direct, or disswade you, and in that behalfe I rest hopefull, if not confident, that you will at least excuse my zeale, if not pardon my presumption for proferring vp the sighes and teares of this poore perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted French Church, to your sublime Protection and

Patronage, or rather to your charitable care, and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious consderacion, as esteeming it euerie way as wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of your pittie and compassion, as of your knowledge. May the sight of her afflictions, myseries and calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, teach vs how to preuent our owne, May God of his best mercie so operate with our hearts and soules, as wee may esteeme and repute them our owne, and may Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land (by the Kings royall, and your Illustricus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample) stretch forth her hands, to relieue this poore French Church and people, so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iustly afflicted, and so wrongfully oppressed and persecuted for God, and his Cause.</p>

Moreouer, in that which was one of the most impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant points, and the chiefest motiues of our resumption of Armes, to wit, the subsistance of the Fort before <hi>Rochell,</hi> they would expresse nothing in the Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on touching the promise made to vs for the razing and demolishing thereof. And that promise which was yet giuen vs by the Ambassadour of the King of Great <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,</hi> as also of the Lords States Generall, was couched in such ambiguous and generall tearmes, that it mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly appeared the intent of those who gaue them, was not to obserue and keepe them: because by their artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall prouidence they prepared the way to euasions, which they haue since practised, and would thereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre, and pretend that they had promised vs no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
            <p>So that in what estate soeuer our affaires then were, finding more safetic in a weake resistance, then in a
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:2742:8"/>
peace which publikely cuts our throats: we therefore refused to accept it vpon those conditions, which we held would infallibly draw after it our fatall ruine and destruction: But at length we found our selues obliged, yea we dare affirme almost enforced, by the vrgent and reiterated assummons which were made vs by the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid Embassadours, who in the name of those they represented, were established vnto vs as Pledges and Sureties, that we were proceeded with sincerely, and especially for the demolition of the said Fort, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they alleaged they had expresse promise and assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. As also that this peace was not of the qualitic and nature of the precedent peaces, which had beene treated onely with vs, whereas this was properly not so much with vs, as with the King of Great <hi>Britaine</hi> and the Lords States, so as whosocuer violated or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringed it, the infraction and iniury thereof was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly offred to them, who would not spare either their intercession, or other meanes, to make good their words to vs.</p>
            <p>And although this were very preualent and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to induce vs to accept and admit thereof, they yet further represented to vs, That our Armes was the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obstacle that the King imployed not his against the inueterate Enemy of our Estate and Religion, and why he did not so soundly wed himselfe to the affaires of <hi>Germanie,</hi> with the King of Great <hi>Britaine:</hi> so that whatsoeuer ill successe betided, it would be iustly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to our obstinacy, and would occasion all those who hitherto haue wished vs well, wholly to abandon and forsake vs.</p>
            <p>To these important reasons we suffred our selues to be vanquished, and although we then foretold them that they would finde themselues deceiued, as well in the assurance which was giuen them to conferue peace vnto vs, as also so to ioyne their designes and Armes

            <p>
               <hi>Without the which assurance of Demolition, and the ease and exemption of Garisons, the said Deputies protested vnto vs, that they would neuer haue consented to the subsistance of the said Fort, being commanded and resolued to conserue the right of that Demolition. As they doe by this present decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, with assurance that the King of Great</hi> Britaine <hi>will labour by his intercessions, ioyn'd with their most humble supplications to hasten the time of that demolition, whereof we haue giuen them all the royall promises and words which they can desire, after we had shewed them, that they might and ought to remaine satisfied and contented. In witnesse of all which now formerly expressed, we haue signed and sealed this present with our names and armes, and haue caused it</hi>

            <p>This Act so dressed and finished, the Deputies carry it home to their Prouinces, to serue for comfort and consolation to our poore afflicted Churches, who wept and trembled at so preiudiciall a Treatie, and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding laboured with all diligence to a punctuall accomplishment of all things which were conceded and granted by vs, to the end that calumnie might not take the least hold of our actions, and that there might not remaine the least shadow of pretext to v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>e vs as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed, <hi>to wit,</hi> not to obserue or performe any thing which is solemnly promised vnto vs.</p>
            <p>To which end the Citie of <hi>Rochell,</hi> contrary to the priuiledge of frontier Townes, as also of her owne in particular, doth speedily demolish a notable peece of fortification, which with much cost and labour it had built, and ioyned to her wals. They dismist the Earle of <hi>Lauall,</hi> and his troops, who had assisted them in their necessitie, and in their places receiued the Kings Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners; whose comming they well knew would proue extreamely preiudiciall to their liberties, and their residence to their safetie: and in a word, from point to point with a scrupulous curiositie, they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged all that they were enioynd to performe. The Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> likewise dismissed all his Regiments and troopes which had followed him, and our swords fell out of our hands in all places where we had drawne them: The sorrowfull honour of warre was presently seene changed, and conuerted into Bonefires of Ioy for the peace, and into publike vowes and acclamations for the Kings long life and prosperity; and briefely,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:2742:10"/>
our Obedience was so intire, that the most malicious research of our Enemies could finde nothing whereat either to contradict or scandalize vs.</p>
            <p>So if we had had to doe with people any way iust or charitable, it had beene capable to haue molified their hearts, and to haue began to deale and agitate with vs, otherwise then formerly they had done, and faithfully to haue perform'd what they had so solemnly promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: But the onely Article of their Faith which they keepe inuiolably, is neuer to keep or performe it to vs; and at the very first abord they shewed vs effects ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, when we came to inregister and verifie the Edict of Peace in the Parliaments, and (onely that of Grenoble excepted) there was none of them which would abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely doe it, some obiecting one restriction, and others alleaging another, vntill they came to point and cauill at matters of no moment, which vnprofitably shewed the peruersenesse of their auerse natures &amp; inclinations, As vpon the word of <hi>Temple,</hi> as if the places where we assembled to pray vnto God were Mosques: and again vpon that of <hi>Ecclesiasticall Assemblies,</hi> as if they were the Congregations of Pagans, or the Synogogues of Iewes.</p>
            <p>But yet we belieued that we had much cause to extoll the moderation of those who haue quarrelled with vs but with words; It is easie for vs to suffer iniurie for the loue of him, who before vs, was in derision called <hi>Samaritan,</hi> howsoeuer that those contemners were wholly vnworthy, in the neglect, but much more in the violation of the Edict, custome (in that nature) hauing made vs so insensible, as we almost disdaine to open our mouthes to complaine thereof. But the ill consists in this that the greatest parts of those Modifications which haue bin vsed, do derectly concerne our safeties, and therefore makes the Kings Declaration wholly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable.</p>
            <p>This hath beene particularly seene in the Parliament of <hi>Thoulouze,</hi> whose Iurisdiction is knowne to extend
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:2742:10"/>
vpon the greatest number of those, whom necessitie had armed in these last emotions. For in two onely Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles they almost anihilated all the substance of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict. First they placed among causes reserued and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable, the demolition of the Temples of the Romish Churches, expresly abolished by the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the yeere 1622, conformable herein to the Edict of <hi>Nantes,</hi> and also then absolutely verified by them, by which meanes, the hatred which they conceiue against vs, carries them from the shame to be held factious and inconstant. But they proceed further, for they limit the abolishing of hostilities committed the 5. Febr. 1626, although the Declaration of Peace was not published vntill many dayes after we subsisted in Armes in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where we were constrained to resume them. So in those two turnes of the pen, they haue inwrapped vs all in the condemnation, preparing the way to all sorts of iniustice and cruelties which they haue since practised and committed vpon vs. And although his Maiestie commanded that these Modifications should bee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawne, as directly opposite to his intentions, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuditiall to the publike tranquilitie, yet notwithstanding all these reasons, this Parliament hath obstinately made good what it formerly so vniustly and so factiously re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued against vs, to the great preiudice and blemish of the Authoritie Royall, and for a most compleat and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire iustification of our complaints and grieuances, not being able to find securitie or safetie in the words and promises of our Prince, because what good affection or intents soeuer he retaine for our behalfes, those who ought to be the executors of his Royall will, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, doe directly combine and band themselues against it, as triumphing and glorying in the infringing of his promises.</p>
            <p>These beginnings were not to giue vs hope of any much happy success, or if any one intended or expected them, experience stayed not long to vndeceaue them,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:2742:11"/>
the eruptions of the Peace hauing beene so grosly and presumptuously committed, with such a violent impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuositie, that they feeme to be affected thereto, it being impossible to giue it any other interpretation then this, <hi>Miserie to those, who are weakest, and vanquished.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was manifestly seene and knowne at the refuse which was giuen to our general Deputies to send Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners through all Prouinces according as it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcated &amp; intimated by the Declaration of Peace. The necessity of their sending being extreame, to the end the Edict might be put in execution where it was infringed and violated. To reestablish the exercise of our religion in those places from whence it had been banished. To replace in their houses a numberlesse number of poore families which had beene expeled and exiled. And in a word, to preuent and remedy those disorders which drew with them the licentiousnesse of war, and to make vs feele some effects of so many promises which had been made vs. But it is that which no supplications can euer obtaine, so as most of the chiefest Churches of the Kingdome haue fainted and languished in miserie, that they are so far off that this Peace hath any way impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued or bettered their condition as contrary-wise it hath disarmed vs, to expose vs naked to all manner of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and persecutions.</p>
            <p>The which to approue and iustifie, at least 60 poore Churches will vndertake with weeping hearts and voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to whom according to the tenor of the Edict, the exercise of their Religion ought to be free, and where it was confidently hoped they should haue now beene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>established by the peace, they yet haue remained in a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull desolation, without that all their requests &amp; pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers can any way steed them for their restoration, or produce any other fruits or effects then the immense charges of their vnprofitable solicitation. Iniustice, which hath not onely been practised in those Townes subdued by the violence of Armes, and where this hard
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:2742:11"/>
measure might peraduenture be imputed to the seuerity and sharpnesse of the Roman-Catholicks against vs for hauing committed some acts of hostilitie, but also in those places who refused to ioyne to the resistance of their brethren, and had stooped the most <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ruily vnder their yoake, and in those places also where ours haue no power to agitate any thing.</p>
            <p>Particularly, we may here remember the Church of <hi>Tours,</hi> whereof the Temple hauing been burnt in the mid'st of peace before the troubles of the yeeres 1620 and 1621, and during the two Edicts of Peace which haue beene since establshed and published; they cannot hetherunto reedifie and repaire it. And although the king with his own mouth hath ordained the restablish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof, and to that end granted out a commission to see it performed the last yeere, yet notwithstanding, the malice and wickednesse of his Officers hath rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it vaine and vnprofitable to whom the execution thereof was giuen and belonged, so that for the tearme of 7 whole yeeres, more than 2000 Soules haue there languished in a miserable captiuitie of Conscience, without hauing permission or liberty to seru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> God. And for asmuch as some-times they haue assayed to assemble secretly to administer the Sacrament of Baptisme to some Children, and not to suffer so great a number of Soules without some exercise of Religion, they haue followed them closely and seuerely, haue publickly abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Minister, and condemned him in a great Fine, for lending of his House for so piousan Action.</p>
            <p>Yea so far it is that those poore troopes of Christians so pitifully dispersed, and so long time depriued of the food of their Soules, could be assembled or gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that the insolencie and crueltie of our Enemies haue begat and perpetrated new dissipations. The yeere 1622, the Duke of <hi>Ventadour</hi> (formerly held to be a moderate Prince) hath in a setled peace demolished the Temple of <hi>Chailar</hi> in <hi>Vizaretz,</hi> and forbidden all this
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:2742:12"/>
poore Towne (wherein there are not 10 Families of a contrarie religion to ours) the exercise of their religion, authorising by this remarkeable example, in regard of his dignitie, all those of his gouernment to an implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hatred against vs, and euen to outraged with a licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious furie and boldnesse. The Baron of <hi>Perant,</hi> Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of <hi>Beucaire</hi> in <hi>Languedoc,</hi> imboldned by this inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie, after he had taken from vs, &amp; vsurped the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, wherein we were accustomed to serue God in the Church of <hi>Vezenobre</hi> in <hi>Sezennes,</hi> he not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented himselfe to depriue vs thereof, and to dedicate it to Idols, but to leaue a perpetuall memoriall of his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious and violent iniustice, caused there a Bell to be founded with this Inscription, That <hi>Such a day he had chased Heresie thence.</hi> And not long since when the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall Synod was held at <hi>Castres,</hi> the Cardinall of <hi>Sourdis</hi> came furiously rushing vpon a troope of harmlesse and innocent Soules, going to <hi>Montrauell,</hi> with the great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodities and laboures of their bodies, to seeke the Food of their Soules, where violently he pursued the Pastor (whom it pleased God to preserue) shut vp a great number of women and small children into a barn, where he held them a long time captiues in the feares and apprehensions of death, &amp; euerie minute threatned to set fire to them and burne them, and in the end by a prophanation full of horror, conuerted to a stable this Temple where these seruants of the Lord were accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med frequently to serue him, and which had continued without interruption since the furie of the Masacres.</p>
            <p>And in this manner it is, that Our Enemies doe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish that which his Maiesties Declaration had promised vs, concerning the reestablishing of our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sipated Churches, that is to say, by new inuented out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages, and performed by great and noble personages, against whom it is vnpossible for vs to obtaine any Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, yea not lawfull to frame or exhibit a complaint.</p>
            <p>Enery one may iudge of what a dangerous and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious

consequence these examples are, and what we may attend or expect from people already exasperated and animated with implacable hatred against vs; hauing before their eyes, those and the like great personages, which serue for fire-brands and incendraries to their rage: and indeede they are growne to so boundlesse and licencious a rage, that they can make vs suffer no more, and in imitation of others, they triumph and glory to abuse vs, and doe openly depresse vs with their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages. So that almost euery where to be knowne to be of our Religion, is to be marked and distinguished for Monsters, and those who are of the sweetest, and most temperate inclinations, doe thinke they extreamly gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie vs, if they doe but simply abhorre vs, and eschew our companies and meetings, as people who are infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the pestilence, especially in those places where they preuaile in number, and it is almost throughout the whole Kingdome, that we cannot goe to our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Exercises, but either in going or returning the vulgar doe assemble to hush and shout at vs with publike out-cries, throw stones at vs, and beat vs downe with iniuries; so that in the Capitall Citie of <hi>Paris</hi> it selfe, it is not long since that there were some slayne vpon the place, without that the presence of the King, &amp; the respect of that famous Parliament there resident, could preuent or hinder that this blood was not spilt before their eyes, and themselues to be almost destroyed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. Yea they aduance so far in this insolencie, as they rush into particular mens houses to execute the excesse of this their crueltie. And the example is resent &amp; fresh of that which hapned in the aforesaid Church of <hi>Veze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobre,</hi> where a furious number of <hi>Asasins</hi> breake by night into the house of the Minister, and clapt a rope about his necke purposely to strangle him, if miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously he had not escaped their tallents by leaping out at a window, from whence he secretly crept along to som neighbouring cottage, almost dead with the blows and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:2742:13"/>
wounds he receiued of them. Those whom they cannot force in their houses, the seduce forth by subtiltie; as an Aduocate of <hi>Sommieres,</hi> who being fallen into some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolt, during the last ciuill combustions, but then imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly after return'd againe into the Church, he was sent for to the Castle vnder a false pretext &amp; errand, &amp; there was surprised and seized on by a multitude of furious Fryers, and appointed Souldiers who there drew him into the Fryerie, where he was forced to endure all that which could be expected from the humanitie of those pitifull fathers. Our children are often surprised &amp; stol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len from vs by publicke violence, to bring them vp in their Cloysters, as many times there remaines nothing to the poore fathers &amp; desolate mothers, but their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable teares to haue ingendred them to Idolatry and superstition. It is a common custome now among Friers, to thrust themselues into families and houses to seduce seruants against the will of their master, &amp; chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in the sight of their fathers, and if they will haue them forsake their houses, they cry out, <hi>Murther, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> as if they had been outraged &amp; set vpon, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing witnesses enough for their purpose, to depose that which they desire, they follow them in suits of Law, as cryminals, and many times they are very happy if they can be quit and freed of them for a great part of their goods. Others they accuse for speaking ill of their Prince, and so frame informations against them, which they presse with so much malice &amp; violence, that some finding themselues circumuented, &amp; in danger of their liues, doe leaue themselues to be drawne and seduced by them, and so wretchedly to redeeme their crymes with their reuolt and Apostacie, whereof there is as a late remarkeable example neere <hi>Naye le Fineuse,</hi> in one who had the charge of Ancient of that Church. Yea many times they very impudently enter into our Temples du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time of Sermons, &amp; there very loudly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict our Pastors to their faces, to the end they may stirr
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:2742:13"/>
vp some mutinie, or sow some sedition among them, which hapned at St. <hi>Maixert</hi> verie few moneths since, and it is commonly practised in all parts of <hi>Poictow,</hi> the which it seemes those maleuolent Spirits doe particularie practise, thereby the more to torment them in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. These sort of people doe againe goe and besiege the patience and braines of sicke and dying people, purpose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to disturbe their wits and memories, and to engender some scruples in their Consciences, and what testimony soeuer the poore sicke patient giues, that he will receiue his consolation from his owne Pastor: If it fall out that he but once open his mouth, then they are presently vp with their insolent cries which they obstinately continue vntill such time as they see the sicke patient in the last a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonies of death. This Death although it be commonly tearmed the last and best remedy of all euils and afficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, yet it doth not wholly take vs away from their cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty; for they raile vpon our dead bodies, persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vs to the very tombe, permit not that we are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied or conducted, fill our graues when we are making of them, wish and desire that we were deuoured of Dogges, and constraine vs almost euery where to so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnize our Funerals by night. But alas! what will you say, when in our very graues, our bones and dust cannot finde repose? for with vnmercifull and cruell hands they violate our graues, whom very Pagans would e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme as sacred, and finding nothing else but pittifull dust, they are yet so barbarous as to throw it into the winde. The burning of the Temple of <hi>Towrs</hi> began by the vnburying of a dead carkase; and so haue beene vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buried the bones of persons of qualitic and Honour as of late <hi>Monsieur de Teligny la Nene,</hi> and very lately of <hi>Monsieur de Saint Fulgents.</hi> Not long since neere vnto <hi>Londun,</hi> as a husband had caused a graue to be made for his dead wife neere vnto the Church-yard, the rage of the Commons was such, as they would not suffer this poore body this last place of repose, but they vnburied it
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:2742:14"/>
by night, and exposed and abandoned it to Woolues, which indeede deuoured part thereof, so that when the afflicted Husband began to make researches and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of this inhumaine cruelty, he receiued a poore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for this his pitifull and charitable office, and was in a morning found to be slashed, and slaine.</p>
            <p>And let none here belieue, that we speak by Hyperbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, for they are pure and naked truths: the Sunne sees them, we feele them, our Enemies make vs suffer them, and <hi>France</hi> is the cruell Theator whereon are represented such bloudy and mournfull tragedies, and as God beholds them, so it is incompatible to his diuine Iustice that one day he doe not reuenge them.</p>
            <p>But here our Enemies will not faile to obiect vnto vs, that although all this be true (as indeed the iustificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof is cleare and apparant) yet that they are parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular actions, not auowed, but disproued, and which therefore ought not to cause the infraction of the Edict of Peace, the which as much as possible we can, we ought to endeauour to preserue and maintaine. But this is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of our Enemies, which through their vain euasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons desire to be couered with our complaints, &amp; to haue a law of themselues to condemne them as iniust. But besides that, we go on plainly to iustifie their iniustices, altogether armed with Patents, and publikely authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, they in vaine endeauour to free and wash themselues of these outrages which are committed on vs by particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar persons, for that they themselues introduce them by their examples, and to embolden them thereto through their impunitie, for wherefore haue they the swords of Magistracy in their hands, but to defend and secure vs from iniuries, and to doe vs right and iustice when we haue receiued them: wherefore doe they contemne all all our complaints and grieuances? whence proceeds it, that hauing presented a full list thereof, which was yet but the abstract and compendium of more important, that we had no iustice done vs vpon any one of them, no
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:2742:14"/>
nor so much as vouchsafe to heare or read them: so that who can otherwayes take or consider them, but as the Authors of these cruell indignities we endure and suffer, in that hauing the authority to preuent them, they abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely refuse to put their hands to it? The Edict of Peace which is giuen vs, is fraudulent and deceitfull, because those who are ordained to make vs obserue them, doe send apparant contrauentions, and permit-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>But their iniustice stops not, at a simple tolleration of outrages, which we see them doe by their particulars, for they themselues are the first and chiefest which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringe all the clauses of the Edict, which is fit for vs to cleere and iustifie; to the end, that all men being well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed thereof.

            <p>The Kings Declaration imports, that we shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>established in the free exercise of our Religion, in our Goods, Offices, and Honours, and in a word, all sorts of fauourable and gracious vsage for the Generall, besides that which was couenanted and granted to some parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, as namely for the Towne of <hi>Rochell,</hi> It is therefore question that we examine or see how all these hath beene performed and executed: As for the free exercise of our Religion, besides that which hath beene formerly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected and represented of a fearefull number of poore Churches which remaine depriued, and that the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of the State haue scoff'd and mocked when they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauoured to demand their reestablishment, which was granted them by the Edict, besides those which are newly rased and discipated, and in those very places where this exercise doth in some manner yet subsist: we are held in a cruell captiuitie, for there are Fines ordained and also corporall punishments, for those who sing Psalmes in their houses, wherein are contained the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of God, whiles the streets regorge with blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,

We are forbidden our Schooles in diuers places, as at <hi>Niort,</hi> and in all <hi>Bearne,</hi> to the end that our Children re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine ignorant and without learning and instruction. The Parliament of <hi>Pau</hi> hath decreed and pronounced a sentence against consistories, which shall professe and practise that which is expresly mentioned in our Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall discipline, to wit, to censure Fathers and Parents which send their children to the Schooles and Colleges of the <hi>Iesuites</hi> to be there by them instructed. Although Fryars which giue their first oath to a Stranger, I meane the Pope, who subiect Kings to him, and who maintaine and defend those paracides which they themselues haue committed; I say, although they are receiued into this Kingdome of all sorts of Nations indifferently; neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse it being question of our Ministers, of whom calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies hath neuer had the face to impute them the least of these horrours, we are debarred to receiue any who are strangers, and the ancient alliance of this Crowne with the Kingdome of <hi>Scotland,</hi> hath not beene considerable or valable to reobtaine the returne of Master <hi>Prymrose,</hi> in the Church of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> where he serued many yeeres with a singular edification, and testimony from our very aduersaries, of a most modest and temperate personage; and others, although naturall <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> are condemned to an vniust and eternall exile, because they were knowne to be excellent instruments to serue God, as <hi>Monsieur d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

As it is not lawfull for our Minister to speake or write, so it is prohibited to our Printers to publish any Bookes of our Religion. That at <hi>Nismes</hi> he of the Academie suffered a long imprisonment for imprinting an ancient manuscript which was publickly sold in <hi>Paris</hi> of the great pardon of God opposed to that of the Popes, and another Minister in <hi>Poictou</hi> named <hi>Bureau</hi> hath been extreamly check't by the Presidiall Court of <hi>Poictues</hi> for printing the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said dispute of <hi>Monsieur Saromet,</hi> and henceforth they haue made a generall Decree whereby they will exclude and insnare vs by vertue of a Declaration published <hi>Anno</hi> 1625, in the behalfe of an ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>It may be, that being contented to haue bereaued and dispoyled vs of our honours, they will be then more iust to restore vsto our goods, and to secure vs from iniuries, and generally to conserue our Rights in matter of Iustice which was solemnly promised vs. So here it is that some enraged passion hath strangely blinded them, that tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling vnder their feet all manner of diuine and humane Lawes, they haue wretchedly abused the authority which gaue them Lawes, euery way to afflict and oppresse vs. When grounding our selues and Actions on the Edict of Peace, we would question before Iudges, the vniust de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers of our goods, whereof they so violently possessed themselues during the fury of the Warres, and so to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Principall which was due to vs, before the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Armes, all our Law suites and Processes haue beene reiected or adiudged against the Plaintiffes to their great cost and charges, and our Enemies the Desendants still maintaind in their vsurpation; so that to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince of <hi>Languedoc</hi> alone, is owing more then two milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Livres, which is 100000. li. sterling, and to the towne of <hi>Rochell</hi> immense and infinite sums, and it is so far off from restoring vs what is due to vs, as by Acts of palpable iniustice they haue many where's condemned vs to restore those prises which we had taken during the warres, and among others there was a sentence giuen thereon, in the Chamber of the Edict at <hi>Besieres,</hi> against deceased <hi>Mrnsieur de S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Blancard.</hi>

            <p>Our processes are iudged by the ticket on the bagges, so that those of a contrary religion boldly sue all manner of actions against vs how vniust so euer, being confident that the contrary Iudge of our Religion will make them gaine their Causes: And so at the Great Councell, The

            <p>But might it please God, that they did not abuse their power but in disployIing vs of our goods, and that their cruelty would at least leaue vs our liberty and liues, that their seats of Iustice were onely Courts established vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iustly to grant and giue away our goods to our Enemies, and that they became not scaffolds expresly erected to draw innocent bloud from vs. It is a horror of the bloudy Decrees and Iudgements which euery day they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce against vs, and whereby they manifest and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate to all the world, that their soules are far redder then their Scarlet gownes. The least fault which any of vs commits is a crime which can neither hope, nor obtaine pardon, and in the whitest innocency it selfe, their hatred makes them finde out lawfull causes to condemne vs. A yong man of <hi>Auignon,</hi> named <hi>William Astier,</hi> for hauing framed and collected some reasons which moued him to abandon the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> was throwne into prison, where with Geeues and fetters he miserably remained two moneths among the greatest criminals, and could not yet obtaine his liberty before he had paid a great sum of money for a fine.

               </hi> and other pittifull reliques of forepast burnings. All <hi>France</hi> hath conceiued horrour at the fearefull iniustice vsed against an innocent man in the Isle of <hi>Ree,</hi> To whom his Iudge tearmed <hi>Briet</hi> (a name of abominable me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie) hauing suborned witnesses to affirme against him, that during the last commotions of <hi>An.</hi> 1622. he had broken and burnt an Image, and therein pronounced sentence of death against him. The Court of Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> without examining his witnesses, who were easily to be conuicted of falsehood and imposture, without admitting the reproaches which he gaue them which were more then valable, without regarding that if the accusation had beene true, that it was an hostilitie committed during the warre, and which ought to haue beene abolished and buried by the Edict of peace, their passion made them to consent and conforme this vniust sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, &amp; so to charge their consciences with the bloud of this poore harmelesse childe of God, who constantly expiring his last breath in the middest of fire and flames, confirmd his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency in this action of his death: and heauen afterwards discouered it, yea this vnfortunate and fatall Image is since found againe, and to this day doth subsist, to accuse the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable wickednesse of his Accusers and Iudges, which haue lent and held vp their hands to circumuent the whitest &amp; can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didst innocency that euer was. The fury and iniustice was not lesse but the precipitation far greater, in the person of one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Roumiou,</hi> who during the wars was Prouost in the Army of the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> who being at <hi>Castres</hi> in May 1626. and one of the Consuls of that Towne, a very vicious man, and wholly sold to our Enemies, comming to him &amp; occasioning him a paltry drunken quarrell, and so outraging and abusing him in the open street, necessity obliging him to put himselfe vpon his defence and resistance, he was presently seiz'd on by
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:2742:19"/>
men placed there to the same effect (for it was a premeditated quarrell) imprisoned, &amp; sentence as soone giuen: whereby he was condemned to the Gallies, he threw in his appeale to the Chamber of <hi>Besieres,</hi> but instcad of good Iudges, from whose vertue and integritie his innocency might receiue some assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, in an Act so outragious as was offred him, he found cruell Tyrants, who cherishing the iniustice of his former Iudges, aggrauated his crime and their sentence, and so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced iudgement of death against him, which by an vnpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raleld example was the very same houre executed, so that in all he staied not foure and twenty houres in their prisons: it is thevehemency of a strange passion which made them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede with such celerity where there was question of a mans life, and it is far opposite and distant from the moderation of those ancient Iudges, which still left thirty dayes between the sentence and execution thereof, to the end that if there were any light breake forth for the innocency of the accused, they would not haue beene sorrowfull to vnderstand it so late, but because they would spare the efusion of bloud, and neuer spill it but with compassion and sorrow, whereas these are insatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly thirsty thereof. And yet we may tearme these Iudges of <hi>Besicres</hi> modest and temperate in regard of that which was perpetrated lately in the Parliament of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> against <hi>Monsieur de S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Germain,</hi> a Gent. of marke and quality, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamely hated of them because he was a man of valor &amp; ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice; the Baron of <hi>Montendre</hi> who had a quarell against him, and who greatly fea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>'d his generosity &amp; courage, iudged the passion of this Parliament, to be a very fit instrument for the execution of his, and so to free him of this formidable enemy; to which end he seduced a wretched Priest to become Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tife a gainst the said <hi>Monsieur de S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Germain,</hi> &amp; so accused him for robbing of his Church, whose witnesses were not diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to be found out, because it wasagainst one of our religion; so the informations were framed and dressed against him, but with an absolute vnheard of silence, and they are put into the hands of a Prouost, expresly chosen for such a one which was requisite for such an execution; who watching his time, sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pris'd this braueGentlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> when he least thought or dream'd

            <p>These are the hands which now dispose soueraignly of our liues, and thus is our Religion turned &amp; imputed to crime, and the faith which was giuen vs by the Edict of peace to lures &amp; snares, the more easily to draw vs to the scaffolds, the which we haue not ceased to oregore &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine with our innocent blood, euer since that vpon the assurance of this peace we put down our armes; and the number is infinite which are daily hunted after for fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>past actions, so that within the extent and iurisdiction of the Parliament of <hi>Thoulouse,</hi> there are 2000 of vs decreed and commanded to be apprehended for the like causes, and there is nothing but flight can warrant them from the bloody hands of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>se cruell Tyrants.</p>
            <p>We assure our selues there are none except they are more then barbarous, who hauing considered all this, are not touched in hart with pitie &amp; compassion towards vs, and that he will not approue our wrongs to be immense, and infinit, because notwithstanding all these most sacred and inuiolable promises which were made vs, we are still tyranized in our consciences, oppressed in our honors, ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined in our goods, &amp; our liues continually exposed to the swords of those, who hauing them in their hands to doe Iustice, doe abuse them in the execution of their hatred against vs.</p>
            <p>But it may be we would yet support all these outrages and persecutions more patiently, if as they are committed against some particulars now here &amp; anone there, that the generaltie could promise themselues some repose &amp; tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quilitie; In this case those to whom it falls out to suffer, must yet glorifie God in their sufferances, &amp; still imbrace and indure them with consolation, seeing that the rest of Gods children, doe at least yet subsist though in I know not what poore estate &amp; condition. But our greatest griefe and miserie is, That we apparantly perceiue, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:2742:20"/>
of our Enemies are wholy bent to root vs out, as also our Religion, &amp; so to giue the last blow to our ruine, what sugred words soeuer they employ to perswade and make vs beleeue the contrarie.</p>
            <p>The iustification whereof is cleere and euident, by the breach of 2 Articles, which doth not simply touch the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trest of some particulars, but which concernes our gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall subsistance. The first regards the holding, &amp; obseruing of our politike assemblies, being deuided &amp; spread as wee are in a Kingdome, whereof euerie one knows, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and extent, and being to liue among people who are animated against vs with ragefull furie, we shall but liue there exposed to these their iniuries, &amp; comming to mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacre vs one after another in our houses, we may almost al perish before we haue knowledge thereof, or onely haue the meanes to haue recourse to the iustice of our Prince to implore his protection. One of the remedies of this our euil is, our mutual correspondence, &amp; communication one with the other, and indeed our king knowing the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie hereof, thought it fit &amp; requisit, and therefore gaue vs expresse commission by their Edicts to assemble at least euerie 3 yeeres to consult of our common affaires, and to compile all our grieuances together, to the end to bring and prostrate them to their feet, &amp; in their iustice to find the Palladium and sanctuarie of our safetie, according whereunto it was expresly promised so the last peace, that we should haue a Pattent deliuered vs to make our assemblies, the which if it had bin performed, &amp; his M<hi rend="sup">tes</hi> ears open to our complaints &amp; grieuances, without doubt he would haue taken pitie of the cries &amp; tears of so many thousands of his poore subiects, &amp; according to his roiall goodnes in prouiding for our wrongs, they had preuerted the calamities and miseries vnder whom <hi>Fraunce</hi> now breaths &amp; sighs. But our Enemies haue so powrfully pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed, that this promise hath bin violated to vs as well as all others, and our 2 whole yeeres patience improfitably imployed to make remonstrance thereof, hath produced vs no other fruit, but to make vs comprehend by their obstinate denials, that they intend to depriue vs of all
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:2742:20"/>
meanes to confer together for our common subsistance, thereby to worke more commodiously and surely to our ruine, as to beat downe and destroy a body, first to cut all the sinews which linck'd the members one to another.</p>
            <p>The same designe to ruine vs doth furthermore plainly appear, &amp; remaines perfectly verified by the proceedings they haue obserued &amp; held to bereaue vs of those Towns and places which the Edict granted and gaue vs in euerie Prouince to assure our liues. Experience had made vs see that what Edicts soeuer our Kings could publish in our fauour, they were not bars stong enough against the furie of the people. At the first seditious Sermon (and Fryers make none others) the fire of a popular emotion wasligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the kniues in the hand of an enraged multitude which came to seeke vs in our beds to cut our throats, which is no lesse then all the whole world knows, &amp; that there haue bin infinite numbers of Gods children which haue felt &amp; made triall of these more then barbarous hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, within that the publike faith, the respect of Laws, and the authority of the Prince, was powerfull enough to secure vs from them, &amp; after, to oppose some more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull remedy. Our Kings themselues haue assigned vs places to serue vs for refuge, if any should seeke to assaile or destroy vs, as formerly they had done, &amp; haue ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the guard &amp; keeping thereof should be wholy gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and committed to vs, euen so they haue remained in our hands not as hostages of the faith of our Princes, who haue neuer doubted of our fidelities, but as pawnes and pledges that our Enemies should containe themselues in their duties. And we kept them not, against those of whose grace we receiued &amp; held them, but against their rebellious subiects, which would presume to violate and infringe their Edicts, yea &amp; masacre vs, against the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of their will. And this properly is the nature of these townes which for this regard haue bin names of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie &amp; assurance, of which whiles we haue bin the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessors &amp; depositors, the insolencie of the people hath bin retain'd &amp; restrain'd, and in stead of wars &amp; combustions
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:2742:21"/>
wherewith this Kingdome hath bin long &amp; miserably af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, &amp; which made her the true theater of miserie, we haue seen her ascend to the height of all felicity &amp; glorie.</p>
            <p>And it cannot be said, but that the K. hath bin truly and perfectly obeyd of vs, &amp; that the gates thereof were open at all times he pleased to enter, as indeed he was receiued into most part of them with ioy and acclamations, when he past by <hi>Saumur</hi> to his mariage, &amp; had euer bin so since, if wicked counsellors had not abused (our respects &amp; obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diences, and had not made vs know by many deplorable experiences) that they contriued &amp; fashioned the snares of our ruine, &amp; to draw vs from forth these places, not that the K. should be better serued, for that was impossible, but because they would find meanes to violate his Edicts with impunitie.</p>
            <p>But how they haue borne themselues to bereaue vs of them, is that which it imports euery one to know, &amp; the which we will fetch from its head fountaine &amp; originall. First they would haue enterprised it by force of Armes, whereof they layd the foundations a little after the death of <hi>He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>y</hi> the great of happy memorie, by the innouation which they decreed &amp; resolued to doe in <hi>Bearne,</hi> in diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the reuenews which the deceased Q. of <hi>Nauarre</hi> and the Estates of that Country had assigned for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Ministers &amp; Colledges, and in employing them to furnish the pride of some Bishops, and the insatiable couetousnes of the Iesuits. They belieued that, that poore people would vnderstand this with griefe, as also that thereupon we would presently run to armes. But our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration deceiued them, so that we contented our selues from time to make our humble complaints and remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strances to his M<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>, and the wisest of his Councell held along time these matters in suspence. The other neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse push'd stil obstinatly to their former designs, &amp; after hauing obliged the assembly of <hi>Loudoun</hi> to seperate them selues in <hi>An.</hi> 1619, through hope that for 6 months after there should be no innouation in this businesse, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in the interim they would consider y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reasons of these of <hi>Bearne,</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:2742:21"/>
long before that time was expired, they led away the King into <hi>Guyene,</hi> and then goe suddainely thundring on these poore people, where by violence they pass'd in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>an, that which formerly they had resolued and concluded; ransaking this Country with strange hostilities, cruelly beat and outraged those who could not saue themselues by flight, defiling with indignity the Temples where they were accustomed to pray vnto God, and to preach his holy Gospell, thereby to hold this miserable Country in eternall seruitude and slauery, filling all places with Garrisons, and hauing drawne the Lord of <hi>Sales</hi> out of the Towne of <hi>Navarrins,</hi> through a thousand oathes that they would leaue him the gouernment thereof, of which when they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come masters, for his good seruice they payd him with scoffes and laughtres, and laugh'd at his credulity.</p>
            <p>They had not so well begun, not to pursue the point of their good fortune: the Deputies of the Assembly of <hi>Loudun</hi> repaire to <hi>Rochell,</hi> at the first brute and newes of these outrages, according to the right which had beene expressely giuen them before their last separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and there prepar'd themselues to goe againe and present their humble supplications to his Maiestie, but this is imputed to them for crime, and they haue order to disperse and deuide themselues; and because they would persist in their remonstrances, they are there held as encrimed, our enemies armed against vs, who then thought to persorme that in the middest of our other Churches, which they came from doing and exploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in <hi>Bearne,</hi> as if nothing could hold out before them, or withstand them.</p>
            <p>For hauing taken <hi>Saumur</hi> by the same lure which they had <hi>Navarrins,</hi> they is by oathes presently viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and corrupted the Gouernours of many other places, which they rendred vnto them without striking stroke, obliged others to receiue compositions, the which they as soone infringed, as at St. <hi>

               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:2742:22"/>
they then came to <hi>Montauban,</hi> which serued as a barre to their entryes, and the yeere after, which was <hi>Anno</hi> 1622. they assailed <hi>Montpellier,</hi> where they found so vigorous resistance, that they lost all hope of becomming masters thereof, whiles <hi>Rochell</hi> for her part acted wonders at Sea, and defended her selfe so well by Land, that those before it did nothing else but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume themselues.</p>
            <p>But for all this they were not daunted or discouraged, and knowing that their first designe to vanquish vs by Armes, no way succeeded to their desires, they spinne a contrary threed, and clewe, and so resolue to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw vs by a Treatie, sith they could not doe it by force: to which effect, they propose and seeke with all variety of Art and policy, and doe so industriously and obsequiously comply with the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> that he suffers him selfe to be inchanted, and lull'd a sleepe with their flattering promises, who not able to perswade hims<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>lfe that they could so wickedly and perfidiously breake his Maiesties word as they did, he concluded to peace with them on these conditions among others:</p>
            <p>That his Maiestie entering into <hi>Montpellier,</hi> should make no change or innouation, that <hi>Marans</hi> should be rendred vp vnto vs, and that the Fort built a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ioyning to <hi>Rochell,</hi> should be demolished; and for the other places, which as then wee held and enioyed, there should no alterations at all be made.</p>
            <p>Here then are our enemies drawne out of some rubs and dangers, by the onely meanes of this Treatie, but yet they haue not fallen from their first intents. The Cittie of <hi>Montpellier</hi> hauing opened her gates to the King, gaue him to braue a reception and entrance, as she thought she had thereby giuen him an eternall confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of her sidelity: but the recompence she receiued, was the Garrison which was left there against the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke faith, so solemnly sworne, with instructions to the Commanders and Officers, so to afflict the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:2742:22"/>
that they themselues should be constrained there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to demaund that which all other people naturally detest and abhorre, that is to say, to be subjected to the tyrannous Yoke of a Cittadell, according to which or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the houses of the chiefest, and most eminent, are stuffed vp and oppressed with Souldiers which eate them out, who spoile their Vines, desolate their fields, quarrell with all, assaile the honour and chastity of their wiues and daughters. Some in regard of these iniuries, consent to make this demand, and some three or foure score present the request of our Supplication: this (as they say) is not to preiudice the right of the rest of the Towne, nor to the remarkable interest which all our other Churches had therein; neuerthelesse this great tumultuous Garrison would not fayle to take them at their words: so the foundations of this Cittadell were presently laid, and in a short time brought to perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and then it was that with all sorts of licenciousnes, they began to grate and afflict this poore Cittie, farre more then before, all her priuiledges are annihilated, the Inhabitants disarmed to their very kniues: the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest Cittie-Virgins are snatch away from their fathers and mothers, to marry them to some vagabond Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of a contrary Religion, many are compeld to Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie, and in a word, once this rich Cittie, now this poore people, are made slaues to an vnheard of, and matchlesse tyranny. In, and in this manner they assured themselues of <hi>Montpellier.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for <hi>Marans,</hi> when the restitution thereof was pressed, it was found in the warrant which they had caused to be dispatched and expedited, that they had committed a notable imposture: for instead of that which they had shewed to the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> and whence the peace was concluded, they had absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly promised, that this Towne should be restored into the hands and keeping of his first Gouernour, but in this last, they adioyned an Alternatiue, which destroyed the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:2742:23"/>
precedent proposition, to wit, <hi>Or recompence shall bee giuen him,</hi> whereby they euaded and eluded our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund.</p>
            <p>But all these are yet but small matters. As <hi>Rochell</hi> was the place which most of all crossed their designes, considering that in regard of second causes, she is as one of the Axell Trees of our Subsistance: It was to become Masters thereof, that the first and chiefest intents haue these many yeeres aymed, but not being able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure and compasse it by Armes, not to reduce and bring them to the point of confidence, which proued so mournfull and miserable to <hi>Montpellier,</hi> to wit, to open their Gates, they attempted another way which they iudged lesse chargeable and more easie, and peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which might more fortunately succeed, then all that which they had formerly done during the time of Warres; there was a Fort began to be built before this Towne, which by this peace was to bee demolished, as by an expresse warrant to that effect was sent and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited as we haue formerly said: But how solemne so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer this promise was, they resolued not to hold or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it; and so to operate and worke by meanes of this Fort in time of peace, that which they could not haue to effect during the Warres: And as this Towne cannot subsist but by the meanes of comerce and trade: so they already preiudged that the subsistance of the said Fort, would infallibly wholy depriue and take it from them; there being no great hope or apparance that Merchants would frequent a place so neere to danger, much lesse hazard or entrust their goods: Besides, this Fort being so neere to their Towne, it might facilitate their Enemies Intelligence, and chalke out a way to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise: And put the worst, if they were inforced to come to Armes, they had therein a strong and powerfull Arcenallready to their h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>nds, and therein all sorts of prepara<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>iues for a Siege. The Rochellers who careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly saue these consequences, and likewise foresawe how
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:2742:23"/>
ruinous they might bee vnto them: dispatched their Deputies to the King at the very instant of the accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the peace, aswell to tender him their Submissions, as to procure necessary warrants for the demolition of the Fort: These Deputies find the King at <hi>Lyons,</hi> of whom they are fauourably receiued, and obtaine of his Councell as many good words and papers as they can desire: returning thus with Letters to Monsieur <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud</hi> (which commanded the Fort) which enjoyned him speedily to free the same, and to suffer it to bee demol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished. But he who had already the watch-word giuen him, mocked at all these their dispatches and expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and told them plainely, he knew the Kings inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions better then they all: and so fortifying, in stead of demollishing, spared neither cost, labour, or diligence, to aduance his worke. The others haue speedy recourse to their complaints, and resound very loud the indignity and disobedience offered them, to the end they should not fly out, before the Fort were brought to perfection: they are entertaynd with good hopes, and promised they shall haue Commissioners sent them, to see if they haue performed and satisfied that which they neuer enioyed by the Declaration, and that they vpon notice thereof would giue them all content. Whiles these Commissioners adde delay to delay, and purposely tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell towards <hi>Rochell</hi> by very small journeyes, the Fort is finished, and furnished with abondance of Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and with all sorts of prouisions of Warre and Victuals: guarded by a mighty Garrison, and with a most exact vigilancy and care: in a word, in that Estate of power, no longer to feare <hi>Rochell,</hi> but to make <hi>Rochell</hi> feare them. And then it was that arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued these long expected Commissioners: who finding nothing to question or contradict with obedience wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the Towne was obliged to the King, they without giuing them any contentment, went to finish their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission in the Isle of <hi>Ree;</hi> by committing strange out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:2742:24"/>

The Rochellers seeing themselues so grosely mocked and abused, doe not omit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse to reiterate their complaints to the King, with such sence and passion, that hee being touched therewith, giues them againe good words: but those of whom the performance and execurion thereof depended, haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary intents and designes: so that whiles those busily pursue their complaints, these are incessantly conspiring and plotting of many Enterprises vpon the Towne. Particularly of one mannaged by a certaine fellow na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Courselles,</hi> who being on the very point to execute it, it pleased God so well to detect it, that the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker thereof was taken; and others with whom he had conspired, conuicted hereof. Whereup on the Deputies of <hi>Rochell</hi> are againe in Court to demaund Iustice: but they were flatly refused, and told they were too im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate in their complaints, which if they continued, they should be imputed to no lesse then crime, yea they proceeded too recriminatious; and told them that they were a mutinous and factious people. A deplorable condition of a Patient, who is forbidden to consolidate his sicknesse by his complaints and sorrowes.</p>
            <p>All these proceedings cleerely demonstrate, what the designe of our Enemies was against this poore Towne: But their impatience finding all these delayes and cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses too long, they againe resolue to make triall of their Armes: so they proued great and powerfull prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by Land: but chiefely they rigge and make ready a strange Fleet at <hi>Blauet,</hi> purposely at vnawares to thunder vpon this poore Towne, which they hope can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not escape them. Which conioyned with the other breaches of the peace euery where committed, obliged the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> by whom it had beene treated and conducted to aduise of the meanes to diuert this great storme, which threatned speedily to befall our Churches:

            <p>And yet our enemies saw, they could not so soone arriue to the point and period of their pretences: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>Rochell</hi> had receiued a checke, yet she wanted neither courage, men, or prouisions.

               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:2742:25"/>
and the Lords the States, seeing how they were deluded and surprised, would no longer permit the stay of their ships against vs, which were the true motiues that made our Enemies become more flexible, to the Ouertures of accommodating and aduancing the peace made by the Ambassadours of the said King, and the Lords the States: But yet wee must not belecue that they had changed their maximes, or left off their designes, to depriue vs of <hi>Rochell,</hi> and all other places which remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, on any tearmes or rates whatsoeuer.</p>
            <p>And indeed their actions and deportments since the peace, hath manifestly declared it to vs. The peace was no sooner concluded, but they enforced the Lord of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auban</hi> to depart with, and leaue his house of <hi>Meouillon,</hi> which were the inheritance of his Ancestors, because the scituation thereof being strange, it might serue as a retreat to the poore neighbouring Protestants.

the body of the Towne, and the other Inhabitant for some point of order and gouernment among them, they set fire to this deuision, animating the one part against the other: yet both to betray each other, to the end to ruine them all by this their proper diuisions. There was obserued a particular intelligence betweene them and the Fort, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery day they held secret conferences in their Lodgings, whereat there were none but were either knowne or sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to wish ill to the Towne: and for the full conuiction hereof, one of them was surprised as hee would haue c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And briefely, whereas their Commission might haue beene ended in two dayes: they obstinately remained in the Towne, vntill the arriuall of the warre sent them away. So because they stayed there so long without businesse, without doubt it is a strong presumption, they were sent thither to sowe some Treasons, and to introduce within the Towne, the meanes of her ruine, whiles others laboured powerfully with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, likewise to effect it.</p>
            <p>The last blow of their pernitious designes, before we who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take off the Maske, and so come to the last effects of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, was a generall defence to transport any Corne by Sea: yea, not only to forraigne Countries, but from one harbour, to another in <hi>France:</hi> and this defence was set on foote, when <hi>France</hi> abounded and regorged with Corne: so as many who discouered not the true intent hereof, wondered to heare it published: and di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But yet we assure them, that we haue not here inserted the thousandth part of our miseries: for whosoeuer would fully and punctually represent them, his paper must be as great as <hi>France,</hi> and he must resolue to write many Volumes. It sufficeth by this small part, to iudge of the whole piece: for by this clawe they may sufficiently know these Lyons, and see into what extremitie and gulfe of miseries, they haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced vs: For in a word, they haue robd vs of our goods, wronged vs in our Honours, spilt our blood, and not spared our Tombes after our death; and all this in detestation of our Religion, the memory whereof eternally to abolish: there is no violence, but they haue imployed: no cruelty, but they haue practised: nor no faith or promise, but they haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringed and delacerated, especially of the last peace, whereof they haue wilfully broken all the Clauses and Articles, and during the time thereof, haue publiquely sought our vtter ruine and destruction.</p>
            <p>To remedy all these our miseries, wee haue continually haunted: yea I may say, beseiged the Gates of our Prince his Palace, and lifted vp our voyces, thereby endeauoring to make him vnderstand our grieuances: but particularly <hi>Rochell</hi> hath still had their Deputies prostrate at his Maie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Haue we rendred vp any one Town, as they then deliuered to the Spaniard, all those whereon they could become masters, and among others the Capitall Citic? Haue wee laid hands vpon the sacred person of our Prince, as they wickedly and damnably haue done? What resemblance is there in a defence drawne from necessitie as is ours, (alwayes in subiection, and still ready to returne to dutie) with their audacious reuolt; so long, so obstinate, so pernicious: hauing not the least pretext to charge vs of the least outrage in their persons, of the least disgrace in their honours, of the least extortion in their goods, or of the least force in their consciences, and who alleadge for their only griese and complaint, that the Prince, who became then weary of killing, was more mercifull then they would haue him, in spilling of our blood, sith from thence they haue deriued their Law to vse surious resolutions, which all men haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held

            <p>That those who suggest these bloody counsels to him, and to tolerate but one Religion, doe notwithstanding practise the contrary in their owne Estates.

            <p>That by all these considerations collected together, and others which his wisedome shall dictate vnto him, this good Seruant endeuoureth to incline him to giue vs a good Peace, whose Ciment may be the inuiolable execution of his Edicts, that by the continuance and preseruation thereof, this poore Kingdome may reuiue &amp; breathe from her former mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series, and re-obtaine the happines of her pristine felicity, and he also may be now blest of all his Subjects, and enioying peace at home, may shew himselfe for the defence of those his Allies abroad who yet subsist; and erraise the others from the ruines and miseries wherein they are fallen for want of his Royall assistance.</p>
            <p>And hereafter we haue addressed our selues to the person of our Prince, wee also inuoke all those, who although they are of a contrary Religion to vs, are yet people of good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, and retaine still the hearts and affections of Loyall Frenchmen, to the end to speake here in presence of God, that if the first can some way consent to so many iniustices and disloyalties, which haue beene offered to vs, whereby we haue beene wronged and circumuented: And if the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther make them not to ioyne in pitty and compassion, for the miseries and calamities of our common Country, wherein it is plunged and precipitated, by the enrage and furious desire

Doe you not bewaile the Raigne of <hi>Henry</hi> the Great, during which, euery one pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God, as he vnderstood; that Peace brought vs then in plenty and abundance, and we all conspired and vnited our affections to the seruice of our Prince, and to fill and heape vp our Country with happinesse?

What indiscrection is it in you to disturbe your Peace and tranquillity, because we beleeue not as you beleeue? Or if it should be so, are you answerable for our consciences? and is it not onely to our selues, that the preiudice and detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment must accrue? Why leaue you not vs to the iudgement of him, before whom we must all appeare at the latter day, and to whom ye shall not be accountable for what we haue beleeued or done? Doe you thinke, that to wrong vs, is a good way to conuert vs?

And what can he more desire, who is as much the Ancient Enemie of this Estate, as he feignes to be of our Religion: but to see vs armed, and bloody minded one against the other, that after he may become Master of all.

            <p>But as for you, our most deare Brothers, who in this Kingdome professe with vs the purity of one and the same Religion, in what place or quality soeuer you are, we expect from you, that as our griefes and afflictions are common, so our feelings thereof may be. We will not heere discouer the searres and cicatrices of our wounds, by reproaching those among you, who heretofore haue beheld our calamities with dry eyes, or who thought to haue done much to bewaile them.

            <p>It is therfore in this regard that we haue recourse to them; and generally wee pary all Princes and Potentates, to extend their assistance and fauour to vs. We doubt not but our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies will endeuour traduce and disparage all our actions to them, and publish against vs, variety of false reports and infamous Libels: but whosoeuer hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

the weaker, passionately to alledge, they are guiltie: as by the report of the Wolfe, the Sheepe had troubled the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

            <p>And thou, O eternall God, who searchest the reines, and art Iudge of the intentions of our hearts, arise as witnes, and decide betwixt vs and our enemies: See whether they or we haue broken the Alliance of thy sacred name, vsed disloyalty and fraude to oppresse and ruine the innocent, Iudge who are true offenders and criminals towards the Prince which thou hast established to be thy Image to vs; either they who haue infringed vs his Edicts, and against the faith thereof, done vs all sorts of indignities and outrages, or we who haue beene constrained to suffer them as a warrant and caution of the faith. Make the violation thereof fall on the heads of those who are guilty; and as the Protector of innocnecy, shoote forth thy vengeance on those who haue oppressed it.</p>
            <p>Our consciences which are pure before God, embolden vs to addresse him these our vowes, and wee doubt not but he will heare them to our aduantage, and be a just reuenger of the Faith, which hath beene perfidiously broken to vs: Of our goods vniustly stolne from vs: Of our blood inhumanely and cruelly spilt; and of our consciences which haue beene afflicted with all variety of rigors; So we hope that he will

powre downe all sorts of blessings on our Armes, who is the true God of victories and Armes. And as it is only ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie, which hath made vs to assume and take them vp: so wee protest to be ready and willing to lay them downe, as soone as we receiue lustice, and that the libertie of our Religion and liues be re-established, according to the Edicts published in our fauour, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly of that of <hi>Nantes.</hi>
