            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight worthy DEANE, if it be true that the Heathen man ſaid, <hi>Otiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſine literis mors, &amp; viui hominis ſepultura,</hi> I thinke there is nothing more commendable then the ſtudy of thoſe Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and that poynt of Learning, which GOD himſelfe hath wrote, not onely by the great Spirit of the Prophets, but alſo by his owne hand, without Scribe or other inſtrument, (the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſeuerall diſpoſitions of liuing creatures:) wherin with the greateſt and nobleſt Characters that euer were, he hath engrauen the higheſt vviſedome of all Maieſtie. And to ſay the truth, no knowledge of politicall States, no Science Geographicall of the round Worlds Orbe, no ſpeculation Aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micall of the Heauens lights or motions, nor Art of ſpeech, reaſon or workes, is compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to this Learning, but a man deſtitute heereof, is dead and buried in a liuing graue, ſtinking before God and Angels. Wherefore this beeing my opinion, and I truſt the ſyncerity of my iudgement touching Gods liuing works, it may ſerue for a reaſon for the vndertaking of theſe labours; becauſe as <hi>Xenophon</hi> writeth vpon another caſe, <hi>Ek toon po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon malaka gignetai,</hi> out of theſe paynes are begotten many pleaſures.</p>
            <p>But whereas ſome thinke that there is knowledge enough of thoſe creatures by theyr out-ſides, &amp; the noyſe of theyr names, is a complete Lecture for humane vnderſtanding, I would but referre them to <hi>Philo Iudaeus,</hi> writing in his Queſtions vppon <hi>Geneſis</hi> in this manner; <hi>Sicut caeci tractant tantum ipſam corporis ſpiſsitudine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tactu, non decus colorum, non formas, non figuras, non aliud quicquam eximiae qualitatis testimonium praebens: Sic minus docti, &amp; inertis animae oculi, nihil in hiſtorijs intrinſecus cernere poſſunt.</hi> Wherefore, ſeeing that blind men cannot be comforted ſo much by their groping feeling, as other which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy the commodity of all their ſences, no man ſhall iuſtly blame the Printers and my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, if we ſet forth Gods workes fiue times more plainely, pleaſantly, and largely, then euer before they were in any language of Chriſtendome.</p>
            <p>I haue therefore now aduentured to put abroade into the World, the ſecond Booke of Liuing-creatures, which entreateth of Serpents, and all venomous Wormes of the Earth and Waters; vvhich for their Maker had the Sonne of GOD as vvell as men, for their antiquitie, were from the beginning before men; for their wit and diſpoſition in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, come neereſt to men; for their ſeate and habitation, dwell in one and the ſame Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with men; for their ſpirits &amp; inclination, are moſt vnreconcileable enemies to men; and for their vſe and commodity, very beneficiall to men: Therefore their knowledge is from God, their continuance from Heauen, theyr natures worth our ſtudy, &amp; the fruite ſeruiceable to man-kind.

For my conſcience beeing free from the ruſt of vaine-bragging, I dare be bold to pray vvith <hi>Nehemiah, Recordare mei Domine in bonitate, ſecundum omnia quae feci huic, populo:</hi> And therefore, if I be not buried till I be naturally dead, I will neuer die in idlenes, nor carry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout my body, to containe a liuing mans Sepulture.</p>
            <p>Although (I truſt) it ſhall appeare to you R: W: that there is ſtore and variety of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter compriſed in this thinne Volume of Serpents, inſomuch as it is needleſſe for mee (if not impoſſible) to ſay much more, yet pardon me (according to your accuſtomed clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie) if I range a little in this poynt of Diuinitie, which is the cognizance I weare, and the robe where-withall it hath pleaſed my Sauiour <hi>Ieſus Christ</hi> to clothe mee, that I ſhould be the man and the meane, (although the meaneſt of a thouſand now aliue) to declare &amp; publiſh to this preſent, and all ſucceeding ages of our Country-men, the ſecrets vvhich God hath regiſtred in the indelible natures of liuing creatures.</p>
            <p>I haue oftentimes admired the frequent mention of Serpents, which you know (bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then my ſelfe) is more then once remembred by GOD in Holy-vvrit: but eſpeciallie there are three memorable things concerning Serpents recorded; Firſt, a Hiſtory, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond; a Figure, the third; an Allegory. The Hiſtory, is the ſeduction of our firſt Mother by a Serpent. Whereof Authours write diuerſly, enquiring whether it were a true Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, or a falſe created Serpent, or the Deuill, (which our Sauiour termeth a Serpent in trope,) were alſo ſo called by <hi>Moſes:</hi> but the aunſwere is made, that it was a true Serpent, and that (as <hi>Peter Lombard</hi> writeth) he was onely permitted by GOD to take the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents body to doe that thing, his words <hi>Lib: 2. Sent: dist: 21. Cap:</hi> 2. are theſe; <hi>Serpentem autem animal ex omnibus delegit, tum quia rationali creaturae omnis irrationalis subiecta erat: tum quia per ſolum ſerpentem id facere à Deo permiſſus est diabolus, non autem per columbae formane, quòd fortaſſe maluiſſet, vt melius fraudem ſubeſſe in ſatanae verbis, Homo ex eo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olfaceret, quòd Serpens loquebatur. Et clarius ipſius tentatoris, id est, diaboli natura, per co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lubru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> illum tortuoſis anfractibus mobilem, ac proinde magis operi isti congruum, ſignificare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</hi> Which opinion (as you know very well) was before him giuen by S. <hi>Austen, Lib: De Ciuit: Dei, 14: &amp; cap.</hi> 11.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ioſephus</hi> writeth, that before that time, the Serpent was very familiar with man, and that the deuill choſe him for that purpoſe, by falſe friendſhip to deceiue him, vvherefore God in the Iudgement after the fall committed, tooke away from him his legges, &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth him creepe vppon the earth. But ſeeing there is no ſuch thing reported in <hi>Geneſis,</hi> eſpecially that the Serpent loſt any members, I will not auerre that for truth: but rather adde vnto <hi>Peter Lombard,</hi> that the Serpents ſubtiltie, aboue all the reſidue of creatures, was the cauſe that the deuill entred into him. Where-vnto <hi>Epiphanius</hi> in his Treatiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Ophitae,</hi> agreeth. But in this action, the Serpent was but the deuills trunke, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſerued it for any other purpoſe but to couer him; ſo as the words which were ſpoken, were the words of the deuill, and that S. <hi>Austen De Gen: ad lit:</hi> writeth, <hi>Serpentem, dum cum Eua loqueretur, neque intellexiſſe quid diceret, neque rationalem animam habuiſſe.</hi> But as hee ſpeaketh by phanaticall men, so did hee out of the Serpent. And yet GOD (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause hee was the deuills inſtrument) hath taken from him his voyce, leauing him onelie hyſſing; and inſteed of thoſe ſmooth words where-withall the woman was beguiled, hee hath giuen him poyſon vnder his tongue, to which the Scripture alludeth, Pſalm. 140. 3. Rom. 3. 13. as <hi>Ioſephus</hi> also affirmeth, <hi>Lib: 1. cap. 3. Antiq.</hi> And for this cauſe alſo was it puniſhed to grouell and creepe vpon the earth, and to ſuffer the enmity of man. For accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Lords ſaying, that hath no power but to byte our heeles, &amp; lower parts, and we on the other-ſide, make all force to bruize his head. I ſhall not need to allegorize this ſtory, it is better knowne to you then to my ſelfe, and I liſt not write thoſe things vvhich are impertinent to the matter. And therefore thus much ſhall ſuffice for this firſt record of the Serpent in holy Scripture, and ſo I will proceede to the ſecond.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:22894:3"/>
Another memory of the Serpent is, the type of <hi>Christ Ieſus,</hi> repreſented in the Brazen Serpent, erected at the Lords owne commaundement, for the curing of the Burning-ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents poyſon in the Wildernes. Many ſuch ſtatues of Serpents I haue remembred in the diſcourſe following, differing onely in the end and benefit. This working miraculouſlie thoſe things, becauſe it repreſented <hi>Christ</hi> crucified, which thoſe could not doe, being but the inuentions of man: yet of this Saint <hi>Austen</hi> maketh this elegant alluſion to <hi>Christ,</hi> in Iohn 3. <hi>Tract: 12. Magnum hoc Sacramentum &amp; qui legerunt nouerunt &amp;c.</hi> This, ſayth he, is a great Sacrament, and they which haue read it, know it. For what are the fiery-byting-Serpents, but ſinnes ariſing out of the mortality of fleſh? What is that ſame Serpent lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vp? but the death of our Lord vpon the Croſſe. For becauſe death came by the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, death is figured in the forme of a Serpent. The byting of the Serpent was deadlie, the death of our Lord was liuely. The Serpent is looked vpon, that it might not be harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, death is looked vpon that it might be of no force. <hi>Sedcuius mors, mors vitae, ſi dici po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test mors vitae, imò quia dici potest, mirabiliter dicitur.</hi> Shall not that be ſpoken which was to be done? Shall I be ſcrupulous to ſay that, which my Lord did not diſdaine to doe? Was not <hi>Christ</hi> life? and yet he was on the Croſſe. Was hee not life? and yet hee dyed. <hi>Sed in morte Chriſti mors mortua est, quia vita mortua occidit mortem, plenitudo vitae occidit mortem, abſorpta est mors in Chriſti corpore.</hi> But as they which did looke vpon the Brazen Serpent, did not periſh although they were bytten; ſo they which by fayth looke vppon <hi>Christ</hi> crucified, are ſaued from the perrill of their ſinnes: but with this difference betwixt the type and the perſon repreſented, that they were ſaued from a temporall death, and the faithfull from an eternall. Thus farre Saint <hi>Austen,</hi> and thus much of the Serpent in fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure.</p>
            <p>The third and laſt mention of Serpent that I apprehend, is that allegoricall precept, or inſtruction of our moſt bleſſed Sauiour, where he exhorteth vs to be wiſe as Serpents, to be innocent as Doues. Which words haue often driuen mee into the ſerious conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Serpents nature: that ſo I might at one time or other, attaine our Sauiours mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, for ſurely I thought of them, as that Learned-man did of the Iewes, <hi>Hoſtes ſunt in cordibus, ſuffragatores in libris:</hi> and becauſe of <hi>Christs</hi> reference, whatſoeuer the Serpents are in their nature and inclination to vs, yet in their wiſedome (as in a Booke) they are our inſtructors and helpers. And certainely, ſeeing there are no vertues of that worth to a Chriſtian life, as are Innocencie and Wiſedome, I could neuer ſatisfie my ſelfe in their diquiſition, how we ſhould goe to creatures ſo farre different in nature, betwixt whom is no concord, and take out their ſeuerall vertues, to marry them together in one humane breaſt. Well I knew the worth of thoſe vertues, and the neceſſity of their imitation, yet how to make vſe of them in a Chriſtian life, was <hi>Hic labor, hoc opus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Serpent in the earth, &amp; the Doue in the ayre, doth it teach vs that with wiſedome we muſt dwell below on earth, and with inocencie, as with the wings of a Doue, flye vp into heauen aboue? Or that in our pollicie while wee liue, wee may wind and turne in worldly affayres like a Serpents path, but in heauenly, keepe a ſtraight and ſwift courſe, like as the Doues doe in their flight? Or that wee be euer armed to defend our ſelues, as the Serpent is with poyſon, neuer vnfurniſhed, and yet be without hart and courage, as is a Doue? Or that there were no man in nature ſo wiſe as Serpents, or ſo innocent as Doues? Surely theſe thoughts draue me to looke vpon the Fathers, the beſt Expoſitors of this Text, for my ſatisfaction; that at leaſt, if I could neuer attaine to the perfect ſcience of Wiſedome and Innocencie, yet I might ſhew my louing endeuour vnto both. They told me with one conſent, that foraſmuch as men deſire wiſedome vvithout innocencie, our Sauiour to reprooue that affection, teacheth to conioyne both together, for <hi>Pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia ſine ſimplicitate, malitia, ſimplicitas, ſine prudentia ſtultitia:</hi> and therefore, <hi>Ne machine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur dolos, habeamus ſimplicitatem Columbae, et ne ab alijs ſupplantemur, astutiam Serpentis:</hi> to this effect you know they all vvrite. But yet this did not ſatisfie mee, for mee thought there was yet a more eminent meaning, or deeper ſecret, like ſome new <hi>Mercurius,</hi> or <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixar vitae,</hi> contayned in thoſe words. Wherefore I ſought further, and ſo I found, that Serpents defend their head, ſo muſt men theyr fayth; that they caſt theyr skinne, ſo muſt men their ſinnes; that they ſtop their eares againſt Inchaunters, ſo muſt men theyr eares
<pb facs="tcp:22894:4"/>
againſt the deuills tentations; that they byte at mens lower parts or heeles, ſo muſt we at the roote of our vnlawfull deſires; that for hatred of men they ſeek peace among thornes and bryars, ſo muſt good men flie the ſociety of thoſe things which might endanger their ſoules; that they ſwym keeping their head out of the water, ſo ought men not to be drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in pleaſure; that they eate duſt, according to the ſentence of the Almightie, ſo muſt we be content with whatſoeuer eſtate God ſhall ſend vs: and to conclude, ſaith S. <hi>Austen Solertiam habent in foetuum aeducatione, in latibulorum aedification, in nutrimentorum acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitione, in vulnerum medicatione, in nociuorum euitatione, in mutationis temporum prae cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitione, &amp; ſuorum comparium dilectione.</hi> Theſe are high poynts of vviſedome for men to imitate, and I know not what more can be added vnto them, if they were generall, except I ſhould reckon the vicious affections of Serpents, which haue far moe diſciples then their vertuous inclination.</p>
            <p>The Serpents ſpirit is a lofty and high ſpirit, reaching not onely after men, but alſo after the birds of the ayre, not beeing afrayd of the Elephants. Heerein many follow them, for
<q>
                  <l>Omnis cura viris vter eſset Induperator.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And it is true, as writeth <hi>Seneca, Animi hominu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſunt ignei, &amp; prouide ſurſum tendunt.</hi> It was the poeſie of <hi>Pompey, Semper ego cupio, praecellere, &amp; eſſe ſupremus.</hi> And of <hi>Caeſar, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem in appido primus eſſe quam Romae ſecundus.</hi> Another vice in Serpents is theyr deſire of reuenge, for euen to the loſſe of theyr lines, and when they are more then halfe dead, they kill other. Euen ſo it is become a noble euill to ſhed blood, or at the leaſt to diſgrace and diſable other to the poynt of death. S. <hi>Austen</hi> ſayth, that as a veſſell is corrupted vvith the ſharpe Vineger it contayneth, ſo is the body and minde of man, by the wrathfull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge it taketh. The inhabitants of <hi>Dinantium,</hi> a Towne of <hi>Burgundie,</hi> to deſpight theyr Duke <hi>Charles,</hi> for ſome iniuries to them done, made his picture of vvood, with all his Armes and Coates of honour vppon it, and ſo brought the ſame to a Towne of his called <hi>Bouinium,</hi> where they ſet it in a filthy ſtinking poole, full of Toades and Frogs, and other venomous beaſts, and cryed out to the <hi>Bouinians, Hic ſedet magnus bufo Dux veſter.</hi> To whom the <hi>Bouinians</hi> ſent a man with dehorting perſwaſions, to remoue their minds from that vndutifull diſloyaltie of contempt and rebellion, which they ſhewed againſt theyr Prince; but that meſſenger they inſtantly killed: afterwards they ſent a little boy, vvith Letters to perſwade them to make peace, ſue for pardon, and to turne away the rage of vvarre which the Duke was preparing againſt them; as ſoone as the little boy had deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Letters, they tore him in peeces like ſo many Wolues.</p>
            <p>Thus they tooke theyr reuenge; and ſhortly after came the Duke with his royall Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, and razed downe theyr Citty to the ground, killed and executed many of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants; the reſidue he caſt by couples into the Riuer <hi>Moſa,</hi> where they all perriſhed, men, vvomen and chyldron, ſo that the third day after it was ſayd, <hi>Hîc fuit Dinantium.</hi> The Duke himſelfe, for this great reuenge enforced by rebellion &amp; murther, eſcaped not ſcot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>free, but was the laſt of his race, and left the Duchy to another Family. Thus if in men there raigne the wrath of Serpents, they muſt alſo looke for the ruine of Serpents, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come like bruite beaſts that perriſh.</p>
            <p>I omit to ſpeake of theyr flattery, embracing while they ſting; theyr treachery, lying in waite in the duſt or graſſe to doe harme; their venome where-withall they are euer armed to ſpoyle; theyr ingratitude, when they kill them that nouriſh them; theyr voracity, when they kill much more then they can eate; theyr hoſtility, whereby they bid battell to all li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing creatures; their contempt of the reuerend viſage of man, whereby they neither ſpare vitious nor vertuous; and theyr deſire to liue alone, deſtroying all other to multiply their owne kind; like our Engliſh-Encloſers, who doe herein follow the wiſedome of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, but not the innocencie of the Doue. Of all theſe and many more, if I did write to a man of meane knowledge, I would enlarge and apply in ſeuerall examples, but to you R: W. it is as needleſſe as to light a Candle at noone day.</p>
            <p>To conclude therefore, I onely affect three things in the Serpents wiſedome, whereof two haue beene practiſed by the Church already, and the third remaineth now for vs to imitate. Firſt, in the beginnings of the Church, all the haereſies did chiefely tend againſt the doctrine of the Trinitie, or Vnitie, or Deitie, or true humanity of our Sauiour <hi>Christ:</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:22894:4"/>
as you know the <hi>Simonians, Cerinthians, Arrians,</hi> and other deteſtable beaſts did inuent. Againſt them all the noble Chriſtian Biſhops and Fathers did oppoſe themſelues, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended their head, viz. <hi>Ieſus Christ,</hi> to be true GOD, and true man; and ſo at one time were wiſe as Serpents, and innocent as Doues, dying for his ſake that dyed for them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, when by the corruption of time, and long current of many continued euils, the Church grew ouer-worne with many ſuperſtitions, ſo as the face thereof was disfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured, and the pure wedding-garment which <hi>Christ</hi> put vppon it, ouer-growne, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered with the beggers-cloake of humane inuentions; then God made his inſtruments to follow the Serpents wiſedome, in paſsing thorow a narrow paſſage of perſecution, death and fire; and ſo ſtripped off that ouer-growne skinne, whereby the <hi>Prime decour,</hi> &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe of the Churches party-coloured coate of fine Needle-worke, reſembled in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, is againe manifeſted. Thus farre they proceeded. And thus we haue ſeene the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence of figure to figure already performed.</p>
            <p>But the third and laſt thing, is that part of the Serpents wiſedome, whereby ſhee forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth ſocietie of men, and Citties or places of pleaſure, and dwelleth alone in the hedges, wildernes, or deſolate Rocks. It was a true experimentall ſaying of him that wrote, <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trema Religionis, vel in ſuperstitione<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vel in profanitatem recidunt.</hi> Now we haue ouer-paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Superſtition, I am out of feare that the Church ſhall neuer-more haue a thick skinne: we haue fallen into open prophaneneſſe, and contempt of one another, (if not of God,) which muſt be remedied by the Serpents wiſedome. And I thinke we muſt depart out of the ciu ill and worldly wayes, and affayres of men, and betake our ſelues to more priuate and ſecure habitations, where the open enemy can neither ſo ſoone find vs, or wound vs. I neede not proſecute this matter, or at the leaſt, if I ſhould, I muſt exceed the limits of a Dedication, onely this I ſay, that if the Church and Church-men, could put on one mind and ioyne together in this action, whereby men might be eſteemed for theyr worth, and not for their wages, I know the people would hunt after vs in deuotion, where now they tread vppon vs in prophaneneſſe. For we beeing made poore, baſe and contemptible be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theyr eyes (which are the liuing organs of grace,) they tread vppon all the reſidue, euen to the blood of the New-Couenaunt: and therefore, once more I pray that the ſons of <hi>Leuie</hi> may ſpeake one thing.</p>
            <p>I haue now ſaid my full, &amp; heere I preſent vnto you my <hi>Second Treatiſe of liuing Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> hauing collected all that is written of this Argument, out of ſeuerall Authors into one Volume and method: ſo that whatſoeuer <hi>Gallen</hi> gaue to <hi>Piſo, Ariſtotle</hi> to <hi>Alexander, Oppianus</hi> to <hi>Antoninus, Bellonius</hi> to Cardinall <hi>Castillion, Fumanellus</hi> to the Senate of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rona, Cardan</hi> to <hi>Madrutius</hi> the Prince of <hi>Trent, Grinaeus</hi> to <hi>Collimitius, Geſner</hi> to <hi>Grauius, Caronnus</hi> to Sir <hi>Horatio Pallaut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entle and pious Reader, although it be needleſſe for mee to write any more of the publiſhing of this Treatiſe of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemous beaſts, yet for your better ſatiſfaction and directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, briefly take this which followeth.</p>
            <p>After the publiſhing of the former booke of <hi>Foure-footed Beaſts,</hi> I vnderſtood of two thinges much miſliked therin, wherein I alſo my ſelfe receiued a iuſt offence. Firſt, the manifolde eſcapes in the preſſe, which turned and ſometimes ouerturned the ſence in many places, (eſpecially in the Latine:) which fault as it may in parte concerne me, ſo yet it toucheth another more deepely, yet are both of vs excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable: He, in wanting the true knowledge of the Latine tongue; and I, bicauſe of my employment in my paſtorall charge, and both of vs together, becauſe we were not ſo thorowly eſtated, as to maintaine a ſufficient Scholler to attend only vpon the preſſe. Wherefore, in this ſecond Booke, we haue remooued away that blot, and vſed a more accurate dilligence, and I truſt there is no eſcape committed peruerting the ſence, and not very many altring the letters.</p>
            <p>The ſecond exception taken againſt the former Treatiſe, was the not eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing or tranſlating of the Latine verſes, which thing I purpoſed to haue done if I had not beene ouerhaſtened in the buſineſſe; for it had beene to the worke an ornament, and to the Hiſtory a more ample declaration: This faulte I haue now amended in the ſetting forth of this ſecond Booke of <hi>Liuing Creatures.</hi> Al therefore that can be ſaide for your direction, I could wiſh the Hiſtorye more compleat for the manifeſtation of the moſt bleſſed <hi>Trinities</hi> glory, whoſe works are here declared; and for the better reuelation of the ſeuerall natures of euery Serpent. I may fayle in the expreſsing of ſome particular, yet I ſuppoſe that I haue omitted no one thing in their Narration, which might bee warranted by good authority or experience. And therfore, although I cannot ſay that I haue ſaide all that can be written of theſe liuing Creatures, yet I dare ſay I haue wrote more then euer was before me written in any language.</p>
            <p>Now therefore <hi>Aske the Creatures (after God,) and they will tell you:</hi> For, ſayth S. <hi>Auſten, Interrogatio creaturarum profunda eſt conſideratio ipſarum: reſponſio ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, atteſta ipſarum de Deo, quoniam omnia clamant, Deus nos fecit.</hi> The aske<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Creatures is a deepe and profounde conſideration of theyr ſeuerall natures: theyr anſwere is, their atteſtation or teſtimony of God, becauſe all of
<pb facs="tcp:22894:5"/>
them cry out <hi>The Lord hath made vs.</hi> Wherefore, ſeeing it is moſt true, <hi>incogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta non deſiderantur,</hi> things vnknowne are not deſired, to the intent that all true Engliſh Chriſtians may hereafter more affectionately long after and deſire, both the myſticall viſion of God in this world, and alſo his perfect ſight in the worlde to come, I haue (for my part) out of that weake ability wherwith I am endued, made knowne vnto them in their owne mother tongue, the wonderfull workes of God; for the admiring of Gods praiſe in the Creatures, ſtandeth not in a confuſed ignorance not knowing the beginnings and reaſon of euery thinge, but rather in a curious and artificiall inueſtigation of their greateſt ſecrets.</p>
            <p>Therefore, let all liuing men conſider euery part of diuine wiſedome in all his workes; for if it be high, he therby terrifieth the proud; by the truth he fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the great ones; by his affability he nouriſheth the little ones, and ſo I will conclude my preface, with the wordes of the three Children: <hi>O all ye workes of the Lorde, praiſe him and magnifie him for euer.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is no Man that can iuſtly take exception that this Hiſtory of Serpents beginneth at theyr Creation: for ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our purpoſe is, to ſet forth the workes of GOD, by which as by a cleere glaſſe, he endeuoureth to diſperſe and diſtribute the knowledge of his Maieſty, Omnipotencie, Wiſedome and Goodneſſe, to the whole race of Man-kinde, it ſeemeth moſt proper that the firſt ſtone of this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> building, laid in the foundation be fetched from the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation: and the rather, becauſe ſome Naturaliſts (eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly amongſt the auncient Heathen) haue taken the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of theſe venemous Beaſts, to be of the earth, without all reſpect of Diuine and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary Creation. And hereunto ſome Hereticks, as the <hi>Manichees</hi> and <hi>Marciontes,</hi> haue <note place="margin">Auguſtine, Epiphan.</note> alſo ſubſcribed, though not directly, for they account the Creation of theſe venemous &amp; all hurtfull beaſts an vnworthy worke for the good GOD, becauſe they could neuer ſee any good vſe of ſuch creatures in the World.</p>
            <p>Yet we know the bleſſed Trinity created the whole frame of this viſible World by it <note place="margin">Zanchius.</note> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> ſelfe; and for good, reaſonable, and neceſſarie cauſes, framed both the beneficiall &amp; hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Creatures, eyther for a Phyſicall or metaphyſicall ende. Therfore it is moſt certaine, that if we conſider the outward parts of theſe Creatures endued with life, no man nor na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture could begin and make them, but the firſt Eſſence or fountaine of life: and if we can be brought, to acknowledge a difference betwixt our ſhallow capacitie, and the deepe wiſedome of God, it may neceſſarily follow by an vnauoydable ſequele, that their vſes &amp; endes were good, although in the barrenneſſe of our vnderſtanding, we cannot conceiue or learne them. But I purpoſe not to ſollow theſe thinges Philoſophically by arguments, but rather Diuinely by euident demonſtration of the thinges themſelues. And firſt of all, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> it, appeareth, Gen. 1, 24. that God brought forth out of the earth <hi>all creeping thinges after their kinde:</hi> And leaſt that any man ſhould doubt, that vnder the generall name of cree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping thinges, Serpents and other Venemous beaſts, were not intelligibly enough expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, it is added Cap. 3, 1. <hi>That the Serpent was more ſubtile then all the Beaſtes of the fielde which God had made.</hi> The Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> alſo, Pſal. 148, 7. among other thinges which are exhorted by the Prophet to praiſe their Creator, there are named <hi>Dragons,</hi> which are the greateſt kind of Serpents. Vnto this alſo alluded S. Iames, cap. 3, 7. ſaying: <hi>That the whole nature of Beaſtes, and of Birdes, of creeping thinges of the ſea is tamed by the nature of man:</hi> for Man, which is next vnto God, hath authoritie and power, to rule ouer all his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> workes, and therefore ouer Serpents.</p>
            <p>And herein it is fit to ſhew, what wonders men haue wrought vpon Serpents, taming and deſtroying them rather like Wormes and Beaſts, no waies enemies to mankind, but friendly, and endued with ſociable reſpect, or elſe as weaklinges commaunded by a ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour power. Such an one was <hi>Atyr</hi> a notable Inchaunter, who by touching any Serpent <note place="margin">Textor.</note>

            <p>The young man beeing in <hi>Affricke</hi> among the <hi>Negroes,</hi> and lodged in the houſe of a Nephew to the Prince of <hi>Budoniell,</hi> when he was taking himſelfe to his reſt, ſuddenly awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, by hearing the vnwonted noiſe of the hiſſing of innumerable ſorts of Serpents; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at while he wondred, and beeing in ſome terror, he heard his Hoſt (the Princes Nephew) <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> to make himſelfe readie to go out of the doores, (for he had called vp his ſeruants to ſadle his Cammels:) the young man demaunded of him the cauſe, why hee would goe out of doores now ſo late in the darke night? to whom he anſwered, I am to goe a little way, but I will returne againe verie ſpeedily: and ſo hee went, and with a charme quieted the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, and droue them all away, returning againe with greater ſpeed then the <hi>Lygurian</hi> young man his gheſt expected. And when he had returned, he asked his gheſt if hee did not heare the immoderate hyſſing of the Serpents? and he aunſwered, that he had heard them to his great terrour: Then the Princes Nephew (who was called <hi>Bisboror)</hi> replyed, ſaying; they were Serpents which had beſet the houſe, and would haue deſtroyed all their Cattell and Heards, except hee had gone foorth to driue them away by a Charme, which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> was very common and ordinary in thoſe parts, wherein were abundance of very hurtfull Serpents.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Lygurian</hi> young man, hearing him ſay ſo, maruailed aboue meaſure, and ſaid, that this thing was ſo rare and miraculous, that ſcarcely Chriſtians would beleeue it. The <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gro</hi> thought it as ſtrange that the young man ſhould bee ignorant heereof, and therefore told him, that their Prince could worke more ſtrange things by a Charme which he had, and that this and ſuch like, were ſmall, vulgar, and not to be accounted miraculous. For when he is to vſe any ſtrong poyſon vpon preſent neceſſitie, to put any man to death, hee putteth ſome venom vppon a ſword, or other peece of Armour, and then making a large round circle, by his Charme compelleth many Serpents to come within that circle, hee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> himſelfe ſtanding amongſt them, and obſeruing the moſt venomous of them all ſo aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, which he thinketh to containe the ſtrongeſt poyſon, killeth him, and cauſeth the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidue to depart away preſentlie; then out of the dead Serpent hee taketh the poyſon, and mixeth it with the ſeede of a certaine vulgar Tree, and therewithall annoynteth his dart, arrow, or ſwords point, whereby is cauſed preſent death, if it giue the bodie of a man but a very ſmall wound, euen to the breaking of the skinne, or drawing of the blood. And the ſaide <hi>Negro</hi> did earneſtly perſwade the young man to ſee an experiment heereof, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him to ſhew all as he had related, but the <hi>Lygurian</hi> beeing more willing to heare ſuch things told, then bolde to attempt the triall, told him, that hee was not willing to ſee any ſuch experiment. And by this it appeareth, that all the <hi>Negroes</hi> are addicted to Incantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> which neuer haue anie approbation from GOD, except againſt Serpents, which I cannot verie eaſilie be brought to beleeue.</p>
            <p>And ſeeing I haue entered into this paſſage of Charming, being (no doubt) an inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Man, and therefore argueth his power to tame theſe venomous Beaſts, according to the former ſaying of Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> although I condemne ſuch courſes vtterly, yet it is

lawfull to proſecute the ſame, ſeeing the holie Ghoſt, Pſalme 58, verſe 4, 5. arffirmeth a practiſe againſt Serpents, a dexteritie and ripenes in that practiſe, and yet an impoſſibility to effect any good, except the voyce of the Charmer come to the eare of the Adder: For thus hee writeth; <hi>Their poyſon is like the poyſon of a Serpent, like a deafe Adder that ſtoppeth his eare. 5. Which heareth not the voyce of the Inchaunter, though hee be most expert in cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi> Vpon which words, Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> Saint <hi>Ierom,</hi> &amp; <hi>Caſsidorus</hi> wryting, ſay; that when the Charmer commeth to Inchaunt or Charme, then they lay one of theyr eares to the earth ſo cloſe, as it may not receiue ſound, and their other eare they ſtoppe with theyr taile. I will therefore yet adde ſomewhat more of this taming of Serpents.</p>
            <p>I haue heard a Gentleman of ſinguler learning, &amp; once my Worſhipfull good friend, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> and daily encourager vnto all good labours, report diuers times very credibly, vppon his <note place="margin">Ma: Will: Morley of Glynde in Suſſex.</note> owne knowledge and eye-ſight, that beeing at <hi>Padua</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> hee ſawe a certaine Quack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaluer, or Mountebacke vpon a ſtage, pull a Viper out of a box, and ſuffered the ſaide Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to bite his fleſh, to the great admiration of all the beholders, receiuing therby no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger at all. Afterward he put off his doublet and ſhirt, and ſhewed vppon his right arme a very great vnwonted blew veine, ſtanding beyond the common courſe of nature; and he ſaid, that he was of the linage of Saint <hi>Paule,</hi> &amp; ſo were all other that had ſuch veines, and that therefore (by ſpeciall vertue to that Family giuen from aboue) no Viper nor Serpent could euer annoy or poyſon them: but withall, the fellowe dranke a certaine compound water, or antidote, for feare of the worſt, and ſo at one time vented both his ſuperſtitious <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> hypocriſie, and alſo much of his Antidote to his great aduantage.</p>
            <p>But I haue ſince that time alſo read, in <hi>Matthiolus</hi> his Commentaries vppon the ſixth Booke of <hi>Dioſcorides,</hi> that there were wont to be many ſuch Iuglers in <hi>Italy,</hi> carrying in theyr boſomes liuing Serpents, of whoſe fraudulent Impoſtures hee ſpeaketh in this ſort. They take Serpents in the Winter time, when they growe dead and ſtiffe through cold, and yet for their better defence againſt their venomous byting, they defend themſelues by a certaine experimentall vnguent, knowne to bee practiſed in this ſport, made of the Oyle preſſed out of vvilde Radiſh, the rootes of Dragonwort, the iuyce of Daffodill, the braine of a Hare, the leaues of Sabine, ſprigges of Bay, &amp; ſome other few things there-vnto ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. As ſoone as they haue taken them, they inſtantly all to ſpette vpon their heads, for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> by reaſon of a ſecret antipathy in Nature, they grow very dull thereby, and lay aſide the force and rage of venome; for the ſpettle of a Man, is of a cleane contrarie operation to their poyſon. And when afterward they make oſtentation heereof in the Market, or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Stage, they ſuffer them to bite their owne fleſh: but firſt of all, they offer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a peece of hard fleſh, where-vppon they bite to clenſe their teeth from all ſpawne and ſpume of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome, or els ſometime pull forth the little bagges of poyſon, which inhaere in their chaps, and vnder their tongues, ſo as they are neuer more repleate or filled againe: And by this deceit they deceiue the world where euer they come, giuing foorth that they are of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage of Saint <hi>Paule,</hi> who caſt a Viper off from his hands, as wee reade in the holie Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/>
            </p>
            <p>It was an inuention of auncient time among the wiſe Magitians, to make a pipe of the skinnes of Cats legges, and there-withall to driue away Serpents; by which it appeareth, that the ſoueraigntie of Man ouer Serpents, was giuen by GOD at the beginning, and was not loſt, but continued after the fall of man, (although the hand that ſhould rule be much weaker) and practiſed by the moſt barbarous of the world, neceſſitie of defence for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing a violence and hatred, betwixt the Serpent, and the Womans ſeede. For this cauſe we reade of the ſeauen daughters of <hi>Atlas,</hi> whereof one was called <hi>Hyas,</hi> whoſe dailie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe was hunting of venomous Beaſtes, and from her the <hi>Hyades</hi> had their denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And for a concluſion of this Argument, I will adde this one ſtorie more out of <hi>Aelia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</hi> When <hi>Thonis</hi> the King of Egypt had receiued of <hi>Menelaus, Helen</hi> to be ſafely kept, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> whiles he trauailed through <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> it hapned that the King fell in loue with her beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and oftentimes endeuoured by violence to rauiſh her; then, it is alſo ſaid, that <hi>Helen</hi> to turne away the Kings vnlawfull luſt, opened all the matter to <hi>Polydamna</hi> the wife of <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> who inſtantly fearing her owne eſtate, leaſt that in time to come, faire <hi>Helen</hi> ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue her of her husbands loue, baniſhed her into the Iland of <hi>Pharus,</hi> which was full of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:22894:8"/>
all manner of Serpents, and yet taking pittie on her for her ſimplicitie, gaue her a certaine herbe, whereby ſhe droue away all Serpents. For (it is ſaid) when the Serpents and veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous beaſts doe but ſmell the ſame herbe, they inſtantly hide their heads in the earth. <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> comming into that Iſland planted the ſame there, and was therefore called by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, after her owne Name <hi>Helenium,</hi> which the skilfull Herboriſts at this day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme to grow in <hi>Pharus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Vnto this diſcourſe of the taming of Serpents, I may adde yet more ſtrange things, if any thing be ſtrange in the nature of this World. And thoſe are ſome hiſtories of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliaritie of Men, Women and Serpents. <hi>Alexander</hi> was thought to bee begotten of a Serpent, for it is ſaid, that one a time there was found a great Serpent vppon his Mother <note place="margin">Plutarch.</note> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> 
               <hi>Olympia</hi> as ſhee was ſleeping; and ſome ſay (for the honour both of the Mother and the Sonne, that this Serpent was <hi>Iupiter,</hi> turned into the likeneſſe of a Serpent, as wee reade he changed himſelfe into many other ſhapes. And the like ſtory vnto this, is alledged of <hi>Scipio Affricanus</hi> his mother, who long time remained barren without the fruite of the <note place="margin">Ca: Oppius Iul: Higinus</note> wombe, inſomuch as that <hi>P: Scipio</hi> her husband, vtterly diſpaired of poſteritie. It hapned one day, as ſhe was in her bed, her husband beeing abſent, there came a great Snake and lay beſide her, euen in the preſence of the ſeruants and familie, who beeing mightily aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed <note place="margin">Gellius.</note> thereat, cryed out with loude voyces for feare, whereat the woman awaked, and the Snake ſlidde away inuiſibly. <hi>P: Scipio</hi> hearing this report at his returne home, went to the Wiſards to vnderſtand the ſecret or ſignification of this prodigie: who making a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> gaue aunſwere that it betokened prolification, or birth of children, and therevpon followed the birth of <hi>Scipio Affricanus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We reade alſo in <hi>Plutarch</hi> of certaine Serpents, louers of young Virgins, who after they were taken and inſnared, ſhewed all manner of luſtfull, vitious, &amp; amorous geſtures <note place="margin">Pierius.</note> of vncleanenes and carnalitie; and by name, there was one that was in loue with one <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolia</hi> a Virgin, who did accuſtome to come vnto her in the night time, ſlyding gentlie all ouer her body neuer harming her, but as one glad of ſuch acquaintance, tarried with her in that dalliance till the morning, and then would depart away of his owne accorde: the which thing beeing made manifeſt vnto the Guardians and Tutours of the Virgin, they remoued her vnto another Towne. The Serpent miſſing his Loue, ſought her vppe and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> downe three or foure dayes, and at laſt mette her by chance, and then hee ſaluted her not as he was wont, with fawning, and gentle ſlyding, but fiercely aſſaulted her with grimme and auſtere countenaunce, flying to her hands, and binding them with the ſpire of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die <note place="margin">Pierius.</note> faſt to her ſides, did ſoftly with his tayle beate vpon her backer parts. Whereby was collected, ſome token of his chaſtiſement vnto her, who had wronged ſuch a Louer with her wilfull abſence and diſappointment.</p>
            <p>It is alſo reported by <hi>Aelianus,</hi> that <hi>Egemon</hi> in his verſes, writeth of one <hi>Aleua</hi> a <hi>Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalian,</hi> who feeding his Oxen in <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> neere the Fountaine <hi>Haemonius,</hi> there fell in loue with him a Serpent of exceeding bigneſſe and quantitie, and the ſame would come vnto him, and ſoftly licke his face and golden haire, without dooing him any manner of hurt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> at all.</p>
            <p>Theſe, and ſuch like thinges, doe euidently prooue, that Serpents are not onely invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarilie tamed by Men, but alſo willingly keepe quarter with them, yeelding to the firſt ordinance of the Creatour, that made them ſubiects &amp; vaſſals to men. And thus much ſhall ſuffice to haue ſpoken in this place, concerning the firſt creation of Serpents. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/>

               <hi>Of the naturall Generation of</hi> SERPENTS, <hi>and</hi> their ſeuerall Originalls.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T beeing thus cleered, that Serpents were at the beginning crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by GOD, and are ruled by Men, it now followeth, that wee ſhould in the next place talk of the matter of their beginning, and the meanes of their continuance euer ſince their Creation.</p>
            <p>Firſt therefore it is moſt plaine in Geneſis, that the Earth, (by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> the vertue of the Word of GOD) did produce all Creeping things, and among them Serpents: but ſince that time, they haue engendered both naturally, and alſo prodigiouſly.</p>
            <p>As concerning their conſtitution, it is held to be moſt cold, aboue all other liuing Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; <note place="margin">Pliny. Gallen.</note> and therefore <hi>Pliny</hi> writeth, that they haue neither heate, nor bloode, nor ſweat. Heere-vnto ſubſcribeth <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Raſis;</hi> yet <hi>Auicen</hi> ſeemeth to affirme the contrary. <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curiall</hi> decideth this controuerſie, and proueth that Serpents are extreamely cold, &amp; their bodies outwardly moiſt. Firſt, becauſe thoſe which are ſtunge &amp; poyſoned by Serpents, are oppreſſed with an vnnaturall cold, which ouercommeth naturall heate, and diſtendeth all their parts, vexing them intollerably. Secondly, there can be aſſigned no other reaſon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> why theſe Creatures hide themſelues 4. moneths in the yere, but onely their naturall cold, making the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo tender, as they are altogether vnfit to endure any externall frigiditie. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if a Man take a Snake or a Serpent into his handling in the midſt of Sommer, &amp; war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt part of the yeere, yet ſhall he perceiue, that they are cold in a palpable manner being aliue, which is not a qualitie competible to any other creature. Fourthly, ſeeing that blood is the proper and natiue ſeate of all heate in naturall liuing bodies, Serpents hauing a very ſmall quantitie of blood, muſt alſo haue a ſmaller proportion of heate: and therfore it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth vnauoidably, that the eminencie of their temperament, is cold in the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, aboue all other liuing Creatures. And that their bodies be outwardlie moyſt, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth (ſaith <hi>Iſidorus)</hi> by this, that when they ſlide along vpon the Earth, (which way ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> they goe) they leaue behind them in their traine or path a ſlymie humour.</p>

            <p>But moſt ſtrange of all other, are the ſucceeding Narrations. For it is reported that when <hi>L. Scipio,</hi> and <hi>C. Norbanus</hi> were Conſuls, that the mother of <hi>Cluſius</hi> in <hi>Hetruria,</hi> brought foorth a liuing Serpent in ſtead of a childe, and the ſayde Serpent by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund of the Wiſardes was caſt into a Ryuer, neuertheleſſe it woulde not drowne but ſwimmed againſt the ſtreame. And <hi>Pliny</hi> ſayth, that at the beginning of the Marſycke warre, there was a mayd-ſeruaunt that brought foorth another Serpent. And <hi>Fauſtina</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Obſequent.</note> the Empreſſe dreamed that ſhe brought foorth Serpents, when ſhee was with childe of <hi>Commodus</hi> and <hi>Antoninus,</hi> and one of theſe Serpents ſeemed more fierce then the other, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> which proued allegorically true: for afterward <hi>Commodus</hi> was ſo voluptuous and tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, that he ſeemed like a Serpent to be borne for nothing, but for the deſtruction of mankinde.</p>
            <p>In the yeare of the Lorde 1551. there was a little Latine booke printed at <hi>Vienna,</hi> wherein was contained this Hiſtory following. In this Summer (ſayth the Booke) about <hi>S. Margarites</hi> day, there happened moſt rare and admyrable Accidents: for neere a Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage called <hi>Zichſa,</hi> by the Riuer <hi>Theoſe</hi> in <hi>Hungaria,</hi> there were many Serpents &amp; Liſards bred in the bodies of men, very like to ſuch as are bred in the earth, whereupon they fell into exquiſite torments: and there dyed of that calamity, about three thouſand, &amp; ſome of the bodyes being layde againſt the Sunne gaping, the Serpents came foorth of theyr <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> mouthes, and ſuddenly entred into their bellies againe. Amongſt other, there was a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Noble-mans daughter which dyed of that malady, and when ſhe was diſſected or ripped, there were found in her body two great Serpentes. Theſe thinges ſeeme to bee miraculous and aboue the order of Nature: yet credible, becauſe in our experience in England, there haue beene Wormes like Serpentes found in the bodies of men, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſome haue beene eiected the parties being aliue, and other when as the parties were dead. But that theſe beginnings of Serpents being vnnaturall are Diuine and ſent from God as ſcourges, it may appeare by another notable Hiſtory, recorded in the aforena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med booke, both in the ſame yeare, and in the ſame Countrey.</p>
            <p>There was (ſayth mine Author) found in a mowe or rycke of corne, almoſt as many <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> Snakes, Adders, and other Serpentes, as there were ſheafes, ſo as no one ſheafe could be remoued, but there preſently appeared a heape of ougly and fierce Serpents. The coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey-men determined to ſet fire vpon the Barne, and ſo attempted to doe, but in vaine, for the ſtraw would take no fire, although they laboured with all their wit and pollicye, to burne them vp: At laſt, there appeared vnto them at the top of the heap a huge great Serpent, which lifting vp his head ſpake with mans voyce to the countrey-men, ſaying: <hi>Ceaſe to proſecute your deuiſe, for you ſhall not be able to accompliſh our burning, for wee were not bredde by Nature, neither came we hither of our owne accord, but were ſent by God to take vengeance on the ſinnes of men.</hi> And thus much for the true and naturall beginninges of Serpentes. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/>
            </p>
            <p>Now we reade in holy Scripture, that the rod of <hi>Moſes</hi> was turned into a Serpent by diuine myracle, whereby he was aſſured of the power that God woulde giue him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer his people Iſraell out of Egypt, which land abounding with Serpentes, both natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall bredde in the earth, and morall, ſuch are crafty and polliticke Princes and people: yet <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhoulde take them as he did his Serpent by the tayle, and cauſe them to bende
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:22894:10"/>
vnto him like as it were a wand, or elſe ſome other little walking ſtaffe: and alſo that his power ſhould be vnreſiſtable, becauſe his Serpent deuoured others. The Magitians or Sorcerers, (as <hi>Iannes</hi> &amp; <hi>Iambres)</hi> reſiſted him, and alſo turned their rods into Serpents. But <hi>Moſes</hi> did it by true pietie, they by diabolicall deluſions, as falſe Chriſtians many times worke miracles by outward ſignes of true pietie, and therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> rodde ouer-came the Sorcerers Serpents, becauſe the end of fraude and falſhood is, to be ouercome by truth &amp; pietie.</p>
            <p>From this changing of rods into Serpents, came the ſeuerall metamorphoſing of ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry other things into Serpents alſo, as that tale of <hi>Orpheus</hi> head, after he was torne in pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by the <hi>Thraſian</hi> women; and the ſame throwne into a Riuer, was taken vp in <hi>Lemnos.</hi>

When <hi>Cadmus</hi> was ſent by his Father, to ſeeke out his ſiſter <hi>Europa</hi> that vvas rauiſhed by <hi>Iupiter,</hi> with ſtraight charge not to returne backe againe except he could finde her, hauing ſpent much time in ſeeking her, to no purpoſe, becauſe he could not find her, and not daring to goe backe againe to his father; hee was warned by the Oracle that hee ſhould goe into <hi>Baeotia</hi> to build a Cittie. Comming thether, he ſent his companions to the Fountaine of <hi>Mars</hi> that was in the Countrey to fetch water, where a great Serpent came and killed them; at the laſt, <hi>Cadmus</hi> not finding their returne, went likewiſe to the ſame Fountaine, where he found all his men ſlaine, and the Serpent approching to aſſaile him, but he quickly killed it. Afterward he was admoniſhed by <hi>Pallas,</hi> to ſtrew the teeth of the ſame Serpent vppon the ground, which he performed, and then out of thoſe teeth (ſaith <hi>Ouid)</hi> aroſe a multitude of Armed-men, who inſtantly fell to fight one with the other, in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> ſuch cruell and bloodie manner, that at the laſt there were but fiue of them all left aliue, which fiue (by the will of <hi>Pallas)</hi> were preſerued to be the Fathers of the people of <hi>Thebes.</hi> And ſo <hi>Apollonius</hi> faineth, that with the helpe of men bred of Serpents teeth, came <hi>Iaſon</hi> to obtaine the Golden-Flecce.</p>

               <hi>Pierius</hi> writeth, that the myrtle rod was not lawfull to be brought into the Temple of <hi>Necates,</hi> and that a Vine braunch was extended ouer the head of her ſigne: and whereas it was not lawfull to name wine, they brought it into her Temple vnder the name of milke, and that therein continually liued harmeleſſe Serpents. The reaſon of al this was, becauſe that her owne father <hi>Faunus</hi> fell in loue with her, whom ſhe reſiſted with al mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, although ſhe were beaten with a myrtle rodde, and made to drinke Wine; but at laſt the beaſtly father was transformed into a ſerpent, and then hee oppreſsing her with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> the ſpyres of his winding body, rauiſhed her againſt her minde. Theſe and ſuch like ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Fables are extant about the beginninges of ſerpents; all which, the Reader may conſider, to ſtirre vp his minde to the earneſt and ardent meditation of that power that of ſtones can make men, of Rocks water, of water wine, and of ſmall roddes great ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents.</p>
            <p>Then thus hauing expreſſed the originall of ſerpentes in their creation, it followeth now to adde the reſidue of this Chapter about their generacion. It is a generall rule <note place="margin">Pliny. Ariſtotle</note> that all beaſts wanting feet and haue long bodies, performe their worke of carnall copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation by a mutuall embracing one of the other, as Lampreys and ſerpentes: And it is certaine, that two ſerpents in this action ſeeme to be one body and two heads, for they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> are ſo indiuiſibly vnited and conioyned together, and the frame of their body is altogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnapt <note place="margin">Aelianus.</note> for any other manner of copulation. When they are in this action they ſend forth a ranke ſauour offenſiue to the ſence of them that doe perceiue it: And although like vnto many Fiſhes, they want ſtones, yet haue they two open paſſages wherin lyeth their generatiue ſeed, and which being filled, procureth them to their veneriall luſt, the ſeede it ſelfe being like a milky humour; and when the female is vnder the male, ſhe hath alſo her paſſages to receiue the ſeed, as it were into the celles of hir wombe, and there it is framed into an egge, which ſhe hideth in the earth an hundred in a cluſter, about the quantity of a Birdes egge, or a great bead, ſuch as are vſed ſometime by women.</p>
            <p>And this is generall for all ſerpents except Vipers, who lay no egges, but hatch in their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> wombes their young ones, as we ſhall ſhew at large in their particular hyſtory. The ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent hauing layd her egge ſitteth vpon them to hatch them at ſeuerall times, and in a yeare they are perfected into young ones. But concerning the ſuppoſed copulation of ſerpents and Lampreys, I will not meddle in this place, reſeruing that diſcourſe to the hiſtoric of fiſhes, and now only it ſufficeth in this place to name it, as a feigned invention, although ſaint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> and other anncient Writers haue beleeued the ſame, yet <hi>Athae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus,</hi> and of late dayes <hi>P. Iouius,</hi> haue learnedly and ſufficientlie declared by vnanſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able arguments the cleane contrarie. The ſerpents loue their egges moſt tenderly, and doe euerie one of them know their owne, euen among confuſed heapes of the multitude, and no leſſe is their loue to their young ones, whom for their ſafeguard, ſometime they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> receiue into their mouthes and ſuffer them to runne into their bellies: And thus much for the generation of ſerpents.</p>

All their bowels, by reaſon of the length and narrownes of their bodies, are alſo long and narrow, and hard to be diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, becauſe of the diſſimilitude of their figures and ſhapes. Their arterie is long, &amp; their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> throate longer then that: the ground or roote of the artery is neere the mouth, ſo as a man would iudge it to be vnder the tongue, ſo as it ſeemeth to hang out aboue the tongue, eſpecially when the tongue is contracted, and drawne backward. The head long like a Fiſhes, and flatte; neuer much bigger then the bodie, except in monſtrous and great ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped Serpents, as the <hi>Boas.</hi> Yea, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> maketh mention of a Serpent that had 2. heads,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:22894:11"/>
and <hi>Arnoldus,</hi> of a Serpent in the <hi>Piraeney Mountaines,</hi> ſlaine by a ſouldier, that had three heads, in whoſe belly vvere found two ſonnes of the ſaid ſouldier deuoured by him, and the back-bone thereof was as great as a mans skull, or a Rammes head. And ſuch an one we read in our Engliſh ſtory was found in England, in the yeere 1349. And the 23 yeere of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, there was a ſerpent found in Oxfordſhire, neere <hi>Chippingnorton,</hi> that <note place="margin">Holinſhed.</note> had two heads and faces like women, one beeing ſhaped after the new attire of that time, and another after the manner of the old attyre, and it had great winges, after the manner of a Bat.</p>
            <p>The Tongue of a Serpent is peculiar, for beſides the length &amp; narrowneſſe thereof, it is alſo clouen at the tippe, beeing deuided as it were with very little or ſmall nailes points. It is alſo thinne, long, and black of colour, voluble; neither is there any beaſt that moueth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> the tongue ſo ſpeedily: wherefore ſome haue thought, that a Serpent hath three tongues, but in vaine, as <hi>Iſidorus</hi> ſheweth, for they deceiue by the nimblenes thereof. Their ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle is large, like their maw, and like vnto a dogs, alſo thinne, and vniforme at the end. The Hart is very ſmall, and cleaueth to the end of their artery, but yet it is long, &amp; ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth like the reynes of a Man: vvherefore ſometimes it may be ſeene to bend the tippe or lappe thereof to the breaſt ward. After this followeth the Lights, but farre ſeperate from it, being ſimple, full of fibres, and open holes like pipes, and very long: The Liuer long and ſimple; the Melt ſmall and round as in Lizards. The Gall is for the moſt part as in fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes, but in Water-ſnakes it is ioyned to the Liuer: in other Serpents to the ſtomacke or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> maw. All their teeth ſtand out of their mouth, and they haue thirtie ribbes, euen as there were among the Haebrewes and Egyptians thirtie daies to euery month.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, that as their eyes be ſmall, ſo alſo they haue the ſame good hap that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falleth young Swallowes, for if by chance they ſcratch or rend out their eyes, then it is ſaid they haue other grow vp naturally in their places: In like manner their tayles beeing cut off, grow againe. And generally, Serpents haue their hart in the throat, the gall in the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie or ſtomack, and their ſtones neere their tayle: Their egges are long and ſoft, &amp; in their teeth they carrie poyſon of defence and anoyance, for which cauſe they deſire aboue all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things to ſaue their heads. Their ſight is but dull and dim, and they can hardlie looke <note place="margin">Aelianus. Iſidorus.</note> atone ſide, or backward, becauſe their eyes are placed in their temples, and not in theyr <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> fore-head, and therefore they heare better then they ſee. They haue eye-liddes, for gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally no creatures haue eye-liddes, except thoſe which haue haire in the other parts of their bodies; foure-footed Beaſts in the vpper cheeke, Fowles in the nether, or Lyzards which haue egges, or Serpents which haue ſoft backs. They haue alſo certaine paſſages of brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in their noſtrills, but yet they are not ſo plaine that they can be termed noſtrills, but breathing places. Theyr eares are like to finny Fiſhes, namely ſmall paſſages, or hollowe places in the backer parts of their head, by which they heare.</p>
            <p>Their teeth are like ſawes, or the teeth of Combes ioyned one within the other, that ſo they might not be worne out by grinding or grating together; and yet they bend inward, to the end that they may the better hold their meate in their mouthes, beeing without all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> other externall helpe for that purpoſe; for euen thoſe Serpents which haue feete, yet can they not apply them to their chaps. In the vpper chap they haue two longer then all the reſidue, on either ſide one, bored thorough with a little hole like the ſting of a Scorpion, by which they vtter their poyſon. Yet there be ſome good Authors that affirme, that this poyſon is nothing els but their gall, which is forced to the mouth by certaine veines vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ridge or backe-bone. Some againe ſay, that they haue but one long tooth, &amp; that a crooked one, which turneth vpward by often byting, which ſometime falleth off, and then groweth againe, of which kinde thoſe are, which men carry vp and downe tame in their boſoms.</p>
            <p>Although they be great raueners, yet is their throate but long and narrow, for helpe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> whereof when they haue gotten a bootie, they erect themſelues vppon their tayles, and ſwallow downe their meate the more eaſily. They cannot be ſaid properly to haue any neck, yet ſomthing they haue, which in proportion anſwereth that part. They haue tailes like all other creatures, except Men and Apes, and ſome ſay that their poyſon is contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in their tayles, &amp; is from thence conuayed into little bladders in their mouthes, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:22894:12"/>
the Mountebancks or Iuglers, breake that bladder, that they may keepe them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out poyſon, but within the ſpace of twentie foure houres, they are recollected, and growe anew againe.</p>
            <p>Their bodies are couered ouer with a certaine skin like a thinne barke, and vppon Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents it ſupplieth the place that ſcales and haire doe vpon Beaſts and Fiſhes; for indeed it is a pure skinne, and in moſt things they are like to Fiſhes, except that they haue lights, &amp; Fiſhes haue none: the reaſon is, they liue on the Earth, and the Fiſhes in the Sea, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore haue finnes and gilles in ſtead thereof. The little Serpents haue all their bones like thornes, but the greater, which ſtand in neede of greater ſtrength, haue ſolide bones for their firmitude and better conſtitution. It is queſtionable whether they haue any melt or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> no, and ſome ſay they haue at the time of their laying of egges, and not otherwiſe. Theyr place of conception or ſecrete, is large, and ſtandeth farre out, beginning beneath, and ſo ariſing vp to the back-bone double; that is, hauing one skinne or encloſure on either ſide, with a double paſſage wherein the egges are engendered, which are not layd one by one, but by heapes or cluſters together. They haue no bladder to containe vrine, like to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Creatures, which haue feathers, ſcales, or rinde-ſpeckled-skinnes, except the Tortei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: the reaſon is, becauſe of the exiguitie and ſmalenes of the aſſumed humour, and alſo all the humour acquired, is conſumed into a looſe and euaporate fleſh. And to conclude this Anatomie, I will adde a ſhort deſcription vvhich <hi>Gregorius Macer</hi> a Phiſition wrote to <hi>Geſner</hi> 1558. by his owne diſſection as followeth, ſaying. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/>
            </p>
            <p>As I lay at reſt in a greene field, there came vnto mee a great Serpent hyſſing, &amp; hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vp her necke, which I ſuddainly with a peece of vvood amazed at a ſtroake, and ſo ſlevv without perrill to my ſelfe. Afterward, ſticking her faſt to a pale, I drevv off her skin, which was verie faſt and ſharpe, and I found betwixt the skinne &amp; the fleſh, a certaine lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle thinne skinne, deſcending all vppon the body with the outward skinne, and this vvas ſome-what fat. And when I came vnto the place of excrements, I found it like a Fiſhes, but there iſſued forth certaine filth, farre exceeding in ſtinking ſauour the excrements of a man. After I had thus pulled off the skinne, it was eaſie for mee to looke into the inward parts, which I found to anſwere the inward Anatomy of Fiſhes &amp; Fowles in ſome parts, and in other things, there appeared a proper diſpoſition to the Serpent it ſelfe. For the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> 
               <hi>Trachaea</hi> was about three or foure fingers long, turned about with little round cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and ſo diſcended to the lights, vnto which the hart and the bladder contayning the gall, did adhaere or cleaue faſt. Then the liuer was long like the fiſh <hi>Lucius,</hi> and ſo a white caule or fatnes couered both the liuer and ſtomack, which was halfe a ſpanne long: The guttes began at the chappes, and ſo deſcended downe to the place of excrements, as vvee ſee they doe in Fiſhes.</p>
            <p>Beneath the liuer were the guttes, vpon either ſide deſcended a certaine neruy or hard veine, vnto which the egges did cleaue: which were couered with ſuch little skinnes as Hennes egges are before they be layd, but yet they were diſtinguiſhed in ſeate or place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their multitude; for vpon either ſide I found two and thirty egges. The tongue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> of the Serpent was clouen, and very ſharpe, but there appeared not any poyſon therein. And ſo it is euident, that in the veine <hi>Trachaea,</hi> hart and lights, it agreeth with Birdes; in the liuer, guttes and caule, it reſembleth a Fiſh, but in the place of the gall, and diſpoſition of the egges, it differeth from both. And thus farre <hi>Macer,</hi> with whoſe words I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this Chapter of Serpents Anatomie.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>O great is the quantitie of Serpents, and their long during age increaſeth them to ſo great a ſtature, that I am almoſt afraide to relate the ſame, leaſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> ſome ſuſpitious and enuious minded perſons, ſhould vtterly condemne it for fabulous; but yet when I conſider not onely the plentifull teſtimonies of worthy and vndoubted Antiquaries, and alſo the euidence of all ages, (not excepting this wherein we liue) wherein are and haue beene ſhewed publiquely ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Serpents and Serpents skinnes, I receiue warrant ſufficient to expreſſe what they haue
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:22894:12"/>
obſerued, and aſſured aunſwere for all future Obiections, of ignorant, incredulous, and vnexperienced Aſſes. Wherefore as the life of Serpents is long, ſo is the time of theyr groweth and as their kindes be many, (as wee ſhall manifeſt in the ſucceeding diſcourſe) ſo in their multitude, ſome grow much greater and bigger then other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gellius</hi> writeth, that when the Romanes were in the <hi>Carthagenian</hi> warre, and <hi>Attilius Regulus</hi> the Conſull had pitched his Tents neere vnto the riuer <hi>Bragrada,</hi> there was a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of monſtrous quantitie, which had beene lodged within the compaſſe of the Tents, and therefore did cauſe to the whole Armie exceeding great calamitie, vntill by caſting of ſtones with ſlings, and many other deuiſes, they oppreſſed and ſlew that Serpent, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward fleyed off the skinne and ſent it to <hi>Rome,</hi> which was in length one hundred and twentie feete. And although this ſeemeth to be a Beaſt of vnmatchable ſtature, yet <hi>Poſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donius</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> a Chriſtian Writer, relateth a ſtorie of another which was much greater, for hee writeth, that he ſaw a Serpent dead, of the length of an acre of Land, and all the reſidue both of head and bodie, were anſwerable in proportion, for the bulke of his bodie was ſo great, and lay ſo high, that two Horſemen could not ſee one the other beeing at his two ſides, and the widenes of his mouth was ſo great, that hee could receiue at one time with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compaſſe thereof, a horſe and a man on his backe both together: The ſcales of his coate or skinne, beeing euery one like a large buckler or target. So that now there is no ſuch cauſe to wonder at the Serpent which is ſaid to be killed by S. <hi>George,</hi> which was as is reported ſo great, that eight Oxen were but ſtrength enough to drawe him out of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> Cittie <hi>Silena.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is a Riuer called <hi>Rhyndacus</hi> neere the Coaſts of <hi>Bythinia,</hi> wherein are Snakes of exceeding monſtrous quantitie, for when thorough heate they are forced to take the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for their ſafegard againſt the ſunne, and birds come flying ouer the poole, ſuddenlie <note place="margin">Mela. Pliny. Megaſth.</note> they raiſe their heads and vpper parts out thereof, and ſwallow them vp. The Serpents of <hi>Megalauna,</hi> are ſaid by <hi>Pauſanias</hi> to be thirtie cubits long, and all their other part anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. But the greateſt in the world are found in <hi>India,</hi> for there they grow to ſuch a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie, <note place="margin">Solinus. Textor. Strabo. Aelianus.</note> that they ſwallow vp whole Bulls, and great Stagges. Wherefore I doe not maruell that <hi>Porus</hi> the King of <hi>India,</hi> ſent to <hi>Augustus Caeſar</hi> very huge Vipers, a Serpent of tenne cubits long, a Torteiſe of three cubits, and a Partridge greater then a Vulture. For <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> in his nauigation vpon the Red-Sea, ſaith; that hee ſaw Serpents fortie cubits long, and all their other parts and members of the ſame quantity.</p>
            <p>Among the <hi>Scyritae,</hi> the Serpents come by great ſwarmes vppon their flocks of ſheepe and cattell, and ſome they eate vp all, others they kill and ſucke out the blood, and ſome part they carry away. But if euer there were any thing beyond credite, it is the relation of <hi>Volateran</hi> in his twelfth booke of the <hi>New-found Lands,</hi> wherein he writeth, that there are <note place="margin">Aloſius. Gillius. Scaliger. Cardan.</note> Serpents of a myle long, which at one certaine time of the yeere come abroad out of their holes and dennes of habitation, and deſtroy both the Heards and Heard-men if they find them. Much more fauourable are the Serpents of a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Iſland, who doe no harme to any liuing thing, although they haue huge bodies, and great ſtrength to accompliſh their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> deſires.</p>
            <p>In the kingdome of <hi>Senega,</hi> their Serpents are ſo great that they deuoure whole beaſts, as Goates, and ſuch like, without breaking any one of their bones. In <hi>Calechute,</hi> they are as great as their greateſt Swine, and not much vnlike them, except in their head, which doth farre exceede a Swines. And becauſe the King of that Country hath made a Lavv, that no man kill a Serpent vnder paine of death, they are as great in number as they are in quantitie: for ſo great is his error, that hee deemeth it as lawfull to kill a Man, as a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.</p>
            <p>All kindes of Serpents are referred to their place of habitation, which is eyther the earth, or the waters of the earth; and the ſerpents of the earth, are moe in number then the <note place="margin">P. Fagius.</note> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> ſerpents of the vvater, except the ſerpents of the Sea: And yet it is thought by the moſt learned <hi>Rabbines,</hi> that the ſerpents of the Sea, are fiſhes in the likenes of Dragons. Nowe <note place="margin">Venetus.

               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:22894:13"/>

The Iſland <hi>Pharus,</hi> is alſo (by the teſtimony of the <hi>Egyptians)</hi> filled with ſerpents: The Coaſtes of <hi>Elymais</hi> are annoyed by ſerpents; and the <hi>Caſpians</hi> are ſo annoyed by ſerpents which come ſwymming in the floods, that men cannot ſayle that waies but in the Winter-time. For from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Spring, or aequinoctiall, they ſeeme (for their number) to approch fauening, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> like troupes and Armies.

We reade alſo, that ſome places haue beene diſinhabited, &amp; diſpeopled by ſerpents, ſuch were the people of <hi>Scythia,</hi> called <hi>Neuri,</hi> who before the war of <hi>Darius,</hi> were conſtrained to forſake theyr ſoyle, becauſe they were annoyed, not onely <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> with home-bred ſerpents, but alſo with many other which came from other parts: and ſo the Country remaineth deſolate to this preſent day, the ancient Inhabitants beeing all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooued to dwell among the <hi>Buditani.</hi> The Cittie <hi>Amyclae</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> (as <hi>M: Varro</hi> writeth) was deſtroyed alſo by ſerpents.

The like is ſaid of <hi>Ireland,</hi> as our owne Chronicles <note place="margin">Arrianus. Suetonius.

            <p>To come therfore to the more particular abode of Serpents, eſpecially, of ſuch as are knowne to vs, we muſt leaue of the talke and nominaton of Kingdoms, and deſcend to dennes, holes, caues, dunghils, ſheep-coats, valleys, rocks, hollow-walls and trees, woods, greene paſtures, hedges. and ſuch like places, wherein they make their moſt abode: And <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> now and then in theſe Northerne parts of the world (&amp; yet ſildome) they diue downe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the bottome or rootes of trees, eſpecially ſuch as are greene all the Winter-time: For they finde in them a greater heate or warmth, then in other, whoſe leaues fall off and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay in the cold weather, except in the rootes of Birch. And by reaſon of their multitude gathered together at the roote of this tree, it falleth out that their breath heateth the ſame,

and ſo preſerueth the leaues of it from falling off: Wherefore in auncient time, the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant multitude, ſeeing a Birch-tree with greene leaues in the Winter, did call it our <hi>Ladies Tree,</hi> or a Holy tree, attributing that greeneneſſe to miracle, not knowing the former rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or ſecrete of Nature. <hi>Solinus</hi> reporteth of ſuch a like wood in a part of <hi>Affrica,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in all the Winter time, the leaues of all the Trees abide greene, the cauſe is as before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, for that the Serpents liuing at the rootes of the trees in the earth, doe heate the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with their breath. Neither ought any man to wonder that they ſhould ſo friendly liue toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, eſpecially in the winter &amp; cold time, ſeeing that by experience in <hi>England,</hi> we know that for warmth they will creepe into bed-ſtraw, &amp; about the legges of men in their ſleepe; as may appeare by this ſucceeding diſcourſe, of a true hiſtory done in <hi>England,</hi> in the houſe of a worſhipfull Gentleman, vpon a ſeruant of his, whom I could name if it were needfull. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> He had a ſeruaunt that grew very lame and feeble in his legges, &amp; thinking that he could neuer be warme in his bed, did multiply his clothes, and couered himſelfe more &amp; more, but all in vaine, till at length he was not able to goe about, neither could any skill of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian or Surgeon find out the cauſe.</p>
            <p>It hapned on a day as his Maiſter leaned at his Parlour window, he ſaw a great Snake to ſlide along the houſe ſide, and to creepe into the chamber of this lame man, then lying in his bedde (as I remember,) for hee lay in a lowe chamber, directly againſt the Parlour window afore-ſaid. The Gentleman deſirous to ſee the iſſue, and what the ſnake would doe in the chamber, followed, and looked into the chamber by the window; where hee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> eſpied the ſnake to ſlide vppe into the bed-ſtraw, by ſome way open in the bottome of the bedde, which was of old bordes. Straightway his hart riſing therat, he called two or three of his ſeruaunts, and told them what he had ſeene, bidding them goe take their Rapiers &amp; kill the ſaid ſnake. The ſeruing-men came firſt and remoued the lame man (as I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber) and then the one of them turned vp the bed, and the other two the ſtraw, their mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſtanding without at the hole, whereinto the ſaid ſnake had entered into the chamber. The bedde was no ſooner turned vp, and the Rapier thruſt into the ſtraw, but there iſſued forth fiue or ſix great ſnakes that were lodged therein: Then the ſeruing-men beſtirring themſelues, ſoone diſpatched them, &amp; caſt them out of doores dead. Afterward, the lame mans legges recouered, and became as ſtrong as euer they were: whereby did euidentlie appeare, the coldnes of theſe ſnakes or Serpents, which came cloſe to his legges euerie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> night, did ſo benumme them as he could not goe. And thus for heate they pierce into the holes of chimneyes, yea into the toppes of hills and houſes, much more into the bottomes and rootes of Trees.</p>
            <p>When they perceiue that winter approcheth, they find out their reſting places, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they lye halfe dead foure moneths together, vntill the Spring-ſunne againe communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating her heate to all Creatures, reuiueth, and (as it were) raiſeth them vp from death to life. During which time of cold and vvinter, as <hi>Seneca</hi> writeth, <hi>Tuto tractari pestifera ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens potest, non deſunt tunc illi venena, ſed torpent:</hi> They may bee ſafely handled, without <note place="margin">Epist. 5.</note> feare of harme, not becauſe they want poyſon at that time, but becauſe they are drouzie, and deadly aſtoniſhed. But there is a queſtion, whether when they be in this ſecrecie or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> drouzines, they awake not to eate, or elſe their ſleepe be vnto them in ſtead of foode. <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus Magnus</hi> affirmeth of the Northerne ſerpents, that they eate not at all, but are nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with ſleep. <hi>Cardan</hi> ſaith, that they take ſome little foode, as appeareth by thoſe which are carried vp and downe in boxes to be ſeene, and are fedde with branne or cheaſill. But this may be aunſwered, that ſerpents in boxes, are not ſo colde as thoſe in woods and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarts: and therefore, ſeeing cold keepeth them from eating, the externall heate of the box<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, or humane body which beareth them about, may be a cauſe, that incloſed ſerpents feede in Winter as well as in Sommer, and yet the ſerpents which run wild in the fieldes, eate nothing at all, during the time of their <hi>Chias</hi> or <hi>Ehiaus,</hi> that is, their lying hid. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/>

            <p>The foode of Serpents that is permitted them by God, is the duſt of the earth, as may appeare by that firſt and iuſt ſentence, which GOD himſelfe gaue vpon them, for ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing our firſt Parents <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue,</hi> Gene: 3. 14. <hi>Becauſe thou hast doone this thing, thou art accurſed aboue all the Beasts of the field, for thou ſhalt goe vppon thy belly, and eate dust all the dayes of thy life.</hi> And againe, Eſay 65. 25. <hi>Dust ſhall be meate to the Serpent.</hi> And leaſt that we ſhould thinke that this curſe hath not taken hold vpon the Serpent, we may finde the expreſſe practiſe heereof, Michae. 7. 17. Where it is ſaid of Gods enemies, that, <hi>They ſhall licke the dust like the Serpent.</hi> Yet <hi>Aristotle</hi> affirmeth truly, that Serpents are <hi>Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nori,</hi> that is, deuourers of fleſh, fiſh, herbes, or any other thinges; howbeit, heerein they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> paſſe their kind, or elſe the curſe of God reacheth not to any other kinds the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to that alone which deceiued our firſt Parents.</p>
            <p>We haue ſhewed already, how they eate and deuour men, women &amp; children, oxen, ſheepe, and goates, but whatſoeuer they eate, they retaine nothing but the moyſture of it, and the reſidue they eiect whole and vndigeſted. VVhatſoeuer is offered them, that they take, either a bird, or a ſmall chicken, or an egge, hauing it, they take hold but of one end, as of the head of a chicke, or ſmall end of an egge, and ſo ſet it directly before them; then doe they gather themſelues together in as ſhort a compaſſe as may be, that ſo their bodies which ſeeme long and ſmall, beeing extended, may appeare great and wide, reduced into a ſhort and compacted frame. And ſurely, heereby they open and make wider their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> or ſwallow, for then they ſuddenly goble in the beaſt or meate before them, without any great adoe; &amp; hauing kept it in their body till it be dryed from all moiſture, they caſt it out againe as they ſwallowed it vp, at another ordinary place. But for birds &amp; chickens, they ſtriue with them till they haue gotten off their feathers, or els, if they ſwallowe them whole, they eiect the feathers as they doe egge-ſhells.</p>
            <p>The Serpents of the North, doe in the Sommer time eate the fleſh of birds, &amp; herbes, and after the eating of them, they taſt of a little water, or milke if they can attaine it, or els vvine. For this cauſe they will ſuck the vdders of Kine, or Goates, or ſheepe, as hath been ſeene in <hi>England.</hi> Yet is their appetite to drinke but ſmally, as is in all other Creatures, whoſe liuers are fungous, and ſoft like Spunges; and ſo are all beaſtes and creatures which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> lay egges. Aboue all kindes of drinke they loue vvine, and thereof they be drunke, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in <hi>Italy</hi> they ſet pottles of vvine to entrappe Vipers: for if once they ſmell the vvine, they enter the veſſell gladly and ſpeedily, and the vvine or milke whereof they drinke, is poyſoned by them. But in thoſe places of <hi>Affrick</hi> where it neuer raineth, they eate a kinde of black moyſt vvorme, which hath many legges, as is ſaid by <hi>Theophrastus.</hi> And to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:22894:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
their meate and drinke is ſo ſmall, that it is receiued for truth, <hi>Nullum venenatum perit fame vel ſiti,</hi> that no venomous beaſt perriſheth by hunger or thirſt.</p>
            <p>The voyce of Serpents is called <hi>Sibilus,</hi> a hyſſing, and theyr voyce differeth from all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beaſts hyſſing, in the length thereof: for the hyſſing of a Torreiſe is ſhorter and more abrupt. Of this hyſſing voyce ſpeaketh <hi>Lucan,</hi> ſaying;</p>

            <p>Among other things notable in a Serpent, this is one, becauſe it eaſteth off his old age euery yeere, whereof the <hi>Graecians</hi> tell this fabulous reaſon. Once Man-kinde ſtroue ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly with the Gods, by ſupplication for a perpetuall youth, that they might neuer waxe old: and obtayning their deſire, they layd the ſame to be carried vpon an Aſſe The ſillie beaſt waxing ſore athirſt in his trauaile, at laſt came vnto a water, and thereof endeuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red earneſtly to drinke; but the keeper of the ſame water beeing a Serpent, denied leaue to the Aſſe to drinke thereof, except he would grant him his carriage, which was <hi>Perpetuall youth:</hi> The poore Aſſe ready to perriſh for thirſt, eaſily condiſcended therevnto. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vppon the Serpent changeth her age for youth, and men their youth for old age; and the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> Aſſe for his puniſhment, is more tormented with thirſt then any other beaſt.</p>
            <p>But to leaue fables, and to come more neere the marke, the <hi>Latines</hi> call the caſting of their skin, <hi>Anguina ſenectus, ſpolium ſerpentis, &amp; vernatio:</hi> the <hi>Graecians, Opheos derma, ſuphar, leb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Other, that it is nothing but a kind of hard Leproſie, growne vpon them during the Winter time vvhile <note place="margin">Aelianus. Greuinus. Olaus. Mag. Textor. Pliny.</note> they lye hid. Some againe ſay, that they caſt it twiſe a yeere, firſt in the Spring, and then ſecondlie in the Autumne. But by conference of all together it appeareth, that while the Serpents lye hidde, by reaſon of their drought now in the beginning of the Spring when <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> they come firſt abroade, they rubbe off this skinne by ſlyding betwixt two ſtones, or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath ſome roote of a tree, or elſe betwixt ſome boughes or ſmall trees, beginning at the head, and ſo continuing to the tayle. And within foure and twenty houres, that which was raw and bald, beginneth to haue another skinne vppon it; and ſo as a young child or beaſt commeth out of the <hi>Secondine</hi> doth a Serpent come out of his skinne.</p>
            <p>As concerning their eye-ſight, they naturally doe take the iuyce of Fennell, which they eate, and by that recouer their ſeeing againe: and if it happen that they cannot finde ſufficient, they rubbe their dimme eyes there-vpon. And if it happen that any of his ſcales <note place="margin">Mercurialis</note> be bruſed or fall ſenceleſſe, then doe they rubbe themſelues vppon the thornes of Iu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is euer to our woe to be remembred, that which the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe hath left recorded in Geneſis, that, <hi>The Serpent was more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile then all the beaſts which God had made.</hi> By which is expreſſed, the naturall diſpoſition of this beaſt aboue other to ſubtiltie and policie; For I cannot approoue the ſaying of them, who thinke <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> that the deuill at the beginning, might as well haue vſed the tonge of an Aſſe or a dogge to haue deceiued Man, as well as a ſerpents; but ſurely that old Serpent knewe very well, (better then all they which ſpeake the contrary) that he could not haue ſo fit a ſubiect in all the World, as the ſhape, wit, and cunning of a Serpent. And that this came not into the Serpent at that time when the deuill framed his tongue to ſpeake, may appeare by the praecept of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt, where he ſaith; <hi>Be wiſe as Serpents, be innocent as D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And therefore I conclude, that ſubtiltie and prudence, came not to the Serpent as ſpeaking into <hi>Balaams</hi> Aſſe, but rather by nature or creation.</p>
            <p>And yet concerning this laſt ſentence of our moſt bleſſed Sauiour, I cannot but expreſſe the words of <hi>Tzetzes,</hi> who writeth thus vpon it, <hi>Seruate capita vestra, quemadmodum ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens qui inſidijs petitus vapulanſque ad mortem, omnimodò caput ſuum abſcondit, ſic vos à ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannis &amp; impijs cruciati, caput ſeruate mihi, fidem veſtram, &amp; ne Deum negetis vſque ad ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſam mortem:</hi> That is, it is as much as if our Sauiour Chriſt would ſay; Euen as whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent is ſet vpon and ſtrooken, by all the meanes ſhe can ſhe hideth her head, and expoſeth all her other parts to blowes, reſeruing that ſound; ſo you, when you are perſecuted by Tyrants, preſerue your head, that is, your fayth, and deny not your God to death. And <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> this thing is affirmed by all Writers, both diuine and humane, which haue euer touched this poynt, that aboue all the parts of the body the Serpent preſerueth his head. For <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith, that if his body be cut off but two fingers length from his head, he will goe away as if he had no harme at all, and liue longer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paulus Fagius</hi> writing vpon Geneſis, ſaith; It is the opinion of ſome <hi>Haebrues,</hi> that the Serpent at the beginning did goe vpright, and was indued with all the affections of men: but this Iewiſh fable is not worthy to be confuted, becauſe humane affections cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed but fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a reaſonable ſoule, which to aſcribe to the ſerpent, were blaſph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Serpents haue many Epithets giuen vnto them, as illiberall, perfidious, trecherous, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomous, poyſonfull, ſtinging, implacable, furious, ſauage, mercileſſe, deuouret, and ſuch like: And indeed the holy Writers, by a Serpent doe vnderſtand implacable furie: For they are <hi>Immitiſsïmum animalium genus,</hi> a moſt vngentle and barbarous kinde of all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as may appeare by the rage of a little Snake, one of the leaſt of Serpents kinde: for when he perceiueth that he is hurt or wounded, hee neuer ceaſeth caſting out his poyſon, vntill he haue done harme, or die for madnes.</p>
            <p>Two things I find to be notable in Serpents, the firſt is proper to their kind, the ſecond is common to them with Swine, Rats and Mice. Firſt, they are aboue meaſure kinde, not onely to their young ones, but alſo to their egges. For <hi>Funckius</hi> confidently ſweareth, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> that at <hi>Lostorfium</hi> hee ſaw a ſerpents egge taken &amp; caſt into a hot fornace, and when it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to fry in the ſame, whether by naturall inſtinct, or by ſmell thereof, the olde Serpent came, and would haue runne into the fire to fetch it out, but that hee and other ſtrangers by hindered her by killing her.

                  </gap>arian,</hi> who knew the ſame (as he writeth) while hee was a captiue in <hi>Turky,</hi> his words are theſe. In the kingdome called <hi>Genycke,</hi> there is a Citty called <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> about which while I was priſoner with <hi>Baiazeta</hi> King of <hi>Turkes,</hi> there pitched or ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued an innumerable company of Land and Water-ſerpents, compaſſing the ſaid Cittie a mile about. The Land-ſerpents came out of the vvoods of <hi>Trienick,</hi> which are great &amp; many, and the Water-ſerpents came out of the bordering Sea. Theſe were nine dayes together aſſembling in that place, and for feare of them there was not any man that durſt goe out of the Citty, although it was not obſerued that they hurt any man, or liuing crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> there-abouts. VVherefore the Prince alſo commaunded, that no man ſhould trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble them, or doe them any harme, wiſely iudging, that ſuch an accident came not but by Diuine miracle, and that alſo to ſignifie ſome notable euent. Vppon the tenth day, theſe two valiant troupes ioyned battell, early in the morning before the ſunne-riſing, ſo conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing in fight vntill the ſunne-ſet, at which time the Prince with ſome horſe-men, went out of the Cittie to ſee the battell, and it appeared to him and his aſſociates, that the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Serpents gaue place to the Land Serpents. So the Prince and his company, returned into the Citty againe, and the next day went forth againe, but found not a Serpent aliue, for there were ſlaine aboue eyght thouſand: all which, he cauſed preſently to bee couered with earth in ditches, and afterward declared the whole matter to <hi>Baiazeta</hi> by Letters af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> he had gotten that Cittie, whereat the great Turke reioyced, for hee thereby interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted happines to himſelfe.</p>
            <p>But I haue beene too long in this firſt and proper affection of Serpents, namely, theyr mutuall concord; and this example of the Land and Water-ſerpents, doth not breake the common promiſed rule, becauſe it is to be vnderſtood of ſerpents that liue in the ſam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Yet it is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that the Serpent and the Foxe will liue peaceably together in one caue or lodging. There is a ſtory, not vnpleaſant, of a Man that found a Serpent encloſed betwixt two ſtones, and at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treatie
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:22894:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of the ſerpent, he looſed him out of danger, and did him no harme. The Serpent beeing releaſed and free from death, inſtead of other recompence for ſo good a turne, told the Man that hee had beene therein long time incloſed, and was very hungry, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was forced (againſt his will) to make the beſt of his fortune, &amp; therefore muſt needes eate the Man, and bad him prepare himſelfe for death. The man aſtoniſhed at this moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, replyed to the ſerpent, that he hoped hee would not deale ſo with him, hauing deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him from death, now to put his deliuerer to death: and ſaid moreouer, that he would not be the Iudge of his owne caſe, but referre the ſame to the next they found: and the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent alſo yeelded to that iudgement, beeing aſſured that no creature would quit the man, leaſt he ſhould caſt his owne life into perrill. Forth then they went and met with an aſſe, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> to whom the man told the difference betwixt him and the ſerpent, howe kindly hee ſaued the ſerpents life, and how vnkindly, he againe would take away his life. And then the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent bade the Aſſe conſider what iudgement hee gaue, and for whom hee ſpake. The Aſſe adiudged it lawfull for the ſerpent to kill the man. Loe now, ſaide the ſerpent, make you readie, for the matter is iudged againſt you, and withall, began to make force at him with mouth and ſting. But the man ſaid, that hee would not take this Aſſes decree for reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and therefore prayed the ſerpent to tarry yet a little longer, and to try once more the next beaſt they met withall; and the ſerpent thinking himſelfe ſure of the bootie, yeelded there-vnto. Then forth they paſſed againe, &amp; ſhortly after met with a Fox, to whom the man related his caſe, and the benefit he had done to the ſerpent: The ſerpent againe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> he releaſed him, but withall, denyed his caſe to be as the man had ſaid, ſo deſperat, but onely he entrapped himſelfe, the better to compaſſe a bootie.</p>
            <p>The Foxe hauing heard them both, (deſirous to end the matter for the mans benefit) would needes goe with them both, to the place where the ſerpent was incloſed, and ſo all parties conſented. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Fox came thether, he bade the Serpent goe into the ſame place againe, that ſo he might the better iudge of the whole matter. The ſerpent went in againe betwixt the ſtones, and was ſo incloſed as he was before, for he could not ſtirre nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther backward nor forward. Then the Foxe asked the man if this were the ſerpents caſe, from which he had deliuered him? The man anſwered yea, in all poynts. Then hee bade the ſerpent come out againe, as he ſaid hee could, without the helpe of the man. But the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> ſerpent called the man to helpe him againe. Nay, ſaid the Fox, I found you two at vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, becauſe of your diſcharge from this place, and ſeeing nowe you are as you were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and the man as he was before your enlargement, my ſentence is, that when you come forth of that place you are in, then ſhall you eate the man: and if hee will let you foorth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, I will neuer pittie him. By this fable is ſhewed, that Foxes loue not Serpents ſo well as they loue men; and yet they neuer loue men, but they are afraide, ſuſpitious, and vvil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to forſake their familiaritie.</p>
            <p>Some ſay there is a kind of loue betwixt Serpents and Cats, whereof I finde this ſtorie in <hi>Ponzettus.</hi> There were certaine Monks, who all of them fell ſicke vpon a ſuddaine, and the Phiſitians could not tell how or whence this ſickneſſe came, except from ſome ſecrete <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> poyſon. At laſt, one of the ſeruants of the Abbey, ſaw the Cat which was dailie fedde at <note place="margin">Ponzettus</note> the Monks table, to play with a ſerpent; and thereby it was coniectured, that the ſerpent hauing in his ſport, loſt or left ſome poyſon vppon the Cats skinne, the Monkes by ſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the Cat were infected there-with. And the cauſe why the Catte was not harmed thereby, was for that ſhee receiued the poyſon from the ſport, and not from the anger of the ſerpent.</p>
            <p>And this thing ſurely is not ſo maruailous, ſeeing that little Mice and Rats doe alſo play with Serpents, and heerein Politicians play the ſerpents, vvho hold correſpondence and peace both with the Catte and the Mouſe: that is, with two ſworne and naturall enemies together. The like peace and league they are alſo ſaide to keepe with Eeles, as may more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> plainely appeare by this following hiſtorie, of a certaine Monke, called, <hi>Rodolphus a Will Monachus Capellenſis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There vvas (as this Monke affirmeth) one of his fellowe Monks, which did often tell him, that beeing a little boy, and vſing to ſport himſelfe by the water ſide, hee hapned to catch an Eele, which he attempted (for his owne pleaſure) to carry to another water, and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:22894:16"/>
by the way as he went, hee paſſed thorough a vvood, at which time when hee was in the vvood, the Eele began to hiſſe &amp; cry mainelie, at the hearing wheteof, there gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether very many ſerpents round about him, inſomuch that he was afraid, and ſet downe his basket faſt pinned and ranne away; afterward he came againe and ſought for his baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, but he found not the Eele therein, wherefore it was ſuppoſed, that the Serpents deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered the ſame Eele out of the basket, by ſome ſleight of nature: the onely doubt is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Eeles doe hyſſe or not, ſeeing they are fiſhes, and <hi>Omnes piſces m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ti,</hi> all fiſhes are mute or dumbe. But for anſwer to this obiection, it is moſt certaine that Ecles haue a voyce, as all they knowe which vſe fiſhing in the night; for I my ſelfe, haue not onely heard ſuch a voyce in the night time in Riuers, and other waters where Eeles abounded, but haue had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> it confirmed by diuers other, of greater practiſe &amp; experience in fiſhing. The reaſon wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, may be their manner of generation; for they engender not by ſpawne as other fiſhes, but of the ſlyme of the earth or vvater, and differ not fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſerpents in their externall forme, except in their colour, and therefore may be ſaid to partake with fiſhes &amp; ſerpents in both their natures: that is, hauing a voyce like a ſerpent, &amp; a ſubſtance like a fiſh. Such is theyr confederacie with liuing Creatures, and with no more that I euer read or heard of.</p>
            <p>But moreouer, it is ſaid that they loue ſome plants or herbes aboue meaſure, as the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell and Iuy; and for this latter, both <hi>Pliny</hi> and <hi>Textor,</hi> doe not without great cauſe won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that euer there was any honour aſcribed or giuen to the Iuy, ſeeing that ſerpents (the moſt vnreconcileable enemies of man-kind) delight ſo much therein. But herein the deuil <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> blinded their reaſon, as hee did the modeſt women that worſhipped <hi>Priapus,</hi> or the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars,</hi> which at this day worſhip the deuill, to the end that he ſhould do the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no harme. Thus much I can onely ſay of the friends and louers of Serpents, by the multitude whereof wee may coniecture, how among other parts of the curſe of God vpon them, they are held ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed both by man and beaſt.</p>
            <p>Now then it followeth, that we enter into a more particular deſcription, or rather a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of that hatred which is betweene them and other creatures, and firſt I will beginne with their arch enemie, I meane Man-kind. For vvhen GOD at the beginning did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce his ſentence againſt the Serpent, for deceiuing our firſt Parents, among other things he ſaid, <hi>I will put enmity betwixt thee and the Woman, betwixt thy ſeed &amp; the womans</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> 
               <hi>ſeede.</hi> Whereby he did ſignifie that perpetuall warre, and vnappeaſeable diſcord, vvhich ſhould be for euer (by his owne appoyntment) betwixt them. And the truth heereof is to be ſeene at this day, for by a kind of ſecret inſtinct, and naturall motion, a man abhorreth the ſight of a Serpent, &amp; a ſerpent the ſight of a man. And as by the tongue of the ſerpent, was wrought mans confuſion, ſo by the ſpettle of a mans tongue, is wrought a ſerpents a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhment. For indeed ſuch is the ordinance of God, that men &amp; Serpents, ſhould euer annoy and vexe each other. And this, <hi>Eraſmus</hi> ſaith ſhall continue, as long as <hi>memineri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus illius inauſpicati pomi,</hi> we ſhall remember that vnfortunate Apple.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iſidorus</hi> ſaith, that ſerpents are afraid of a man naked, but will leape vpon, and deuoure a man clothed. Which thing is alſo affirmed by <hi>Olaus Magnus,</hi> for he ſaith, that when he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> was a boy hee often tryed it, that when hee was naked, hee found little or no reſiſtance in ſerpents, and did ſafely without all danger combat with them hand to hand. I my ſelfe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in my younger time, when I was about tenne or twelue yeeres old, vſed many times in <note place="margin">At Seauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oake in Kent, which novve belongs to Sir Raphe Boſse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile, Knight. &amp;c.</note> the Spring and Sommer time, to waſh my ſelfe with other my colleagues, in certaine fiſh-ponds, wherein I haue ſeene and met with diuers water-ſnakes, without all harme; and I did neuer in my life, heare of any harme they did to any of my fellowes beeing naked, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did I euer ſee any of them runne away ſo faſt on the Land, as they did fly from vs in the vvater; and yet are not the vvater-ſnakes leſſe hurtfull then the Land-Adders. And this was well knowne to many.</p>
            <p>About the beginning or Fountaine Springs of <hi>Euphrates,</hi> it is ſaid, that there are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſerpents which know ſtrangers from the people of the Country, wherefore they doe <note place="margin">Aelianus. Pliny.</note> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> no harme to the naturall borne Country-men, but with ſtrangers, &amp; men of other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes they fight with might and maine. And along the bankes of <hi>Euphrates</hi> in <hi>Syria,</hi> they alſo do the like; ſauing that if they chaunce to be trode vpon by any of the people of thoſe parts, they bite (like as a dogge doth) without any great harme; but if any other, forrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:22894:17"/>
or ſtranger annoy them, they alſo repay him with malice, for they bite him, and intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerably vexe him; wherefore the Country-men nouriſh them, and doe them no harme. Such as theſe are alſo found in <hi>Tirinthus,</hi> but they are very little ones, and are thought to be engendered of the earth.</p>
            <p>The firſt manifeſtation in nature, of mans diſcord with ſerpents, is their venom; for as in a ſerpent there is a venome which poyſoneth a man: ſo in a man, there is the venom of his ſpittle, which poyſoneth a ſerpent. For if the faſting ſpittle of a man, fall into the iawes of a ſerpent, he certainly dieth thereof. And of this, thus writeth the Poet <hi>Lucretius.</hi>

            <p>The cauſe of this, the Philoſophers (which knew nothing of <hi>Adams</hi> fall, or the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Apple) doe aſſigne to be in the contrarietie, betwixt the liuing ſoules or ſpirits of theſe Creatures: for the Serpents life is cold and dry, and the humane life hote &amp; moyſt, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore either of both abhorreth one the other; and the ſerpent leapeth as farre from a mans <note place="margin">Pierius.</note> ſpittle, as it would doe out of a veſſell of ſcalding water. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Agatharcides</hi> writeth, that there was a King in <hi>Affrick</hi> called <hi>Pſyllus,</hi> whoſe Sepulchre was preſerued in the greater <hi>Syrtes.</hi> From this King there were certaine people named <hi>Pſyllians,</hi> in whoſe bodies there was a certaine inbred and naturall power to kill, or at the leaſt to aſtoniſh Serpents, Spiders, Toades, and ſuch like, and lay them for dead, euen by the ſauour or ſmell of them. And the manner of theſe men, to try the chaſtitie of theyr wiues, was to take their children newly borne, and to caſt them vnto direfull Serpents, for if they were of the right line, &amp; lawfully begotten, then did the ſerpents die before them, but if they were adulterous, and the children of ſtrangers, the ſerpents would eate and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure them. <hi>Pliny</hi> affirmeth, that euen in his dayes, there were ſome of thoſe people aliue among the <hi>Naſomons,</hi> who deſtroyed many of them, &amp; did poſſeſſe their places; yet ſome running from death, eſcaped. Generally, ſuch people were called <hi>Marſi</hi> and <hi>Pſilli,</hi> for the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> 
               <hi>Marſi</hi> were a people of <hi>Italy,</hi> deſcended of <hi>Circes</hi> (as is ſaid) in whom there was a vertue to cure all the ſtinging of ſerpents, by touching the wounded places. Such ſaith <hi>Crates Perga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menus,</hi> are in <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> about the Riuer <hi>Parius.</hi> And ſome are of opinion, that at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning they were <hi>Ophiogenes,</hi> borne or bred of Serpents; or that ſome great Noble man, father of that country, was of a ſerpent made a man. And <hi>Varro</hi> ſaith, that in his time there were ſome few men aliue, in whoſe ſpettle was found that vertue, to reſiſt &amp; cure the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of venomous beaſts.</p>
            <p>But hauing named <hi>Ophiogenes,</hi> or <hi>Anguigenae,</hi> that is, men bred of ſerpents or ſnakes, I ſee no cauſe why it ſhould be iudged, that thoſe which cure ſerpents poyſon, ſhould be ſo miſiudged; for to cure poyſon, is not the worke of poyſon, but of an Antidote, or contrary <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> power to poyſon: and therefore curers &amp; reſiſters of poyſon, are without all learning cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Ophiogenes,</hi> that is, ſerpents broode: but rather, that terme belongeth more iuſtlie to thoſe people, whoſe nature is ſociable with ſerpents, and ſerpents agree with them, as they would doe with their own kind. Such an one was <hi>Exagon</hi> the Embaſſadour at <hi>Rome,</hi> who at the commandement of the Conſuls, (for their experience) was caſt naked into a veſſell or tunne of ſnakes, who did him no harme, but licked him with their tongues, and ſo with great miracle, he was let foorth againe vntouched: and yet there is no more reaſon to ſay, that this man was borne of the linage of ſerpents, becauſe thoſe Men-enemies did not hurt him, then it was to ſay, that <hi>Daniell</hi> was borne of Lyons, becauſe that the Lyons did not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> harme him. Or that <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Remus</hi> were borne of the kindred of Wolfes, becauſe a ſhee Wolfe did nouriſh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

Wherefore they kept a Serpent in a Caue, whom they did nouriſh and worſhippe, which at the charme of the Prieſt would come out of his Caue, and licke the oblations which they ſet vppon his denne; rowling and folding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe round about them, and then would goe in againe: then did theſe abhominable Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks breake theſe oblations into the Euchariſt, and receiue them as ſanctified by the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.

The third yeere the ſerpent came againe to attempt the like ſlaughter; but there among the ſtorkes ſhee found a certaine ſtrange Bird neuer ſeene before, being ſhorter then the ſtorkes, and yet had a great long ſharpe bill, as ſharpe as the poynt of any ſword. This bird (as it ſeemeth) was brought thether by the ſtorkes to guard their young ones, when the Parents were gone abroade to forrage for them. Then, as
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:22894:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſoone as the young ones were hatcht, out commeth the Serpent from his hole, and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to aſſaile the neſts of the ſtorkes, but the guardian bird, (according to the truſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to her) reſiſted the ſerpent, and pecked at her mortally with her ſharpe beake. The ſerpent to end his aduerſary, nimblie aduaunced himſelfe vpright, &amp; endeuoured to reach the bird; but the warie bird, ſoared ſo high aboue his reach, that the langrell ſerpent could not catch him, &amp; ſo they continued in fight, till at laſt the bird killed the ſerpent, after that the ſerpent had once onely faſtened his venomed teeth vpon the bird, which afterward ſo wrought vpon this bird, that all her feathers did flie off from her backe.</p>
            <p>But of all other Fowles enemies to ſerpents, there is none greater or more deadlie, then the bird called <hi>Ibis,</hi> which the <hi>Egyptians</hi> doe wonderfully honour; for when ſwarmes of <note place="margin">Philes Marcedi. Simocratus Diodorus Zoroaſter.</note> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> ſerpents come into <hi>Egypt</hi> out of the Arabian gulfes and fennes, theſe birds meete and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them: and there is ſuch an admirable feate in ſerpents of theſe birdes, that they doe not onely tremble, and fall ſenceleſſe at their ſight, but alſo at the ſight of their feathers: they do harme to no other liuing thing, except Locuſts and Caterpillers, wherefore they are worthily nouriſhed, and called <hi>Inimicae et populatores ſerpentum,</hi> enemies and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of ſerpents.</p>
            <p>All kind of Pullen, as Cocks and Hennes, are likewiſe enemies to the broode of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents. And a good couragious cock, (as <hi>Columella</hi> ſaith) is able to kill and reſiſt a ſerpent. For, (as <hi>Rondoletius</hi> ſaith) he hath found in the croppe or craw of pullen, young ſerpents deuoured by them. But from whence <hi>Albertus</hi> had his relation, that a Henne cannot be hurt that day by a ſerpent wherein ſhe layeth an egge, I cannot tell, and therefore leaue it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> to the Reader to beleeue or refuſe.</p>
            <p>And it is alſo ſaid, that the fleſh of hennes applyed to the bitings of ſerpents, doth cure <note place="margin">Creſcentius</note> them, or els cauſe a hen to ſitte vpon the wounded place; but if the beaſt which is woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, be a cow with calfe, or any ſuch other femall with young, how ſoeuer it fareth with the old one, ſurely the young ones ſhall perriſh.</p>
            <p>There is alſo another bird, which for his combatting with ſerpents, is termed <hi>Ophioma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> a fighter with ſerpents. Although <hi>Geſner</hi> be of opinion, that <hi>Ophiomachus</hi> neuer ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth <note place="margin">Textor.</note> a Bird. Of this Bird the <hi>Septuagints</hi> make mention, Leuit. 11. but many of the better learned, doe interpret it for a Lizard, or a Locuſt, or an <hi>Ichneumon.</hi> The Peacocke <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> alſo is a terrour to ſerpents, ſo as they will not abide within the hearing of his voyce, for it is at perpetuall fewde with all venomous beaſtes. And the Vulture, as wee ſaid before, is a terrour vnto them, inſomuch as one of their feathers burned, will by the ſauour of the ſmoake driue away the ſerpent. And to conclude, the Swallowes alſo are at variance with the ſerpents broode, for the ſnake will creepe vp to the ſwallowes neſt, &amp; therein ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſurprize the young, for the old ones will flye away chattering, and chirping in mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſort, not beeing able to hinder or reſiſt their chicke-deuouring foes. But at the laſt, when they ſee all their young ones diſpatched, as if they could not endure to liue for ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, or els thinking it poſſible to fly into the ſnakes belly to fetch out againe their deuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red young ones, they fall downe vpon their enemies iawes, doing what they can to make <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> them deuoure and ſwallow them vp alſo. And thus much for the hatred betwixt fowles <note place="margin">Oppianus</note> and ſerpents: Wherein, although they kill the ſerpent, either in their owne defence, or els for rauen &amp; pray, yet may we admire the prudence of the moſt mightie Creator, who hath ſo diſpoſed of his power, that he cauſeth the fowles of heauen, to reuenge mans quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell vpon the ſerpents of the earth, by whoſe ſubtiltie man was plucked from heauen, and they made ſubiect to corruption.</p>
            <p>In the next place, God hath alſo framed an oppoſition betwixt ſerpents, &amp; the beaſts of the earth and water, which liue with ſerpents in the ſame Element, that ſo they might be both annoyed at home and abroade. I will therefore beginne with the dogge, who is a notable enemie to the ſerpents, as I my ſelfe haue ſeene many in England, for hee vvill <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> earneſtly ſeeke them out with noſe and foote, both in waters, dunghills, and hedges, and when he hath found any one, he will ſuddainly ſnatch him into his mouth, biting him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the middle, &amp; ſo holding it in equall poyſe, will fling and ſhake it about his eares very faſt and violently, till hee perceiue it can ſtirre no more, and then ſuddainly againe letteth it fall out of his mouth to the earth, but if it beginne to ſtirre, he ſnatcheth it vp againe, and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:22894:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſhaketh it about his eares as before, and ſo neuer giueth ouer till it appeare dead: but they ſildome kill them, onely they aſtoniſh them, and ſo may a young childe knock out theyr braines. Howbeit, when they fight in defence of their Maiſters, then they kill them, by byting them in peeces. And yet is it more ſafe for them, to aſtoniſh them, and leaue them for dead, by ſhaking them about their eares, then by biting them in pecces, for that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly then, while they ſhare them aſunder, they are ſtung or bitten by the ſerpent. And this I haue ſeene often in mine owne experience. But one of the greateſt enemies of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, are Harts, a timorous beaſt of all other, and yet greedie to combat with the ſerpent, vvherefore I will briefely deſcribe this their war and hatred, out of <hi>Solinus, Aclianus, Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch,</hi> and <hi>Oppianus.</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/>
            </p>
            <p>The Hart will greedily follow out the path of the ſerpent, and finding it lodged in his denne or hole, by the vertue of his noſe draweth it out of the earth, and thereof ſome haue deriued <hi>Elaphos</hi> a Hart, of <hi>Elanein tous opheis,</hi> that is, driuing away of ſerpents. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I thinke it not reaſon to follow the opinion of <hi>Aclianus,</hi> who intreating of Harts draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſerpents out of the earth, ſaith; that the ſerpent is inticed and allured out of her hole, by the breath of the Hart, as by a Philtre or Cup of loue; for ſeeing that there is ſo great an hoſtilitie, and antipathy in nature, betwixt their whole diſpoſition, howe can it come from any ſecret ſympathy, that the ſerpent (which is the ſubtilleſt of all beaſtes) ſhould be bewitched with the loue of his enemies breath? But if it be ſaid that Serpents, which are by nature very cold, can eaſily be drawne forth by a warmer breath, as it were by the ſweet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> beames of the hot ſunne; how then falleth it not out, that when any other beaſt breatheth vpon their lodging, and into their dennes, they are not remooued? But let it be granted, that the warmeneſſe of the Harts breath maketh him forſake his denne, yet it cannot be aſcribed to any ſecret in nature, as if there were a fire of loue in the Harts throat or bones, but onely from the naturall concomitant qualitie of heate, with expiration, reſpiration, &amp; inſpiration: and therefore I cannot but conclude, that there is not any poſſibilitie or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilitie in nature, that where the ſpirits, which take and make the breath, are at ſuch va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance, there the breath proceeding from the one aduerſary, ſhould ſo inchaunt &amp; beguile the other.</p>
            <p>But the true cauſe of this extraction of ſerpents out of their lodgings, is as I coniecture, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> not her warme breath, that allureth, nor yet ſcorcheth and burneth her aduerſary, but that when the Hart hath found the denne of the Serpent, by her violent attraction of the ayre out from the ſerpent, ſhe enforceth it for the ſafegard of life to follow it out of the denne. As when a veſſell is broched, or vented, the vvine followeth the flying ayre; or as a Cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping-glaſſe draweth blood out of a ſcarified place of the body: and ſo is a ſerpent againſt her will, drawne to followe the breath of her deſtroyer. <hi>Oribaſius</hi> and <hi>Gunterius,</hi> doe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe vnto this opinion, and take it for moſt conſonant to reaſon and truth, and therfore I will not follow it any further: for by the ſelfe ſame manner doe the Sea-Rammes drawe the Sea calfes out of their lodgings among the Rocks vnder the earth, for when they haue found the Calfe, they keepe them from ayre, and preuent their refrigeration. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/>
            </p>
            <p>When the ſerpent ſeeth himſelfe ſo drawne forth by his aduerſarie, hee beeing aboue meaſure incenſed to rage, flyeth away, and maketh his poyſon more noyſome, violent &amp; powerfull, for which cauſe, there was wont to be a prouerbiall caueat or warning: <hi>Caue ne incideris in ſerpentem, quum extracta à latebris anhelitu cerui, effugerit, tum enim propter iracundiam vehementius ei venenum est.</hi> Take heede leaſt you meete with a ſerpent flying away from the Hart, after ſhe is drawne out of her denne by her breath, for then, by reaſon of her rage, her poyſon is more ſorcible. But I will proceede to the more ſtrange &amp; won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull combat betwixt ſerpents and Harts. For when the ſerpent perceiueth the vnauoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able danger, and that ſhe muſt needes fight for her life, ſhe hyſſeth ſtrongly, lifting vp her head from the earth, euen to the throat of the Hart, &amp; thereat catcheth &amp; gnaſheth with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> her teeth; but on the other ſide, the valiant Hart, (if ſuch a word may be giuen to a feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full beaſt) as it were deriding his aduerſaries weake endeuours to harme, ſuffereth the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent to wind about his breaſt and belly, and to embrace both necke and legges with his long and weake bodie, that ſo he may haue the more power vpon it, for he teareth it into an hundred peeces.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:22894:20"/>
But the moſt ſtrange combats, are betwixt the Harts and Serpents of <hi>Libia,</hi> where ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred hath his deepeſt footing, for there the ſerpents watch the Hart when he lyeth downe to ſleepe vpon the ground, and beeing a multitude of them, ſet vpon him altogether, faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their poyſonfull teeth in euery part of his skinne, ſome on his neck and breaſts, ſome on his ſides and backe, ſome on his legges, and ſome hanging vpon his priuie partes, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him with mortall rage, to end and ouerthrow him. The poore Hart beeing thus op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with multitude, and aſſailed without any warning to the battell, in vaine attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to runne away, for their cold earthy bodies, winding tayles, and pinching teeth, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his wonted pace, and ouer-charge his ſtrength: whereat beeing forced to quite him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in the beſt manner he can, enraged with teeth, feete and hornes, aſſaileth his enemies, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> whoſe ſpeares and arrowes of teeth and ſtinges, ſticke ſo faſt in his body; tearing them in peeces which he can touch with his teeth, beating others aſunder where he can reach the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with his hornes, and trampling vnder his feete thoſe which cleaue to his lower parts: and yet ſuch is the rage and dauntleſſe courage, or rather hatred of theſe enemies, not willing to die alone, (but like Champions to end their liues vppon and with their aduerſarie) doe ſtill hold faſt, and euen when their bodies are beaten in peeces, their heads ſticke cloſe, and hang ſharpe vpon the Harts skinne, as though they would grow with him, and neuer fall off, till he ſhould alſo fall downe dead. But the Hart feeling ſome eaſe, and hauing by the ſlaughter of their bodies deliuered his feete from thraldome, by a diuine naturall inſtinct, flyeth and runneth faſt to ſome adioyning fountaine, where hee ſeeketh for Sea-crabbes, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> whereof he maketh a medicine, that ſhaketh off their heads which cleaue ſo faſt vnto him, and alſo cureth all their wounds and poyſon. This valiant courage is in Harts againſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, neuer yeelding, tyring, or giuing ouer, and yet otherwiſe, are afraid of Hares and Connyes by nature.</p>
            <p>But what is the cauſe of this hoſtilitie betwixt Harts and ſerpents? is it for meate, or for medicine and cure? Surely they would abhorre to eate them, if it were not for health and naturall medicine, for ſometimes the pores of their body are dulled and ſhut vp, ſomtimes the wormes of their belly, doe aſcend vp into the roofe of their mouthes while they chew the cudde, and there cleaue faſt; for remedie whereof, the Hart thus afflicted, runneth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to ſeeke for ſerpents, for the eating of a ſerpent cureth this maladie. <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> when the Hart waxeth old, and perceiueth that his ſtrength decayeth, haire changeth, &amp; his bodie beginnes to be feeble, then for the renewing of his ſtrength, he firſt deuoureth a ſerpent, and afterward runneth to ſome fountaine of water, wherof when he hath drunk, he findeth a ſenſible alteration, both in horne, haire, and whole bodie. And this thing is alſo deliuered by the Writer of the Gloſſe vpon the 42 Pſalme, which beginneth, <hi>Like as the Hart deſireth the water ſprings, ſo longeth my ſoule after my GOD.</hi> But for the ending of this queſtion, we muſt conſider and remember, that there are two kinds of Harts, one eateth ſerpents, and feeling the poyſon to worke, ſtraight-way by drinking caſteth vp the poyſon againe, or elſe cureth himſelfe by couering all his body ouer in water. The other kind onely by nature killeth a ſerpent, but after victorie forbeareth to eate it, and returneth againe to feede in the Mountaines. And thus much for the diſcorde betwixt Harts and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> Serpents.</p>
            <p>In the next place, great is the variance betwixt Serpents, Dragons &amp; Elephants, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>Pliny</hi> &amp; <hi>Solinus</hi> write as followeth. When the Elephants, called Serpent-killers, meete with the Dragons, they eaſily tread them in peeces, and ouer-come them, wherefore the Dragons and greater ſerpents, vſe ſubtiltie in ſtead of might, for when they haue found the path, and common way of an Elephant, they make ſuch deuiſes therein to intrap him, as a man would thinke they had the deuiſe of men to helpe them, for with their tayles they ſo enſnare the way, that when the beaſt commeth, they entangle his legges as it were in knots of ropes; now when the beaſt ſtoopeth downe with his trunke to looſe and vntie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> them, one of them ſuddenly thruſteth his poyſoned head into his trunke, whereby hee is ſtrangled. The other alſo, (for there are euer many which lye in ambuſh) ſet vpon his face, byting out his eyes, and ſome at his tender belly: ſome wind themſelues about his throat, and all of them together, ſting, bite, teare, vex &amp; hang vpon him, vntill the poore beaſt, emptied of his blood, and ſwollen with poyſon in euery part, fall downe dead vppon his
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:22894:21"/>
aduerſaries, and ſo by his death kill them at his fall and ouerthrow, whom hee could not ouer-come beeing aliue. And whereas Elephants (for the moſt part) goe together in flocks and troupes, the ſubtile ſerpents doe let paſſe the formoſt of euery rancke, and ſette onely vpon the hindermoſt, that ſo one of the Elephants may not helpe another; &amp; theſe ſerpents are ſaid to be thirtie yardes long.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe, foraſmuch as theſe Dragons know, that the Elephants come and feede vpon the leaues of trees, their manner is to conuay themſelues into the trees, and lye hid among <note place="margin">

            <p>It is reported that the blood of Elephants is the coldeſt blood in the world, &amp; that the Dragons in the ſcorching heate of Summer, cannot get any thing to coole the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> except this blood: for which cauſe they hide themſelues in Riuers &amp; Brookes, whether the Elephants come to drinke, and when he putteth downe his trunck they take hold thereof, &amp; inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie in great numbers leape vp into his eares, which onely of all his vpper parts, are moſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and vnarmed, out of which they ſuck his blood, neuer giuing ouer their holde till hee fall downe dead, &amp; ſo in the fall, kill them which were the procurers of his death.

            <p>The Cat alſo, by <hi>Albertus</hi> is ſaid to be an enemie to ſerpents, for hee ſaith ſhee will kill them, but not eate thereof; howbeit, in her killing of them, except ſhe drinke incontinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſhe dieth by poyſon.

            <p>The Roes or Roe-bucks do alſo kill ſerpents, &amp; the Hedge-hogge is enemy vnto them, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> for ſometimes they meete both together in one hole, and then at the ſight of the ſerpent, the hedge-hogge foldeth himſelfe vp round, ſo as nothing appeareth outwardly, ſaue one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie his prickles and ſharpe briſtles: the angry ſerpent ſetteth vpon him, and biteth him with all her force; the other againe, ſtraineth herſelfe aboue meaſure, to annoy the ſerpents teeth, face, eyes, and whole body: and thus when they meete, they lie together afflicting one another, till one, or both of them fall downe dead in the place.

And thus I will end the warre betwixt ſerpents, and foure-footed beaſtes and fowles.</p>
            <p>Novv leaſt their curſe ſhould not be hard enough vnto them, God hath alſo ordained one of them to deſtroy another, and therefore now it followeth, to ſhewe in a word, the mutuall diſcord betwixt themſelues. The Spider (although a venomous creature) yet is it an enemie to the ſerpent, for when ſhee ſeeth a ſerpent lye vnder her tree in the ſhadow, <note place="margin">Pliny.</note> ſhe weaueth or twiſteth a thred downe from her vveb vppon the head of the ſerpent, and ſuddenly byteth into his head a mortall wound, ſo that he can do nothing but onely roule to and fro, beeing ſtrooken with a Megrim, whereby hee hath not ſo much power, as to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> breake the Spiders thred hanging ouer his head, vntill he be dead and ouerthrowne.

            <p>The Lyzard, a kind of ſerpent, is moſt friendly to man, &amp; very irefull againſt ſerpents, to the vttermoſt of his power, whereof <hi>Eraſmus</hi> (in his booke of friendſhippe) telleth this ſtorie: I ſaw (ſaith hee) on a day, a very great Lyzard fighting with a ſerpent in the verie mouth of a Caue, at the firſt ſight whereof I maruailed at the matter, for the ſerpent was not viſible our of the earth: there was with me an <hi>Italian,</hi> who ſaid, that ſurely the Lyzard had ſome enemy within the Caue. After a little while the Lizard came vnto vs, &amp; ſhewed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> vs his ſide all wounded, as it were crauing helpe, for the ſerpent had bitten him ſore, for of greene, he made him appeare redde, and this Lyzard did ſuffer himſelfe to be touched of vs. Thus ſaith <hi>Eraſmus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe, in the ſame place he ſaith, that when a Lyzard ſaw a ſerpent lye in waite to ſet vpon a man beeing a ſleepe, the Lyzard ranne to the man, and neuer ceaſed running vpon the mans face, ſcratching his necke and face gentlie with his clawes, vntill he had awaked the man, and ſo diſcouered to him his great danger. The Locuſt alſo fighteth with a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and killeth him when he luſteth, for he getteth hold with his teeth vppon his lower chappe, and ſo deſtroyeth him; but this is not to be vnderſtood of euery kinde of Locuſt, but onely of one kind, which for this cauſe is called <hi>Ophiomachum genus.</hi>

            <p>But there is not any thing in the worlde that fighteth more earneſtly againſt ſerpents then Sea-crabbes &amp; Creuiſes, for when the Sunne is in <hi>Cancer,</hi> ſerpents are naturally tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with paines and feauers, and therefore if ſwine be ſtunge or bitten with ſerpents, <note place="margin">Thraſillus Pliny.

There is a great water neere <hi>Epheſus,</hi> at the one ſide whereof there is a Caue full of many noyſome &amp; irefull ſerpents, whoſe bytings by often probation, haue beene very deadly both to men and beaſtes. Theſe ſerpents doe oftentimes endenour to crawl ouer the poole; now on the other ſide there are great ſtore of Crabbes, who when they ſee the ſerpents come crawling or ſwimming, they inſtantly put out their crooked legges, &amp; as it were with tonges or pynſars, reach at the ſlyding ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, where-withall the ſerpents are ſo deterred, that through their ſight, &amp; often remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of their vnhappy ſucceſſe with them, they turne backe againe, and neuer dare any more aduenture to the other ſide.

To conclude, not onely liuing creatures, but alſo ſome kind of earth and plants are enemies to ſerpents: and therfore moſt famous are <hi>Ebuſus</hi> &amp; <hi>Creete,</hi> as ſome ſay, although <hi>Bellonius</hi> ſay, that there are <hi>Scolopendraes</hi> Vipers, and Slow-wormes in <hi>Creete,</hi> yet he ſaith they are without venome: and there are very fewe in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>

This antipathy with Serpents, proceedeth from liuing to dead and vegetable things, as trees, herbes, and plants, as may be ſeene by this diſcourſe following.</p>
            <p>There is ſuch vertue in the Aſhe-tree, that no Serpent will endure to come neere either the morning or euening ſhadow of it, yea though very farre diſtant from them, they do ſo deadlie hate it. We ſet downe nothing but that wee haue found true by experience: If a great fire be made, and the ſame fire encircled round with Aſhen-boughes, &amp; a ſerpent put betwixt the fire and the Aſhen-boughes, the ſerpent will ſooner runne into the fire, then come neere the Aſhen-boughes: Thus ſaith <hi>Pliny. Olaus Magnus</hi> ſaith, that thoſe Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> Countries which haue great ſtore of Aſh-trees, doe want venomous beaſts, of which opinion is alſo <hi>Pliny. Callimachus</hi> ſaith, there is a Tree growing in the Land of <hi>Trachinia,</hi> called <hi>Smilo,</hi> to which if any Serpents doe either come neere, or touch, they foorth-with die. <hi>Democritus</hi> is of opinion, that any Serpent will die if you caſt Oken-leaues vpon him. <hi>Pliny</hi> is of opinion, that <hi>Alcibiadum,</hi> which is a kind of wild Bugloſſe, is of the ſame vſe &amp; qualitie; and further, beeing chewed, if it be ſpet vpon any ſerpent, that it cannot poſſibly <note place="margin">Aelianus.

In time of thoſe ſolemne Feaſtes which the <hi>Athenians</hi> dedicated to the Goddeſſe <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,</hi> their women did vſe to lay and ſtrew their beddes, with the leaues of the Plant called <hi>Agnos,</hi> becauſe ſerpents could not endure it, and becauſe they imagined it kept them chaſt, Where-vpon they thought the name was giuen it.

            <p>The <hi>Egyptians</hi> doe giue it out, that <hi>Polydamna,</hi> the wife of <hi>Thorris</hi> their King, taking pittie vpon <hi>Helen,</hi> cauſed her to beſet on ſhore in the Iland of <hi>Pharus,</hi> and beſtowed vpon her an herbe (whereof there was plenty) that was a great enemy to ſerpents: whereof the ſerpents hauing a feeling ſence (as they ſay) and ſo readily knowne of them, they ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies got them to their lurking holes in the earth: and <hi>Helen</hi> planted this herbe, who co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And <hi>Cardan</hi> the Phiſitian hath obſerued as much, that ſerpents, not any thing that is venomous, will neither lodge, dwell or lurk priuily neere vnto <hi>Trifolie,</hi> becauſe that it is their bane, as they are to other liuing creatures: and therfore it is ſowne to very good purpoſe, &amp; planted in very hot cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tries, where there is moſt ſtore of ſuch venomous crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. <hi>Arnoldus Villanouanus</hi> ſaith, that the herb called <hi>Dracontea</hi> killeth ſerpents. And <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentinus</hi> affirmeth, that if you plant woormwood, Mugwort, or Sothernwood about your dwelling, that no venomous ſerpents will euer come neer, or dare enterpriſe to invade the ſame. No ſerpent is found in Vines when they flouriſh, bearing flowers or bloſſoms, for they abhor the ſmell, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith. <hi>Auicen</hi> an <hi>Arabian</hi> Phiſitian, ſaith, that Capers doe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> kill wormes in the guts, &amp; likewiſe ſerpents.

               <hi>Paulus Venetus,</hi> in his ſecond booke, chap. 40, writeth, howe that in the Prouince of <hi>Caraiam,</hi> there be ſerpents of exceeding greatnes, which beeing killed, the inhabitants of the Country doe pull out their gall, which they vſe to prize at a verie high rate when they ſell any of it, for it is very medicinall: ſo that they which are byt of a madde dogge, if they take inwardlie in any drinke but the quantitie of a penny weight of this gall, they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently cured. And if a woman be in her trauaile of child-birth, if ſhee taſt neuer ſo little of this gall, the birth will be the more ſpeedie. So, if any be troubled either with the Pyles or Haemerrhoides in the fundament, if that the place be annoynted with this gall, after a few <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> dayes, he is ſet free from his diſeaſe. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> giueth the ſeede of ſerpents as a remedie againſt the ſuffocation of the belly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nicholaus Myrepſus</hi> preſeribeth this medicine againſt ſtraines &amp; hardneſſes.

And with him agreeth <hi>Pliny,</hi> who expreſly affirmeth, that the aſhes of ſnakes and ſerpents; beeing annoynted vpon <hi>Strumes,</hi> eyther with oyle or waxe, is a ſinguler medicine. And likewiſe to drinke the aſhes of a ſerpent, that is burrit to pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in new earthen potte, is very good: but it will be the more effectuall, if the ſerpents be killed betweene two tracks or forrowes that are made with Cart-wheeles. The aſhes of a ſerpent burnt with ſalt in a pot, beeing put with oyle of Roſes into the contrary eare, help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the tooth-ach.</p>

They vſe to mixe it with the emplaiſter of <hi>Iohn de Vigo,</hi> that famous Chirurgeon) for all hardneſſes, nodes, and other priuie &amp; vnſeene (though not vnfelt) torments proceeding of the Spaniſh-poxe. They vſe it yet further, againſt leprous ſwellings, and pimples, and to ſmooth and thinne the skinne. <hi>Matthiolus</hi> ſaith, that the fat of a black Serpent, is mixt to good purpoſe with thoſe oyntments that are prepared againſt the French or Spaniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pox. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> And <hi>Pliny</hi> mixeth their fat with other conuenient medicines, to cauſe haire to grow againe. The ſuffumigation of an old ſerpent, helpeth the monthlie courſe. <hi>Michaell Aloi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> ſaith, that oyle of Serpents decocted with the flowers of Cowſleps, (euer remembring to gather and take that which ſwimmeth at the toppe) is ſinguler to annoynt podagricall perſons there-with.</p>
            <p>NOvv followeth the preparing of Serpents. Take a Mountaine-Serpent, that hath a blacke backe, and a vvhite bellie, &amp; cut off his taile, euen hard to the place where he ſendeth forth his excrements, and take away his head with the breadth of foure fingers, then take the reſidue &amp; ſquiſe out the blood into ſome veſſell, keeping it in a glaſſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> carefully, then fley him as you doe an Eele, beginning from the vpper &amp; groſſer part, and hang the skinne vpon a ſtick and dry it, then deuide it in the middle, and referue all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently. You muſt waſh the fleſh and put it in a pot, boyling it in two parts of Wine, and beeing well and throughly boyled, you muſt ſeaſon the broth with good ſpices, and Aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall or cordiall powders, and ſo eate it. But if you haue a mind to roſt it, it muſt be ſo
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:22894:23"/>
roſted, as it may not be burnt, and yet that it may be brought into powder, and the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thereof muſt be eaten together with other meat, becauſe of the loathing, and dreadfull name, and conceit of a ſerpent: for beeing thus burned, it preſerueth a man from all feare of any future Lepry, and expelleth that which is preſent. It keepeth youth, cauſing a good colour aboue all other Medicines in the vvorld; it cleereth the eye-ſight, gardeth ſurelie from gray haires, and keepeth from the Falling-ſicknes. It purgeth the head from all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie, and beeing eaten (as before is ſaid) it expelleth ſcabbines, &amp; the like infirmities, with a great number of other diſeaſes. But yet ſuch a kind of Serpent as before wee haue deſcribed, and not any other, beeing alſo eaten, freeth one from deafenes.</p>
            <p>You may alſo finelie mince the heads and tayles of Serpents, &amp; feede there-with chic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> or geeſe, beeing mingled with crummes of bread or Oates, and theſe Geeſe or Chic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins beeing eaten, they helpe to take away the Leproſie, and all other fouleneſſe in mans bodie. If you take the dryed skinne, and lay it vppon the tooth on the inner ſide, it will mittigate the paine thereof, ſpecially if it proceede from any hote cauſe. In like ſort, the ſame skinne waſhed with ſpettle, and with a little peece of the taile laid vppon any Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtume, or <hi>Noli me tangere,</hi> it will tame and maſter the paine, cauſing it to putrefie more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilie and gentlie, and ſcarcely leauing behind any cicatriſe or skarre. And if a woman bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in extremitie of paine in child-birth, do but tye or bind a peece of it on her belly, it will cauſe the birth immediatly to come away.

The fat of a ſerpent, ſpeedily helpeth all rednes, ſpots, &amp; other infirmities of the eyes, and beeing annoynted vpon the eye-liddes, it cleereth the eyes exceedingly. Item, put them into a glaſſed ſpot, and fill the ſame with Butter in the Month of May, then lute it well with paſte (that is, Meale well kneaded) ſo that nothing may euaporate, then ſette the pot on the fire, and let it boyle wel-nigh halfe a day; after this is done, ſtraine the But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter through a cloth, and the remainder beate in a morter, and ſtraine it againe, and mixe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> them together, then put them into water to coole, &amp; ſo reſerue it in ſiluer or golden boxes, that which is not cuaporated, for the older, the better it is, and ſo much the better it will be, if you can keepe it fortie yeeres. Let the ſicke patient, who is troubled eyther with the Goute, or the Palfie, but annoynt himſelfe often againſt the fire with this vnguent, and without doubt he ſhall be freed, eſpecially if it be the Goute. All theſe preſcriptions and directions, were taken from the writings of a certaine nameleſſe Author.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaith, that a Hart or Stagge hauing eaten any Serpents, the wormes in their guttes are thereby expelled. And <hi>Abſyrtus</hi> hath the ſame words, that Harts by eating of a Serpent, doc kill and expell wormes from their guttes. <hi>Hierocles,</hi> to a certaine medicine which he prepared for the Strangulion in a horſe, mingled the dung of a Lyzard, &amp; <hi>Stèar</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> 
               <hi>herpetou,</hi> (that is, as I interpret it) the fat of a ſerpent, the blood of a Doue, &amp;c. <hi>Laurence Ruſius</hi> ſaith, that it is good to giue the fleſh and decoction of Serpents, to madde, beating and ſtriking horſes. And that the fatte of a Serpent, &amp;c. doth cure the puffing or ſwellings that ariſe in horſes backs, which come by meanes of any compreſſion, or cloſe ſitting and thruſting downe.</p>
            <p>Item, the vnguent that droppeth from a Serpent, whilſt he is roſted on a ſpit, is highlie commended for Fiſtuloes that are in horſes hoofes. <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Raſius,</hi> doc counſell vs to cut in peeces a ſnake or ſerpent, and to lay the fat there of vpon a ſticke, and to annoint the outward parts of the hoofe of any horſe. Horſeleaches, liue Miſe, the greene Lyzard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing burned, if they be giuen to a Hawke in her meate, they do cauſe a ſpeedie mutation of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> her feathers or wings; and the ſame effect haue little Riuer-fiſhes, finely beaten or ſtam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, if they be caſt vpon any meate.</p>
            <p>Item, the Serpent that is ſpeckled, and of diuers and ſundry colours, of all others hath the leaſt poyſon, and in the German tongue it is called <hi>Huf,</hi> (peraduenture it is that which we call a ſnake) if, (I ſay) you take this ſerpent, and boyle it with Wheate, and giue the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:22894:24"/>
ſame Wheate to a Henne to feede vpon, beeing mingled amongſt her meate and drinke with the venim of a Serpent, a Hawke beeing fedde with the fleſh of ſuch a Henne, forth-with caſteth her ſicke feathers, and is freed from any other diſeaſe, if ſhe haue any at all, as <hi>Albertus</hi> ſaith.</p>
            <p>The old skinne of an Adder or Snake, that he caſts off in the Spring-time, if it be rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed vpon the eyes, cleereth the ſight, as <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith. And <hi>Galen</hi> biddeth vs, if any be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with blood-ſhotten eyes, to take the old caſt-skinne of ſerpents, &amp; being beaten with Sea-water', to annoynt them there-withall. And <hi>Cardan</hi> ſaith, that the caſt-skin of a ſnake, if the eyes be rubbed there-with euery morning, that they will neuer be very dim of ſight, nor yet euer haue any pinne or webbe in them. Amongſt compoſitions that are made for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> the eyes, they vſe to mixe the caſt-skinne of ſnakes, as <hi>Diocles</hi> affirmeth; adding further, that the old age, or caſt-skinne of a ſnake beeing boyled in vvine, is an excellent helpe for paine in the eares, if a little thereof be dropped into them. Boyle the caſt skinne of a ſnake with toppes of Poppy, and droppe a little thereof into the cares, if any be troubled vvith paine thereof, and this is an excellent remedy, as <hi>Galen</hi> in his third Booke, <hi>De Compoſit. medicam. ſec. loca,</hi> hath taught vs, hauing himſelfe learned the ſame from <hi>Archigenes.</hi> The caſt-skinne of ſerpents being burned in a pot, or on a hot burning tyle-ſhard, if it be ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with oyle of Roſes, and ſo dropt into the eares, is prooued to be very effectuall againſt all ſores, and ſickneſſes of the eares; but eſpecially againſt the ſtinking ſauour of them: or if they be puralent or full of matter, then to be mixt with vineger. Some vſe to mingle <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> Bulls gall there-with, and the iuyce of the fleſh of Torteiſes beeing boyled.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Marcellus</hi> ſaith, that if you take the gall of a Calfe, with a like quantitie of Vineger, and mixe them with the caſt-skinne of a ſerpent, if then you dippe a little vvooll into this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, and put it into the eare, that it helpeth very much, eſpecially if with a ſpunge being ſoked in warme-water, you firſt foment the eare. <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> doe affirme, that the caſt-skinne of a ſerpent, if it be boyled in Wine, doth cure the tooth-ach, if the pained place be waſhed there-with. But yet, in intollerable paines of the teeth, this is prooued more ſinguler. Take the caſt-skinne of a Serpent and burne it, then temper it with oyle, till it come to the thicknes or conſiſtence of hard Hony, and couer the tooth (being firſt ſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and clenſed there-with, annoynting all the neere places to the ſame, and put ſome of it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> into the hollownes of the tooth. And as <hi>Archigenes</hi> ſaith, if you lay the caſt-skinne of a ſnake vnto the teeth, not beeing burnt, they will all fall out. It cureth likewiſe the lowſie euill, called <hi>Phthiriaſis.</hi> And <hi>Galen</hi> preſcribeth this caſt-skin of ſnakes or ſerpents, for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie againſt the Cholick, if it be put into a braſſe pot with ſome oyle, and ſo burnt to powder, if then it be diſſolued in oyle, and the place there-with annoynted, it is of great vertue. And if it bee boyled in a Tinne veſſell with ſome oyle of Roſes, it remedieth the the Bloody-flixe, and ſuch as be troubled with <hi>Teneſmas,</hi> which is, a great deſire in going to ſtoole, and yet can doe nothing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arnoldus de villa noua,</hi> in his Breuiarie ſaith, that if you take the caſt-skin of a ſerpent, <hi>Opopanax, Myrrhe, Galbanum, Caſtoreum,</hi> yellow Sulphur, Madder, Pidgeons or Hawkes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> doung, and incorporate them with the gall of a Cow, they beeing firſt pulueriſed, and the fume thereof receiued through a tunnell at the lower parts, it bringeth foorth either the dead or liuing birth. <hi>Cardan lib. de Subtil.</hi> ſaith, that the caſt-skin of a ſerpent burned in the full of the Moone, &amp; entring into the firſt degree of <hi>Aries,</hi> if the aſhes thereof be ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kled on the head, that thereby terrible and fearefull dreames will follow. And if the face be annointed or waſhed there-with being firſt layd in water, that it will cauſe one to looke very fearefully and horribly: and if it be held vnder the tongue, it will make one very wiſe and eloquent: and if it be kept vnder the ſoles of the feete, it maketh one very gratious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Princes, Magiſtrates and great men. And another ſaith, that this caſt-off-skin bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pulueriſed when the Moone is in her increaſe, and in the firſt degree of <hi>Aries,</hi> if the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> powder thereof be ſet on the Table, in a woodden or metalline diſh, if any poyſon be ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, it will be diſperſed and doe no hurt, and yet the powder will remaine ſafe and whole: and if giuen to a Leaprous-perſon, his diſeaſe will ſpreade no further. And if you put a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of this powder into any wound, it will cure it within three dayes. I haue ſeene, (fayth <hi>Galen)</hi> Goates that haue eaten of the boughes and leaues of Tamariske, and I haue found
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:22894:24"/>
them without a ſpleene: alſo I haue ſeene other Goates that haue lickt vppe ſerpents after they had caſt their skinne, and I haue prooued, that after that, they haue growne verie white, and to haue kept their young yeeres a great while; ſo that it was long before they waxed old.</p>

The iuyce of the blacke Vine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> extracted from the roote, and annoynted on the bodie, perſormeth the like. For preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation from Serpents, <hi>Nicander</hi> compoundeth this oyntment. Take two Vipers about the end of Spring-time, Deare-ſewit thirtie drammes, <hi>Vnguenti roſati</hi> thirtie ſixe drams, crude oyle of Oliues as much, commix them with nine ounces of Waxe, boyle the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents till the fleſh fall from the bones, which you muſt caſt away becauſe they are veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous.</p>
            <p>They that will yet be more aſſured, let them annoynt their bodies with a thinne cerate, made of Wax, oyle of Roſes, a little <hi>Galbanu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> ſome powder of Harts-horne, or els Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min-ſeede of <hi>Ethiopia.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Aetius.</hi> If a man carry about him the tooth of a Stag, or thoſe ſmall bones which are found in his hart, he ſhall be ſecured from ſerpents. If any one doe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> beare about him Wild-Bugloſſe, or the roote of the wild-carot, hee cannot be wounded of any Serpents. <hi>Greuinus</hi> is of the minde, that the Iet-ſtone, beſide other manifeſt quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, hath yet this as peculier to it ſelfe, that he which carrieth it about with him, need nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to feare ſerpents, nor any other poyſons.</p>
            <p>Now for venomous beaſtes, which are found in any houſes, the beſt way is to powre
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:22894:26"/>
ſcalding water into their dennes &amp; lurking-holes. And if any man (conſtrained by neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie) can find no other place to ſleepe, but ſuch a one as where Salamanders, the Spyders called <hi>Phalangia,</hi> or the like ſerpents doe abound, it is good to ſtop the holes and corners with Garlick beaten with water, or ſome of thoſe herbes which before we haue ſpoken of. But yet men now adayes hold it the ſafeſt courſe, to powre vnquenched Lime ſprinckled with water, into their dennes and ſecret corners.</p>
            <p>As they that are bitten by a madde dogge, ſo all ſuch perſons as be wounded by veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous creatures, are in exceeding great danger, vnleſſe at the firſt they receiue ſpeedy help and ſuccour: The ſafeſt way therefore to cure the poyſon, is by attractiues, which dravve from the more inward parts to the ſurface, and not to make too much poſt-haſt in cloſing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> vp the wound. But if any one hath ſwallowed downe, and taken inwardly any poyſon, the beſt way is (as <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> writeth) to vomit often: but if any be wounded by byting, then it is beſt to vſe ſcarification, and to faſten Cupping-glaſſes vpon the place affected, to draw out the poyſon. Some vſe to ſuck the venom out, and others to cut off and diſmem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the part. And this is to be obſerued, that if any one will vndertake to ſuck out the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom, the partie that attempteth it muſt not be faſting: &amp; beſides, he muſt waſh his mouth with ſome Wine, and after that, holding a little oyle in his mouth, to ſuck the part, and to ſpet it preſently forth. And before Cupping-glaſſes be applyed, the part muſt firſt be fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with a Spung, then ſcarified deepely, that the venomous matter may the more ſpeedily be drawne out from the more inward parts; and yet cutting of the fleſh round in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> a compaſſe, doth more good then any ſcarification.</p>
            <p>But if the place will admit no ſection or inciſion, then cupping-glaſſes, with deepe ſcari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ication, with much flame, muſt needes be vſed: for by attraction of the blood, and other humors with windines, the poyſon it ſelfe muſt of neceſſitie follow. And <hi>Aetius</hi> in his 13 Booke and tenth chapter, counſelleth that the ſicke perſon be kept from ſleepe, and ſo ſitte ſtill, vntill he find ſome ceaſing or releaſe from his paine. Beſides, the member which is enuenomed, ought to be bound round about, that the poyſon may not too eaſily conuey it ſelfe, and penetrate into the more noble and principall parts, as the hatt, liuer or braine. And in this manner hauing applyed your Ligature, you muſt by the aduiſe of <hi>Fumanellus,</hi> ſet on your Cupping-glaſſes, and they beeing remoued, apply the herbe Calamint vppon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> the place, and to giue the patient, ſome of the roote of Mugwort in powder, or the beſt Treacle, and ſuch cordialls as doe corroborate the hart: and for this intent, Bugloſſe, Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, Balme, and any of their flowers are much commended.</p>
            <p>A Doue or Pidgion beeing deuided in the midſt, &amp; applyed hote to the place affected, attracteth poyſon to it ſelfe, and healeth. And the ſame effect and vertue haue other liuing creatures, as namely, hennes and chickins, young Kiddes, Lambes and pigges, if they be ſet to in the beginning, immediatly after the cupping-glaſſes be remoued, for beeing as yet hot and warme, they draw out the poyſon and mittigate paine. But if neither any one for loue or mony can be found, that will or dare ſuck out the venim, &amp; that no cupping-glaſſe can be prouided, then it is beſt that the patient doe ſuppe of mutton, veale, or gooſe broth, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> and to prouoke vomiting. Yet they that will more effectually and ſpeedily giue help, vſe to kill a Goate, and taking out the entralls, with the warme dung therein found, forth-with bind it vnto the place.</p>
            <p>The learned Phiſition <hi>Matthiolus,</hi> in his comment vppon <hi>Dioſcorides,</hi> ſaith; that to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyd the danger that commeth by ſucking out the venom, men now a-dayes vſe to apply the fundament of ſome Cocke or Henne, or other Birds after the feathers are puld off, to the wounded place, and the firſt dying, to apply another in the ſame order, and ſo another and another, vntill the whole venomous matter be cleane driuen away, whereof one may be certainely aſſured, if the laſt henne or byrd ſo applyed, doe not die. <hi>Auicen</hi> the <hi>Arabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> ſaith, that the Phiſitians of <hi>Egypt,</hi> (in which Country there bee infinite ſtore of veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> beaſts) doe haſten to burne the part with fire, as the ſafeſt and ſureſt remedy, when any one is this way endangered: For fire not onely expelleth poyſons, but many other grieuances. But the way how they vſed to burne with fire, was diuers in theſe caſes: For ſome-times they vſed to ſeare the place with a hot yron, and other-whiles with a corde or match beeing fired, and ſometimes ſcalding oyle; and many other deuiſes they had with
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:22894:26"/>

            <p>Neither am I ignorant (ſaith <hi>Dioſcorides)</hi> what the <hi>Egyptians</hi> doe in theſe caſes: For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they reape their Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

When as therefore they haue wounded either the foote or any other part, they that are preſent, doe put the ſtring into the pot of pitch, and binding the place, they fall to cutting it with ſome inſtrument rounde in compaſſe as the ſtring is tyed, after this is done, they powre in of the pitch a ſufficient quantitie, then vntying and looſing the band, they laſtly annoynt it with Garlick and Onions.</p>

So when hee had held his foote a whole night couered and buried vnder the earth, &amp; finding no abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but rather an increaſe of his tormenting paine; at length, by the aduiſe and directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a certaine Noble Matron, he dranke a good draught of <hi>Theriaca</hi> &amp; Hony tempred in Ale, and ſo after a few houres, fell on a great &amp; continuall vomiting, by which meanes he was perfectly freed from the paines of the vpper parts of his body, his feete notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding continuing in their former ſwelling: which was alſo taken cleane away, onely by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> drinking the milke of a black Goate, ſo much in quantity at a time as one egge-ſhell would containe, his foote in the meane ſpace beeing held or plunged in a ſufficient quantitie of the ſame milke. From which there iſſued and ranne, a foule ſtinking, glutinous &amp; ſnivelly matter, and this he was admoniſhed to doe by a certaine Prieſt.</p>
            <p>But yet afterwards by chaunce, waſhing himſelfe in a hot ſunnie day in a certaine Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, and ſitting vppon the banke, his feete hanging downe into the water, and hee falling faſt a ſleepe, (hee knew not well how long time hee ſo continued) at length awaking, hee plainly perceiued the water that was neere, on all ſides to bee filthy, ſtained and polluted with much ſtinking matter, and as it were, dreggie refuſe and ful<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vegetius</hi> affirmeth, that if any liuing creature be bytten and wounded of venomous Beaſts, the place which is hurt, muſt firſt of all be ſuffumigated with hens egge-ſhels burnt, which firſt ought to be infuſed in Vineger, with a little Harts-horne, or <hi>Galbanum.</hi> After fomentation, the place muſt be ſcarified, &amp; the blood muſt be let out, or elſe the place muſt be ſeared with a hot yron, ſo farre as the venom ſtretcheth. And this care muſt be had, that the Cauterre be neuer applyed and layde, either aboue the ioynts, or in ſinewie parts at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> time, for the ſinewes or ioynts beeing ſeared and burnt, there muſt of neceſſitie, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall weakenes and debilitie follow. Therfore great diligence muſt be vſed, that neither a little aboue, nor a little beneath the nerues &amp; ioynts, we lay any Cauterizing medicine, yea, although neceſſitie biddeth vs. But it is alſo requiſite that euery one thus wounded,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:22894:27"/>
doe gently and eaſily prouoke ſweating with warme clothes caſt vpon him, &amp; afterwards to walke vp and downe, &amp; to take Barley-meale in his meate, with ſome leaues of the Aſh-tree, and the white Vine added to it. And to the wound it is good to apply Attick-Honie, or Comin heated and patched, and ſo mixed with olde Wine. Some vſe to mixe newe Hogs-dung and Attick-honny tempered together with wine, and ſo beeing warmed, to apply it as a Cataplaſme, adding to it ſome vrine of a man.</p>
            <p>I haue ſaid before, that young chickins, beeing diſſected or cut in peeces when they are warme, ought to be layde to the ſtinged part: and ſome there be that yeelde this reaſon why they ſhould be good for this purpoſe, becauſe (ſay they) there is a naturall antipathy betwixt them, and venomous creatures. But this reaſon is reaſonleſſe, and I think rather, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> that hennes or young birds, beeing of a very hot nature and complexion, doe eaſilie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coct and diſgeſt notable poyſon, and their ſtomacks do conſume moſt dry &amp; hard ſeedes, which the ſtrongeſt man liuing cannot doe; which may eaſily alſo be prooued by this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that many times by their rauening, they ſwallowe downe ſand and little ſtones, which they doe eaſily diſſolue, and their croppes very ſoone diſcharge, without any of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to them at all. And therefore the ſpirits of an invenomed perſon, beeing helped and refreſhed, with the liuely and ſtrong naturall heate of theſe fowles thus applyed, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and acquiring ſtrength from the part wounded, and ſo haſtily leaping out as it were, and quickly ſparkling forth, they doe expell, ſhut and draw out the poyſon.</p>
            <p>Now, after we haue deſcribed the generall method of curing this miſchieuous euill, we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> will now deſcend to particular remedies, obſeruing euer this rule &amp; order, that firſt I will ſpeake of ſuch meanes as are topicall, or ſuch as are outwardly applyed; and next, of ſuch as be taken inwardly, and in both of them I will firſt deſcribe compound, before I ſpeake of ſimple medicaments. This one leſſon you muſt carry with you, that many remedies are preſcribed and ſet downe, which be not onely good for the bytings of ſerpents, but alſo for the bitings and ſtingings of all other venomous creatures, as namely, of Scorpions, Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantula<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Vnquenched Lyme, mixeth with Honnie and oyle, and applied to the place the thick-nes of a cerote, is good againſt the wounds that come by any venomous beaſtes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> byting.</p>
            <p>Now I thinke it meete to ſet downe thoſe ſimple medicaments which are outwardlie to be applied, eyther by laying on, or by annointing, againſt the ſting and venomous by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Serpents. It is beſt firſt to foment the ſore place with hote vinegar, wherein Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mint hath been boyled, and in ſtead of Vineger, one may take Salt-water, or Sothern-wood, Maidenhaire, and Garlick, either in drinke, meate, or to be vſed as an oyntment. The roote of Aram, &amp; of Aſtrologe, &amp; the leaues of the true Daffadill, and oyle of Balme, is moſt effectuall: alſo Beellium, and the roote either of the white or black Beete, is good againſt the bytings of Serpents.</p>
            <p>Betonie, Coleworts, eſpeciallie the Wild-coleworts, Calamint, the leaues of the wild <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> Figge-tree, Centorie, Onions, Germander, Chamaeleon, the herbe called Fleabane, wilde Carrets, Rocket, Heath, Fennell, Figges, Winter-cherries, <hi>Enula Campana,</hi> Barly-meale, the Day-lilly, Hiſop, the Flower-deluce-roote, Horehound, Balme, Water-creſſes, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſill, Origan, Plantine, Leekes, Turneps, Madder, Rue, Verven, Muſtard-ſeede, Scabioſe, and S.

            <p>
               <hi>Pliny</hi> is of opinion, that the bowels or entralls of Serpents themſelues, beeing applyed, will ſurelie cure the wounds of all other Serpents, although they ſeeme incurable. A liue ſerpent beeing caught, if it be bruſed, beaten and ſtamped in water, and the hurt place fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented there-with, will aſſuredlie helpe and doe much eaſe. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/>

            <p>Some of the <hi>Greekes</hi> haue left in writing, that the Idolatrous Prieſts and Prelats of the God <hi>Vulcan,</hi> that dwelt in the Ile <hi>Lemnos,</hi> had a ſpeciall vertue giuen them to cure thoſe who were wounded by Serpents: wherevpon it is ſaid, that <hi>Philoctetes</hi> beeing wounded by a ſerpent before the Altar of <hi>Apollo,</hi> went thither to be remedied of his hurt. <hi>Cornelius Celſus</hi> ſaith flatly, that the people called <hi>Pſylli</hi> had no ſuch peculiar gift in healing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that were hurt of ſerpents, either by ſucking or touching the place, but beeing boldly aduentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, had preſumed thereby to attempt and do that, which others of leſſe courage had no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> ſtomack to doe: for whoſoeuer durſt be ſo confident as to follow their example, ſhould be himſelfe out of danger, and aſſure the other ſafe and free from feare of further hurt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Galen</hi> in his booke <hi>De Theriaca ad Piſonem,</hi> manifeſtly ſheweth, that the <hi>Marſi,</hi> who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in his dayes, had no ſuch ſpeciall qualitie againſt the poyſon of Serpents, but that with their crafty dealing, and knauiſh tricks, they beguiled the common people. For (ſaith he) thoſe Iuglers and Deceiuers, do neuer hunt Vipers at any conuenient time, but long after the Prime of the yeere and Spring, wherein they caſt their skins, when as they are weake, and haue loſt their ſtrength, and are very faint: then do they take them, &amp; ſo by long vſe and continuance, teach them, and invre themſelues one to another, &amp; bring it ſo to paſſe, that they will feede them with ſtrange and vnaccuſtomed meates to their nature; yea they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> will permit them to taſt of fleſh, and conſtraine them to be continuallie gnawing and by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the ſame, that by their ſo labouring and ſtriuing, their poyſon may by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle be ſpent, and purged out of their bellies. Beſides all this, they giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a kind of bread made of milke and flower, that by this meanes the holes in their teeth may be ſtopped: &amp; ſo by this labourious courſe of dyeting them, they bring the matter ſo about, that theyr bytings are very weake, &amp; do ſmall annoyance to any that they ſtrike at. So that the ſeers and lookers on, account it a thing exceeding common reaſon and nature, and blaze it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade for a miracle.</p>

               <hi>Matthiolus</hi> alſo, a Phiſition of late dayes, agreeth with him in this poynt, affirming ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, that theſe kind of trumperies and craftie fetches, are much put in practiſe in theſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> times, by ſuch bold and impudent Quackſaluers, Mountebanks, and cooſeners of plaine Country-people, who dare face it out, lye, faine and cogge, that they are deſcended from the race and linage of Saint <hi>Paule,</hi> wherein they ſhewe themſelues notorious lyers. &amp;c.

               <note place="margin">Herodotus Mela.

And for theſe cauſes, Serpents are very much afraid of any one of this Nation. Likewiſe certaine of the <hi>Candeans</hi> were called <hi>Ophiophagi,</hi> that is, Eaters of Serpents, and one part of the people of <hi>Arabia</hi> eate Snakes.

               <hi>Caraia,</hi> they ſell the fleſh of Serpents in open Markets. Theſe ſerpents are called <hi>Iuanae,</hi> &amp; the common people are forbidden to eate them, becauſe they are very delicate, euen as Pheaſants, Partridges and Peacocks are in <hi>Fraunce.</hi> Yet is there but one way to dreſſe them, which is, to roule them in Lard, and ſo to ſeeth them.

With this Lard there is made a broth ſweeter then any Nectar, which they vſe in many bankets of great account.</p>
            <p>But for the taking of Serpents, I will yet adde one or two more experiments, vvherein the Ancients reuenged themſelues vpon theſe irreconcileable enemies of mankind. They <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> did vſe to ſet into the earth a deepe pot, whereinto all venomous creatures would gather and hide themſelues, then came they ſuddenly &amp; ſtopped the mouth of that veſſell, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <note place="margin">Florentinus</note> they incloſed all that were taken, and ſo making a great fire, eaſt the ſaide part of veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous ſerpents into the ſame, which conſumed them all. Otherwiſe, they tooke a liuing Serpent, and digged in the earth a deepe Well or pit ſo ſteepe, as nothing at the bottome
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:22894:30"/>
could climbe vp to the top thereof, into this pit they would caſt the ſerpent, and with her a brand of fire, by meanes whereof the encloſed Serpent would fall a hyſſing for her life, at the hearing whereof, her fellowes of the ſame kind, were therby eaſily inuited to come at her call to giue her releefe, (as we haue ſhewed elſwhere) who finding the noiſe in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of the pit, doe ſlide downe of their owne accord, wherby they likewiſe intrap them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in the ſame pit of deſtruction.</p>
            <p>But the Iuglers or Quackſaluers take them by another courſe, for they haue a ſtaffe ſlit at one end like a payre of tongs, thoſe ſtand open by a pinne, now when they ſee a ſerpent, Viper, Adder or Snake, they ſet them vppon the neck neere the head, and pulling foorth the pinne, the ſerpent is ineuitably taken, and by them looſed into a prepared veſſell, in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> which they keepe her, and giue her meate. It is reported, that if a Serpent bee ſtrooken with a Reede, ſhe ſtandeth ſtill at the firſt blow, as if ſhe were aſtoniſhed, and ſo gathereth <note place="margin">Caelius Rhoi Aelianus</note> herſelfe together, but if ſhe be ſo ſtrooken the ſecond or third time, as one deliuered from her aſtoniſhment and feare, ſhe recollecteth her wits and ſtrength, and ſlydeth away. The <note place="margin">Conſtantinus</note> like obſeruation vnto this, is that of the Auncients, that a ſerpent cannot be drawne out of her denne by the right hand, but by the left, for they ſay, if one lay hold on her taile by the right hand, ſhe will either ſlide farther into the earth from him, or elſe ſuffer herſelfe to be pulled in peeces, neuer turning againe: and therefore ſaith mine Authour, <hi>Non cedit tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henti,</hi>

The cauſe ſaith <hi>Pierius,</hi> is <hi>linguae motatio,</hi> the continuall and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ceaſing motion of a Serpents tongue: and ſo the continuall and euer-working perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of diabolicall tentations, and a true mixture and limbe of this old Serpent, ſpeaketh otherwiſe with his tongue, then he thinketh with his hart.

There is a raging wolfe which is couetous, and there is a ſerpent which is an impoſtour and fraudulent. The ſame lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned man ſaith, that riches are like to a ſerpent: For as when an ignorant man thinketh to take a Serpent without harme by the tayle, ſhee turneth backe againe and biteth him, but if he take her by the necke, ſhe cannot execute any part of her malice: euen ſo when a wiſe man hath the managing of riches, by vertue of his diſcretion hee ſo charmeth them, that there is not in them any harme at all: but the fooliſh man is mortally ſtung by his impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent poſſeſſion and diſpenſation of them. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/>

            <p>This is vſuall, to call a water-Adder, a houſe-Adder, a Land-ſnake, and ſuch other, but catachreſtically confounding one kind with another. And thus much for the name of this Serpent. The parts differ not from the generall deſcription before recited, it is long like an Eeele, and hath many Epithets, as <hi>virides colubri,</hi> greene Adders, long, rough, veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, diuers coloured, ſwelling, ſlyding, winding, blew, terrible, ſecret, hurtfull, <hi>Medu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaean, Cyniphian, Gorgonean, Lybiſsine,</hi> biting, ſpotted, wreathing, black, bending, heauy, ſcalie, and diuers ſuch other, as the Gramarians haue obſerued.

The Cooke as ſoone as he was bitten in the hand, ſucked the wound with his mouth, thinking therby to mittigate the paine, and draw out againe the poyſon; but as ſoone as his tongue touched the wound, preſently it ſo ſwelled that he could not ſpeake: and beſides, is arme or ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> ſwelled into a high bunch or tumour, which did put him vnto painfull torments, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that he ſwounded twice in our preſence; his face and colour changed as though he would preſently die. Whereat we all deſpayred to cure him, yet did not forſake him, nor left to try ſome meanes to eaſe his torments. Then wee waſhed his tongue with Triacle, mixed with an equall proportion of white vvine and <hi>Aqua vitae;</hi> then alſo I cauſed the arme to be ſcarified all ouer, and launced the place where the Adder had bitten him, out of which flowed abundance of corrupt mattery blood. Then we waſhed the vvound with Triacle and Mithridate, in <hi>Aqua vitae;</hi> ſo we cauſed him to be layd into a warme bedde, there to ſvveat, and commaunded to keepe him awake, which was done accordingly; and ſo the next day the ſwelling was abated, &amp; the malignant ſymptomes were all euacuated: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> ſo we gaue order to keepe the vvound or launced place open, &amp; afterward the Cooke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be well againe.

Ptyas</hi> hurteth by poyſoning mens eyes, by ſpetting forth venom, <hi>Chaerſaea</hi> liueth on the Land, and <hi>Chelidonia</hi> in the waters.</p>
            <p>The Aſpe is a ſmall Serpent, like to a Land Snake, but yet of a broader backe, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in this differeth not much from the Snake, their Neckes ſwell aboue meaſure, and if they hurt in that paſſion, there can bee no remedy, for the ſtroake of their eyes are excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding red and flaming, and there are two pieces of fleſh like a hard skin which grow out of their foreheads, according to theſe verſes of <hi>Nicander;</hi>

And from the wordes of the Pſalme a, foreſaid, not onely the certaintie and effectuall vſe of charming is gathered by <hi>Pierius,</hi> but alſo by many iuſtified in the caſe of Serpents. Whereof I haue already giuen mine opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the former generall Treatiſe, vnto the which I will onely adde thus much in conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which I haue found in a certaine vnnamed Authour: <hi>Daemones diſcurrunt cum ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis ad ſerpentes, &amp; infectione interiori hoc faciunt, vt ſerpentes ad nutum eorum moueantur, ac ſine laeſione tractabiles exhibeantur:</hi> Which is thus much in effect; Deuils runne vp &amp; downe with words of enchauntment to Serpents, and by an inward or ſecrete infection, they bring to paſſe that the Serpents diſpoſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues after their pleaſure, and ſo are hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led without all harme. And indeed, that it may appeare to be manifeſt that this incanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> of Serpents is from the deuill, and not from God, this onely may ſuffice any reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable man: becauſe the Pſalmiſt plainely expreſſeth, that the ſerpent ſhifteth it off, &amp; auoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth <hi>Peritiſsimos muſsitantium incantationes,</hi> the moſt skilfull Charmers. Now if it came from the vnreſiſtable power of almighty God, it ſhould paſſe the reſiſtance of them or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uills; but beeing a fallacie of the deuill, the ſerpent (wiſer in this poynt then men that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue it) eaſily turneth tayle againſt it: and in this thing we may learne to be wiſe as Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, againſt the inchaunting temptations of the deuill or men, which would beguile vs with ſhadowes of words and promiſes, of no valuable pleaſures.</p>
            <p>If we may belieue <hi>Pliny, Elianus,</hi> and <hi>Philarchus,</hi> the Egyptians liued familiarly vvith Aſpes, and with continued kindnes wanne them to be tame. For indeede among other <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> parts of their ſauage beaſtlines, they worſhipped Aſpes euen as houſhold Gods, by meanes whereof the ſubtill ſerpent grewe to a ſenſible conceit of his owne honour and freedome, and therefore would walke vp and downe and play with their children, doing no harme, except they were wronged, and would come and licke meate from the table, when they were called by a certaine ſignificant noyſe, made by knacking of the fingers. For the gueſts after theyr dinner, would mixe together hony, wine, and meale, and then giue the ſigne, at the hearing whereof they would all of them come foorth of their holes; and creeping vp, or lifting their heads to the table, leauing their lower parts on the ground, there licked they the ſaid prepared meate, in great temperance by little &amp; little without any rauening, and then afterward departed when they were filled. And ſo great is the reuerence they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> beare to Aſpes, that if any in the houſe haue neede to riſe in the night time out of theyr beds, they firſt of all giue out the ſigne or token, leaſt they ſhould harme the Aſpe, and ſo prouoke it againſt them: at the hearing whereof, all the Aſpes get them to their holes and lodgings, till the perſon ſtirring be layd againe in his bed.</p>
            <p>The holy kind of Aſpes, they call <hi>Thermuſis,</hi> and this is vſed and fedde in all their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of <hi>Iſis</hi> with the fat of Oxen or Kine. Once in the yeere they crowne with them the Image of <hi>Iſis,</hi> and they ſay that this kind is not an enemy to men, except to ſuch as are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry euill, wherevpon it is death to kill one of them willingly.</p>
            <p>It is reported of a certaine Gardiner making a ditch or trench in his Vineyarde, by chaunce and ignorantly, he ſet his ſpade vpon one of theſe <hi>Thermuſis</hi> Aſpes, and ſo cut it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> aſunder, and when he turnd vp the earth, he found the hinder-part dead, and the fore-part bleeding and ſtirring: at which ſight his ſuperſtitious hart ouercome with a vaine feare, became ſo paſsionately diſtreſſed, that he fell into a vehement and lamentable frenzie. So as all the day time he was not his owne man, and in the night, in his madde fits leapt out of his bed, crying out with pittifull &amp; eager complaint, that the Aſpe did bite him, the Aſpe did wound him, and that hee ſaw the picture of the ſaid aſpe (by him formerly ſlaine) fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing him, and tearing his fleſh, &amp; therefore moſt inſtantly craued helpe againſt it, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill he perriſhed by it, he was mortally wounded. And when he had now (ſaith <hi>Elia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus)</hi> continued a while in this ſuperſtitious fury and diſeaſe of the mind, his kindred &amp; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance brought him into the houſe of <hi>Serapis,</hi> making requeſt vnto that fained God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> to remoue out of his ſight that ſpectre and appariſion; and ſo he was releaſed, cured, and reſtored to his right mind.</p>
            <p>This kind of Aſpe they alſo ſay is immortall and neuer dyeth, and beſides, it is a reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of ſacriledge, as may appeare by ſuch another hiſtory in the ſame place. There was a certaine Indian Peacock ſent to the King of Egypt, which for the goodly proportion and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:22894:35"/>
feature thereof, the King out of his deuotion conſecrated to <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and was kept in the Temple. Now there was (ſaith hee) a certaine young man which ſet more by his belly, then by his GOD, which fell into a great longing for to eate of the ſaid Peacocke: and therefore to attaine his appetite, he bribed one of the Officers of the Temple with a good ſumme of Money to ſteale the ſayd Peacocke, and bring it to him aliue or dead. The co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous wretch enraged with the deſire of the Money, ſought his opportunity to ſteale a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Peacock, and one day came to the place where he thought &amp; knew it was kept, but when he came, he ſaw nothing but an Aſpe in the place thereof, and ſo in great feare leaped back to ſaue his life, and afterward diſcloſed the whole matter. Thus far <hi>Aelianus.</hi>

            <p>The domeſticall Aſpes vnderſtand right and wrong, and therefore <hi>Philanthus</hi> telleth a ſtory of ſuch an Aſpe which was a Female, and had young ones: in her abſence one of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> her young ones killed a childe in the Houſe: When the old one came againe according to her cuſtome to ſeeke her meate, the killed child was layed forth, and ſo ſhe vnderſtood the harme: Then went ſhe and killed that young one, and neuer more appeared in that houſe. It is alſo reported, that there was an Aſpe that fell in loue with a little Boy that kept Geeſe in the prouince of <hi>Egypt,</hi> called <hi>Herculia,</hi> whoſe loue to the ſaide Boy was ſo <note place="margin">Aelianus</note> feruent, that the Male of the ſaide Aſpe grew iealous thereof.

            <p>The true ſignes then of an Aſpes biting, is ſtupour or aſtoniſhment, heauineſſe of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> head, and ſlothfulnes, wrinking the forehead, often gaping and gnawing and nodding, bending the necke, and convulſion: but thoſe which are hurt by the <hi>Ptyas,</hi> haue blindnes, paine at the hart, deafeneſſe, and ſwelling of the face. And the ſignes of ſuch as are hurt by the <hi>Chalidonian</hi> or <hi>Cherſaean</hi> Aſpe, &amp; the <hi>Terreſtrian</hi> are all one, or of very little difference, except that I may adde the Crampe, and the often beating of the pulſe, &amp; frigiditie of the members or parts, or paine in the ſtomack, but all of them in generall, deepe ſleepe, and ſometimes vomitting. But by this, that the blood of the place by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bitten turneth black, it is apparant and manifeſt, that the poyſon of the Aſpe mortifieth or killeth the naturall heate; which is ouercome by the heate of the poyſon outwardly, &amp; the darknes or blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the eyes, proceedeth of certaine vapours which are infected, and aſcend vp to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> diſturbance of the braine: and when the humours are troubled in the ſtomacke, then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth vomiting, or elſe the crampe, and ſometimes a looſneſſe when the knuckles are drawen in by the venomous byting, or the infected humours falling downe into the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trals. <note place="margin">Ponzettus</note> To conclude, ſo great is the tabificall effect of this poyſon of Aſpes; that it is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily accounted the greateſt venom, and moſt dangerous of all other: for <hi>Aelianus</hi> ſayth,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:22894:37"/>
               <hi>Serpentum venenum cum peſtiferum ſit, tum multò aſpidis peſtilentius,</hi> the poyſon of all ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents is peſtiferous, but the venom of the aſpe moſt of all. For if it touch a greene wound, it killeth ſpeedily, but an old wound receiueth harme thereby more hardly. In <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi> when they would put a man to a ſudden death, they would ſet an aſpe to his boſome or breaſt, and then after the wound or byting, bid the partie walke vp and downe, and ſo <note place="margin">Galenus.</note> immediatly within two or three turnes hee would fall downe dead. Yet it is reported by <hi>Pliny,</hi> that the poyſon of Aſpes drunke into the body doth no harme at all, &amp; yet if a man eate of the fleſh of any beaſt ſlaine by an Aſpe, he dyeth immediatly.</p>
            <p>But concerning the cure of ſuch as haue beene, or may be hurt by Aſpes, I will nowe entreate, not ſpending any time to confute thoſe, who haue wrote that it is incurable: on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> the contrary it ſhall be manifeſt, that both by Chirurgery and Medicines, compound and ſimple, this both hath beene &amp; may happily be effected. Firſt it is neceſſary when a man is ſtunge or bitten by a Serpent, that the wounded part be cut off by the hand of ſome skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Chirurgeon, or elſe the fleſh round about the wound, with the wound it ſelfe to bee circumciſed and cut with a ſharpe Raſor; then let the hotteſt burning thinges be applyed, <note place="margin">Dioſcorid. Actuarius Aegineta</note> euen the ſearing yron to the very bone. For ſo the occaſion beeing taken away from the poyſon to ſpread any further, it muſt needes die without any further damage. Then alſo the holes in the meane time before the eiection, muſt be drawne, eyther with cupping-glaſſe, or with a Reede, or with the naked rumpe of a Ringdoue or Cocke; I meane the very hole ſet vppon the bitten place. And becauſe the place is very narrowe and ſmall, it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> muſt be opened, and made wider, the blood be drawne forth by ſcarifications, and then muſt ſuch medicinall herbes be applyed as are moſt oppoſite to poyſon, as Rew, and ſuch <note place="margin">Mercurialis.</note> like. And becauſe the poyſon of Aſpes doth congeale the blood in the veynes, therfore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſame muſt all hote thinges made thinne be applyed, as Mithridatum &amp; Triacle diſſolued in <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> &amp; the ſame alſo diſſolued into the wound; then muſt the patient be vſed to bathings, fricaſing or rubbing, and walking, with ſuch like exerciſes. But when once the wound beginneth to be purple, greene, or blacke, it is a ſigne both of the extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhment of the venome, &amp; alſo of the ſuffocating of naturall heate, then is nothing more ſafe then to cut off the member, if the partie be able to beare it. After Cupping-glaſſes, and <note place="margin">Paraeus</note> ſcarifications, there is nothing that can be more profitably applyed then Centory, Myrre, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> and <hi>Oppium,</hi> or Sorrell after the manner of a plaiſter. But the body muſt be kept in dailie motion and agitation, the wounds themſelues often ſearched and preſſed, and Sea-vvater vſed for fomentation. Butter likewiſe, &amp; the leaues of Yew, are very good to be applyed <note place="margin">Aetius</note> to the bytings of Aſpes. And in the Northerne Regions, (as witneſſeth <hi>'Olaus Magnus,)</hi> they vſe nothing but branne like a playſter, and theyr cattell they annoynt with Triacle &amp; ſalt all ouer the bunch or ſwelling. And thus much for the Chirurgicall cure of the biting of Aſpes. In the next place, wee may alſo relate the medicinall cure, eſpecially of ſuch thinges as are compound, and receiued inwardly.</p>
            <p>Firſt, after the wound, it is good to make the party vomit, &amp; then afterward make him drinke iuyce of Yew and Triacle, or in the default thereof, wine, as much of the iuyce as a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> groate waight, or rather more. But for the tryall of the parties recouery, giue him the powder of Centory in wine to drinke, and if he keepe the medicine, he will liue, but if he vomit or caſt it vp, he will die thereof. But for the better auoydance &amp; purging out of the digeſted venome, diſtributed into euery part of his body, giue the party Garlicke beaten with <hi>Zythum,</hi> vntill he vomit, or els <hi>Opponax</hi> in wine allayed with water: alſo <hi>Origan</hi> dry <note place="margin">Mercuri:</note> and greene. After the vomit, the former antidoticall medicines may be vſed. And the nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne people vſe no other Triacle then Venetian. Whereas there are aboundance of all <note place="margin">Andreas.</note> manner of Serpents in the Spantſh Iſlands, yet neuer are any found there to vſe Triacle, neither doe they account of it as of a thing any whit vertuous, but in ſtead thereof they vſe the bearded <hi>Thapſia,</hi> Gilliflowers, and red Violets, and the herbe <hi>Auance,</hi> boyled in wine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> Vinegar, the ſharpeſt that may be gotten, &amp; a ſound mans vrine, wherwithall they bathe the wounded part, although much time after the hurt receiued. But ſaith <hi>Amb: Paraeus,</hi> it is much better for the patient to drinke thereof faſting, &amp; before meate two howres, three ounces at a time. And by the help of this notable experiment, the Inhabitants of thoſe I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, are nothing afraid to offer theyr bodyes to be bitten by the moſt angry Aſpes. And
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:22894:37"/>
thus much for compound medicines in generall.</p>
            <p>It is ſaide, that the firſt and chiefeſt eaſie remedy for ſuch as are bitten by Aſpes, is to drinke ſo much of the ſharpeſt Vineger, as he can ſenſibly perceiue and feele the ſame vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the right ſide of his midreffe, becauſe that poyſon firſt of all depriueth the liuer of ſence. <note place="margin">Aetius.</note> For <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith, that hee knew a man carrying a bottle of Vineger to be bitten by an Aſpe, whiles by chaunce he trode therevpon, but as long as he bore the Vineger and did not ſet it downe, he felt no paine thereby, but as often as to eaſe himſelfe hee ſet the bottell out of his hand, he felt torment by the poyſon, which being related to the Phiſitians, they knew thereby that Vineger drunke into the ſtomacke was a ſoueraigne antidote againſt poyſon. Yet ſome ſay, that the firſt knowledge of this vertue in vineger, grew from the neceſſitie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> which a little boy bytten by an Aſpe had of drinking, and finding no other liquour but a bottle of vineger, dranke thereof a full draught, and ſo was eaſed of his paine. For the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, that it hath both a refrigeratiue, and alſo a diſſipating vertue, as may appeare when <note place="margin">Cor. Celſus.</note> it is poured on the earth, becauſe it yeeldeth a froth, and therefore when it commeth into the ſtomacke, it diſperſeth all the infected humours.</p>
            <p>The Northerne Shepheards doe drinke Garlicke and ſtale Ale againſt the bytings of Aſpes. And ſome hold opinion that Anniſeede is an antidote for this ſore. Other vſe Hart-wort, <note place="margin">Olaus. Mag.</note> 
               <hi>Apium</hi> ſeed, and wine. <hi>Aron</hi> being burned, hath the vertue to driue away ſerpents, and therefore beeing drunke with oyle of Bayes in blacke wine, it is accounted very ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne againſt the bytings of Aſpes. The fruite of Balſame, with a little powder of Genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> in vvine, or the iuyce of Mynts, keepeth the ſtomacke from the Crampe after a man is bytten by an Aſpe. Other giue <hi>Castoreum,</hi> with <hi>Lignum Caſsiae,</hi> and ſome the skinne of a Storkes ſtomacke or mawe. There be certaine little filthy and corrupt wormes bred in rotten wood or paper, called <hi>Cimices,</hi> theſe are very profitable againſt poyſon of Aſpes, or any other venomous byting beaſt, and therefore it is ſaid that Hennes &amp; other pullen, do earneſtly ſeeke after theſe wormes, and that the fleſh of ſuch fowle as haue eaten thereof, is alſo profitable for the ſame purpoſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Athaeneus</hi> alſo writeth, how certaine thieues were condemned to be caſt to ſerpents to be deſtroyed, now the morning before they came forth, they had giuen them to eate Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons; when they were brought to the place of execution, there were Aſpes put forth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> them, who byt them, and yet did not harme them. The next day, it beeing ſuſpected, the Prince commaunded to giue one of them a Citron, and the other none, ſo when they were brought forth againe the Aſpes fell on them, and ſlew them that had not eaten Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron, but the other had no harme at all. The Egyptian <hi>Clematis</hi> or <hi>Periwinke</hi> drunke in vineger, is very good againſt the poyſon of Aſpes; ſo likewiſe is Corrall in Wine, or the <note place="margin">Pliny. Orpheus</note> leaues of Yew. Henbane bruſed with the leaues thereof, and alſo bitter Hoppes haue the ſame operation. The vrine of a Torteyſe drunke, is a medicine againſt all bytings of wild beaſts, and the vrine of a man hurt by an Aſpe: as <hi>Marcus Varro</hi> affirmed in the eyghtie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninth yeere of his age, according to the obſeruation of <hi>Serenus</hi> ſaying;</p>

            </lg>
            <p>But it is more ſafe to agree with <hi>Pliny</hi> in the preſcription of mans vrine, to reſtraine it to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> them that neuer had any beards.

And thus much for the antipathy &amp; cure of Aſpes byting venomous nature, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:22894:38"/>
I will adde for a concluſion, that prouerbicall ſpeech, of one Aſpe borrowing poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of another, out of <hi>Tertullian</hi> againſt the Hereticke <hi>Marcion,</hi> who gathereth many of his abſurd impieties from the vnbeleeuing Iewes. <hi>Deſinat nunc haereticus á Iudaeo, aſpis quod aiunt á vipera mutuari venenum,</hi> that is, let the haereticke now ceaſe to borrow his venom of a Iew, as the Aſpes doe borrow their poyſon from Vipers.

A Bee is a cut-waſted liuing creature, that can flye, hauing foure winges, and bloudles, <note place="margin">Apum definitio</note> the onely Crafts-maſter of Hony-making. Their eies are ſomewhat of a horny ſubſtance, hid deep in their bodies, as is alſo their ſting: they want neither toong nor teeth, they haue <note place="margin">Deſeription of their parts.</note> 4. wings, being of a bright and cleare colour, growing to their ſhoulder-blades, whereof the two hindermoſt are the leſſer, becauſe they might not hinder their flying: and out of their ſhort feet or ſtumps, there grow forth as it were two fingers, wherein they carry a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſtone, for the peizing and making weighty their ſmall bodies in ſtormy, tempeſtuous, bluſtering, or troubleſome weather, for feare leaſt they might be driuen from their houſe and home, by the contrary rage and violence of the winds. They do not breath (by <hi>Plinies</hi> 
               <note place="margin">No reſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Bees.</note> good leaue) but either pant, moue, or ſtirre (as the hart or braine doth) and by tranſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> they are comforted, refreſhed, and made liuely. Their ſtomack is contexed and framed of the thinneſt part of all their members, wherein they not onely retaine, and ſafely keepe their Honny dew which they haue gathered, but alſo digeſt, purifie, and clenſe it, which is the true and onely reaſon, why the Honny of Bees is longer kept pure and fine, then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Manna or Meldew, or rather it is not at all ſubiect to corruption.</p>
            <p>Bees euen by nature are much different: for ſome are more domeſticall and tame, and <note place="margin">Differences of Bees from na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> others againe are altogether wilde, vplandiſh, and agreſtiall. Thoſe former are much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with the familiar friendſhip, cuſtome and company of men, but theſe can in no wiſe brook or endure them, but rather keep their trade of hony-making in old trees, caues, holes, and in the ruders, and rubbiſh of old wals and houſes. Of tame Bees againe, ſome <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> of them liue in pleaſant and delightfull Gardens, and abounding with all ſweet ſenting &amp; odoriferous plants and hearbs, and theſe are great, ſoft, fat, and big-bellied. Others again, there be of them that liue in townes and villages, whoſe ſtudy and labour is to gather ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny from ſuch plants as come next to hand, and which grow farther of, and theſe are leſſer in proportion of body, rough and more vnpleaſant in handling; but in labour, induſtrie, witteand cunning, far ſurpaſſing the former. Of both ſorts of theſe, ſome haue ſtings (as all true Bees haue:) others againe are without a ſting, as counterfeit and baſtardly Bees, which (euen like the idle, ſluggiſh, lyther, and rauenous cloyſtered Monkes, thrice worſe then theeues) you ſhall ſee to be more gorbellied, haue larger throats, and bigger bodies, yet neither excellent or markable, either for any good behauiour and conditions, or gifts <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> of the mind. Men call theſe vnprofitable cattle, and good for nothing, <hi>Fuci,</hi> that is drones; either becauſe they would ſeem to be labourers, when indeed rhey are not: or becauſe that vnder the colour and pretence of labour (for you ſhall ſometimes haue them to carry wax, and to be very buſie in forming and making hony-combes,) they may eate vp all the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. Theſe Drones are of a more blackiſh colour, ſomewhat ſhining, and are eaſily knowne by the greatneſſe of their bodies. Beſides ſome Bees are deſcended of the kingly race, and borne of the bloud Royall: where of <hi>Aristotle</hi> maketh two ſorts: a yellow kind, which is the more noble, and the blacke, garniſhed with diuers colours. Some make three Kings, differing in colour, as black, red, and diuers coloured. <hi>Menecratés</hi> ſaith, that thoſe who are of ſundry colours are the worſer, but in caſe they haue diuerſity of colour with ſome black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, they are eſteemed the better.

Others againe will haue them the leſſer, with a ſting: but the ſounder ſort (in my iudgment) will neither know nor acknowledge any other males, beſides their Dukes and princes, who are more able &amp; handſome, greater and ſtronger then any of the reſt, who ſtay euer at home, and very ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> (vnleſſe with the whole Swarme) they ſtir out of doores, as thoſe whom nature had pointed out to be the fitteſt to be ſtander-bearers, and to carry ancients in the camp of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> and euer to be ready at the elbowes of their loues to do them right: Experience teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vs, that theſe do ſit on egges, and after the manner of birdes, do carefully cheriſh and make much of their young, after the thin membram or skin wherein they are encloſed is broken.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:22894:39"/>
The difference of their age is knovvne by the forme, ſtate, and habite of their bodies. <note place="margin">Of age.</note> For the young Bees haue very thinne and trembling winges, but they that are a yeare old, as they that are two or three yeares of age are very trimme, gay, bright-ſhining, and in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good plight and liking, of the colour of Oyle.</p>
            <p>But thoſe that haue reached to ſeauen yeares, haue layed away all their flatneſſe and ſmoothneſſe, neither can any man afterwards, either by the figure and quality of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies or skinnes, iudge or diſcerne certainely their age (as wee ſay by experience in Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes:) For the elder ſort of them are rough, hard, thinne and leane ſcragges, ſtaruelinges, lothſome to touch and to looke vpon, ſomewhat long, nothing but skinne and bone, yet very notorious and goodly too ſee to, in regard of their grauity, hoarenes and aunciency. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> But as they be in forme and ſhape, nothing ſo excellent, ſo yet in experience and induſtrie they farre outſtrippe the younger ſort, as thoſe whom time hath made more learned, and length of dayes ioyned with vſe, hath ſufficiently inſtructed and brought vp in the Art or trade of hony-making.</p>
            <p>The place likewiſe altereth one whiles their forme, and ſometimes againe their nature, (as their ſexe and age do both.) For in the Iſlands of <hi>Molucea,</hi> there be Bees very like to <note place="margin">The differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the forme of Bees, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the place.</note> winged Piſmires, but ſomewhat leſſer then the greater Bees, as <hi>Maximilian Tranſiluanus,</hi> in an Epiſtle of his, written to the Byſhop of <hi>Salſpurge,</hi> at large relateth it. <hi>Andrew Theuet</hi> in his Booke that he wrote of the new-found World, Cap. 51. amongſt other matters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth that he did ſee a company of Flies or Hony-bees about a tree named <hi>Vhebehaſon,</hi>

            <p>Bees are gouerned and doe liue vnder a Monarchy, and not vnder a tyrannicall ſtate, admitting and receiuing their King, not by ſucceſſion or caſting of lots, but by reſpectiue <note place="margin">The gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of bees.</note> aduiſe, conſiderate iudgement, and prudent election; and although they willingly ſubmit their neckes vnder a kingly gouernment, yet notwithſtanding they ſtill keepe their anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent liberties and priuiledges, becauſe of a certaine prerogatiue they maintaine in giuing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> their voyces and opinions, and their King being deeply bound to them by an oath, they exceedingly honor and loue.</p>

            <p>The King preſcribeth lawes and orders to all the reſt, and appointeth them their rules and meaſures: for ſome he ſtraightly chargeth and commaundeth, (as they tender his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, and will auoyde his diſpleaſure) to fetch and prouide water for the whole Campe. He enioyneth others to make the Hony-combes, to build, to garniſh and trimme vp the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> houſe well and cleanely, to finiſh perfectly the worke, to find and allow, to promote and ſhew others what to doe. Some he ſendeth forth to ſeeke theyr liuing, but being vvorne with yeares, they are maintained of the common ſtocke at home.

If in reſpect of his yeares he be luſty and ſtrong, then like a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Captaine hee marcheth before his whole winged-army, expoſing himſelfe firſt to all perils, neither with his good will, will he be carryed of his Souldiers vnleſſe he be weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> and vveakened by meanes of crooked age, or maiſtered and cleane put out of heart by any violent ſickneſſe, ſo that he can neither ſtand on his Legges nor fly. When night ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procheth, the ſigne and token being giuen by his Honny-pipe, or Cornet, (if you will ſo call it) a generall proclamation is made through the whole Hiue, that euery one ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take himſelfe to reſt, ſo the watch beeing appointed, and all thinges ſet in order, they all make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues ready and go to bed. So long as the King liueth, ſo long the whole ſvvarm enioy the benefit of peace, leading their liues vvithout any diſquieting, diſturbance, vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, or feare of feuture wars. For the drones do vvillingly contain the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues in their own celles, the elder liuing contented with their ovvne homes, and the younger not daring for their eares to breake into their father Lands, or to make any inrodes or inuaſion into the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> houſes of their predeceſſours. The King keepeth his Court by himſelfe, in the higheſt and largeſt part of the whole Palace, his lodging being workemanlie and very cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made of a fine round or encloſure of Waxe, beeing thus as it were fenced and paled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout as with a defenſible wall. A little from him dwell all the Kings children, beeing very obedient to their parents becke.

            <p>The elder ſort if they be of a ſtrong and robuſtious conſtitution, are choſen for the gard of the kinges perſon, as the fitteſt perſons to be about him, in reſpect of their approoued worth, faithfull dealing, and vprightneſſe of conſcience, for the ordering and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of all matters. Some giue Phyſicke to thoſe that are ſicke, by making and giuing to them a medicinall aliment of hony, that is drawne from Anniſe, Saffron, and <hi>Hiacinthes.</hi> But if any thorough age or ſickneſſe chance to dye, then they whoſe office it is to carry forth the dead bodies to burying, do forthwith flocke together, carrying the dead bodie of their brother on their ſhoulders, as it were on a Beere, leaſt the pure Honny-combes might be fainted with any vncleanlineſſe, ſtinke, or naſtineſſe. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/>

And that they might beare the world in hand, that they are no priuy or ſecret Theeues in their flying, they make a noyſe and humming, which together with their flight, is heard both to beginne and end: Which ſound, whether it proceedeth from the mouth, or from the motion of their winges: <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi>

But if he die by the way, then they all mournefully depart, euerie one to his owne place ſeperating themſelues, or peraduenture for a while, they worke vp theyr hony-combes not yet finiſhed, but neuer make any more hony; So that at length, growing to be lazie, ſickly, waſted, conſumed and diſtained with their owne filth and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> they all miſerably perriſh. For they cannot poſsibly liue without a King, againſt whom, none is ſo hardy as to lift vp his finger to offer him any violence, much leſſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire his deſtruction, vnleſſe he (after the faſhion of Tyrants) doe ouerthrow and turne all things vpſide downe, after his owne will and luſt, or neglecting careleſly the Weale pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, ſetteth all vpon ſixe and ſeauen. Yea, if he accuſtome himſelfe to goe often abroad, (which he cannot doe without the great hurt and preiudice of his Cittizens) they do not by and by kill him, but they take from him his wings, &amp; if he then amend his life &amp; looke better to his office, they ſingularly affect and honour him.</p>
            <p>When the King by flying away hath left his Bees, they fetch him againe, and being a fugitiue from his kingdome, they follow him amaine by his ſmell, as it were with liue and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> cry, (for amongſt them all the King ſpelleth beſt) and ſo bring him backe to his kinglie houſe. None dare venture out of his owne lodging firſt, nor ſeeke his liuing in any place, except the King himſelfe firſt going forth, do direct them the way of their flight. For I am hardly of <hi>Aristotles</hi> mind, who affirmeth that the King neuer commeth abroad, but when the whole ſwgrme doth, which is ſeldome ſeene. But if by reaſon of his tyrannie, cruelty and violent rule, they be forced to ſeeke ſome other dwelling places, then a few dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the time appointed, there will be heard a ſolitary, mournfull, and peculiar kinde of voyce, as it were of ſome trumpet, &amp; two or three dayes before, they flie about the mouth of the Hiue; ſo when all things are in a readines for their flight, being all aſſembled, they flie all ſpeedilie away, and kill the Tyrant (whom they left behind) if he attempt to follow <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> them. But a good King they neuer forſake, and if at any time he pine and fall away by reaſon of ſicknes, any plague or murren, or through old age, all the meaner ſort do make mone, the whole route and multitude of Senators and Aldermen do greatly bewaile him, not conueighing any meate into their hiues, nor yet looking out of doores for meere griefe, filling the whole houſe with ſorrowfull hummings &amp; laments, and gathering them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues by heapes about the carkaſſe of the dead King, they doe with great noyſe tragically mourne for him. Neither doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuance of time mittigate or take away their griefe, but at length all of theſe faithfull friends, partly through griefe, and partly through famine, they are cleane conſumed and brought to death.</p>
            <p>Whilſt they haue a King, the whole ſwarme and company is kept in awfull order, but he being gone, they goe vnder the protection of other Kings. They haue not many kings <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> at once, neither can they endure Vſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

And if in one ſwarme there be two Kings, (as ſometimes it fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth out) then one part adhaereth to the one king, and the other ſide cleaueth to the other, ſo that ſometimes in one hiue, you ſhall find hony-combes of ſundry formes &amp; faſhions: where they behaue themſelues ſo honeſtly and neighborly, that the one medled<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Neither are Bees onely, examples to men of politicall prudence and fidelity, but alſo preſidents for them to imitate in many other vertues. For whereas Nature hath made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Zooa agelaia,</hi> that is, creatures liuing in companies and ſwarmes, yet do they all things for the common good of their owne route and multitude, excepting euer the Drones and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> theeues, whom if they take tripping in the manner, they reward with condigne puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Their houſes are common, their children common, their lawes and ſtatutes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and their country common. They couple together without queſtion, as Camels do, priuily and apart by themſelues, which whether it proceed of modeſty, or be done through the admirable inſtinct of Nature, I leaue it to the diſpute and queint reſolution of thoſe graue Doctors, who being laden with the badges and cognizances of learning, doe not ſticke to affirme that they can render a true reaſon euen by their owne wits, of all the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in nature, though neuer ſo obſcure, hid and difficult.</p>
            <p>Flyes and dogges doe farre otherwiſe, whoſe impudencie is ſuch, that hauing no regard of times, perſons, or places, they will not giue place, or be diſioyned. Yea the <hi>Maſſagets</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> (as <hi>Herodotus</hi> writeth) hauing their quiuer of arrowes on their carts, they dealt with their vviues very vnſeaſonably, and though all men beheld it, yet they moſt impudently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned it. And that which is worſer, this beaſtly faſhion is crept amongſt the vſurpers, or at leaſt profeſſors of the Chriſtian name, who ſhame not openly to kiſſe and embrace, yea euen to play &amp; meddle with filthy whores &amp; brothelly queanes. Bees ſurely will co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demne theſe kind of people of beſtiall impudency and wanton ſhameleſneſſe; or cauſing them to bluſh if they haue any grace, will teach them repentance. Neither are they altogether ſuch creatures as cannot endure or away with muſicke, (which is the princeſſe of delights, and the delight of Princes) as many vnlearned people cannot, but are exceedingly delighted with tune in any harmony wherein is no iarring, ſo the ſame be ſimple and vnaffected. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/>
            </p>
            <p>And although they haue not the skill to daunce according to due time, order and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion in Muſicke, as they ſay Elephants can, yet doe they make ſwifter or ſlovver theyr flight, according to the Trumpettors mind, who with his ſharpe and ſhrill ſound cauſeth them to beſtirre themſelues more ſpeedily; but beating ſlowly and not ſo loude vpon his braſen inſtrument, maketh them more ſlow, and to take more leyſure. Neither hath Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> onely the moſt ingenious of all liuing creatures, but by diſcipline hath made them tame and tractable. For they doe not onely know the hand and voyce of the hony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, or him that hath the charge and ordering of the ſame, but they alſo ſuffer him to do what liketh him beſt: which euery man muſt needes confeſſe to be an argument of a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and noble diſpoſition, thus to vnder-goe the rule of their ouer-ſeers and Surveiors, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> but the hand and diſcipline of a ſtranger, they will by no meanes endure.</p>
            <p>As for oeconomicall vertues they excell alſo, and namely for moderate frugalitie and temperance, not profuſely and prodigally waſting and deuouring the great ſtore of hony which they gathered in the Sommer ſeaſon, but they ſuſtaine themſelues therwith in win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and that very ſparingly: And ſo whilſt they feede vppon few meates, and thoſe of the pureſt ſort, they purchaſe long life, (the reward of ſobrietie.) Neither are they ſo higgard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and ſordidous minded, but when as they haue gathered more hony then their number can well ſpend, they communicate and impart ſome very liberally amongſt the Drones. As for their clenlineſſe theſe may be certaine Arguments, that they neuer exonerate na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture within their hiues, (except conſtrained thereto by ſome ſicknes, foule weather, &amp; for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> ſome vrgent neceſſity) that they conuay away the dead carkaſſes, that they touch no rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten nor ſtinking fleſh, or any other thing, no herbe that is withered, nor no ill-ſenting or decayed flovvers.</p>
            <p>They kill not their enemies within their hiues, they drinke none but running water, and that which is throughly defecated: they will not dwell in houſes impure &amp; foule, ſluttiſh,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:22894:41"/>
blacke, or full of any feculent or dreggy refuſe, and the excrementes of the labourers and ſickly, they gather on a heape without their pauilions, and aſſoone as their leaſure ſerueth; it is carried cleane away. Concerning their temperance and chaſtity, (although it hath beene partly touched before,) yet this I will adde, that it is wonderfull what ſome men haue obſerued. For whereas all other creatures doe couple in the open ſight of men, the Elephant onely excepted, and Waſpes likewiſe not much differing in kind, do the ſame: yet Bees were neuer yet ſeene ſo to ioyne together, but either within their hiues very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly they apply themſelues to that buſineſſe, or elſe abroad do it without any witneſſes. And they are no leſſe valiant, then modeſt and temperate, <hi>Dum corpora bello obiectant, pulchramque petunt per vulner a mortem.</hi> Their war is either ciuill or forraine. Of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> there be diuers cauſes, that is to ſay: the multitude of their Dukes or Captaines ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in waight to betray both King and kingdome: ſcarſity of vittaile, ſtraightnes of place and roome, corruption of manners and idleneſſe. For if they haue no Dukes, then is it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient (as otherwhiles it happeneth) they ſtay the ouerplus, leaſt the number of them growing to great, either violence might be offered to the King, or the commons drawne to ſome ſedition.</p>
            <p>They kill them moſt of all, when as they haue no great ſtore of young Bees to plant any new colonies, ouerthrowing and ſpoyling withall their hony-combs (if they haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.) They execute alſo Theeues and Drones, ſo often as they haue not roome inough to do their buſines in, (for they hold the more inward part of the Hiue,) ſo taking from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> at one time, both their hony-combs and meat. The ſcarſity and lacke of Hony, cauſeth them alſo to be at deadly feude, ſo that the ſhort Bees do encounter the long with might and maine.</p>
            <p>In the which bicketing, if the ſhort be Conquerors, it will be an excellent Swarme, but if fortune ſmile on the long Bees ſide, they liue idlely, making neuer any good Honny. Whoſoeuer getteth the day, they are ſo giuen to rapine and reuenge, as they take no priſoners, nor leaue any place to mercy, but commit all to the ſword. Now concerning their forren warres, I muſt ſay that they giue place to no other liuing creature, either in fortitude, or hardy venturing: and if either men, Foure-footed-beaſts, Birds, or Waſpes, do either hinder, diſquiet, or kill any of them, ſo that they be not well contented, agaynſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> all theſe they oppoſe themſelues very ſtoutly, according to their power wounding them. They hate extreamely adulterous perſons, and ſuch men as bee ſmeared with any oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, thoſe that haue curled or criſped haire (as alſo all vnfaithfull and baſe raskally peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) and all thoſe that weare any red clothes of the colour of bloud: as contrarywiſe they loue and reuerence exceedingly their Maiſters, Keepers, Tutors, Defenders, and Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers: ſo that ſitting vpon their hands, they doe rather tickle and licke them in ſporting wiſe, then either wound or hurt them, though neuer ſo little with their ſting. Yea theſe men may ſafely without any touch of hurt, and without any couering to their hands, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther together the Swarmes in a very hot Summer; yea, handle, place them in order, heap vp together, ſit or ſtand before their Hiues, and with a ſticke take cleane away Drones, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> Theeues, Waſpes, and Hornets.</p>
            <p>If any Souldier looſeth his ſting in fight, like one that had his Sword or Speare taken from him, he preſently is diſcouraged and diſpaireth, not liuing long, through extreamity or griefe. Going forth into the fielde to fight, they ſtay till the watchword be giuen, which being done, they flocke in great heapes round about their King (if he be a good one) en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all their quarrell in one ſet battell. In their order of fighting, how great vertue, cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, ſtrength, and nobleneſſe, theſe poore creatures ſhew, as well wee our ſelues can te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie, and they better who haue aſſured vs by their writings, that whole armies of armed men haue beene tamed by the ſtings of Bees, and that Lyons, Beares, and Horſes, haue beene ſlaine by meanes of them. And yet (how fierce and warlike ſoeuer they ſeeme to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> be,) they are appeaſed and made gentle with continuall or daiely company, and vnleſſe they be to much netled and angred, they liue peaceably inough without any great trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, neuer hurting any one maliciouſly or deceitfully, that ſtandeth before their Hiues. If I ſhould goe about to declare at large their ingenie, naturall inclination, cunning worke-manſhip and memory, I ſhould not onely giue vnto them with <hi>Virgil: Particulam auru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

diuinae,</hi> but alſo <hi>hauſtus mentis aethereae,</hi> and <hi>(liceat Pythagoricè errare,)</hi> the <hi>Metempſuchoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> of that ingenious Philoſopher. For after that they are incloſed in a cleane and a ſweet hiue; they gather out of gummie and moiſt licqour-yeelding trees, a kind of glutinous ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, thicke, clammy and tough, (called of the Latines <hi>Comoſis,</hi> and of the Greekes <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tys,)</hi> eſpecially from Elmes, Willowes, Canes or Reedes, yea euen from ſtones; and this they lay for the firſt foundation of their worke, ſo couering it all ouer as with a hard cruſt at firſt, bringing to it afterwardes another layer of <hi>Piſſocera,</hi> which is a kinde of iuyce of Waxe and Pitch, made with Gumme and Roſin, and ouer that againe they lay <hi>Propolis,</hi> which we call Bee-glew.</p>
            <p>In this ſame three-fold tilie, and ſure ground-worke thus artificially begunne, they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> doe not onely laugh to ſcorne, ieſt at, and mocke the eyes of the ouer-curious ſpectators of their Common-wealth and workes, but that which no man conſiders, they doe heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by defend both themſelues and theirs, againſt raine, cold, ſmall vermin and beaſts, and all their enemies. Then after this they build their Combes, with ſuch an Architectonicall prudence, that <hi>Archimedes</hi> in reſpect of them ſeemes to be no body. For firſt of all they ſet vp the cells of their Kings and Princes, in the higher place of the hony-combes, beeing large, fayre, ſumptuous, ſtately and loftie, beeing cunningly wrought, of the moſt tryed, pureſt, &amp; refined Waxe, trenching them round for the greater defence of the regall Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, with mound and encloſure, as it were with a ſtrong Wall, Bulwarke, or Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/>
            </p>
            <p>And as Bees in regard of their age and condition, are of three ſorts, ſo likewiſe doe they deuide their Cells: for to the moſt auncient they appoint houſes next to the Court, (as thoſe that are the fitteſt to be of his priuie counſaile, &amp; garders of his perſon) next to theſe are placed the young Bees, and thoſe that be but one yeere old. And they of middle yeres and ſtronger bodies, are lodged in the vttermoſt roomes, as thoſe that are fitteſt and beſt able to fight for their King and country. Yet <hi>Aristotle</hi> ſaith, that Bees in the making of their Tents or Cells, doe firſt of all prouide for themſelues, and next for their King &amp; his Nephewes, and laſtlie for the Drones. And as in the fabricature of their hony-combes, they make the faſhion according to the magnitude and figure of the place, faſhioning it either orbicular, long, ſquare, ſword-like, or foote-like, &amp;c. according to their owne li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> running out ſometimes in length eyght foote: ſo their little Cells contrariwiſe, are framed after a certaine forme in a Geometricall proportion and meaſure; for by rule they are iuſtly Sexangular, and capable enough to hold the tenant.</p>
            <p>The whole combe containeth foure orders of Celles; The firſt the Bees occupie; the next the Drones poſſeſſe; the third, thoſe that are called of the Greekes <hi>Chadoones,</hi> of the Latines, <hi>Apum ſoboles,</hi> (call them if you pleaſe <hi>Schadones.)</hi> The laſt is appointed for the roome of hony making. There be ſome who conſtantly auerre, that the Drones do make combes in the ſame hiue the labouring Bees doe, but that they lacke the skill and power of mellification, it beeing vncertaine whether this comes to paſſe either through theyr groſſnes and bigbellied fatnes, or through their ſetled &amp; naturall lazines. And if through <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> the weightines of the honie the combes beginne to ſhake and wagge, and to leane &amp; bend as though they were readie to fall, then doe they reare them vp, and vnderproppe them with pillars made archwiſe, that they may the more readilie diſpatch their buſineſſe, and execute their charges, (for it is neceſſarie that to euery combe there be a ready way.)</p>
            <p>In ſome places, as in <hi>Pontus,</hi> and in the Cittie of <hi>Amiſus,</hi> Bees make white hony, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any combes at all, but this is ſildome ſeene. And if a man would conſider the rare and admirable contexture and fabricke of their honie-combes, farre excelling all humane Art and conceit, who would not ſubſcribe with the Poet, <hi>Eſſe Apibus partem diuinae mentis, et haustus aethereos?</hi> who will deny them (I ſay) either imagination, fantaſie, iudgement, memorie, and ſome certaine glimſe of reaſon? But I will not diſpute of this, neither am <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> I of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> mind, who conceited that the ſoules of wiſe men, and of other ingenious creatures, departed into Bees. But whoſoeuer will diligently examine how they deuide their labours, as ſome to make vppe the combes, ſome to gather hony, to heape together their meate, to trimme and dreſſe vp the houſes, to clenſe the common draught, to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore the ruinous walls, to couer thoſe places wherein any thing is to be kept, to draw out
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:22894:42"/>
the very ſtrength of the hony, to diſgeſt it, to carry it to their Cells, to bring water to the thirſtie labourers, to giue foode at ſet and appointed howres to the old Bees that ſitte, to defend their King with ſuch ouer-ſight and painefull regard, to driue away Spyders, and all other enemies, to carry forth the dead, (that no ſtinke or ill ſauour hurt,) euery one to know and goe to his owne proper cell, and generally, all of them not to ſtray farre from home to ſeeke their liuing; and when the flowers are ſpent neere their lodgings, to ſend out their eſpialls to looke for more in places further diſtant, to lye with their faces vpward vnder the leaues when they haue ſet foorth any voiage by night, leaſt their wings beeing much moiſtened by the dew, they ſhould come tardie home the next day, to ballance and peize their light bodies with carrying a ſtone in ſtormie weather, and when there is anie whirlewind, to fly on the further ſide of the hedge, for feare leaſt either they might be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> or beaten downe by the boiſterous violence thereof. Whoſoeuer (I ſay) wil du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie conſider all this, muſt needes confeſſe, that they obſerue a wonderfull order and forme in their Common-wealth and gouernment, &amp; that they are of a very ſtrange nature and ſpirit.</p>
            <p>I had almoſt omitted to ſpeake of that naturall loue which they beare to theyr young, a great vertue, and ſildome ſeene in the parents of this age. For Bees doe ſitte vpon theyr combes (when they haue laid their increaſe) almoſt like vnto birds, neither wil they ſtirre from thence but in caſe of pinching hunger, returning out of hand to their breeding place againe, as though they were afeard leaſt that by any long ſtay and abſence, the vvorke of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> their little cell might be couered ouer by ſome Spyders web (which often happeneth) or the young by taking cold might be endangered. Their young ones be not very nice or tender, nor cockeringly brought vp, for being but bare three dayes old, as ſoone as euer they begin to haue wings, they enioyne them their taske, &amp; haue an eye to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that they be not idle, though neuer ſo little. They are ſo excellent in diuination, that they euen feele afore-hand, and haue a ſence of taine and cold that is to come, for then (euen by Natures inſtinct) they fly not far from home: and when they take their iourney to ſeeke for theyr repaſt, (which is neuer done at any ſet and ordinary time, but onely in faire weather) they take paines continually and diligently without any ſtay, beeing laden with ſuch plentie of hony, that oftentimes being ouer-wearied, they faint in their returne to their own priuate <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> cotages, not beeing able to attaine them. And becauſe ſome of them in regard of their roughnes are vnfit to labour, by rubbing their bodies againſt ſtones and other hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they are ſmoothed, afterwards addreſsing themſelues moſt ſtourly to their buſineſſe. The younger ſort beſtirre the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> right doutelie without dores, bringing to the hiue all that is needfull. The elder looke to the family, placing in due order that hony which is gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and wrought by the middle-aged Bees. In the morning they be all very ſilent, till one of them awaken all the reſt with his thriſe humming noyſe, euery one buſtling himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his owne proper office and charge. Returning at night, they are as it were in an vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roare at the firſt, and after that, they make a little muttering or murmuring among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, vntill the principall officer appointed for ſetting of the watch, by his flying round <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> about, and his ſoft and gentle noyſe, dooth as it were couertly and priuily charge them in their kings name to prepare themſelues to reſt; and ſo this token being giuen, they are as ſilent as fiſhes, ſo that laying ones <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Which beeing true, we muſt then thinke it no ſtrange mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that <hi>Aristaeus, Philiſtius, Ariſtomachus Solenſis, Menus</hi> the <hi>Samnite,</hi> and ſixe hundred others, that haue writ of the Nature of Bees, bidding adue to all thoſe pleaſures and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacies that are found in Citties, for fyftie and eyght yeeres ſpace together, inhabited the woods and fieldes, that they might more exactly come to the knowledge of their order of liuing, and naturall diſpoſitions, leauing it as a monument for poſteritie to imitate. But what theyr bodies doe worke in ours, I iudge woorth the labour and paines taking to let <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> you vnderſtand, that we may be aſſured there is nothing in Bees, but maketh to the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance of our health and good.</p>
            <p>Firſt therefore, their bodies beeing taken newly from the hiues and bruiſed, &amp; drunke <note place="margin">Medicinall vſes.</note> with ſome diareticall wine, cureth mightily the Dropſie, breaketh the ſtone, openeth the obſtructed paſſages of the vrine, and helpeth the ſuppreſsion thereof. Beeing bruiſed, they cure the wringings and grypings of the belly, if they be layd vpon the place affected: and if any haue drunke any poyſonous hony, Bees being likewiſe drunke doe expell the ſame. They mollifie hard vlcers in the lippes, and beeing bound to the part, they cure a carbun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle and the Bloody-flixe, amending alſo the cruditie of the ſtomack, and all ſpots &amp; flecks <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> in the face, beeing tempered with their owne made hony; as both <hi>Hollerius, Alexander, Benedictus</hi> and <hi>Pliny</hi> haue written.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Galen</hi> affirmeth, that if you take liue Bees out of their combes, and mixe them with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie wherin Bees haue beene found dead, you ſhall make an excellent oyntment to be vſed againſt the ſhedding and falling of the hayre in any place of the head, cauſing it to growe againe, and come afreſh. <hi>Pliny</hi> againe willeth vs to burne many Bees, commixing the aſhes with oyle, and there-with to annoynt the bald places; but wee muſt (ſaith he) take great heede that we touch no other place neere adioyning.

            <p>Bees alſo are very profitable, becauſe diuers liuing creatures are nouriſhed by, and doe feede full ſauerly on their hony, as the Beare, the Badger or Brocke, Lizards, Frogges, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, the Woodpecker or Eate-bee, Swallowes, Lapwings, the little Titmouſe, which of ſome is called a Nunne, becauſe his head is filletted as it were Nun-like, the Robin-red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breaſt, Spyders and Waſpes, as <hi>Bellonius</hi> hath well obſerued.</p>
            <p>But to what end (you will ſay) ſerueth their ſting, againſt whoſe poyſon <hi>Pliny</hi> knew no remedie? I muſt needes confeſſe truly that which cannot be denied, that the ſtings of Bees are ſometimes venomous, but that is when eyther they are madde and raging, and be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly diſquieted by meanes of anger, or ſome vehement Feauer, for otherwiſe they doe not ſting, but pricke but a little: and therefore <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> neuer made mention of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> ſtinging of Bees, ſuppoſing it very vnmeete for a man to complaine of ſo ſmall a matter as the ſting of a ſilly Bee. But yet they that haue ſucceeded him, haue obſerued paine, rednes, and ſwellings, as companions and effects of their malice, eſpecially if the ſting doe ſticke in the fleſh, which if it doe very deepe, then death hath ſometimes followed, as <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cander</hi> writeth in his <hi>Theriacis.</hi> In like manner the people of the old World (that vvee may proue the ſting of Bees to be conuerted to ſome good vſe) did (as <hi>Suidas</hi> writeth) pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh thoſe perſons who were found guilty of cooſenage, and deceitfull counterfeiting of merchandiſe after this ſort: Firſt they ſtripped the offender ſtarke naked, annointing his body all ouer with hony, then ſetting him in the open ſunne with his hands and feete faſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> bound, that by this meanes beeing tormented with flyes, Bees, and ſcorching beames of the ſunne, he might endure puniſhment, paine &amp; death, due to his lewd and wicked life. With which kind of puniſhment &amp; torture, the Spanyards doe grieuouſly vex the poore naked Ilanders of <hi>America</hi> at this day, (now called the Weſt Indies) who are vnder their rule and gouernment, not for iuſtice ſake, (as thoſe Auncients did) but for ſatisfaction and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:22894:44"/>
fulfilling of their barbarous wills, and beaſtly tyrannie, that they might ſeeme to be more cruell, then crueltie it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Noninus</hi> ſaith, that if the herbe Balme (called <hi>Apiaſtrum)</hi> be beaten, and annoynted with oyle vppon the ſtinged place, that there will enſue no hurt thereby. <hi>Florentius</hi> coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelleth the gatherer of hony, to annoynt himſelfe with the iuyce of Marſh-mallowes, for by that meanes he may ſafely and without feare take away the Combes. But the iuyce of any Mallow vvill doe as much, and eſpecially if it be mixed with Oyle: for it both preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth from ſtinging, and beſides it remedieth the ſtinged. But admit that Bees by theyr ſtinging doe vexe and diſeaſe vs, yet notwithſtanding the dead Bees ſo found in the hony, doe ſpeedily bring cure to that hurt, if they be duly applyed, abating and taking away all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> the paine and poyſon. What ſhould I ſay? No creature is ſo profitable, none leſſe ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous. GOD hath created them, and a little money and coſt will maintaine them, and ſmall prouiſion will content them. They liue almoſt in all places, yea euen in Forreſts, Woods and Mountaines; both rich and poore by their good husbandry do gather good cuſtomes and penſions by them, they paying (as all men know) very large rents for their dwelling houſes; and yet for all their tribute they pay, a man need neither keepe one ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt the more for the gathering of it, nor ſet on pot the oftner. <hi>Merula</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Varro</hi> gathered yeerely fiue thouſand pound weight of Hony: and that in a ſmall Village of Spaine, not exceeding one Akre of ground, he was wont to gaine by Honie there gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, tenne thouſand Seſterties, which is of our Engliſh coyne about fiftie pounds. Wee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> are furniſhed alſo out of their vvork-houſes or ſhops, with vvaxe, <hi>Sandaracha,</hi> Bee-glevv, combes, and dregges of waxe, which no Common-wealth can well ſpare. To ſpeake no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the examples of their vertues and noble properties, being no leſſe wholſome for the ſoule, then theſe others are for the good prouiſion and maintenaunce of our life, and for nouriſhment of our bodies neceſſary and commodious.</p>
            <p>Now for the conſeruation of Bees, it is very meete (as <hi>Pliny</hi> writeth) that we come by them lawfully, &amp; by honeſt meanes, that is, eyther by gift, or by buying of them, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken away by theft, they will not proſper with vs: euen as the herbe called Rew bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtolne, will very hardly or neuer grow. Furthermore, to keepe theſe good Pay-mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and to make them in loue with you, you muſt remoue from their Hiues mouthes, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> vnluckie, miſchieuous, and deceitfull people, and idle perſons that haue nothing to doe, cauſing them to ſtand further off: As alſo all thoſe that are diſtayned with whoredome, or infected with the diſeaſe called Gonorrhaea, or the fluxe of menſtrues, bathes, or anie thing that ſmelleth of ſmoake, mud, dung, or ordure of cattell, men or beaſts, houſes of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, ſincks, or kitchens. Mundifie &amp; correct the ayre oftentimes, infected with the breath and vapour of Toades and Serpents, by burning of Balme, Time, or Fennell; hauing great care to keepe them neate, cleane and quiet. Deſtroy all vermine and ſeekers to prey vpon their Hony, robbers, pillers and pollers, and if at any time they be ſicke, giue them Phiſicke.</p>
            <p>Nowe the ſignes of their vnhealthines, as of all other liuing creatures, are knowne by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> three things; that is, from the action offended, the outward affect of the body, and excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. For their cheerefulneſſe beeing gone, ſluggiſh dullnes, a giddy and vertiginous pace, often and idle ſtanding before the mouth of the Hiue, lacke of ſtrength, wearineſſe, litherneſſe, languiſhing, and want of ſpirit to doe any buſines, deteſtation of flowers and Honie, long watchings, and continuall ſleepings, vnaccuſtomed noyſes and hummings, are ſure arguments that Bees are not in good health. As alſo if they be ſome-what rough, not fine and trimme, dry and vnpleaſant in handling, not ſoft, harſh and rugged, not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate and tender, if their combes be infected with any manner of filthy, corrupt, and noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome ſauour, and that theyr excrements melt, ſtinke, and be full of vvormes, carrying dead carkaſſes daily out of their houſes, that they haue no regard to theyr Bees and Bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hiues, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> it is a certaine token that they are ſicke, and that ſome exidemicall, generall peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence or plague rageth amongſt them, whereof that famous Poet <hi>Virgill</hi> hath very ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantlie, but confuſedly touched ſome part, in the fourth Booke of his <hi>Georgickes,</hi> in theſe following verſes.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Many men make the Drone to be one of the 4. ſorts of Bees, which is very vnaduiſedly doone, as ſome would make vs beleeue: Becauſe they beſtow no paines in gathering the <note place="margin">The deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> Hony, nor labour it throughly to haue it perfectly wrought. He is twice ſo great as the common Bee, and greater then the Theefe, ſo that in bigneſſe he eueneth, yea, ſurpaſſeth the King himſelfe: and yet he attaineth vnto this greatneſſe, not by the gift of Nature, but by his cuſtome and trade of life. For whereas Bees doe prepare and make their celles for the breeding of Drones: they make them leſſer then the Drones, and not heere and there through the Hiue, but onely in the vttermoſt, and as it were in the baniſhed or moſt out-caſt place of all in the whole Camp and lodged Army. Beſides, the ſmall Wormes of the Drones, are far ſmaller at their firſt bringing forth, then thoſe that are of the kingly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> race, and linage of their Dukes: Who yet at length grow greater then any of them all, in regard that by labour and trauaile, they waſt and diminiſh nothing of ſuperfluous mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and thoſe groſſe humours, wherewith they abound, as alſo that both day and night (like Oxen lying at racke and Manger) they gluttonouſly rauen &amp; ſtuffe themſelues with the hony-liquor, which they againe pay for full dearely, in time of any general dearth and ſcarſity of vittaile and prouiſion.</p>
            <p>Further this is to be added, that the Drone is of a more ſhining black colour, then the true labouring Bee, he is alſo greater then the greateſt, without ſting, ſluggiſh, idle, ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, without hart or courage, cowardous and vnapt to war, not daring to venture life &amp; limbe in manly Martiall trade, as the true Ligitimate Bees will. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aristotle</hi> ſaith, that they breed and liue amongeſt the true Bees, and when they flye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, they are carryed ſcatteringly, here and there aloft in the aire as it were, with ſome violence or tempeſt; ſo exerciſing themſelues for a time, they returne from whence they came, ther greedily feeding vpon the hony. Now why the droues may be compared with the Dukes and Princes, in reſpect of their corporature, and Bees like vnto them in theyr ſting, let vs heare <hi>Aristotles</hi> reaſon.

They ſuffer punniſhment, and are ſcourged many times in the whole Bee-common-wealth, not onely for pretence of idleneſſe, gluttony, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertion, and rauenous greedineſſe, to which they are too much adicted; but becauſe lack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their ſting, and by that defect, being as is were emaculated, they dare ſhew themſelues in publique.</p>

               </gap> we may call them the very ſlaues and bond-men of the true Bees, to whom they owe all due homage and ſubiection, wherefore they exerciſe their authority ouer them, thru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> them firſt out of doores by head and ſhoulders, like a company of drudges to theyr worke; and if they be any thing negligent, not beſtirring themſelues quickly and liuely, they giue them correction, and punniſh them without all pitty and mercy. For in the moneth of Iune, two or three Bees, (eſpecially of the younger ſort) will hale out of the Hiue one Drone, there beating of him with there winges, pricking and tormenting him with their ſtinges, and if he offer any reſiſtance to their Lordly rule, then they violently caſt him downe from the ſhelfe or ſtep whereon he holdeth, down to the earth as though they would breake his necke. Thus when they haue glutted their wils, and puniſhed him at the full, they at length put him to a ſhamefull death, all which we haue often beheld, not without great admiration and pleaſure. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/>
            </p>
            <p>Sometimes the Drones remaine like baniſhed perſons, before the enterance of the hiue, and dare not venture to preſſe in. For three cauſes ſpecially the Bees do driue and caſt out the drones: either when they multiply aboue meaſure, or when they haue not place y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough left for their labourers, or that they be pinched with hunger and famine, for lacke of Hony. And as they carry a deadly hatred againſt the Drones, ſo to make it more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant, they will not hurt ſuch perſons as offer either to take away with their bare handes any of the drones, and to caſt them away, yea, though they be in the greateſt heat of their fight. <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his ninth Booke <hi>De histo.

Cap.</hi> 40. affirmeth, that Bees are engendered apart one from another, if their Captaine liueth: but in caſe their King and Captaine dies, ſome ſay they breed in the Bees celles, and that of all others of this kinde, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> they are the moſt noble and couragious.</p>
            <p>The young drones are bred without any King, but the true younger Bees neuer: for they deriue their originall and petigree from the kingly ſtocke. Some will ſay that the <note place="margin">Their genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> young drones doe fetch their originall from the flowers of the Herbe <hi>Cerinthe</hi> (deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by <hi>Pliny,</hi> which is a kind of Hony ſuckle, hauing the taſt of the Hony and Waxe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether)
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:22894:46"/>
from the Oliue tree and Reede; but this opinion is weakely grounded, and ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vpon ſmall reaſon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aristotle</hi> affirmeth, that they proceede from the longer and bigger Bees, yea, and thoſe that are tearmed Thieues: which without queſtion he receiued either from the Auncient Philoſophers, or ſome others that had the charge and were skilfull of ordering Honny, that liued in his time. Some will haue them to breed and come from putrifaction, as <hi>Iſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore</hi> from ſtinking and putrified Mules: <hi>Cardan</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Aſſes, <hi>Plutarke</hi> and <hi>Seruius</hi> from Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Otherſome are of opinion, that they firſt proceede of Bees, and that afterwards they degenerate baſtardlike from them, after they haue loſt their ſtings, for then they become Drones: neither are they afterwardes knowne to gather any Honny, but being as it were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> depriued of their ſtrength, they grow effeminate, ceaſing either to hurt, or to do any good at all.</p>
            <p>Some againe hold the contrary ſide, aſſuring vs vppon their knowledge, that the true labouring Bee fetcheth his beginning from the Drone, becauſe long experience (the Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of wiſedome) hath taught vs, that there is yearely knowne to be the greater ſwarme, when there is the greater multitude of Drones. But this to me ſeemeth rather the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe and inuention of ſome curious braine, then any true grounded reaſon. For becauſe that many Drones breede (as it commeth alwaies to paſſe in good and plentifull yeares) therefore there ſhould be greater Swarmes is no good conſequent: but contrariwiſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the multitude of Bees do greatly increaſe through the moderatenes of the pure aire, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> and the plenty of the Hony-dropping dew, and through the aboundance of this milliflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous moyſture, there muſt needs follow a greater foiſon and ſtore of drones: as the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher hath well obſerued. But admit that this be true, that whereas there is the greater encreaſe of drones, there ſhould yearly enſue the more ſwarmings: yet muſt we not ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon conclude, that Bees do owe, and ought to aſcribe their firſt originall from Drones, but rather that they are indebted and bound in honeſty to the drones, becauſe in time of breeding, they giue much warmth and comfort to their young (as <hi>Pliny lib. 11. c.</hi> 11. ſaith) conferring vppon them a liuely heat, fit for their encreaſe and proſpering. Some deuide them into male and female, and that by coupling together they make a propagation of their kind, although (as <hi>Athenaeus</hi> writeth) neither drones nor Bees were euer yet ſeen of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> any one to couple together.</p>
            <p>But whereas Waſpes, Hornets, and other Cut-waſted creatures that make any combs and breed in the ſame, haue beene ſometimes (though ſeldome) ſeene, both by vs and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle,</hi> to ioyne together, I can ſurely ſee no cauſe why we ſhould vtterly take from them the vſe of <hi>Venus,</hi> though in that reſpect they be very modeſt and moderate.</p>
            <p>I haue before in the diſcourſe of their generation ſaid, that the Bees do make the male kind, and the Drones to be but the female; but ſith that in the time of Hony-making, they punniſh them ſo ſharply after they haue eiected them from poſſeſſion firſt, ſo that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they put them to death, I can hardly be enduced to beleeue that the drones are but the female kind, conſidering that one thing would ecclipſe and ouercaſt all thoſe reſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> vertues which all men know to be in Bees, to deale thus cruelly with their Parents. To what vſe therefore ſerue they in hiues? Seeing <hi>Virgill</hi> in the fourth booke of his Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giks thus deſcribeth them;</p>

            <p>But the moſt approoued Authors ſet downe diuers good vſes of drones. For if there <note place="margin">Their vſes.</note>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:22894:46"/>
be but a few of them among the Bees; they make them the more carefull about their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, and to looke more duely to their taske: not by their good example, (for they liue in continuall idleneſſe) but becauſe they might continue their liberality towardes ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, they worke the more carefully in their Honnie-ſhoppe. And (if <hi>Bartholemaeus</hi> doe not deceiue vs) theſe Drones bee not altogether idle: but they imploie themſelues about the building of the Kings Houſe, which they make large, ſtately, and very ſumptuous in the higher and middle part of the Combes, being very faire to ſee too in reſpect of their couering.</p>
            <p>So then they are but lazie, in reſpect of Hony-making and gathering: but if you looke toward their Art or ſcience of building, they are to be accounted excellent deuiſers of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> frame and chiefe Maiſters of the whole worke. For as the Bees do faſhion out the combs of the Drones nigh the Kings Pallace: ſo againe, for the like counterchange of kindnes, the Drones are the ſole inuentors, and principall work-maiſters of the Kinges Court; for which cauſe both they and their of-ſpring, kinsfolkes, and friends, (if they haue any) are bountifully rewarded of the whole ſtocke of Bees, by giuing them franckly &amp; freely their diet and maintenance which coſteth them nothing.</p>
            <p>The Lockers or holes of the vp-growne Bees, are ſomewhat to large, if you reſpect the quantity of their bodies, but their combes leſſer, for thoſe they build themſelues, &amp; theſe other are made by the Bees, becauſe it was not thought co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient and indifferent, ſo great a portion of meat to be giuen to ſuch vile labourers and hirelings, as was due to their own <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> Sons and Daughters, and thoſe that are naturally ſubiects.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tzetzes,</hi> and ſome other Greekes doe beſides affirme, that the Drones are the Bees Butlers or Porters to carry them water, aſcribing moreouer to them a gentle and kindly heat, with which they are ſaid to keepe warme, cheriſh and nouriſh the young breede of the Bees; by this meanes as it were, quickning them, and adding to them both life and ſtrength.</p>
            <p>The ſame affirmeth <hi>Columella</hi> in theſe wordes. The Drones further much the Bees for the procreation of their iſſue, for they ſitting vpon their kind or generation, the Bees are ſhaped and attaine to their figure, and therefore for the maintenaunce, education, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of a new yſſue, they receiue the more friendly entertainement. And <hi>Pliny lib. 11. c.</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> 11. differeth not from him. For not onely they are great helpers to the Bees in any ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitectonicall or cunning deuiſed frame (as hee ſaith) but alſo they doe good in helping and ſuccouring their young, by giuing them much warmth and kindly heat, vvhich the greater it is (vnleſſe there be ſome lacke of Hony in the meane ſpace) the greater will the ſwarme be.</p>
            <p>In ſumme, except they ſhould ſtand the Bees in ſome good ſtead, the Almighty would neuer haue encloſed them both in one houſe, and as it were made them freemen of the ſame Citty. Neither doubtleſſe would the Bees by maine force violently breake in vpon them, as being the Sworne and profeſſed enemies of their common-wealth, except when their ſlauiſh multitude being to much encreaſed, they might feare ſome violence or rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> or for lacke of prouiſion: at which time who ſeeth not, that it were farre better the Maiſter Worke-men, free Maſons, and Carpenters might bee ſpared, then the true la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Husbandman, and tiller of the Eearth? Eſpecially ſince that miſſing theſe, our life is endangered for lacke of meate, and other neceſſaries, and thoſe other for a time we may very well ſpare without our vndoing, and for a need, euery one may build his ovvne lodging. But as they be profitable members, not exceeding a ſtinted and certaine num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, ſo if they be to many, they bring a ſickneſſe called the Hiue-euill, as well becauſe they conſume the food of the hony-making Bees, as for that in regard of their extreame heat, they choke and ſuffocate them.</p>
            <p>This diſeaſe is by the Authour of <hi>Geoponicon</hi> thus remedyed. Moyſten with Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> inwardly the lidde or couering of their Hiue, and earely in the Morning opening it, you ſhall finde Drones ſitting on the droppes that are on the couers, for beeing glutted with Honny, they are exceeding thirſtie, and by that meanes they vvill ſticke faſt to the moyſt and Devvie places of the Couer: So that vvith ſmall adoe, you may

either deſtroye them quite, or elſe if you pleaſe, take away what number you liſt your ſelfe. And if you will take away withall their young, who are not yet winged, and firſt pulling off their heades throw them among the other Bees, you ſhall beſtow on them a very welcome dinner. But what the dreaning of Drones portended, and what matter they Miniſter in the Hieroglyphicall Art, let <hi>Apomaſueris</hi> reueale and diſcloſe out of the Schooles of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and <hi>Perſians.</hi> I thinke I haue diſcharged my duety, if I haue ſet dovvne their true Vſes, true Nature, generation, degeneration, deſcription, and names.</p>

               <hi>Fur</hi> in Latine, or Theefe in Engliſh, is by <hi>Aristotle</hi> called <hi>Phoor,</hi> of <hi>Heſychius Phoorios:</hi> from whence I take the Latine word <hi>Fur</hi> to be deriued. Some haue thought that theeues <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> 
               <note place="margin">Of Bees cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led theeues.</note> are one proper ſort of Bees, although they be very great, and blacke, hauing a larger bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie or Bulke then the true Bee, and yet leſſer then the Drones, they haue purchaſed this theeuiſh name, becauſe they doe by theft and robbery deuoure Honny, belonging to others, and not to them. The Bees do eaſily endure, and can well away with the preſence of the drones, and do as it were greete and bid one another welcome, but the Theeues they cannot endure, in regard that the Bees do naturally hate them, for in their abſence the Theeues priuily and by ſtealth creepe in, there robbing and conſuming their treaſure of Honny, ſo greedily and haſtily (without chewing) ſwallowing it downe, that beeing met withall by the true Bees in their returne homewards, &amp; found ſo vnweildy by means of their fulneſſe, that they cannot get away, nor be able to reſiſt, but are ready to burſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> they are ſeuerely punniſhed, and for their demerites by true Iuſtice put to death. Neither thus onely do they prodigally conſume &amp; ſpend the Bees meate, but alſo priuilie breed in their celles, whereby it often commeth to paſſe, that there are as many drones &amp; Theeues, as true and lawfull Bees.</p>
            <p>Theſe neither gather Hony, nor build houſes, nor help to beare out any mutuall labor with Bees: for which cauſe they haue Watch-men or Warders appointed to obſerue and ouerſee by night ſuch as are ouerwearied by taking great and vndefatigable paines in the day time, to ſecure them from the Theeues and Robbers, who if they perceiue any Theefe to be ſtolne in a doores, they preſently ſet vppon him, beate, and either kill him outright, or leauing him for halfe dead, they throw him out. Oftentimes alſo it happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> that the Theefe being glutted and ouercloyed with Honny, cannot fly away or get himſelfe gone in time, but lyeth wallowing before the Hiues entrance, vntill his enemies either in comming forth or returning home do ſo find him, and ſo with ſhame diſcredit and ſcoffing-ſcorne ſlay him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aristotle</hi> appointeth no office, charge or buſineſſe to the Theefe, but I thinke that he is ordained for this end, that he might be as it were a ſpur to prick forwards, to whet and <note place="margin">Their vſes.</note> quicken the courage of the true Bees, when the other offer them any iniury: and to ſtirre and encourage them to a greater vigilancy, diligence, and doing of right and iuſtice to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one particularly. For I cannot ſee to what other purpoſe Thieues ſhould ſerue in a Chriſtian common-wealth, or what vſe might be made of ſuch as lie in waight to do diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> and practiſe by crafty fetches, Ambuſhes, and deceitfull treacheries, to wound their Neighbours, either in their eſtimation, credit, or goodes.

that a Waſpe is a creature that liueth in companies together, one with another, ſubiect to a ciuill gouernment vnder one King or Ruler, induſtrious, mutuall friendes one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ingenious, crafty, ſubtle, quicke, and cunning, of a very quarrelſome nature, and much ſubiect to anger and teſtineſſe. This is a good Argument of their ciuill and politicall manner of life, in that they liue not ſolitarily in a deſart or Wilderneſſe where no man keepeth, but they build for themſelues a Citty, both excellent and admirable for the notable buildings and houſes in it, where they ſpend their time (for the moſt part) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the mutable and neuer fayling lawes of Nature, obſeruing and keeping euer the Golden meane, as well in their daily taskes, as in their diſpoſitions and affections of mind. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides, they are gouerned with a kingly, not with a tyrannicall gouernment, (as <hi>Aelia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> ſaith) although by nature they are great fighters, eger, bioyſterous, and vehemently tempeſtuous: and he is led to ſay this, becauſe their Dukes or generals are ſtingleſſe, or rather hauing ſtings as their Subiects, they will not vſe the ſame to the hurt of their infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors, by thruſting it forth, or ſtriking in paſſion.</p>
            <p>Now although they be twice ſo great, and harder or rougher then the other Waſpes, yet are they not vnfurniſhed of the vertue of patience and clemency, or gentle and debo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naire behauiour, by which meanes they keepe in order, and containe in their liſts, as it were by gentle language, their vnruly rout, and mutinous companies. There is no man but will confeſſe, that this is an euident token and Argument of their mutuall loue, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> great good liking which they bear one to another: for whoſoeuer dare be ſo knack-hardy as to come neere there houſes or dwelling places where they haue to do, and to offer any violence or hurt to the ſame, at the noyſe of ſome one of them, all the whole Swarme ruſheth out, being put into an amazed feare, to help their fellow Cittizen, and doe ſo bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily beſtirre themſelues about the eares of their moleſters, as that they ſend them away packing with more then an ordinary paſe, and if we will credit <hi>Aelianus.</hi> The <hi>Phaſelites</hi> in times paſt were conſtrained to forſake their Citty, for all their defence, munition, and Armour, onely through the multitude, and cruell fierceneſſe of the Waſpes, wherewith they were anoyed.</p>
            <p>Againe, this manifeſtly prooueth, that they want not a harty and fatherly affection, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> becauſe with more then heroycall courage and inuincible fury, they ſet vpon all perſons, of what degree or quality ſoeuer, that dare attempt to lye in wait to hurt or deſtroy theyr young breede, no whit at all dreading <hi>Neoptolemus, Pyrrhus, Hector, Achilles,</hi> or <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memnon</hi> himſelfe, the Captaine generall of all the whole Graecians if he were preſent.

            <p>Some waſpes doe proceede from the ſtinking carkaſſe of a Crocodile, if wee may giue any credite to the Egyptians and their fellowes; and for that cauſe, when they imagine or thinke a waſpe, they paint and draw out the ſhape and forme of a Crocodile or a Horſe. From hence <hi>Hierom Cardan</hi> would make this collection, that of euery corrupted liuing creature, another doth proceede: which in my conceit is very abſurd and againſt all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. For this beeing granted, the generation of waſpes would be infinite, and daily expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience would read a Lecture of contradiction againſt him, vpon the progreſſe of Natures workes. Many times waſpes doe breede by the mutuall company of the male &amp; female together, which though <hi>Athaeneus</hi> counteth but a fable, yet for all that, ſith the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> doth plainely tell vs, that hee hath beene an eye-witnes to the ſame, (as in his firſt booke <hi>De generat. Animal. cap.</hi> 16. and in his ninth booke <hi>De histor. Animal. cap.</hi> 41.) I will wholy incline to his iudgement. But what manner of beginning they haue by ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning together, and how it is perfited &amp; accompliſhed, let vs a little lend our liſtening eares to <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and <hi>Pliny</hi> his Interpreter.</p>
            <p>The Princes or Ring-leaders of the waſpes, when they haue made choyce of a fit place for themſelues vnder the earth, either in the holes, chincks, or clefts of the Rockes, or in thatched houſes, (as I haue often ſeene) there they make there combes in the beginning of Sommer, faſhioning their ſmall cells with foure little dores, wherein ſmall wormes do breede, who when they are more growne, they make yet other greater dores or hatches, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> and then againe, when theyr young are at the greateſt, they make others, ſo that towards the end of Autumne, you ſhall find many, and thoſe very large neſtes: wherin their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Commaunder doth breed, not with euery waſpe indifferently, but onely with thoſe of his owne race and princely linage. They are bred in the moſt eminent and higheſt placo of the waſpe neſt, like vnto great wormes, their celles being foure or fiue in number, cloſe
<pb facs="tcp:22894:49"/>
ioyned and couched together, for otherwiſe they would encreaſe after the ſame ſort in all reſpects as the common waſpes doe.</p>
            <p>The excrement is onely in the ſmall wormes, and their young increaſe remaineth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moueable without any ſtirring before they be able to flye, and whilſt they are couered as it were with a thinne membrane, and yet in the ſame ſeaſon of the yeere, and in the ſpace of one day, you ſhall manifeſtly perceiue a great difference: for one flyeth out, another ſticketh ſtill as it were in the ſhell, another rolleth and tumbleth, and a fourth cannot ſtir one whit. All theſe haue their beginning and increaſe for the moſt part in Autumne, not in the Spring, and ſpecially in the full of the Moone. This one thing here is to be noted, that waſpes doe not ſwarme, and that in Sommer-time they are ſubiect to Kings, and in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> Winter, <hi>Guuaicocrateia,</hi> the females regiment, or <hi>Muliebre imperium</hi> preuaileth. And when they haue renued and repayred their iſſue with a great ſupply, &amp; that they be freſh and luſtie, the Empire againe returneth to the Maſculine kinde, and yet it is but a ſhort, brittle, and ruinous Empire not able to beare vp it ſelfe, although by Natures immutable decree, orderly ruled, and rightfully gouerned.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith that it is not likely that the young waſpes are brought forth as a broode, becauſe they be ſo great in bulke, as that in reaſon it ſhould not ſeeme probable, that ſo ſmall a flye as a waſpe, ſhould haue ſuch great young ones. But this is a bare &amp; weake rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, not beſeeming the dignitie of ſo great a Philoſopher. For what can any man alleadge to the contrary, why Nature in a lawfull birth and breeding, ſhould not as ſoone, and as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> ſpeedily finiſh, and make to grow and increaſe, as ſhee doth in generation that proceedes of rottennes or corruption, which I hold to be but illegitimate. Let vs but call to minde young birds, in how ſhort a time after they be out of the ſhell, they be feathered, they be able to goe, to eate, yea quickly increaſed in ſtrength, and growne to theyr full greatnes, ſo that they are in their full flowre ere one be aware. All which when one hath through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidered, he will eaſily iudge, that famous Phyloſopher <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> to haue relyed but vpon a weake proppe, hauing ſcarſe probability to ſtand on his ſide for the maintenance of his opinion.

When they haue disbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened themſelues of their breed, they cloſe vp their cells with a certaine thin ſmall skinne, which againe beeing broken when they come to any perfection or growth, they get the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues our of dores into the cleere light, &amp; at two daies end wil be able to flie round about. The Philoſopher maketh two kinds of waſpes, the one wild &amp; fell, the other more meeke <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> and quiet. The wilder ſort is ſildom ſeene, for they liue &amp; breed in mountaines &amp; woods, in Oke trees, &amp; not in the earth, and this kind is greater, blacker, more diuerſly coloured, &amp; ſtingeth more cruelly then the other. After they haue liued one whole yeere, they are ſeene to flie away, if in the winter the tree be cut downe. Theſe kinde of waſpes I did once ſee in a wood in Eſſex, where going vnwarily to gather ſimples with another Phiſitian, &amp; offending one of this fumiſh generation, the whole ſwarme of them preſently ruſhed forth about mine eares, &amp; ſurely had I not had in my hand ſome ſprigs or branches of broome for my defence, I had vndoubtedly payde deerely for this my vnaduiſednes, if it had not coſt me my life, for they purſued me in euery place of the wood, with a vehement rage for a long ſeaſon, inſomuch that I was faine to take me to my heeles, &amp; ſo to ſeeke to ſaue my <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> ſelfe from further danger. And if our owne countriman Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> himſelfe had beene there, although hee was (as <hi>Meteranus</hi> a ſtranger, (and ſo vnpartiall) in his <hi>Belgick</hi> Hiſtorie right truly obſerued,) <hi>Omnium ducum nostri ſeculi fortiſsimus ac famoſiſsimus,</hi> yet I make no doubt, but he would haue taken my part, and beene a companion with me in this my fearefull flight.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:22894:50"/>
Some of theſe vvaſpes, as well thoſe of the crueller kinde as thoſe of the gentler, doe lacke a ſting, (or rather I thinke they vſe it not.) Otherſome againe of both ſorts, are fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with ſtinges, and thoſe that want them, are euer the leſſer and weaker, neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenging themſelues any way, nor offering to make reſiſtance. Contrariwiſe, thoſe who haue ſtings are greater, ſtronger, more quarrellous, concentious, ſtubburne and eager. Some account theſe the males, and thoſe other ſtingleſſe to be the females. Many of thoſe which haue ſtinges, doe for-goe and quite looſe them when Winter draweth on, as ſome make reckoning, but it was neuer my hap to ſee this, ſaith the Philoſopher, in his 9 booke <hi>De hiſt: Animal: capit.</hi> 41.</p>
            <p>If you catch a Waſpe, holding her faſt by the feete, ſuffering her to make her vſuall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> humming ſound, you ſhall haue all thoſe that lacke ſtinges preſently come flying about you, which the ſtinged waſpes neuer are ſeene to doe. Therfore ſome hold this as a good reaſon to prooue, that the one ſhould be the male, the other the female. Both theſe ſorts, both wilde and vnwilde, haue beene ſeene to couple together after the manner of Flyes. Beſides, (in reſpect of ſexe) both kindes of waſpes are deuided into Captaines or Ringlea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and into labourers, thoſe former are euer greater in quantitie, and of more calme diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; theſe other, both leſſer, more froward, teſtie, peeuiſh, and diuers. The males or labourers, neuer liue one whole yeere full out, but all of them die in the winter time, which is euident by this, becauſe in the very beginning of cold weather, they are as it were frozen or benummed, and in the depth or midſt of hard winter, a man ſhall hardly or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> ſee any of them.</p>
            <p>But yet for all that, their Dukes or principall Chiefetaines, are ſeene all the winter long to lye hidde in their lurking holes vnder the earth: and indeed many men whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or broke vppe the ground, and digged in winter, haue found of this ſort. But as for the labouring waſpe, I neuer as yet heard of any that could finde them. Theyr Principall or Captaine, is broader, thicker, more ponderous and greater then the male waſpe, and ſo not very ſwift in flight, for the weightines of their bodies is ſuch an hinderance to them, that they cannot flie very farre: whereby it commeth to paſſe, that they euer remaine at home in their hiues, there making and deuiſing their combes, of a certaine glutinous mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or ſubſtance, brought vnto them by the worke-waſpes: thus ſpending their time in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuting <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> and dooing all thoſe duties that are meet, in their Cells.</p>
            <p>Waſpes are not long liued, for theyr Dukes (who liue longeſt,) doe not exceede tvvo yeeres. And the labouring, that is the male waſpes, together with Autumne, make an end of their dayes. Yea which is more ſtrange, whether their Dukes or Captaines of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer yeere, after they haue ingendered and brought forth new ſprong vp Dukes, doe dye, together with the newe waſpes, and whether this doe come to paſſe after one &amp; the ſelfe-ſame order, or whether yet they doe and may liue any longer time, diuers men do diuerſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doubt. All men hold the wilder kind to be more ſtrong of nature, and to continue and hold out the longer. For why, theſe other making their neſts neere vnto common high-wayes and beaten paths, doe liue in more hazard, lye open to diuers iniuries, and ſo more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> ſubiect to ſhortnes of life.</p>
            <p>The brouity of their life, is after a ſort recompenced, and ſome part of amends made by the rare clammy glewiſhnes of the ſame: for if you ſeperate their bulkes from the head, &amp; the head from the breaſt, they will liue a long while after, and thruſt out their ſting almoſt as ſtrongly as if they were vndeuidable, and free from hurt and deathes harme.</p>

               <hi>Apollonius</hi> calleth waſpes <hi>Omoboroi,</hi> and <hi>Aristotle, Meloboroi,</hi> although they doe not onely feede on rawe fleſh, but alſo on peares, plummes, grapes, reyſins, and on diuers and ſundry ſorts of flowers and fruites; of the iuyce of Elmes, Suger, Hony, and in a manner of all things that are ſeaſoned, tempered, made pleaſant, or prepared with eyther of theſe two laſt rehearſed. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/>

               <hi>Pliny</hi> in his 11. booke <hi>capit.</hi> 53. is of opinion that ſome waſpes, eſpecially thoſe of the wilder &amp; feller kind, do eate the fleſh of Serpents, which is the cauſe that death hath ſome-times enſued of their poyſonous ſtinging. They alſo hunt after great flyes, not one vvhit ſparing the harmeleſſe Bees, who by their good deedes haue ſo well deſerued. According to the nature of the ſoyle &amp; place, they do much differ in their outward forme &amp; faſhion
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:22894:50"/>
of their body, and in the manner of their qualities and diſpoſitions of their mind: for the common waſpes beeing acquainted, &amp; familiarly vſed to the company of men &amp; beaſts, are the gentler, but the Hermites and ſolitary waſpes, are more rude, churliſh, and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtuous: yea <hi>Nicander</hi> termeth them <hi>Olaus,</hi> that is, pernicious. They are alſo more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy, dangerous, and deadly in very hote countries, as <hi>Ouidius</hi> reporteth, and namelie in the Weſt-Indies: where both in their magnitude and figure, there is great difference betwixt theirs and ours, ſo that they are accounted farre more poyſonous &amp; deadly, then either the Engliſh, French, Spaniſh, or Barbarian waſpes. Some of theſe dangerous ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration doe alſo abound in exceeding cold Countries, as <hi>Olaus Magnus</hi> in his 22. booke telleth vs. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/>
            </p>
            <p>Their vſe is great and ſinguler: for beſides that they ſerue for foode to thoſe kinde of Hawkes which are called Kaiſtrells or Fleingalls, Martinets, Swallowes, Owles, to Brocks or Badgers, and to the Cameleon: they alſo doe great pleaſure and ſeruice to men ſundry wayes, for they kill the <hi>Phalangium,</hi> which is a kind of venomous Spyder, that hath in all his legges three knots or ioynts, whoſe poyſon is perilous and deadly, and yet waſpes do cure their wounds.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Raynard</hi> the Foxe likewiſe, who is ſo full of his wiles and craftie ſhifting, is reported to lye in waite to betray waſpes after this ſort. The wilie thiefe thruſteth his buſhie tayle into the waſpes neſt, there holding it ſo long, vntill hee perceiue it be full of them, then draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſlylie forth, he beateth and ſmyteth his tayle-full of waſpes againſt the next ſtone or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> tree, neuer reſting ſo long as hee ſeeth any of them aliue; and thus playing his Foxe-like parts many times together, at laſt hee ſetteth vppon their combes, deuouring all that he can find.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pliny</hi> greatly commendeth the ſolitary waſp to be very effectuall againſt a Quartaine-A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, if you catch her with your left hand, &amp; tyeor faſten her to any part of your body, (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes prouided, that it muſt be the firſt waſpe that you lay hold on that yeere. <hi>Mizaldus memor.

Wherevpon we may very confidently conclude, that their poyſon is very hote, flatuous or windie. Some do prole after waſpes, and kill them by other ſleights &amp; deuiſes. For when the Labourers do much vſe and frequent elmes, which they doe very often about the Summer ſolftice, to gather from them ſome gummy and clammy matter, their Dukes and Princes beeing at home, not ſtanding ſtill, but ſetling themſelues to their buſines or trade, and helping to hatch vp their young, they are ſuddenly choked with the fume of Brimſtone, Garlicke, the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Coleworts, or other pot-herbes, or els by breaking downe &amp; onerthrowing their combes, they die through famine. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/>
            </p>
            <p>VVhen you are minded to defend the Bees from the inuaſion and ſpoyle of waſpes, you muſt ſette a potte with ſome peeces of fleſh in it neere the Hiue, and when the waſpes (in hope of ſome prey) are entered, ſuddenly clappe ouer the couer, and ſo deſtroy them, or elſe by pouring in ſome hot water at the toppe, you may ſcald them all to death in the pot. In like ſort, ſome doe gently breath vppon Raiſins, fruites, Suger, Hony, Oyle, by which, eyther the waſpes are chaſed away, or by taſting the oyle doe die. And againe, ſome doe mixe corroſiues with Honie, (as for example, <hi>Sublimate, Vitrioll, Auripigmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> &amp;c.) that they by taking this venomous or poyſon-infected drinke, may ſuffer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digne puniſhment for their intemperate and inſatiable gluttony.</p>
            <p>Of the ſtinging of vvaſpes, there doe proceede diuers and ſundry accidents, paſsions <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> and effects, as payne, diſquieting, vexation, ſwelling, redneſſe, heate, ſweatings, diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or will to vomit, loathing and abhorring of all thinges, exceeding thirſtineſſe, &amp; now and then fainting or ſwounding; eſpecially when after the maner of venomous creatures, they haue infected their ſtings eyther by taſting the fleſh of ſome Serpents, or by gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their foode from venomous plants.</p>

I will nowe ſette before your eyes and eares one late and memorable example of the danger that is in VVaſpes, of one <hi>Allens</hi> vvife, dwelling not manie yeeres ſince at <hi>Lowick</hi> in <hi>Northamptonſhire,</hi> vvhich poore woman reſorting after her vſuall manner in the heate <note place="margin">Allens wife</note> of the Sommer to <hi>Drayton,</hi> the Lord <hi>Mordants</hi> houſe, beeing extreamely thirſtie, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient of delay, finding by chaunce a blacke Iacke or Tankerd on the table in the Hall, ſhe very inconſiderately and raſhly ſette it to her mouth, neuer ſuſpecting or looking what might be in it, and ſuddainly a Waſpe in her greedineſſe paſſed downe with the drinke, and ſtinging her, there immediatly came a grea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tumour in her throate with a rednes, puf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing and ſwelling of all the parts adiacent; ſo that her breath beeing intercepted, the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable vvretch whirling herſelfe twiſe or thriſe round, as though ſhee had had ſome verti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> in her braine, preſently fell downe and dyed. And this is knowne for a truth, not onely to me, but to moſt of the inhabitants there abouts, being as yet freſh in their memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and therefore their authorities as I take it, is vnreproueable.</p>
            <p>Now, for feare leaſt I ſhould looſe my ſelfe in this troubleſome and vaſt Ocean of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures admirable fabricature, I wil now diſcourſe of ſuch medicinall meanes, as will defend from their furious malice. The vertue of Mallowes, and of <hi>Althea,</hi> (called Marſh-mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe) is notable againſt the prickings of Waſpes. For the ſofteſt and moſt emollient herbe, is applyed as a contrary to a watlike and hurtfull creature, whoſe iuyce beeing an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted with oyle, eyther abateth the rage of vvaſpes, or ſo blunteth and dulleth theyr ſting, that the paine is not very ſharpe or byting. <hi>Pliny lib: 21. capit:</hi> 171. And of the ſame <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> mind is <hi>Auicen:</hi> Waſpes (ſaith he) will not come neere any man if he be annoynted with oyle and the iuyce of Mallowes. For as a ſoft aunſwere doth <hi>frangere iram,</hi> and as the Graecians haue a ſaying; <hi>Edus Megiston estin orges, pharmakon logos:</hi> So alſo in naturall <note place="margin">Salomon.</note> Philoſophy we ſee, that hard thinges are quailed, and their edge euen taken off with ſoft and ſuppling: as yron with a fine, ſmall, and ſoft feather, the Adamant ſtone with blood, and the ſtinge of vvaſpes, Hornets and Bees, with oyle and Mallowes.</p>
            <p>What is ſofter then a Caterpiller? and yet if <hi>Aetius</hi> credite be of ſufficience, the ſame beeing beaten with oyle, and annoynted vppon any part preſerueth the ſame from the woundes and ſtinges of vvaſpes. And of the ſame vertue is the herbe called Balme, being ſtamped and mixed with oyle. The ſame ſymptomes or accidents doe follow the ſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> of Waſpes, as of Bees, but farre more painefull, and of longer continuance, to vvit, redneſſe, intollerable paine, &amp; Apoſtumes. And if any be ſtrooken of the Orenge or yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low coloured vvaſpes, eſpecially in a ſinowie or ſome ſenſible part, there will followe a convulſion, weakenes of the kees, ſwounding, yea, &amp; ſometimes death, as before I haue touched.</p>
            <p>Againſt the ſtingings of vvaſpes diuers medicines are preſcribed by Phiſitions, but I will ſpeake of ſuch onely as I haue made proofe of, and ſuch as are confirmed by long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience. <note place="margin">The curation of their ſtings.</note> 
               <hi>Gilbert</hi> the Engliſhman, ſaith, that vvaſpes beeing bruiſed and applyed to the place affected, doe cure their owne wounds very ſtrangely. The ſame vertue peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, not onely the Scorpion, but the greater part of Inſects haue, if any one would make <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> 
               <note place="margin">Gilbertus Anglus.</note> any dilligent tryall thereof. If a man be ſtinged of any venomous vvaſpes (which is eaſily knowne by the blewnes of the place, madnes, rauing and fainting of the partie, and cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the hands and feete) after you haue giuen him inwardly ſome Alexipharmacall medicine, the place agrieued muſt be launched, or rather opened with a Cauterie, ſo bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus enlarged and opened, the venome muſt be well ſucked out, and the paring or ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of that earth wherein the waſpes build their neſts, muſt be wrought &amp; kneaded with Vineger, and ſo applyed like a Cataplaſme.</p>
            <p>A plaiſter alſo made of VVillow-leaues, Mallowes, and the combe of waſpes, is verie medicinable for the ſame, as by the counſell of <hi>Haly Abbas</hi> I haue experimented. The Engliſh-Northerne-men, doe prepare moſt excellent emplaiſter woorth gold, againſt all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> 
               <note place="margin">Haly Abbas</note> ſtinges of waſpes, onely of that earth whereof their Ouens are made, hauing vineger and the heads of Flyes commixed therewith. Let the place be very well rubbed with the iuyce of Citrulls, &amp; withall, let the partie that is pained drinke of the ſeed of Margerom beaten to powder the quantity of two drammes: or thus. Take of the iuyce of Margerom two ounces, of Bole Armony two drammes, with the iuyce of vnripe Grapes ſo much as is
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:22894:51"/>
ſufficient, make an emplaiſter. Another. Annoynt the place with the iuyce of Purcelane, Beetes, or ſweet Wine, and Oyle of Roſes, or with Cowes bloud, or with the ſeedes of the Spirting or wilde Cucumber (called <hi>Nolime tangere)</hi> beaten with ſome VVine. Thus farre <hi>Galen.</hi> Barly Meale wrought vp with Vineger and the Milke or iuyce of a Fig-tree, brine, or Sea water, are excellent for theſe griefes, (as <hi>Dioſcorides lib. 8. Cap.</hi> 20. writeth) if the wound be often fomented, bathed, or ſoked with any of them. To drinke, giue two drammes of the young and tender leaues of Bayes with harſh wine, and if the part affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted bee onely annointed with any of theſe, they are much auaileable. In like ſort the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of Marſh-mallowes drunke with Vineger and water, are much commended, and outwardly ſalt with Calues fat: Oyle of Bayes draweth out the poyſon of VVaſpes. The <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> leaues of Marſh-mallow (as <hi>Aetius</hi> ſaith) beeing bruiſed and applyed, doe performe the ſame.</p>
            <p>The iuyce of Rue or Balme, about the quantity of two or three ounces drunke with wine, and the leaues being chewed and laid on with Hony and Salt, or with Vineger and Pitch, do help much. VVater-creſſes, Roſemarie, with Barly meale, and water with vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neger ſod together, the iuyce of Iuy leaues, Marigolds, the bloud of an Owle, all theſe are very affectuall againſt the ſtinging of waſpes: as <hi>Pliny lib. 31. Cap.</hi> 9. telleth vs. The buds of the wilde Palme-tree, Endiue with the root, and wilde Timbe being applyed playſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, doe helpe the ſtinging of VVaſpes. After the vemine is drawne out by ſucking, the place effected muſt bee put into hot water the ſpace of an houre, and then ſuddenly they muſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> be thruſt into Vineger and brine, and forthwith the paine will bee aſſwaged, the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour ceaſe, and the malice of the venemous humor cleane extinguiſhed. <hi>Rhazes</hi> ſaith, <note place="margin">Rhazes.</note> that the leaues of Night-ſhade, or of Sengreene, do very much good in this caſe. And in like ſort Bole Armony with vineger and <hi>Champhire,</hi> and nuts beaten with a little vineger and <hi>Castoreum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Alſo take the Combe with Honny applying to the place, and hold the grieued place neere the fire immediatly, and laying vnder them a few aſhes, binde them hard, &amp; forth-with the paine will bee ſwaged. <hi>Serapio</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Sauorie,</hi> or Creſſes applyed, and the <note place="margin">Serapio.</note> ſeed thereof taken in drinke, and the iuyce of the leſſer Centory mixt with wine, are very meete to bee vſed in theſe griefes, he alſo commendeth for the ſame purpoſe the leaues of Baſill, the Herb called Mercury, and Mandrakes, with Vineger. <hi>Ardoynus</hi> is of opinion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> that if you take a little round ball of Snow, and put it into the fundament, the paine will <note place="margin">Ardoynus.</note> ceaſe, eſpecially that which proceedeth by waſpes. Let the place be annoynted with Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neger and <hi>Champhire,</hi> or often fomented and bathed with Snow-water. Take of <hi>Opium,</hi> of the ſeed of Henbane and <hi>Champhire,</hi> of each alike much, and incorporate them with Roſe water, or the iuyce of VVillowes, and laie it vppon the wounded place, applying on the top of it a linne<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cloth, firſt throughly wetted in wine. <hi>Iohannes Meſue</hi> (who of ſome <note place="margin">Meſue.</note> is called <hi>Euangelist a medicoram)</hi> preſcribeth this receipt of the iuyce of <hi>Siſimbrium</hi> two drammes and a halfe, and with the iuyce of <hi>Tartcitrons</hi> make a potion. The iuyce alſo of <hi>Spina Arabica,</hi> and of Margerom are nothing inferiour to theſe forementioned. <hi>Aaron,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Aaron.</note> would in this griefe haue water Lintells (called by ſome Duckes meat) to be ſtamped with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> vineger, and after to be applyed.</p>

               <hi>Constantine</hi> aſſureth vs, that <hi>Alcama</hi> tempered with Barley meale and vineger, and ſo <note place="margin">Constanti.</note> bound to the place, as alſo Nuts, leaues of vvall-nuts, and Bleetes, are very profitable in this paſſion.

In the hundreth and nintith yeare <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> before the byrth of our bleſſed Sauiour, an infinite multitude of Waſpes came flying into the Market place at <hi>Capua,</hi> (as <hi>Iulius</hi> witneſſeth) and lighted on the temple of <hi>Mars,</hi> all which when with great regard &amp; diligence they were gathered together and ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly burnt, yet for all that they preſignified the comming of an enemy, and did as it were foretell the burning of the Citty, which ſhortly after came to paſſe.

Their belly is as though it were tied to their ſhoulders with a very fine thred, the forward and middle part whereof is ouercaſt with a browne colour, &amp; begirt as it were with a girdle of Saffron. The hinder part is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together yellow, eaſily diſcerned and remarkable for thoſe eight browne pricks or ſpecks,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:22894:52"/>
euery one of them being much like vnto a ſmall triangle, beſides they haue certain clefts or ſlits on both ſides, both before and behind, by which they can at their pleaſure when they liſt, either ſhrinke vp themſelues, or draw and gather themſelues together, and with the ſame againe lengthen and ſtretch out their bodies. They haue alſo neere to their belly on both ſides foure blacke ſpots, and in their taile they are armed with a ſtrong piercing ſting, and the ſame very venomous. They make a ſound or a buzzing ſtrange noyſe, more hydeous and dreadfull then waſpes doe. They are ſhrewd, fierce, and cruell, quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly angry and wrathfull, and although they liue in companies together, yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they are euer known to be but of an homely, rude, curft, and vntractable diſpoſition and nature, and will neuer be brought by any Art or faſhioning to lay aſide their vplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh wildeneſſe, (as ſome Herbes will doe that are tranſplanted into Gardens.) <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/>
            </p>
            <p>They are beſides this of ſuch a miſcheeuous malignity and venemous quality, that as ſome affirme, nine of their ſtings will kill a man, and three time nine will be able to kill a ſtrong Horſe; eſpecially at the riſing of the Dog-ſtar and after, at which time they haue a more fiery, haſty, and inflaming nature, and men at that ſeaſon, by reaſon of their large exaltation and ſending forth of ſpirits, grow more weake and faint.</p>

            <p>It is good therefore if you haue a Wife, that is, <hi>Calcata immitior hydra,</hi> vnquiet and contentious, to let her alone, not to wake an angry Dogge: and when a miſchiefe is well <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> quieted and brought aſleepe, to go your waies and ſay neuer a word. Whereas among Bees, their Drones and Kinges do want ſtinges; yea, and ſome Waſpes too, as before I haue writ: yet notwithſtanding all Hornets in generall, as well the greater ſort of them that builde their houſes in trees, as the leſſer ſort that dwell in the earth, are prouided of ſtinges, neither doth their Ring-leader ſeeme to bee vnarmed. For Waſpes haue theyr preſidents of their owne ſociety, and their Captaines generall as well as Bees &amp; waſpes, whatſoeuer <hi>Pliny lib. 11. cap.</hi> 21. dreame to the contrary: which in proportion and quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity are farre greater (if you reſpect the bodies of other Hornets) then either the captaines of the Bees or Waſpes, are in compariſon of their ſubiects.

            <p>For neither do they chide, braule, or contend, nor yet make any ſtir or ruſtling when any is promoted to any office or place of preferment in their corporation; neither are they diſtracted into diuers mindes with their buſineſſes, neither yet doe they raiſe any tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> make any vprore, or keepe a coyle or ruffling at the election of their Prince or cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine generall, but with common conſent they vſe but one Table, taking their commons together like good friends and fellowes, and whatſoeuer they kill, they carry ſome part of it home, frankly imparting it to their neighbors, children, and companions.</p>

But as for their King and captaine (whom they exceedingly honor and highly eſteeme) they make choyce of ſuch a one, as neyther ſeemeth to be a King without a kingdome, nor a Prince without people and poſſeſſions, and yet he ſo behaueth himſelfe, and carryeth himſelfe ſo euenly, as though hee had but little to do in this his Empire. And yet in largeneſſe of body and greatnes of his hart, in ſtoutneſſe and ſtatelineſſe of ſtomacke and perſon, he ſtaineth all the reſt, carrying away <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> the prize from them all, and when there is proclamation of warre to be made againſt any forraine foes, and that their flags and ancients bee diſplayed by ſounding his deadly blaſt, he giueth the defiance to his enemies, moſt couragiouſly beſtirring himſelfe more then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his followers, ſhewing himſelfe both moſt vehement, warlike, and skilfull in fight, and yet againe at home towardes his ſubiects, (like a true noble ſpirit) he is very gratious, gentle, and temperate, tractable, eaſie to bee intreated and moſt ready to forgiue. They make for themſelues certaine holes or dwelling places vnder the ground, caſting forth the earth much after the faſhion Piſmires: for you muſt vnderſtand that neither Waſpes nor Hornets do ſend forth any Swarmes as Bees doe, but thoſe young Hornets which ſpring from them now and then, do there remaine among their breeders, making their beds or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> hiues much greater, by meanes of the earth formerly caſt out.</p>
            <p>They enlarge their Combes exceedingly, by adding more and more vnto them, ſo that of a ſtrong and healthy ſtocke of Hornets, it hath beene knowne they haue gathered three or foure Treyes or baskets full of Combes. If any Hornets ſtray from their owne home, they repayre to ſome tree, l &amp; there in the top of it makes their Combs, ſo that one many times may very eaſily and painely perceiue them, &amp; in theſe they breede one cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine generall, or great commaunder, who when he is growne to be great, he carryeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the whole company, placing them with him in ſome conuenient lodging. Wilde Hornets (as <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith) do liue in the hollow trunkes and cauities of trees, there keeping themſelues cloſe all the winter long, as other Cut-waſts do. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/>
            </p>
            <p>Their life is but ſhort, for they neuer exceede the age of two yeares. Their combs are wrought with greater cunning, more exquiſite Art, and curious conceit, then thoſe ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Waſpes or Bees, and theſe excellent deuiſers doe make them one while in the trunkes of trees, and ſometimes againe in the earth, encreaſing them at their pleaſure with more floores and buildings, according to the encreaſe of their iſſue, making them ſmooth and bright, decking and trimming them with a certaine tough or binding ſlime or Gelly gathered from the gummy leaues of plantes. Neither do any of the little mouths or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of their Cells looke vpwardes, but euery one bendeth downewardes: and the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome is placed vpwards, leaſt either the raine might ſoke thorough them in long ſhewers, or the head of them being built vpwardes, they might lye open and be the more ſubiect, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> and expoſed to the vnruly rage and furious blaſts of winds and ſtormes.</p>
            <p>If you eye well their neſtes, you ſhall finde them all for the moſt part exactly ſex angu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar or ſixe cornered, the outward forme and faſhion whereof is diuided with a murry co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured pertitions: and their membranous ſubſtance is much like vnto the rinde or bark of Byrch, which in the patching heat of Sommer cleaueth and openeth it ſelfe into chaps. The ſtinging of Waſpes is for the moſt part accompanied with a Feuer, cauſing withall a carbuncle, ſwelling, and intollerable paine.</p>
            <p>I my ſelfe beeing at <hi>Duckworth</hi> in <hi>Huntingtonſhire,</hi> my natiue ſoyle, I ſaw on a time a great Waſpe or Hornet making after and fiercely purſuing a Sparrow in the open ſtreet of the Towne, who at length beeing wounded with her ſting, was preſently caſt to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> ground, the Hornet ſatisfieng her ſelfe with the ſucked bloud of her quelled prey, to the exceeding admiration of al the beholders and conſiderers of this ſeldome ſeene combate. <hi>Aristotle,</hi> whom I ſo greatly reuerence, and at whoſe name I doe euen riſe and make curteſie, knowes not of a ſurety how Hornets do engender, nor after what manner they bring forth their young breede. But ſince we are aſſured of this that they bring forth their
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:22894:53"/>
young by the ſides of their Cells, as Waſpes and Bees, we need not doubt, but that they doe all other matter after their manner, and if they couple together, they doe it by night, as Cats do, or elſe in ſome ſecret corner, that <hi>Argus</hi> with his hundreth eyes can neuer eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pye it.</p>
            <p>Hornets gather meate not from floures, but for the moſt part they liue vppon fleſh, whereby it commeth to paſſe, that you ſhall often finde them euen in the very dunghills, or other ordure. They alſo proule after great Flyes, and hunt after ſmall Byrdes, which when they haue caught into their clutches, after the manner of hungry Hawkes, they firſt wound them in the head, then cutting it aſunder, or parting it from the ſhoulders, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reſt of the body with them, they betake themſelues to their accuſtomed flyght. The greater ſort of them dye in the hard winter, becauſe they ſtore not themſelues ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> aforehand with any ſuſtenaunce as Bees doe, but make their prouiſion but from hand to mouth, as hunger enforceth them, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> enformeth vs. In like ſort <hi>Landius</hi> hath well obſerued, that Hornets both day and night keepe watch and Ward beſides the Hiues of Bees, and ſo getting vpon the poore Bees backs, they vſe them in ſtead of a wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon or carry age: for when the ſilly Bee laboureth to be diſcharged of his cruell Sytter: the Hornet when he hath ſucked out all his iuyce, and cleane bereft him of all his moyſture, vigour, and ſtrength, like an vnthankefull Gueſt, and the moſt ingratefull of all winged creatures, he ſpareth not to kill, and to eate vp his foſterate and chiefe maintainer.</p>
            <p>They feede alſo vppon all ſweete, delicious, and pleaſant thinges, and ſuch as are not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> vntoothſome and bitter, and the <hi>Indian</hi> Hornets are ſo rauenous, and of ſuch an inſaſiate gluttony (as <hi>Ouidius</hi> reporteth) that they fly vpon Oyle, Butter, greaſie Cookes, all ſorts of ſharpe ſawce vſed with meates, and all moyſt and liquid thinges, not ſparing the very Napkins and Table clothes, and other linnen that is any way ſoyled, which they do fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily contaminate with the excrements of their belly, &amp; with their Viſcous laying of their egges.</p>
            <p>But as they get their liuing by robbery, and purloining of that which others by the ſweat of their browes, by their owne proper wits and inuention, and without the ayde &amp; helpe of any do take great paines for: ſo againe they want not a reuenge to puniſh, &amp; a prouoſt Marſhall to execute them for their wrongfull dealings: tearmed of ſome a Gray, Broch, <note place="margin">Their vſes,</note>

            <p>Neither do they onely miniſter foode to this paſſing, profitable, and fat beaſt, but they ſerue in ſtead of good Almanackes to country people, to foretell tempeſts and change of weather, as Hayle, Raine, and Snow: for if they flye about in greater numbers, and bee oftner ſeene about any place, then vſually they are wont, it is a ſigne of heate and fayre weather the next day. But if about twilight they are obſerued to enter often their neſtes, as though they would hide themſelues, you muſt the next day expect raine, wind, or ſome ſtormy, troubleſome or boyſterous ſeaſon: whereupon <hi>Auienus</hi> hath theſe verſes, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/>

The Graecians call a Catterpiller <hi>Kámpe,</hi> by reaſon of his crooked, winding or ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding pace in wauing ſort, whereby in creeping they bow, wry, and lift vp themſelues. Of the Hebrewes it is termed <hi>Ghazain,</hi> becauſe it ſheareth, pilleth, &amp; deuoureth the fruites of the earth, as <hi>Kimhi</hi> vpon the firſt of <hi>Ioell</hi> writeth.

            <p>If I ſhould goe about to deſcribe and ſet downe all the differences and varieties of Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpillers, <note place="margin">Their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences.</note> I might perhaps vndertake an endleſſe and tedious labour. I thinke it therefore fitteſt to bend my ſlender skill, and to imploy my beſt forces, in ſpeaking of ſuch as are more notable and common with vs in this Country: For ſome of them in touching are rough, hard, and ſtiffe; and other-ſome againe, are ſoft, ſmooth, and very tender. Some are horned, either in the head or in the tayle, and againe, others haue no hornes at all. Some haue many feete, and ſome fewer, and none at all haue aboue ſixteene feete. Moſt of them haue a bending ſwift pace, and like vnto waues, and others againe keepe on their way very plainely, ſoftly, by little and little, &amp; without any great haſt. Some change their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> skinnes yeerely, others againe there be that neither change nor caſt their old dry skinnes, but keepe them ſtill. Some of them ceaſing altogether from any motion, and giuing ouer to eate any thing at all, are transformed very ſtrangely into a kind of vermin or wormes, who beeing couered with a hard cruſt or ſhell, lye as it were dead all the winter; &amp; from theſe come in the beginning of hot weather, our vſuall Butter-flyes.</p>
            <p>Many of theſe Catterpillers are bred of the egges of Butter-flyes: and ſome againe do breede in the leaues of trees, of their owne proper ſeede, beeing left there in the time of Autumne, included in a certaine webbe, or els by meanes of the dew or ayre, therein ſhut and putrified, as commonly the little hairie Cankers or Caterpillers which are ſo full of feete, doe breede. Beſides, ſome of them doe feede on leaues, ſome on flowers, &amp; there <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> are ſome which deuoure fruites.</p>
            <p>All ſmooth Catterpillers which are not hairie, are of a yellow or greene colour: ſome againe are found of a reddiſh colour, or browniſh, or elſe they be of ſundry hewes. But of all others, the moſt excellent is the greene coloured Catterpiller, which is found vppon that great buſhy plant, vſually termed Priuet, or Primprint, which hath a circle encloſing round both his eyes and all his feete, hauing alſo a crooked horne in his tayle: theſe Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpillers are blackiſh-redde, with ſpots or ſtreakes going ouerthwart theyr ſides, beeing halfe white and halfe purpeliſh, the little pricks in theſe ſpots are inclining to redde: The reſt of theyr body is altogether greene.</p>
            <p>There is another Catterpiller feeding altogether vpon Elder-trees, not much differing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> from the former, ſauing that this is altogether of a greene colour, &amp; wanting thoſe ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwarting croſſe white markes or ſpots, and the other ſmall white pricks which we deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in the former.</p>
            <p>There is alſo a third ſort of greene Catterpillers, which when Autumne or the fall of leafe draweth on, are turned into a certaine ſheath or caſe, beeing of a very hard and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie ſubſtance, of colour very browne, and this feedeth altogether vpon pot-herbes, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thoſe that be ſoft, as Lettuce: wherevpon it may not vnfitly be termed, <hi>Eruca Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tucaria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, there is to be ſeene another ſort, of a greene colour, which is the leaſt of them all, and this kind liueth and feedeth vpon trees, (eſpeciall in the Oke) there drawing out <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> theyr webbe, by meanes of which beeing ſtyrred and ſhaken, they eaſily fall downe vpon the heads of trauaylers and paſſengers by the way ſide, cleauing to their hats &amp; garments. And this kind of Catterpiller is too well knowne and found in the Sommer-time, and when cold weather approacheth, they fold themſelues into a rude, plaine, &amp; nothing cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious web. And thus beeing included in a greeniſh ſcabbard or caſe tending to redde, they
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:22894:58"/>
all die in Winter, and all theſe haue tenne feete, as all they haue that goe bending them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vpwards. But to leaue the greene, and come to them that are yellow, there is to be found a certaine Catterpiller called <hi>Vinula,</hi> being as the word ſoundeth, a very elegant &amp; fine inſect to looke vpon, and paſſing beautifull: &amp; this kind haue I often found amongſt Willowes, full ſauourly feeding vpon theyr leaues. His lyps and mouth are ſome-what yellow, his eyes blacke as a cole, his fore-head purple coloured, the feete and hinder part of the body, of a greene graſſie hue, his tayle two-forked, and ſome-what blacke. The whole body is as it were ſtained and dyed with thicke Red-wine, which runneth alongſt the necke and ſhoulders blades, as it were in forme of a Burgonian croſſe, or of the Letter X made croſſe-wiſe downe vnto the tayle with a white line, addeth no ſmall grace to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> other parts.</p>
            <p>There is yet another Catter-piller of yellow-blackiſh colour, called <hi>Porcellus,</hi> we may in Engliſh call it Pigges-ſnoute, in reſpect of the faſhion of the head, eſpecially the greater ſort of theſe, for the leſſer haue round white ſpecks vpon their ſides, and theſe liue and are altogether to be found amongſt the leaues of the Marſh Trifolie, which they conſume &amp; deuoure with an incredible celeritie. In the wilde Night-ſhade, (which the Italians call <hi>Belladona)</hi> there is found a ſmooth Catterpiller, of a yellow-greeniſh colour, hauing a horne in his fore-head the length of a finger, which <hi>Hierom Cardan</hi> the learned Phiſitian, reporteth that he had often ſeene.</p>
            <p>The hayrie Catterpillers are moſt miſchieuous and dangerous amongſt them all, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> theſe are eyther thicke or thinne hayred, and the moſt venomous is that which is called <hi>Pityocampe,</hi> whoſe byting is poyſon: and this is euer found in the Pine-apple-tree, beeing <note place="margin">The deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Piryo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

They conſiſt of eleuen ſlyts or cuts betwixt the head and the tayle, and they haue ſixteene feete, according as all other hayrie Palmer-wormes haue. That is to ſay, neere the head on both ſides, three, in the middeſt of their body on both ſides, foure, and at the end of the tayle on both ſides, one. Their former feete are crooked and ſmall, with which they feele, try and aſſay the way whether it be paſſable or no, theyr other feete are broader, with many iagges and notches like a ſavve, to take the faſter hold, and ſtay with ſurer footing vppon ſmooth and ſlippery leaues. Their head is much like a Piſmires, and the reſt of their bodies like other <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> common Catter-pillers. They are rough, &amp; full of briſtly ſtanding vp hayres on all ſides, and thoſe in theyr ſides are white, but thoſe on their backes doe ſhine, beeing very bright and gliſtering, the midſt whereof is garniſhed with many ſpots, as though it were full of eyes.</p>
            <p>Their skinne is blacke, which is ſoone ſeene, their hayres beeing cut or taken cleane a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. All their hayres are but ſmall, and yet they ſting more vehemently then any nettle, whereby is cauſed intollerable paine, burning, itching, a feauer, and much diſquietneſſe: when as their poyſon is ſuddenly in a moment, ſent and conueighed without any mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt apparance, or ſence of any wound to be iudged by the eye, vnto thoſe parts that are next to the entralls, as the harr, liuer, and the reſt. They weaue their webs after a fine and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> exquiſite manner, as Spyders do, drawing out in length, framing and trimming in good order, their hayrie ſmall threads. And vnder theſe when night draweth on, they lye, as in their own proper tent and pauillion, aſwell to auoyde cold, as the diſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities of futious blaſts &amp; ſtormes: for the matter &amp; ſubſtance of this their tent is ſo handſomely wrought, ſo firme, ſtiffe, clammy &amp; ſure, that they neither care for furious winds, nor yet any raine or ſtorme will euer ſoke thorow. Beſides, the largenes of this houſe is ſuch, and of ſo great receit, as it will eaſily receiue and lodge many thouſands of Caterpillers. They make their neſts or buildings in the higheſt branches of the Pitch and Pine-trees, where they liue not ſolitarily (as other Palmer-wormes do) but in flocks or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panies together. Which way ſoeuer they take their iourny, they are ſtill ſpinning &amp; drawing out their threds for theyr <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> web, and early in the morning (if it be likely to proue faire) the younger ſort by heapes at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the elder, &amp; hauing firſt bared &amp; robbed the trees of all their boughes &amp; leaues, (for they make cleane riddance of all where-ſoeuer they come) they afterwardes dexterouſlie bend the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to their weauing craft. They are the only plague &amp; deſtruction of pitch &amp; Pine-trees, for vnto any other roziny or gummy trees they neuer doe harme.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:22894:58"/>
There is great plentie of them to be found in the Mountaine of <hi>Athos,</hi> ſcituate betwixt <hi>Macedonia</hi> and <hi>Thrace,</hi> in the woods of <hi>Trident,</hi> and in diuers valleyes beyond the Alpes, in which places there is ſtore of theſe fore-named Trees, (as <hi>Matthiolus</hi> ſaith.) They are doubtleſſe moſt poyſonous and venomous vermine, whether they be cruſhed outwardlie with the hands, or taken inwardly into the body: yea they are ſo knowne, manifeſt, and ſo neuer fayling a poyſon, &amp; ſo eſteemed of in times paſt, as that <hi>Vlpian</hi> the famous Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer, interpreting the Law <hi>Cornelia De Sicarijs,</hi> or priuie murtherers, that he in that place, calleth and eſteemeth the giuer of any Pityocampie in drinke or otherwiſe to any one, to be doomed a murtherer, and their puniſhment to be equalized.

But yet I will adde a word or two of a ſtrange and ſtinking Catter-piller, which it was neuer my hap as yet to ſee, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by <hi>Corradus Geſner,</hi> in theſe wordes following. This ſtinking Catterpiller (ſaith he) is very like to thoſe that are horned, but yet it wanteth hornes, differing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them all in
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:22894:59"/>
colour. I firſt eſpyed it creeping vpon a wall toward the end of Auguſt. <hi>Anno.</hi> 1550. there commeth from it a lothſome and an abhominable ſauour &amp; ſmell, ſo that you would ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily beleeue it to be very venomous. It went forwards very frowningly, &amp; with a quick, angry, and deſpightfull countenaunce, as it were in bending wiſe, the head alwaies ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched vp aloft with the former two feete: I iudge her to be blind. She was the length and breadth of a mans finger, with a fewe ſcattering and rugged hayres, ſomewhat briſtly &amp; hard both on her backe and ſides, the backe was very blacke. The colour of her belly and ſides was ſome-what redde, enclining to yellow, and the whole body was diſtinguiſhed, deuided, and eaſily diſcerned with foureteene ioynts or knots, and euery ioynt had a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine furrow like a kind of wrinckle running all along the back. Her head was blacke and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> ſome-what hard: her mouth crookedly bending like hookes, hauing teeth notched like a ſaw, and with theſe teeth as with pincers or nyppers, whatſoeuer ſhe layd hold on, ſhe (as famiſhed) did bite. She went on ſixteene feete, as for the moſt part all the ſorts of Palmer-wormes doe. Without doubt, ſhe muſt be concluded to be exceeding venomous.</p>
            <p>The learned man <hi>Vergerus,</hi> tooke it to be a Pityocampe, and others thought it a Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopendra: but that could not be, by reaſon of the number of her feete. I could hardly with much adoe endure her vyle ſmell, till I had drawne out her deſcription. Shee ſo infected two hot-houſes with her abhominable ſauour and ſtinke, that my ſelfe and they that were with me, could not endure in the place.

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:22894:59"/>
as themſelues, and to be blinded with the maſcarados of abſurdities. And firſt, if we will beginne to rifle in the monument of former times, I will heere produce <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in his fifth booke, <hi>Hiſtor. cap.</hi> 19. who there expreſly ſaith, that they take their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from the greene leaues of herbes, &amp; namely of Radiſh and Coleworts, by meanes of their ſmall ſeede of generation, beeing like vnto Millit-ſeede, which is there left about the end of Autumne, from which, femall wormes proceede: and of theſe little wormes in the ſpace of three dayes a Catterpiller is formed, about the Spring time, or toward the latter end thereof, which growing to their due quantitie, and well fedde withall, they ceaſe at length from any further motion, &amp; when Autumne beginneth, they change both forme and life. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pliny</hi> is of this mind, that Catterpillers fetch all their pedegree, raſe, parentage &amp; birth, from a dew thickned and incraſſated by the heate of the Sunne, and ſo ſtill left behind in leaues: and <hi>Arnoldus de Villa noua</hi> is of the ſame iudgement. Otherſome deriue them wholy from Butter-flyes, and will haue them to proceede of no other beginning, which as ſoone as they are crept out of their hard ſhells or ſcabbards, wherein they had lien as it were dead all the Winter, as ſoone as Summer &amp; warme weather draweth on, they caſt certaine egges eyther vnder or aboue the leaues of certaine herbes, which egges accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the quantitie of their bodies, are either greater or leſſer, and ſome of theſe ſhelles wherein they are included, are of a skye colour; others yellow, white, blacke, greene, or redde: and ſo beeing at length about foureteene dayes quickned and nouriſhed with the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> liuely and kindly heate of the Sunne, their ſhell-houſe beeing broken, firſt commeth forth ſmall Catterpillers, like vnto little wormes, ſauing that they are diuerſly coloured, who at their firſt appearance, beeing as it ſhould ſeeme very hungry, doe altogether bend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to deuoure and eate vp both leaues and flowers, eſpecially of thoſe trees and plants, whereon they were whilſt they were in egges.</p>
            <p>But I am of opinion; that not onely this, but by diuers other wayes and meanes they may proceede and increaſe, for although the doctrine of <hi>Aristotle</hi> in this poynt ſeemeth to be vnſauoury, and nothing reliſhing diuers taſtes, becauſe hee affirmeth that that little worme which is found vpon Coleworts, doth turne into a Catterpiller: yet for all that, it is not ſo much without ſmack of ſalt, or ſo abhorrent to reaſon as they would make ſome <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> beleeue. For Nature, as ſhee is able, and doth produce and bring foorth a liuing creature from an egge, ſo likewiſe from a worme ſhee breedeth a more perfect liuing creature, by many degrees; and that not by way of corruption, but by way and meanes of her excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent perfection. For although a worme afterwards be not that thing which before it was, (ſo farre as is apparant to outward ſence) yet for any thing we can gather or perceiue, it is that which it was, and this <hi>That,</hi> is more by a great deale now, then before it was. For a worme dyeth not, that a Catterpiller may therby ſpring, but to the old body, Nature ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth a greater magnitude: as for example, feete, colours, winges: ſo that whilſt life re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth, it acquireth other parts, and other offices.</p>
            <p>There be ſome alſo that deride the opinion of <hi>Pliny,</hi> becauſe hee contendeth that Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpillers <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> haue their beginning and production from dew. But it may not be denyed in my conceit, that ſome imperfect ſmall creatures, are bred and take life from dew, and not without great reaſon. For the Sunne by his kindly heate and warming qualitie, work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and acteth, beeing as it were the forme, and the moiſture or humour is <hi>Paſsiue,</hi> as the matter or ſubiect for the heate of the ſunne is different from that of the fire: for it eyther quickneth and inſpireth with life, or at leaſt-wiſe conſerueth and maintaineth our life, by meanes of likenes, proportion, or ſymmetry, wherein our liues and ſpirits reſpect each other. Beſides, there is nothing more nouriſhing then <hi>Dew,</hi> for with it onely ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſmall creatures are fedde, and doe thereby liue: which thing the diuine Poet verie well obſerued, when he vttered theſe words; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/>
               <q>
                  <l>Quantum nos nocte reponit.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>So that in reſpect that it is humour, it is matter, in reſpect it is thin, it pierceth and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily entereth in, and in reſpect it is attracted and throughly concocted by the Sunne, it is the apter made to generation. For the preparation of the forme, carrieth with it the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or ſtuffe, as his mate &amp; companion: So theſe two meeting together, there co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequently

followeth the quickning or taking life of ſome one creature. And not onely are ſome Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpillers the of-ſpring and breed of dew, as common experience can witneſſe, but euen the greateſt part of Catterpillers do fetch their ſtocke and pedegree from Butter-flyes, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it be thoſe that liue vpon Colewarts and Cabbages, and thoſe that are called Vine-fretters, with ſome few other. For thoſe that liue and breede in Vines, (called of the Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians <hi>Ipes,)</hi> doe proceede from dew, or ſome dewie and moyſt humour, which is inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in their webbes, and there growne to putrefaction. For then doe they ſwarme ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly in ſome countryes, as I dare neither affirme, nor otherwiſe imagine, but that they muſt needes haue ſuch a mighty encreaſe from putrefaction. And this for the moſt part happeneth when the Eaſterne wind bloweth, and that the warmth of the ayre furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> and haſteneth forwards any corruption.</p>

When the Butterflyes doe ioyne together very late, or after the time it ought to be, they doe lay or caſt theyr egges which will continue vitall, and that may liue till the next Spring, (if a diligent care be had of them) as well as is often ſeene in Silke-wormes, whoſe egges the Spanyards ſell, and that very vſually by vvhole ounces and pounds.

               <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> ſaith, that Catterpillers will touch no plants which are moiſtened or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſprinckled with Wine.

Some very aduiſedly take dry leaues &amp; ſtalks of Garlicke, &amp; with the ſame doe ſmoke and perfume their whole Garden, ſo that by this way the ſmoke being conuayed into all places thereof, the Catterpillers will fall downe dead, as <hi>Palladius</hi> hath written, in whoſe writings, any man may read of plenty of ſuch antydots and alexipharmicall medicines, as may ſerue to deſtroy Catterpillers.</p>

Some haue framed an Hebrew word <hi>Gamalion,</hi> which is abſurd, for <hi>Gameleon.

            <p>Chamaeleon is a Greeke word, from whence the Latines, and almoſt all Nations haue borrowed the name of this ſerpentine or creeping beaſt, except the Germaines, and they onely haue fained names, as <hi>Lindtwarm</hi> in <hi>Albertus,</hi> that is, a Worme of the wood, and <hi>Rattader</hi> by <hi>Geſner,</hi> that is a Ratmouſe, becauſe in quantitie &amp; compoſition, it reſembleth both thoſe creatures. Some Latines, by reaſon of the ſimilitude it holdeth with a Lizard, call it <hi>Muri Laccritus,</hi> a Mouſe-Lyzard. The Greeke word <hi>Chamaeleon,</hi> ſignifieth a low &amp; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> humble Lyon, becauſe in ſome parts and members, he reſembleth that lofty &amp; couragious beaſt.

The countries breeding Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maeleons, are Affrica, Aſia, and India, &amp; for the quantity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I do find diuers deſcriptions, ſome particuler, as in <hi>Bellonius</hi> and <hi>Scaliger,</hi> and ſome generall in other Writers, all which I purpoſe briefely &amp; ſucceſsiuely to expreſſe in this place.

But both theſe kindes of Chamaeleons, haue a copped head, like to a Camell, and two bones at the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> toppe of theyr browes ſtanding vp on either ſide, and hanging out: their eyes are moſt cleere and bright, about the bignes of a peaſe, onely couered vvith a skinne, ſo that their appearance outwarde, exceedeth not the quantity of a Millet-ſeede.

            <p>Some haue thought that it neuer eateth meat, but is nouriſhed with the wind, becauſe it draweth in very eagerly many times the wind into the belly, whereby it ſwelleth: for it hath great lights ſtretched all along the ſides of the belly: but this opinion is falſe, as ſhall be ſhewed hereafter, although it cannot be denyed that it is <hi>Ouiparum patrentiſsimum fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis:</hi> that is, The moſt induring famine among all other Egge-breeding-beaſtes, for it fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth many times eyght monthes: yea, a whole yeare together.

            <p>The opening of the mouth is very large, and it hath teeth on the neather and vpper <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> chap like Sawes, ſuch as are in a Slo-worme, the toong very ſmooth, halfe a hand breadth long, where withall it licketh in thoſe inſectes Flyes, Horſe-flyes, Locuſtes, and Emittes, whereupon it feedeth: For it keepeth at the mouth a certaine fome or moyſture, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo vpon the tayle and backer partes, wherewithall thoſe Flyes and other Creatures are ſo much delighted, that they follow the Chamaelion, and as it were bewitched with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire thereof, they fall vppon the moyſture to their owne perdition; and this is to bee noted, that this moyſture or fome in the backer partes of the body is like a Spunge. It hath a line or ſtrake vnder the belly, indented as it were with ſcales, white in colour, and ſtretched out to the tayle, but the feete ſeeme to bee of an artificiall worke of Nature, wherein is a curious difference betwixt the former and the hinder: for the forefeete haue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> three fingers or clawes within, and two without: the hinder feete on the contrary, haue two without and three within: It layeth twelue long Egges, ſuch as Lyzards do, the hart is not much greater then the heart of a Domeſticall Mouſe or Rat: it hath two lappes of a Liuer, whereof the left is the greater, vnto which cleaueth the skinne of the Gall, the which skin exceedeth not in quantity a Barly-corne. And thus farre the deſcription by <hi>Bellonius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the next place for the better manifeſtation of the nature of this beaſt, I will alſo adde the deſcription that <hi>Scaliger</hi> maketh thereof. For he ſaith, when <hi>Iohannes Landius</hi> was in the fartheſt parts of <hi>Syria,</hi> he ſaw fiue Chamaelions, whereof he bought one, which with his tongue did very ſoddenly take off a Fly from his breaſt: Wherefore in the diſſection <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> of the ſaid Chamaelion, he found that the tongue thereof was as long as a hand breadth, hollow and empty, in the toppe whereof there was a little hole with filthy matter there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, wherewithall he tooke his prey: which thing ſeemed new and ſtrange vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which heretofore thought that a Chamaelion liued onely by the ayre. His backe was ſomewhat crooked, riſing with ſpotted bunches like a Sawe, like the Turbut-fiſh, his belly cloſed with ſhort ribbes, his eyes moſt beautifull, which he turneth euery way without bending his necke: his colour white, greene, and dusky: naturally greene, ſomewhat pale on the backe, but paler and nearer to white on the belly, yet was it beſet all ouer with red, blew, and white ſpots.</p>
            <p>It is not true that the Chamaelion chaungeth her ſelfe into all colours, vppon greene <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> groweth greenneſſe, vpon the dusky is tempered a dusky colour; but vppon blew, red, or white the natiue greennes is not blemiſhed or obſcured, but the blew, white, and red ſpots yeald a more liuely and pleaſant aſpect; vpon black, ſtandeth browne, yet ſo, as the green hew ſeemeth to be confounded with blacke, and it doth not change his owne colour into a ſuppoſed colour, but when it is oppreſſed with feare or griefe. That it liueth ſometime of the Ayre, a whole yeare or more, doeth appeare, becauſe it eateth no meate during that time, but gaping with a wide mouth draweth in the ayre, &amp; then ſhutting his chaps againe his belly ſwelleth. Yea, I found one that conſtantly affirmed, that they turne themſelues to the beames of the Sunne, and gaping wide after them, follow them hard as it were to draw them in. They haue fiue diſtinct clawes vpon euery foote, with two <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> of which they claſpe the round boughes or twigges of trees, as Parrats doe when they ſit vppon their pearches, and theſe clawes ſtand not as other Birdes doe, three together and one by it ſelfe, but in imparity or diſſimilitude, three on the one ſide, and two on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſo are parted with an inuerſe order, for the hinder and former are contrary one to the other, ſo as if there bee three clawes on the inſide, and two on the outſide of the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:22894:63"/>
Leg before, then are there three on the outſide behind, and two on the inſide: And thus much I receiued from <hi>Langius.</hi> So farre <hi>Scaliger.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now we will proceede to the perticular deſcription of their parts, as we find them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in other Writers, leauing thoſe breefe and pregnable Narrations of <hi>Bellonius</hi> &amp; <hi>Scaliger.</hi> And firſt of all for the figure and outward ſhape of their bodies, then for theyr colour, and the reaſons of their mutability and variation of colour. For the figure and ſhape of their bodies, <hi>Pliny</hi> is of opinion, that a Chamaelion is like to a Crocodile of the Earth, except in the ſharpe bending of the backe-bone, or the length or greatneſſe of the tayle. Some ſay that the whole parts of the body doth repreſent a <hi>Lizard,</hi> excepting that the ſides are ioyned to the belly, and the baeke-bone ſtandeth vp as in Fiſhes. <hi>Arnol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> 
               <note place="margin">Ariſtotle</note> ſaith it reſembleth a <hi>Stellion</hi> if the Legs were not ſtraighter and higher: but the truth is, it is a Foure-footed-beaſt, much like to a <hi>Lizard,</hi> yet it goeth higher from the Earth, <note place="margin">Solmus.</note> and alwayes gapeth, hauing a rough skinne all ouer the body like a Crocodile, and is alſo full of ſcabs.</p>
            <p>The length of it from the tip of the Noſe to the rumpe of the taile, is 7. or 8. fingers, the height of them fiue fingers, and the Legs lone, three fingers and a halfe. The length of the tayle eyght or nine fingers, the backe-bone eminent &amp; ſtanding vp, cerſted or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dented all throughout to the tip of the taile, but neare the rump, the creſtes are more low and leſſe viſible. On eyther ſide at the roote of the ribbes ſtand bony eminent bunches, from which diſcendeth a line, and is extended throughout the length of the tailo on both <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> ſides; and if it were not for theſe bunches the turnings about, and the other three in the lower part, it would be ſo exaſperated or extenuated toward the end like to the tayle of a Rat or great Mouſe. The middle place betwixt the bottome of the belly and the top of the backe, contayneth an Angle or flexure of ſixteene ribbes, after the faſhion or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of a Greeke <hi>Lambda,</hi> except that the angle thereof be more wide &amp; potent, which looketh backeward toward the taile, and within theſe ribbes is the whole haunch of the body and belly, contained in a round compaſſe on either ſide. Beeing blacke, it is not vnlike the Crocodile, and being pale, it is like to the <hi>Lizard,</hi> ſet ouer with blacke ſpottes like a Leopard. It changeth colour both in the eyes, tayle, and whole body, alwayes into the colour of that which is next it, except red and white, which colours it cannot eaſily <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> vndertake, ſo that it deceiueth the eyes of the beholders, turning blacke into greene, and greene into blew, like a Player, which putteth of one perſon, to put on another: accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to theſe verſes of <hi>Ouid;</hi>

            <p>A Chamaelion of all Egge-breeding-beaſtes is the thinneſt, becauſe it lacketh bloud, and the reaſon hereof is by <hi>Aristotle</hi> referred to the diſpoſition of the ſoule: For he ſaith, through ouer much feare, it taketh vpon it many colours, and feare through the want of bloud and heate, is a refrigeration of this beaſt. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Plutarke</hi> alſo calleth this beaſt a meticulous and fearefull beaſt, and in this cauſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth the change of his colour, not as ſome ſay, to auoyde and deceiue the beholders and to worke out his owne happineſſe, but for meere dread and terrour. <hi>Iohannes Vrſinus</hi> aſſigneth the cauſe of the change of Chamaelions colour, not to feare, but to the meate &amp; to the ayre, as appeareth by theſe verſes;</p>

            </lg>
            <p>But I for my part doe aſſigne the true cauſe to bee in the thinneſſe of their skinne, and therefore may eaſily take impreſſion of any colour, like to a thin fleake of a horne, which beeing layde ouer blacke, ſeemeth blacke, and ſo ouer other colours: and beſides, there being no hinderaunce of bloud in this beaſt, nor Intrals, except the Lights, the other hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours may haue the more predominant mutation; and ſo I will conclude the diſcourſe of the partes and colour of a Chamaelion, with the opinion of <hi>Kiranides,</hi> not that I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue it, but to let the Reader know all that is written of this Subiect, his wordes are theſe: <hi>Chamaelem ſingulis horis diei mutat colorem:</hi> A <hi>Chamaelion</hi> changeth his colour eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> houre of a day.</p>
            <p>This beaſt hath the face like a Lyon, the feet and tayle of a Crocodile, hauing a variable colour, as you haue heard, and one ſtrange continued Nerue from the head to the tayle, beeing altogether without fleſh, except in the head, cheekes, and vppermoſt part of the tayle, which is ioyned to the body; neither hath it any bloud but in the hart, eyes, and in a place aboue the hart, and in certaine vaynes deriued from that place, and in them alſo but a very little bloud.</p>
            <p>There be many membranes all ouer theyr bodies, and thoſe ſtronger then in any other Beaſtes. From the middle of the head backward, there ariſeth a three ſquare bone, and <note place="margin">Ariſtotle. Pliny.</note> the fore part is hollow and round like a Pipe, certaine bony brimmes, ſharpe and inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> ſtanding vpon either ſide. Theyr braine is ſo little aboue their eyes, that it almoſt toucheth them, and the vpper skinne beeing pulled off from their eyes, there appeareth a certaine round thing like a bright ring of Braſſe, which <hi>Niphus</hi> calleth <hi>Palla,</hi> which ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth that part of a Ring, wherein is ſet a pretious ſtone.</p>
            <p>The eyes in the hollow within, are very great, and much greater then the proportion
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:22894:64"/>
of the body, round, and couered ouer with ſuch a skinne as the whole body is, except the apple, which is bare, and that part is neuer couered. This apple ſtands immoueable, not turned, but when the whole eye is turned at the pleaſure of the beaſt. The ſnoute is like to the ſnoute of a Hog-ape, alwayes gaping, and neuer ſhutting his mouth, and ſeruing him <note place="margin">Solinus.</note> for no other vſe but to beare his tongue and his teeth: his gumbes are adorned with teeth as we haue ſaid before, the vpper lippe beeing ſhorter and more turned in then the other. Their throate and arterie are placed as in a Lizard: their Lights are exceeding great, and they haue nothing els within their body. Whervpon <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> as <hi>Plutarch</hi> witneſſeth, conceiueth, that they fill the whole body within, &amp; for this cauſe it is more apt to liue on the ayre, and alſo to change the colour. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/>
            </p>
            <p>It hath no Spleene or Melt, the tayle is very long, at the end and turning vp like a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers tayle, winded together in many circles. The feete are double clouen, &amp; for propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">Ariſtotle</note> reſemble the thumbe and hand of a man, yet ſo, as if one of the fingers were ſet neere the ſide of the thumbe, hauing three without and two within behind, and three vvithin, and two without before; the palme betwixt the fingers is ſomewhat great: from within the hinder legges, there ſeeme to growe certaine ſpurres. Their legges are ſtraight, and longer then a Lizards, yet is theyr bending alike, and theyr nayles are crooked and very ſharpe. One of theſe beeing diſſected and cut aſunder, yet breatheth a long time after, they goe into the caues and holes of the earth like Lizards, wherein they lie all the winter time, and come forth againe in the Spring, theyr pace is very ſlow, and themſelues very <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> gentle, neuer exaſperated but when they are about wild-figge-trees.</p>
            <p>They haue for theyr enemies the Serpent, the Crow and the Hawke. When the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>erpent doth aſſault them, they defend themſelues in this manner, as <hi>Alexander Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi> writeth: they take in their mouthes a broad &amp; ſtrong ſtalk, vnder protection where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of as vnder a buckler, they defend themſelues againſt theyr enemy the Serpent, by reaſon that the ſtalke is broader then the Serpent can gripe in his mouth, and the other parts of the Chamaeleon ſo firme and hard, as the Serpent cannot hurt them: he laboureth but in vaine to get a prey, ſo long as the ſtalke is in the Chamaeleons mouth. But if the Chamae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leon at any time ſee a Serpent taking the ayre, and ſunning himſelfe vnder ſome greene tree, he climbeth vp into that tree, and ſetleth himſelfe directly ouer the Serpent, then out <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> of his mouth he caſteth a thred like a Spyder, at the end whereof hangeth a drop of poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as bright as any pearle, by this ſtring he letteth downe the poyſon vpon the Serpent, which lighting vppon it, killeth it immediatly. And <hi>Scaliger</hi> reporteth a greater vvonder then this in the deſcription of the Chamaeleon, for he ſayth, if the boughes of the Tree ſo grow as the perpendiculer line cannot fall directlie vpon the Serpent, then hee ſo correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and guideth it with his fore-feete, that it falleth vpon the Serpent within the mark of a hayres breadth.</p>
            <p>The Rauen and the Crow are alſo at variance with the Chamaeleon, &amp; ſo great is the aduerſe nature betwixt theſe twaine, that if the crow eate of the chamaeleon beeing ſlaine by him, he dyeth for it, except he recouer his life by a Bay-leafe, euen as the Elephant af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> he hath deuoured a chamaeleon, ſaueth his life by eating of the Wile-oliue-tree. But the greateſt wonder of all is, the hoſtility which <hi>Pliny</hi> reporteth to be betwixt the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maeleon and the Hawke. For he writeth, that when a Hawke flyeth ouer a Chamaeleon, ſhe hath no power to reſiſt the Chameleon, but falleth downe before it, yeelding both her life and limbes to be deuoured by it; and thus that deuourer that liueth vpon the prey &amp; blood of others, hath no power to ſaue her owne life from this little beaſt.</p>
            <p>A Chamaeleon is a fraudulent, rauening and gluttonous beaſt, impure, and vncleane by the law of GOD, and forbidden to be eaten: in his owne nature wilde, yet counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetting meekenes, when he is in the cuſtodie of man. And this ſhall ſuffiſe to haue ſpoken for the deſcription of this beaſt, a word or two of the Medicines ariſing out of it, and ſo a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> concluſion.</p>
            <p>I find that the Auncients haue obſerued two kindes of Medicines in this beaſt, one ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall, and the other naturall, and for my owne part, although not able to iudge of either, yet I haue thought good to anex a relation of both to this Hiſtory. And firſt of the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall medicines, <hi>Democritus</hi> is of opinion that they deſerue a peculier Volume, and yet he
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:22894:65"/>
himſelfe telleth nothing of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> worthy of one page, except the lying vanities of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, &amp; ſuperſtitions of the Graecians. With the gall, if the ſuffuſions and Leprous parts of the body be annointed three dayes together, and the whiteneſſe of the eyes, it is belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to giue a preſent remedy: and <hi>Archigenes</hi> preſcribeth the ſame for a medicine for the <note place="margin">Marcellus.</note> taking away of the vnprofitable and and pricking hayres of the eye-browes. It is thought if it be mixed with ſome ſweet compoſition, that it hath power to cure a quotidian Ague. If the toong of Chamaelion be hung ouer an obliuious and forgetfull perſon, it is thought to haue power to reſtore his memory.</p>
            <p>The Chamaelion from the head to the tayle, hath but one Nerue, which beeing taken <note place="margin">Rhazes.</note> out and hung about the necke of him that holdeth his head awry or backeward, it cureth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> him. The other parts haue the ſame operation as the parts of the Hyaena &amp; the Sea-calfe. If a Chamaelion be ſod in an earthen pot, and conſumed till the waterbe as thicke as oile, then after ſuch ſeething, take the bones out, and put them in a place where the Sunne ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <note place="margin">Kiranides.</note> commeth, then if you ſee a man in the fit of the falling ſickneſſe, turne him vppon his belly, and annoynt his backe from the <hi>Os ſacrum</hi> to the ridge bone, and it will preſently deliuer him from the fit: but after ſeuen times vſing, it will perfectly cure him. The Oyle thus made muſt be kept in a Boxe. This medicine following is a preſent remedy agaynſt <note place="margin">Trallianus.</note> the gowt. Take the head and feet of a Chamaeleon, cut offalſo the outward partes of the knees and feete, and then keepe by themſelues thoſe parts: that is to ſay, the partes of the right legge by themſelues, and the partes of the left Legge by themſelues, then touch the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> Nayle of the Chamaeleon with your Thumbe and right finger of your hand, dipping the tips of your fingers of the right hand in the bloud of the right foote of the beaſt: and ſo likewiſe the fingers of the left hand in the bloud of the left foote, then include thoſe parts in two little Pipes, and ſo let the ſicke perſon carry the right partes in the right hand, and the left parts in the left hand, vntill he be cured: and this muſt bee remembred, that hee muſt touch euery morning about the Sun riſing the ſaid Chamaeleon, yet liuing and lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in a Linnen cloth, with thoſe parts that are oppreſſed with the Gout.</p>
            <p>The like ſuperſtitious and magicall deuiſes are theſe that follow, as they are recorded by <hi>Pliny</hi> and <hi>Democritus.</hi> The head and thraot being ſet on fire with wood of Oake, they beleeue to be good againſt Thunder and raine, and ſo alſo the Liuer burned on a Tyle. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> If the right eye be taken out of it aliue, and applyed to the whitenes of the eyes in Goats Milke, it is thought to cure the ſame. The tongue bound to a woman with child, preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth her from danger in child-byrth, if the ſame tongue be taken from the beaſt aliue, it is thought it foreſheweth the euent of iudgement. The heart wrapped in blacke Wooll of the firſt ſhearing, by wearing it, cureth a quartane Ague, the right claw of the forefeet bound to the left arme with the skinne of his cheekes, is good againſt robberies and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of the night, and the right pap againſt all feares. If the left foote be ſcorched in a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace with the Herb Chamaeleon, and afterward putting a litle ointment to it, &amp; made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to little Paſties, ſo being carryed about in a wooden boxe, it maketh the party to go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible. The right ſhoulder maketh a man to preuaile againſt his aduerſaries, if they doe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> but tread vpon the Nerues caſt down vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the earth. But the left ſhoulder they conſecrate the ſame to monſterous dreames, as if that thereby a man might dreame what hee would in his owne perſon and effect, the like in others.</p>
            <p>With the right foote are all paulſies reſolued, and with the left foote all Lethargies: the Wine wherein one ſide of a Chamaeleon hath beene ſteeped, ſprinkled vppon the head, cureth the ach thereof. If Swines Greaſe be mingled with the powder of the left foote or Thigh, and a mans foote be annoynted therewith, it bringeth the gout, by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Gall into fire, they driue away Serpentes; and into Water, they draw together Weaſels, it pulleth off hayre from the body, ſo alſo doth the Liuer, with the Lightes of of a Toade; likewiſe the Liuer diſſolueth amorous inchantments. Melancholy men are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> cured by drinking the iuyce of a Chamaeleon out of a Chamaeleons skin. They alſo ſay, that the Intrals and dung of this beaſt waſhed in the vrine of an Ape, and hung vp at our enemies gates, cauſeth reconciliation.</p>
            <p>With the taile they bring Serpentes aſleepe, and ſtay the flowing of the flouds and Waters: the ſame mingled with Ceder and Myrrhe, bound to two rods of Palme, and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:22894:65"/>
ſtrucke vpon water, cauſeth all thinges that are contained in the ſame water to appeare; but I would to GOD that ſuch Magitians were well beaten with Róddes of ſtronger wood, vntill they forſooke theſe magicall fooleries: And thus much for the ſtory of the Chamaeleon.</p>

And it ſeemeth nature hath ordained him for that purpoſe: for beſide the ſtrength of his poyſon which is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> vncurable, he hath a certaine combe or Corronet vppon his head, as ſhall be ſhewed in due place: It is alſo cald <hi>Sibilus,</hi> as we read in <hi>Iſidorus, Sibilus enim occidit antequam mordeat vel exurat:</hi> The Cockatrice killeth before it burneth.

            </p>
            <p>There is ſome queſtion amongeſt Writers, about the generation of this Serpent: for ſome, (and thoſe very many and learned) affirme, him to be brought forth of a Cockes egge. For they ſay that when a Cock groweth old, he layeth a certaine egge without any ſhell, in ſtead whereof it is couered with a very thicke skinne, which is able to withſtand <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> the greateſt force of an eaſie blow or fall. They ſay moreouer, that this Egge is layd one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Summer-time, about the beginning of Dogge-dayes, being not long as a Hens Egge, but round and orbiculer: Sometimes of a duſty, ſometimes of a Boxie, ſometimes of a yellowiſh muddy colour, which Egge is generated of the putrified ſeed of the Cocke,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:22894:66"/>
and afterward ſet vpon by a Snake or a Toad, bringeth forth the Cockatrice, being halfe a foot in length, the hinder part like a Snake, the former partlike a Cooke, becauſe of a treble combe on his forehead.</p>
            <p>But the vulger opinion of Europe is, that the Egge is nouriſhed by a Toad, and not by a Snake; howbeit in better experience it is found that the Cocke doth ſit on that egge himſelfe: whereof <hi>Leuinus Lemnius</hi> in his twelth booke of the hidden miracles of nature hath this diſcourſe, in the fourth chapter thereof. There happened (ſaith he) within our memory in the Citty <hi>Pirizaea,</hi> that there were two old Cockes which had layd Egges, &amp; the common people (becauſe of opinion that thoſe Egges would engender Cockatrices) laboured by all meanes poſſible to keepe the ſaid cockes from ſitting on thoſe egges, but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> they could not with clubs and ſtaues driue them from the Egges, vntill they were forced to breake the egges in ſunder, and ſtrangle the cockes. But this point is worth inquiry, whether a cocke can conceiue an Egge, and after a certaine time lay the ſame' without a ſhell. I for my part am perſwaded, that when a cocke groweth old, and ceaſeth to tread his female in the ordinary courſe of nature, which is in the ſeuenth or ninth yeare of his age, or at the moſt in the foureteenth, there is a certaine concretion bred within him by the putrified heat of his body, through the ſtaying of his ſeede generatiue, which harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vnto an egge, &amp; is couered with ſuch a ſhell, as is ſaid already: the which egge being nouriſhed by the cocke or ſome other beaſt, bring eth forth a venomous worme, ſuch as are bred in the bodies of men, or as Waſpes, Horſe-flyes, and catterpillers engendered <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> of Horſe-dung, or other putryfied humours of the earth: and ſo out of this Egge may ſuch a venomous Worme proceede, as in proportion of body, and peſtiferous breath, may reſemble the <hi>Affrican</hi> cockatrice or Baſiliske, and yet it is not the ſame whereof wee purpoſe here to intreat, but will acknowledge that to be one kind of cockatrice, but this kind is generated like other Serpents of the earth, for as the auncient <hi>Hermes</hi> writeth, it is both falſe and impoſſible, that a cockatrice ſhould be hatched of a cockes Egge. The ſame writer maketh mention of a Bazeliske ingendered in dung, whereby hee meaneth the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixir</hi> of life, wherewithall the <hi>Alchimistes</hi> conuert mettals.</p>
            <p>The Aegyptians hold opinion, that theſe cockatrices are engendered of the Egges of the Bird called <hi>Ibis,</hi> and therefore they breake thoſe Egges whereſoeuer they finde them: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> and for this cauſe in theyr Hieroglyphicks, when they will ſignifie a lawfull execution af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an vpright iudgment, &amp; ſound inſtitution of their forefathers, they are wont to make an <hi>Ibis,</hi> and a cockatrice.</p>
            <p>The countries breeding or bringing forth theſe cockatrices, are ſayd to be theſe: Firſt <note place="margin">Pliny. Textor. Auicenna. Aelianus Solinus.</note> 
               <hi>Affricke,</hi> and therein the Ancient ſeat or land of the Turkes, <hi>Nubia,</hi> and all the wildernes of <hi>Affrica,</hi> &amp; the countries <hi>Cyrenes.

Wee doe read that in Rome, in the dayes of Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the fourth, there vvas a Cockatrice found in a Vault of Church or Chappell, dedicated to Saint <hi>Lucea,</hi> whoſe peſtiferous breath hadde infected the Ayre round about, whereby great mortality follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed in Rome: but how the ſaid Cockatrice came thither it was neuer knowne. It is moſt probable that it was created and ſent of GOD for the punniſhment of the Citty, which I do the more eaſily beleeue, becauſe <hi>Segonius</hi> &amp; <hi>Iulius Scaliger</hi> do affirme, that the ſayd peſtiferous beaſt was killed by the prayers of the ſaid <hi>Leo</hi> the fourth.</p>
            <p>I thinke they meane that by the authoritie of the ſayde Byſhop, all the people were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> mooued to generall faſting and prayer, and ſo Almighty GOD who was mooued for theyr ſinnes, to ſend ſuch a plague amongeſt them, was likewiſe intreated by their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and ſutes, not onely to reuerſe the plague, but with the ſame hand to kill the beaſt, wherewithall it was created: euen as once in Aegypt by the hand of <hi>Moſes,</hi> hee brought Graſſe-hoppers and Lice, ſo by the ſame hand he droue them away againe.</p>
            <p>There is ſome ſmall difference amongeſt the Writers, about the quantity and partes of this Serpent: which I will breefely reconcile. Firſt <hi>Aelianus</hi> ſaith, that a Cockatrice is not paſt a ſpanne in compaſſe, that is as much as a man can gripe in his hand. <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith, that it is as bigge as twelue fingers. <hi>Solinus</hi> and <hi>Iſidorus</hi> affirme, that it is but halfe a foot long. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Auicen</hi> ſaith, that the Arabian <hi>Harmena,</hi> that is, the Cockatrice, is two cubits and a halfe long. <hi>Nicander</hi> ſaith, <hi>Et tribus extenſo porrectus corpore palmis,</hi> that is, it is in length but three palmes. <hi>Aetius</hi> ſayth, that it is as bigge as three handfuls: Now for the recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation of all theſe. It is to bee vnderſtood, that <hi>Pliny</hi> and <hi>Aelianus</hi> ſpeaketh of the Worme that commeth out of the Cockes Egge, in regard of the length, but not of the quantity, and ſo confound together that Worme and the Cockatrice. For it is very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, that ſeeing the magnitude and greatneſſe of the Serpent is concluded to bee at the leaſt a ſpan in compaſſe, that therefore the length of it muſt needes bee three or foure foote at the ſhorteſt; elſe how could it bee ſuch a terrour to other Serpents, or how could the fore part of it ariſe ſo eminently aboue the earth, if the head were not lifted at the leaſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> a foote from the ground. So then we will take it for graunted, that this Serpent is as big as a mans wriſt, and the length of it aunſwerable to that proportion.</p>
            <p>It is likewiſe queſtionable whether the Cockatrice haue Winges or no: for by reaſon of his conceiued generation from a Cocke, many haue deſcribed him in the fore-part to haue Winges, and in the hinder part to haue a tayle like a Serpent: And the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of winges ſeemeth to bee deriued from Holy Scripture, becauſe it is written Eſay 14: verſe twenty nine, <hi>De radice cobibij egredietur regulus &amp; ſemen eius abſorbens volucrem:</hi> That is to ſay, Out of the Serpents rootes ſhall come a Cockatrice, and the fruite there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſhall bee a fiery flying Serpent, as wee tranſlate it in Engliſh: but <hi>Tremellius</hi> the beſt Interpreter, doth render the Hebrew in this maner: <hi>De radice Serpentis prodit haemorrhus</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> 
               <hi>&amp; fructus illius prester volans:</hi> That is to ſay; VVord for word, Out of the roote of the Serpent ſhall come the <hi>Haemorrhe,</hi> and the fruite thereof a flying <hi>Prester.</hi> Now we know, that the <hi>Haemorrhe</hi> and the <hi>Prester</hi> are two other different kindes of Serpentes from the Cockatrice, and therefore theſe Interpreters beeing the more faithfull and learned, wee will rather followe the Holy Scripture in theyr tranſlation, then the vulgar
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:22894:67"/>
Latine, which is corrupted in very many places, as it is alſo Eſay. the 30. verſe ſixe. For <hi>Praester,</hi> there is againe in the vulgar tranſlation the Cockatrice: and for this cauſe vvee haue not deſcribed the Cockatrice vvith winges, as not finding ſufficient authority to warrant the ſame.</p>
            <p>The eyes of the Cockatrice are redde, or ſomewhat inclyning to blackeneſſe, the skinne and carkaſe of this beaſt haue beene accounted precious, for wee doe read that the <hi>Pergameni</hi> did buy but certaine peeces of a Cockatrice, and gaue for it two pound and a halfe of Syluer: and becauſe there is an opinion that no Byrd, Spyder, or venomous Beaſt, will indure the ſight of this Serpent, they did hang vppe the skinne thereof ſtuffed, in the Temples of <hi>Apollo</hi> and <hi>Dinna,</hi> in a certaine thinne Net made of Gold: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> it is ſayde, that neuer any Swallow, Spider, or other Serpent durſt come within thoſe Temples: And not onely the skinne or the ſight of the Cockatrice worketh this effect, but alſo the fleſh thereof, being rubbed vppon the pauement poſtes or Walles of <note place="margin">Solinus.

And moreouer, if Siluer bee rubbed ouer with the powder of the Cocka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trices fleſh, it is likewiſe ſayde, that it giueth it a tincture like vnto Golde: and beſides theſe qualities, I remember not any other in the fleſh or skinne of this ſerpent.</p>
            <p>The hiſſing of the Cockatrice which is his naturall voyce, is terrible to other ſerpents, and therefore as ſoone as they heare the ſame, they prepare themſelues to fly away, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to theſe verſes of <hi>Nicander;</hi>

            <p>Againe, euen as a Lyon is afrayd of a cock, ſo is the Bazeliske, for he is not onely afrayd at his ſight, but almoſt dead when hee heareth him crow, which thing is notoriouſly knowne throughout all <hi>Affrica.</hi> And therefore all Trauellers which goe through the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> Deſertes, take with them a Cocke for theyr ſafe conduct againſt the poyſon of the Baze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liske: and thus the crowing of the Cocke is a terror to Lyons, &amp; a death to Cockatrices, yet he himſelfe is afraid of a Kite.</p>
            <p>There are certaine learned Writers in <hi>Saxonie,</hi> which affirme, that there are many kindes of Serpentes in theyr Woods; whereof one is not vnlike to a Cockatrice: for they ſay it hath a very ſharpe head, a yellow colour, in length not exceeding three Palmes, of a great thickeneſſe, his belly ſpotted and adorned with many white prickes: the backe blew, and the tayle crooked and turned vppe, but the opening of his mouth is farre wyder then the proportion of his body may ſeeme to beare. Theſe Serpentes may well bee referred to Cockatrices: for howſoeuer theyr poyſon is not ſo great as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> the Bazeliskes of <hi>Affrica,</hi> (euen as all other Serpentes of the hotte Countryes, are farre more peſtiferous then thoſe which are bred in the cold Countries:) the very ſame reaſon perſwadeth mee, that there is a difference among the Cockatrices, and that thoſe of <hi>Saxonia</hi> may differ in poyſon from thoſe in <hi>Affrica,</hi> and yet bee true Cockatrices: Beſides this, there is another reaſon in <hi>Lemnius,</hi> which perſwadeth the Reader they are no Cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atrices; becauſe when the Country-men ſet vppon them to kill them, with Clubs, Billes, or Forkes, they receiue no hurt at all by them, neither is there any apparant contagion of the Ayre: but this is aunſwered already, that the Poyſon in the colde Countrey is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to great as in the hot, and therefore in <hi>Saxony</hi> they neede feare the byting, and not the ayres infection. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/>

               <hi>Gardan</hi> relateth another ſtory of a certaine Serpent, which was found in the walles of an olde decayed Houſe in <hi>Millan,</hi> the head of it (ſayth he) was as bigge as an Egge, too bigge for the body, which in quantity and ſhape reſembled a Stellion. There vvere teeth on eyther chappe, ſuch as are in Vipers. It hadde two Legges, and thoſe very ſhort, but great, and their feete had clavves like a Cats: ſo that vvhen it ſtood, it vvas like a Cocke, for it hadde a bunch on the toppe of the head, and yet it vvanted both Fethers and Winges: The tayle was as long as the body, in the top whereof there was a round bunch as big as the head of an <hi>Italian</hi> Stellian. It is very likely that this beaſt is of the kind of Cockatrices.</p>
            <p>Now we are to intreate of the poyſon of this ſerpent, for it is a hot and venomous poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> infecting the Ayre round about, ſo as no other Creature can liue neare him, for it killeth, not onely by his hiſſing and by his ſight, (as is ſayd of the Gorgons,) but alſo by his touching, both immediately and mediately, that is to ſay; not onely vvhen

            </p>
            <p>But to omit inquiry in what part of his body the poyſon lyeth, ſeeing it is moſt mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that it is vniuerſall, we will leaue the ſeate thereof, and diſpute of the inſtruments and effectes.</p>
            <p>Firſt of all therefore it killeth his owne kinde, by ſight, hearing, and touching. By his owne kinde, I meane other Serpentes, and not other Cockatrices, for they can liue one beſide another, for if it were true (which I doe not beleeue) that the Arabian <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mene</hi> were any other Serpent then a Cockatrice, the very ſame reaſon that <hi>Ardoynus</hi> giueth of the fellowſhippe of theſe two Serpents together, (becauſe of the ſimilitudes of their natures) may very vvell prooue that no diuers kindes can liue ſo well together, in ſafety without harming one or other, as doe one and the ſame kind together. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> there is more agreement in nature betwixt a Cockatrice and a Cockatrice, then a Cockatrice and <hi>Harmene,</hi> and it is more likely that a Cockatrice dooth not kill a Cocka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trice, then that a Cockatrice doth not kill an <hi>Harmene:</hi> And againe, Cockatrices are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendered by Egges, according to the Holy Scripture; and therefore one of them killeth not another by touching, hiſſing, or ſeeing, becauſe one of them hatcheth another. But it is a queſtion whether the Cockatrice dye by the ſight of himſelfe: ſome haue affirmed ſo much, but I dare not ſubſcribe therevnto, becauſe in reaſon it is vnpoſſible, that any thing ſhould hurt it ſelfe, that hurteth not another of his owne kinde, yet if in the ſecret of nature GOD haue ordayned ſuch a thing, I will not ſtriue againſt them that can ſhew it. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore I cannot without laughing remember the olde Wiues tales of the Vulgar Cockatrices that haue bin in England; for I haue oftentimes heard it related confidently, that once our Nation was full of Cockatrices, and that a certaine man did deſtroy them by going vppe and downe in Glaſſe, whereby their owne ſhapes were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:22894:68"/>
vpon their owne faces, and ſo they dyed. But this fable is not worth refuting, for it is more likely that the man ſhould firſt haue dyed by the corruption of the ayre from the Cockatrice, then the Cockatrice to die by the reflection of his owne ſimilitude from the glaſſe, except it can be ſhewed that the poyſoned ayre could not enter into the glaſſe wherein the man did breathe.</p>
            <p>Among all liuing creatures, there is none that perriſheth ſooner then dooth a man by the poyſon of a Cockatrice, for with his ſight he killeth him, becauſe the beames of the Cockatrices eyes, doe corrupt the viſible ſpirit of a man, which viſible ſpirit corrupted, all the other ſpirits comming from the braine and life of the hart, are thereby corrupted, &amp; ſo the man dyeth: euen as women in their monthly courſes doe vitiat their looking-glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> or as a Wolfe ſuddainly meeting a man, taketh from him his voyce, or at the leaſt-wiſe maketh him hoarſe.</p>
            <p>To conclude, this poyſon infecteth the ayre, and the ayre ſo infected killeth all liuing things, and likewiſe all greene things, fruites, and plants of the earth: it burneth vp the graſſe where-vppon it goeth or creepeth, &amp; the fowles of the ayre fall downe dead when they come neere his denne or lodging. Some-times hee byteth a man or a beaſt, and by that wound the blood turneth into choller, and ſo the whole body becommeth yellow as gold, preſently killing all that touch it, or come neere it.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough I finde ſome difference about the nature of this ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing creature, and namely whether it bee a Serpent or a Fiſhe, yet becauſe the greater and better part make it a Serpent, I will alſo bring it in his due order in this place for a veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous beaſt. <hi>Geſner</hi> is of opinion, that it is no other but a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of the Water, but this cannont agree with the deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Aristotle</hi> &amp; <hi>Bellonius,</hi> who affirme the Cordill to haue Gilles like a Fiſh, and theſe are not found in any Lizard. The <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> Graecians call this Serpent <hi>Kordule,</hi> and <hi>Kordulos,</hi> whereof the Latines deriue or rather borrow their <hi>Cordulus,</hi> and <hi>Cordyla. Numenius</hi> maketh this a kind of Salamander which the Apothecaryes do in many Countryes falſely ſell for the <hi>Scincus</hi> or Corcodile of the Earth, and yet it exceedeth the quantity of a Salamander, being much leſſe then the cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codile of the earth, hauing gils, and wanting fins on the ſides, alſo a long taile, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the proportion of the body, like a Squirrels, although nothing ſo big, vvithout ſcabs: the back being bald and ſome what black, &amp; horrible rough, thorow ſome bunches growing therupon, which being preſſed do yeald a certain humor like milk, which being ſayd to the Noſthrils doth ſmell like poyſon, euen as it is in a Salamander. The beake or ſnout is very blunt or dull, yet armed with very ſharp teeth. The clawes of his forelegges <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> are diuided into foure, and on his hinderlegges into fiue: there is alſo a certaine fleſhy fin growing all along from the crowne of his head, vnto his tayle vppon the backe, which when he ſwimmeth hee erecteth, &amp; by it is his body ſuſtained in the water from ſinking, for his body is mooued with crooked winding, euen as an Eele or a <hi>Lamprey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The inward parts of this Serpent are alſo thus deſcribed. The tongue is ſoft and ſpun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, like as is the tongue of a Water-Frogge, wherewith as it were with Glew, he draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to his mouth, both Leches and Wormes of the earth, whereupon it feedeth. At the roote of his tongue there is a certaine bunch of fleſh, which as I thinke ſupplieth the place of the lightes, for when it breatheth, that part is eſpecially mooued, and it panteth too &amp; fro, ſo that thereby I gather, either it hath the Lights in that place, or elſe in ſome other <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> place neere the iawes. It wanteth ribs as doth the Salamander, and it hath certain bones in the backe, but not like the ordinary back-bone of other ſuch Serpents. The heart is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo all ſpungy, &amp; cleaueth to the right ſide, not to the left: the left care whereof ſupplyeth the place of the <hi>Pericadium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The liuer is very blacke, and ſomewhat clouen at the bending or ſloape ſide: the melt ſomewhat red, cleauing to the very bottome of the ventricle. The reynes are alſo very ſpungy, ioyned almoſt to the Legges, in which parts it is moſt fleſhy, but in other places eſpecially in the belly and breaſt, it is all skinne and bone. It alſo beareth Egges in her place of conception, which is forked or double, which are there diſpoſed in order, as in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther liuing griſtly creatures.

About the Etymologie of this word, I find two opinions not vnprofitable to be rehearſed: the firſt, that <hi>Crocodilus</hi> commeth of <hi>Crocus,</hi> Saffron, becauſe this beaſt, eſpecially the Crocodile of the earth, is afrayd of Saffron, and therefore the country people, to defend theyr Hiues of Bees and hony from them, ſtrow vpon the places Saffron. But this is too farre fetched, to name a beaſt from that which it feareth, and beeing a ſecrete in nature, it is not likelie that it was diſcouered at the firſt, and therefore the name muſt haue ſome other inueſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>

               </hi> and <hi>Croculae:</hi> and becauſe the Crocodiles haunt &amp; liue in thoſe ſhores, it might giue the name to the beaſts, becauſe the water Crocodiles liue and delight in thoſe ſandes, but the Land or earth Crocodiles ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre and feare them.</p>
            <p>It is reported that the famous Grammarian <hi>Artemidorus</hi> ſeeing a Crocodile lying vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the ſands, he was ſo much touched and moued there-with, that he fell into an opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">Aurelianus</note> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> that his left legge and hand were eaten off by that Serpent, and that thereby he loſt the remembrance of all his great learning and knowledge of Artes. And thus much for the name of this Serpent.</p>
            <p>In the next place we are to conſider the Countries wherein Crocodiles are bred, and keepe theyr habitation, and thoſe are eſpecially Egypt, for that onely hath Crocodiles of <note place="margin">Ariſtotle Mela. Diod. Sicul.</note> both kindes, that is, of the water and of the Land, for the Crocodiles of <hi>Nilus</hi> are <hi>Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bij,</hi> &amp; liue in both elements: they are not only in the riuer <hi>Nilus,</hi> but alſo in all the pooles neere adioyning. The Riuer <hi>Bambotus</hi> neere to <hi>Atlas</hi> in Affrica, doth alſo bring foorth Crocodiles: and <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith, that in <hi>Darat</hi> a Riuer of <hi>Mauritania,</hi> there are Crocodiles in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendered. Likewiſe <hi>Apollonius</hi> reporteth, that when he paſſed by the Riuer <hi>Indus,</hi> he met <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> with many Sea-horſes and Crocodiles, ſuch as are found in the Riuer <hi>Nilus,</hi> and beſides theſe countryes I doe not remember any other, wherein are ingendered crocodiles of the water, which are the greateſt and moſt famous Crocodiles of all other.</p>
            <p>The Crocodiles of the earth, which are of leſſer note and quantitie, are more plentiful, for they are found in <hi>Libia,</hi> &amp; in <hi>Bithinia,</hi> where they are called <hi>Azaritia,</hi> &amp; in the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Syagrus</hi> in Arabia, and in the vvoods of <hi>India,</hi> as is well obſerued by <hi>Arianus, Dioſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corides,</hi> and <hi>Hermolaus,</hi> and therefore I will not proſecute this matter any further.</p>
            <p>The kindes being already declared, it followeth that we ſhould proceed to their quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie and ſeuerall parts. And it appeareth that the water Crocodile is much greater, and <note place="margin">Marcellinus Herodotus. Iſidore.</note> more noble, then the Crocodiles of the earth; for they are not aboue two cubites long, or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> ſome-times eyght at the moſt, but the other are ſixteene, and ſometimes more.

            <p>Now a Crocodile is like a Lyzard in all poynts (excepting the tayle, and the quantity of a Lyzard,) yet it layeth an egge no greater then a Gooſes egge, and from ſo ſmall a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ariſeth this monſtrous Serpent, growing all his life long, vnto the length of fifteene or twenty cubits. And as <hi>Phalareus</hi> witneſſeth, in the dayes of <hi>Pſammitichus</hi> King of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, there was one found of fiue and twenty cubits long: and before that, in the dayes of <hi>Amaſis,</hi> one that was aboue ſixe and twenty cubits long, the reaſon whereof was theyr long life, and continuall growth.</p>
            <p>Wee haue ſhewed already, that the colour of a Crocodile is like to Saffron, that is, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> betwixt yellow and redde, more inclining to yellow then redde, not vnlike to the blacker kind of Chamaeleon: but <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> ſaith, that their belly is ſomewhat whiter then the other parts. Their body is rough all ouer, beeing couered with a certaine barke or rinde, ſo thicke, firme and ſtrong, as it will not yeelde (and eſpecially about the backe) vnto a cart-wheele when the cart is loaded, and in all the vpper parts, and the tayle, it is impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trable with any dart or ſpeare, yea ſcarcely to a piſtoll or ſmall gunne, but the belly is ſof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whereon he receiueth wounds with more facility: for as wee ſhall ſhew afterwardes, there is a kind of Dolphine which commeth into <hi>Nilus,</hi> and fighteth with them, wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them on the belly parts.</p>
            <p>The couering of their backe is diſtinguiſhed into diuers deuided ſhells, ſtanding vppe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> farre aboue the fleſh, and towardes the ſides they are leſſe emynent, but on the belly they are more ſmooth, white, and very penitrable. The eyes of a Crocodile of the vvater, are reported to be like vnto a Swines, and therefore in the vvater they ſee very dimlie, but out of the water they are ſharpe and quicke ſighted, like to all other foure-footed Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents that lay egges. They haue but one eye-lidde, &amp; that groweth from the nether part <note place="margin">Caelius Rho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </note> of the cheeke, which by reaſon of their eyes neuer twinckleth. And the Egyptians ſay, that onely the Crocodile among all the liuing creatures in the water, draweth a certaine thin bright skinne from his fore-head ouer his eyes, where-withall hee couereth his ſight: and this I take to be the onely cauſe of his dimme ſight in the waters.</p>
            <p>The head of this beaſt is very broade, and his ſnoute like a Swynes. When hee eateth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> or byteth, he neuer mooueth his neather or vnder chappe. Whereof <hi>Aristotle</hi> giueth this reaſon, that ſeeing Nature hath giuen him ſo ſhort feete, as that they are not able to hold <note place="margin">Herodotus Pliny. Solinus. Marcelinus.</note> or to take the prey, therefore the mouth is framed inſtead of feete, ſo as it may more ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently ſtrike and wound, and alſo more ſpeedily mooue and turne after the prey, and this is better done by the vpper the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the nether chap. But it is likely that hee was not decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, although he ſpeaketh of <hi>Crocodilus Marinus,</hi> a crocodile of the ſea: vvheras there is no Crocodile of the Sea, but rather ſome other monſter like a Crocodile in the ſea, and ſuch peraduenture <hi>Albertus</hi> ſaw, and there-vpon inconſideratly affirmed, that all Crocodiles moue theyr vnder-chapps, except the <hi>Tenchea.</hi> But the learned <hi>Veſſalius</hi> prooueth it to be otherwiſe, becauſe that the nether chappe is ſo conioyned and faſtned to the bones of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> temples, that it is not poſsible for to be moued. And therfore the Crocodile onely among all other liuing creatures, moueth the vpper-chap, and holdeth the vnder-chap vnmoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
            <p>The ſecond wonder vnto this, is that the Crocodile hath no tongue, nor ſo much as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <note place="margin">Albertus. Herodotus.</note> appearance of a tongue. But then the queſtion is, how it commeth to diſtinguiſh the ſapours and taſt of his meate. Where-vnto <hi>Aristotle</hi> aunſwereth, that this Crocodile is ſuch a rauening beaſt, that his meate tarrieth not in his mouth, but is carryed into his ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, like as other water-beaſts, and therefore they diſcerne ſapours, and relliſh theyr meate more ſpeedily the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> other; for the water or humour falleth ſo faſt into their mouthes, that they cannot ſtand long vppon the taſt or diſtaſte of their meate. But yet ſome make <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> queſtion of this, and they aunſwere that moſt men are deceiued heerein, for whiles they looke for his tongue vpon his nether-chap, as it is in all other beaſts, and find none, they conclude him to want that part: but they ſhould conſider, that the tongue cleaueth to the moueable part, and as in other beaſts the nether-chap is the ſeate of the tongue, becauſe of the motion, ſo in this the tongue cleaueth to the vpper-chappe, becauſe that it is moue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:22894:71"/>
and yet not viſible as in other, and therefore is very hardly diſcerned. For all this, I rather conclude with the former Authours, that ſeeing it liueth both in the waters and on the land, and therefore it reſembleth a fiſh and a beaſt, as it reſembleth a beaſt, <hi>locum obti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net lingua,</hi> it hath a place for a tongue, but as it reſembleth a fiſh, <hi>Elinguis est,</hi> it is without a tongue. It hath great teeth ſtanding out, all of them ſtand out before viſibly when the mouth is ſhut, and fewer behind. And whereas <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> writeth, that there is no liuing creature which hath both <hi>dentes prominentes, &amp; ſerratos,</hi> that is, ſtanding out, and deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded like a ſaw, yet the Crocodile hath both. Theſe teeth are white, long, ſharpe, &amp; a little crooked and hollow, their quantity well reſembling the reſidue of the proportion of the body: and ſome ſay, that a crocodile hath three rowes of teeth, like the Lion of <hi>Chius,</hi> &amp; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> 
               <note place="margin">T. Martyr</note> like the Whale, but this is not an approoued opinion, becauſe they haue no more then 60. teeth. They haue alſo 60. ioynts or bones in the back, which are alſo tied together with ſo many nerues. The opening of his mouth reacheth to the place of his eares, and there be ſome Crocodiles in <hi>Ganges</hi> which haue a kind of little horne vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their noſes or ſnout. The <note place="margin">Aelianus</note> melt is very ſmall, &amp; this ſomeſay is onely in them that bring forth egges, their ſtones are inward &amp; cleaue to their loynes. The taile is of the ſame length that the whole body hath, and the ſame is alſo rough &amp; armed with hard skin vpon the vpper part &amp; the ſides, but beneath it is ſmooth &amp; tender. It hath finnes vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the tayle, by the benefit wherof it ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, as alſo by the help of the feete. The feet are like a Beares, except that they are coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with ſcales in ſtead of haire; their nailes are very ſharp &amp; ſtrong, for if it had a thumbe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> as well as it hath feet, the ſtrength thereof would ouer-turne a ſhip. It is doubtful whether it hath any place of excrement except the mouth: And thus much for the ſeuerall parts of the Crocodile.</p>
            <p>The knowledge alſo of the naturall actions &amp; inclinations of Crocodiles is requiſite to be handled in the next place, becauſe that actions folow the members as ſounds do inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.

The eyes of a Crocodile (as we haue ſaid) are dull &amp; blind in the water, yet they appeare bright to others, for this cauſe, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Egyptians wil ſignifie the ſun-riſing, they picture a Crocodile in the water looking vpward to the earth, &amp; when they will ſignifie the weſt, they picture a Crocodile diuing into the water, and ſo for the moſt part the crocodile lyeth vpon the banks, that he may either diue into the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with ſpeed or aſcend to the earth to take his prey. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/>
            </p>
            <p>By reaſon of the ſhortnes of his feet, his pace is very ſlow, &amp; therefore it is not only ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to eſcape from him by flight, but alſo if a man do but turne aſide &amp; wind out of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect way, his body is ſo vnable to bend it ſelfe, that hee can neither wind nor turne after it. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they go vnder the earth into their caues, like to all other foure-footed &amp; egge-breeding ſerpents, as namely Lizards, Stellions, &amp; Torteiſes, they haue all their legs ioyned to their ſides, which are ſo retorted as they may bend to either ſide, for the neceſsity of coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their egges, but when they are abroad, and goe bearing vp all their bodies, then they bend only outward, making their thighes more viſible. It is ſom-what queſtionable, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they lye hid within their caues 4. months or 60. daies, for ſome Authors affirme one thing, &amp; ſome another, but the reaſon of the difference is taken from the condition of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> cold weather, for which cauſe they lye hid in the winter-time. Now foraſmuch as the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in Egypt is not vſually aboue foure months, therfore it is taken that they lye but foure months, but if it be by accide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of cold wether prolonged longer, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the ſame cauſe the crocodile is the longer time in the earth. During the time they lye hid, they eate nothing, but ſleepe (as it is thought) immoueably, &amp; when they come out againe, they do not caſt their skinnes as other Serpents doe.</p>

The tayle of a Crocodile is his ſtrongeſt part, and they neuer kill any beaſt or man, but firſt of all they ſtrike him downe and aſtoniſh him with their tailes, and for this cauſe, the Egyptians by a Crocodiles tayle doe ſignifie death &amp; darknes. They deuoure both men and beaſts if they find them in theyr way, or neere the bankes of <hi>Nilus,</hi> wherein they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide, <note place="margin">Orus.</note> taking ſometimes a calfe from the cow his damme, and carrying it whole into the waters. And it appeareth by the portraiture of <hi>Nealces,</hi> that a Crocodile drew in an Aſſe into <hi>Nilus</hi> as he was drinking, and therefore the dogges of Egypt by a kind of naturall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, do not drinke but as they runne, for feare of the Crocodiles: wherevpon came the prouerbe, <hi>Vt canis é Nilo bibit &amp; fugit,</hi> as a dogge at one time drinketh and runneth by Nilus. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/>

            <p>When they deſire fiſhes, they put their heads out of the water as it were to ſleepe, and then ſuddenly when they eſpy a booty, they leape into the waters vppon them and take them. After that they haue eaten and are ſatisfied, then they turne to the land againe; and as they lye gaping vpon the earth, the little bird <hi>Trochilus</hi> maketh cleane their teeth, and is ſatisfied by the remainders of the fleſh ſticking vppon them. It is alſo affirmed by <hi>Arnol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> that it is fedde with mud, but the holy Crocodile in the Prouince of <hi>Arſinoe,</hi> is fedde <note place="margin">Sira<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

VVhen the Egyptians will write a <note place="margin">Orus.</note> man eating or at dinner, they paynt a Crocodile gaping.</p>
            <p>They are exceeding fruitefull and prolificall, and therfore alſo in Hieroglyphicks they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> are made to ſignifie fruitfulnes. They bring forth euery yeere, and lay their egges in the earth or dry land. For during the ſpace of three-ſcore dayes they lay euery day an egge, &amp; within the like ſpace they are hatched into young ones, by ſitting or lying vpon them by courſe, the male one while, &amp; the female another. The time of their hatching is in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate <note place="margin">Aelianus. Solinus.</note> and temperate time, otherwiſe they perriſh and come to nothing, for extremity of heate ſpoyleth the egge, as the buds of ſome trees are burned and ſcorched off by the like occaſion. The egge is not much greater then the egge of a Gooſe, and the young one out of the ſhell is of the ſame proportion. And ſo from ſuch a ſmall beginning doth this huge and monſtrous Serpent grow to his great ſtature, the reaſon whereof (ſaith <hi>Aristotle)</hi> is, becauſe it groweth all his life long, euen to the length of ten or moe cubits. When it hath <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> layd the egges, it carryeth them to the place where they ſhall be hatched, for by a naturall prouidence and fore-ſight, it auoydeth the waters of Nilus, and therefore euer layeth her egges beyond the compaſſe of her floods: by obſeruation whereof, the people of Egypt know euery yeere the inundation of Nilus before it happen. And in the meaſure of this place it is apparent, that this beaſt is not indued onely with a ſpirit of reaſon, but alſo with <note place="margin">Plutarch.</note> a fatidicall or propheticall geographicall delineation, for ſo ſhee placeth her egges in the brimme or banke of the flood (before the flood commeth) that the water may couer the neſt, but not herſelfe that ſitteth vpon the egges. And the like to this is the building of the Beauer, as we haue ſhewed in due place before in the Hiſtory of Foure-footed beaſtes.</p>
            <p>So ſoone as the young ones are hatched, they inſtantly fall into the depth of the vva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but if they meete with frogge, ſnayle, or any other ſuch thing fit for their meate, they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> doe preſently teare it in peeces, the damme byteth it with her mouth, as it were puniſhing the puſillanimity thereof, but if it hunt greater things, and be greedy, rauening, induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and bloody, that ſhe maketh much of, and killing the other, nouriſheth and tendereth this aboue meaſure: after the example of the wiſeſt men, who loue their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, fore-ſeeing their induſtrious inclination, and not in affection, without regard of worth, vertue, or merrit. It is ſaid by <hi>Philes,</hi> that after the egge is layd by the Crocodile, many times there is a cruell ſtinging Scorpion which commeth out thereof, and woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth <note place="margin">Sclinus.</note> the Crocodile that layde it. To conclude, they neuer proſper but neere the waters, and they liue threeſcore yeeres, or the age of a mans life. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/>
            </p>
            <p>The nature of this beaſt is to be fearefull, rauening, malitious, and trecherous in get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of his prey, the ſubtiltie of whoſe ſpirit, is by ſome attributed to the thinneſſe of his blood, and by other to the hardnes of his skin and hide. How it dealeth with her young ones, we haue ſhewed already, as it were trying their nature whether they will degenerate or no, and the like things are reported of the Aſpes, Cancers, &amp; Torteyſes of Egypt.</p>

And if the Beaſt lift vppe his head to byte him, when hee gapeth they put into his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> mouth a wedge, holding it hard at both ends with both their hands, &amp; ſo as it were with a bridle, leade, or rather driue them captiues to the Land, vvhere with theyr noyſe they ſo terrifie them, that they make them caſt vppe the bodies which they had ſwallowed into theyr bellies: &amp; becauſe of this antypathy in nature, the Crocodiles dare not come neere to this Iland.</p>
            <p>The like thing wee haue before in our generall diſcourſe of Serpents, ſhewed to be in the <hi>Indian Pſylli</hi> againſt the greateſt Serpents. And <hi>Strabo</hi> alſo hath recorded, that at what time crocodiles were brought to Rome, theſe <hi>Tentyrites</hi> folowed &amp; droue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For whom there was a certaine great poole or fiſh-pond aſſigned and walled about; except one paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage for the Beaſt to come out of the water into the ſun-ſhine: and when the people came <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> to ſee them, theſe <hi>Tentyrites</hi> with nettes would draw them to the Land, &amp; put them backe againe into the water at theyr owne pleaſure. For they ſo hooke them by theyr eyes, and bottome of theyr bellyes, which are their tendereſt partes, that like as horſes broken by theyr Riders, they yeelde vnto them, and forget theyr ſtrength in the preſence of theſe theyr Conquerours.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> in his third booke of his <hi>Babylonian Lagation,</hi> ſaith, that from the Cittie <hi>Cair</hi> to the Sea, the Crocodiles are not ſo hurtfull and violent as they are vp the Riuer <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> into the Land, and againſt the ſtreame. For as you goe further vp the Riuer, neere the mountanie and hilly places, ſo ſhall you find them more fierce, bloody, and vnreſiſtable, whereof the inhabitants gaue him many reaſons. Firſt, becauſe that part of the Riuer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> which is betwixt the Citty <hi>Cair</hi> and the Sea, is very full of all ſorts of fiſhes, whereby the beaſts are ſo filled with deuouring of them, that they liſt not come out of the water on the Land to hunt after men or cattell, and therefore they are the leſſe hurtfull, for euen the Lyon and Wolfe doe ceaſe to kill &amp; deuoure when theyr bellyes are full. But ſometimes the Crocodiles beneath the Riuer, follow the gales or troupes of fiſh vp the Riuer, like ſo many Fiſher-men, and then the Country Fiſher-men incloſe them in Nettes, and ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them. For there is a very great reward propoſed by the Law of the Country, to him that killeth a Crocodile of any great quantitie; and therefore they grow not great, and by reaſon of their ſmalnes are leſſe aduenturous. For ſo ſoone as a great Crocodile is diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, there is ſuch watch and care taken to interrupt and kill him for hope of the reward, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> that he cannot long eſcape aliue.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the Crocodiles vp the Riuer, towards the Mountaines, are more hurtfull, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are preſſed with more hunger and famine, and more ſildome come within the terrour of men, wherefore they forſake the waters, and run vp and downe to ſeeke preyes to ſatisfie their hunger, which when they meet withall, they deuoure with an vnreſiſtable
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:22894:72"/>
deſire, forced and preſſed forward by hunger, which breaketh ſtone walls. But moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly when the Riuer <hi>Nilus</hi> is loweſt, and ſunck downe into the channell, then the Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codiles in the waters doe growe moſt hungry, becauſe the fiſh are gone away with the floods; and then the ſubtile beaſt will heale and couer himſelfe ouer with ſand or mudde, and ſo lye in the banke of the Riuer, where hee knoweth the women come to fetch water, or the cattell to drinke, and when he eſpieth his aduantage, he ſuddainely taketh the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man by the hand that ſhe taketh vp water withall, and draweth her into the Riuer, where he teareth her in peeces and eateth her. In like ſort dealeth he with Oxen, Cowes, Aſſes, and other cattell. If hunger force him to the Land, and he meete with a Cammell, horſe, Aſſe, or ſuch like beaſt, then with the force and blowes of his tayle he breaketh his legges, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> and ſo laying him flat on the earth, killeth and eateth him: for ſo great is the ſtrength of a Crocodiles tayle, that it hath beene ſeene that one ſtroke thereof hath broken all the foure legges of a beaſt at one blow.</p>
            <p>There is alſo another perrill by Crocodiles, for it is ſaide that when <hi>Nilus</hi> falleth, and the water waxeth low, the Barkes thorough want of wind, are faine by the Marriners to to be tugged vp the ſtreame with long lynes and cordes: the ſubtile Crocodile ſeeing the ſame, doth ſuddainely with his tayle ſmite the ſame line with ſuch force, that eyther hee breaketh it, or by his forcible violence tumbleth the Marriner downe into the vvater, whom he is ready to receiue with open mouth before he can recouer. Yea many times by meanes thereof the Barke it ſelfe ſo tottereth and reeleth, that the violent beaſt taketh a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> man out of it, or elſe cleane ouer-turneth it, to the deſtruction of all that are in it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aelianus</hi> ſaith, that among the <hi>Ombitae</hi> which are in <hi>Arſinoe,</hi> the Crocodiles are harme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, and hauing ſeuerall names when they are called, doe put their heads out of the vva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and take meate gently, which meate is the head and garbage of ſuch ſacrifices as are brought thether. But in another place hee writeth, that among the <hi>Ombitae</hi> or <hi>Coptitae,</hi> it is not ſafe for a man to fetch water from the Riuer, or to waſh theyr feete, or walke on the Riuers ſide, but with great caution and warines. For euen thoſe beaſtes which are moſt kindly vſed by men, doe rage againſt their Benefactours, as namely the Crocodile, the <hi>Ichneumon,</hi> the Wild-cats, and ſuch like. And yet <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his booke <hi>Vtra animalium,</hi> ſaith, that the Prieſtes, by the cuſtome of meate-giuing, haue made ſome of them ſo tame, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> that they will ſuffer theyr mouthes and teeth to be clenſed by men. And it is further ſaid, <note place="margin">Marcelinus.</note> that during the ſeauen Ceremoniall dayes of the natiuity of <hi>Apis,</hi> there is none of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that ſheweth any wilde tricke or cruell part, but as it were by compact betwixt them and the Prieſtes, they lay aſide all cruelty and rage during that time.</p>
            <p>And therefore <hi>Cicero</hi> writeth moſt excellently, ſaying; <hi>Egyptiorum morem quis igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret? quorum imbutae mentes prauitatum erroribus, quamvis carnificinam potius ſubierint, quam ibim, aut aſpidem, aut crocodilum violent.</hi> That is to ſay, Who is ignorant of the cuſtome of the Egyptians? whoſe mindes are ſo ſeaſoned and indued with erronious wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe, that they had rather vnder-goe any torment, then offer violence to an <hi>Ibis,</hi> an Aſpe, or a holy Crocodile. For in diuers places, all theſe, and Cats alſo, were worſhipped <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> by the people, according to the ſaying of <hi>Iuuenall.</hi>
            </p>
            <lg>
               <l>Crocodilon aderat parshaec Egypti,</l>
               <l>Illa pauit ſaturam ſerpentibus Ibim. </l>
            </lg>
            <p>
               <hi>Which may be engliſhed thus;</hi>

               <l>This part of Egypt Crocodiles adore,</l>
               <l>That, the Ibis, fed with Serpents ſtore.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>But the reaſons of diuine worſhippe or honour giuen to the Crocodiles are worth noting, that the diligent Reader may the better haue ſome taſte of that auncient blindnes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> whereby our fore-fathers were miſleddge and ſeduced, to forſake the moſt glorious and euer-bleſſed principles of Diuinitie, for arguments of no waight.</p>
            <p>Firſt therefore the Idolatrous Prieſtes, thought there was ſome diuine power in the Crocodile, becauſe it wanted a tongue, for the Deitie or Diuine ſpeech, hath no neede of a voyce to expreſſe his meaning, according to the ſaying of the Graecians, <hi>Kai di apſophoa
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:22894:73"/>

            <p>Secondlie, by reaſon of a certaine thinne ſmooth skinne comming from the midſt of his fore-head, where-withall it couereth his eyes, ſo that when it is thought to be blind, <note place="margin">Caelius</note> yet it ſeeth: euen ſo is it with the Diuine power, for euen then when it is not ſeene, yet doth it ſee perfectly all mortall things.</p>
            <p>Againe, by theyr egges &amp; neſts they vſually fore-ſhew the ouer-flowing of <hi>Nilus,</hi> to the infinite benefit of their country wherein they liue, for thereby the husband-men know when to till their Land, and when not, when to ſow and plant, and leade foorth theyr <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> flockes, and when not: vvhich benefite is alſo aſcribed to Diuinitie, and therefore the Crocodile is honoured with diuine power.</p>
            <p>Againe, it layeth threeſcore egges, &amp; layeth threeſcore yeeres, which number of three-ſcore, was in auncient time the firſt dimenſion of heauen and heauenly things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cicero</hi> alſo ſpeaking againſt this Egyptian vanitie, ſaith, that they neuer conſecrated a beaſt for a God, but for ſome apparant vtilitie, as the <hi>Ibis</hi> for deuouring of Serpents, and the Crocodile for beeing a terrour to theeues: and therefore the Arabian and Lybian theeues durſt not come ouer the Riuer <hi>Nilus</hi> to robbe the Egyptians for feare of the Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codiles.</p>
            <p>There is a tale in <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> of the originall of a Crocodiles diuine worſhippe, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> which although it cannot be but fabulous, yet I haue thought good to inſert it in this place, to ſhew the vanitie of ſuperſtition and Idolatry. There was a King of Egypt called <hi>Minas,</hi> or as <hi>Herodotus</hi> calleth him <hi>Menes,</hi> who following his houndes in hunting into a certaine mariſh of <hi>Moeris,</hi> fell in with his horſe, and there ſtucke faſt, none of his follovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers daring to come after him to releaſe him, ſo that he had there perriſhed, had not a cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codile come and taken him vp vppon his backe, and ſette him ſafe vppon the dry Land. For which miracle, the ſaid King there built a Citty, and cauſed a Crocodile to be vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped, which was called <hi>Sychus</hi> by all the inhabitants of that Citty, and alſo gaue all the ſaid Mariſh of <hi>Moeris</hi> for the ſuſtenance of the ſame. It was nouriſhed with bread, fleſh, &amp; wine, cakes, ſodde fleſh, and ſweete new wine: ſo that when any man came to the Lake <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> wherein it was kept, the Prieſts would preſently call the Beaſt out of the water, and being come to the Land, one of them opened his mouth, and the other put in meate, delicacies, and VVine.</p>
            <p>This Crocodile of <hi>Moeris,</hi> is the ſame that is called <hi>Arſinoe,</hi> and like to that at <hi>Thebes,</hi> about which they did hang iewels of gold, ſiluer, and iemmes of earings, bracelets, and ſuch other thinges of price. When it dyed, they did ſeaſon the body thereof with ſalt, &amp; buried it in the holy Tombes or burying Pots. The ſame alſo are called <hi>Ombitae,</hi> I meane the people of that Egypt which dwell in <hi>Arſinoe,</hi> and for the loue of the Crocodiles, they abandon all manner of Hawkes their enemies, inſomuch that many times they take them and hang them vp in publique vpon gallowes for that purpoſe erected. And further, they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> 
               <note place="margin">Herodotus</note> keepe certaine dayes of tryumphes like the <hi>Olympiades,</hi> and games of honour: and ſo farre they were blinded with that ſuperſtition, that they thought themſelues exceedingly bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed if they loſt their children by them, and thought themſelues much honoured, if they ſaw them with their eyes fetched out of the ſtreetes and playing places by Crocodiles.</p>
            <p>Againe, all the Egyptians holde opinion, that the Crocodile is a Diuinatour, vvhich they prooue by the teſtimonie of <hi>Ptolomeus,</hi> who calling one of theſe ſacred Crocodiles, which was the oldeſt and beſt of all, he would not aunſwere him, and afterward offering him meate, he alſo refuſed it, whereat many wondered: and ſome of the Prieſts ſayde, it was ſome prognoſticall ſigne either of the Kings death or his owne, &amp; ſo it fell out ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after, for the ſame Crocodile dyed. As though a Swine might not as well be accounted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> diuine, ſeeing it alſo refuſeth all meate and prouocation, at the time of theyr ſicknes, and before death.</p>
            <p>There is a citty in Egypt called <hi>Apollinopolis,</hi> the citty of <hi>Apollo,</hi> where the inhabitants ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor &amp; condemne the worſhip of crocodiles, for when they take any of them they hang the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp and beate them to death, notwithſtanding their teares &amp; cryings, and afterward they
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:22894:73"/>
eate them: but the reaſon of their hatred is, becauſe <hi>Typhon</hi> their auncient enemy, vvas clothed with a Crocodiles ſhape. Others alſo ſay, the reaſon of their hatred is, becauſe a Crocodile tooke away and deuoured the daughter of <hi>Pſamnites,</hi> and therfore they enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned all their poſteritie to hate Crocodiles.</p>
            <p>To conclude this diſcourſe of Crocodiles inclination, euen the Egyptians themſelues account a Crocodile a ſauage, and cruell murthering beaſt, as may appeare by their Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roglyphicks, for when they will decypher a mad man, they picture a crocodile, who bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Orus.</note> put from his deſired prey by forcible reſiſtance, hee preſently rageth againſt himſelfe. And they are often taught by lamentable experience, what fraude &amp; malice to man-kind liueth in theſe beaſts, for they couer themſelues vnder willowes &amp; greene hollow bankes, <note place="margin">Aelianus</note> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> till ſome people come to the waters ſide to draw and fetch water, and then ſuddenly, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they be aware, they are taken and drawne into the water. And alſo for this purpoſe, becauſe he knoweth that he is not able to ouer-take a man in his courſe or chaſe, he taketh a great deale of water in his mouth, &amp; caſteth it in the path-waies ſo that when they ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to run from the crocodile, they fall downe in the ſlippery path, and are ouer-taken &amp; deſtroyed by him. The common prouerbe alſo, <hi>Crocodili lachrimae,</hi> the crocodiles teares, iuſtifieth the treacherous nature of this beaſt, for there are not many bruite beaſts that can weepe, but ſuch is the nature of the Crocodile, that to get a man within his danger, he will ſob, ſigh &amp; weepe, as though he were in extremitie, but ſuddenly he deſtroyeth him. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſay, that the crocodile weepeth after he hath deuoured a man. How-ſoeuer it be, it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> noteth the wretched nature of hypocriticall harts, which before-hand will with fayned teares endeuour to do miſchiefe, or els after they haue done it be outwardly ſorry, as <hi>Iudas</hi> was for the betraying of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> before he went and hanged himſelfe.</p>
            <p>The males of this kind do loue their females aboue all meaſure, yea euen to iealouſie, as may appeare by this one hiſtory of <hi>P. Martyr.</hi> About the time that hee was in thoſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, there were certaine Marriners which ſaw two Crocodiles together in carnall copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation vpon the ſands neere the Riuer, from which the water was lately fallen into a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Iland of <hi>Nilus,</hi> the greedy Marriners forſooke their ſhip, and betooke themſelues to a long boate, and with great ſhouting, hollowing &amp; crying, made towards them in verie couragious manner: the male at the firſt aſſault fell amazed, &amp; greatly terrified ran away <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> as faſt as he could into the waters, leauing his female lying vpon her backe, (for whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ingender, the male turneth her vpon her backe, for by reaſon of the ſhortnes of her legges ſhe cannot doe it her ſelfe) ſo the Mariners finding her vpon her back &amp; not able to turne ouer her ſelfe, they eaſily ſlew her, and tooke her away with them. Soone after, the male returned to the place to ſeeke his female, but not finding her, and perceiuing blood vpon the ſand, coniectured truly that ſhe was ſlaine, wherefore hee preſently caſt himſelfe into the Riuer of <hi>Nilus</hi> againe, &amp; in his rage ſwam ſtoutly againſt the ſtreame vntill hee ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke the ſhip wherein his dead femall was, which he preſently ſet vppon, lifting vp him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and catching hold on the ſides, would certainly haue entered the ſame, had not the Marriners with all their force battered his head and hands with clubs and ſtaues; vntill he was wearied and forced to giue ouer his enterpriſe, &amp; ſo with great ſighing and ſobbing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> departed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them. By which relation it is moſt cleere what naturall affection they beare one to another, and how they chooſe out theyr fellowes, as it were fitte wiues and huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands for procreation.</p>
            <p>And it is no wonder if they make much of one another, for beſides the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues they haue few friends in the world, except the bird <hi>Trochilus</hi> and Swine, of whom I can ſay little, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept this that followeth. As for the little bird <hi>Trochilus,</hi> it affecteth and followeth them for the benefit of his owne belly: for while the Crocodile greedilie eateth, there ſticketh faſt in his teeth ſome part of his prey, which troubleth him very much, &amp; many times ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth wormes, then the beaſt to helpe himſelfe taketh land, and lyeth gaping againſt the ſunne-beames weſtward, the bird perceiuing it, flyeth to the iawes of the beaſt, and there <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> firſt with a kind of tickling-ſcratching, procureth (as it were) licence of the Crocodile to pull foorth the wormes, and ſo eateth them all out, and clenſeth the teeth thoroughly, for which cauſe the Beaſt is content to permit the Bird to goe into his mouth. But when all is clenſed, the ingratefull Crocodile endeuoureth ſuddainely to ſhut his chappes together
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:22894:74"/>
vppon the Bird, and to deuoure his friend, like a curſed wretch which maketh no recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of friendſhip, but the turne ſerued, requiteth good with euill. But Nature hath ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med this little bird with ſharpe thornes vpon her head, ſo that while the Crocodile ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoureth to ſhut his chaps and cloſe his mouth vpon it, thoſe ſharpe thornes pricke him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <note place="margin">Ariſtotle Marcelinus. Aelianus. Leo Afric:</note> his palate, ſo that full ſore againſt his vnkind nature, hee letteth her flye ſafe away. But where as there be many kinds of <hi>Trochili,</hi> which are greedy of theſe wormes or clenſings of the Crocodiles, ſome of them which haue not thornes on theyr heades pay for it, for there beeing not offence to let the cloſing of the Crocodiles mouth, they muſt needes be deuoured: and therefore this enforced amity betwixt him and the Crocodile, is onely to be vnderſtoode of the <hi>Claedororynchus,</hi> as it is called by <hi>Hermolaus.</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/>
            </p>
            <p>There be ſome that affirme that he deſtroyeth all without exception that thus come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his mouth, and other-ſome ſay he deſtroyeth none, but when he feeleth his mouth ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently clenſed, he waggeth his vpper chappe, as it were to giue warning of auoydance, <note place="margin">Plutarch.</note> and in fauour of the good turne, to let the bird flie away at his owne pleaſure. Howbeit, the other and former narration is more likely to be true, and more conſtantly affirmed by all good Authors except <hi>Plutarch.</hi> And <hi>Leo Afric:</hi> ſaith, that it was the conſtant and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident report of all Affrica, that the Crocodile deuoureth all for theyr loue and kindneſſe, except the <hi>Claedororynchi,</hi> which they cannot, by reaſon of the thornes vppon their head.</p>
            <p>That there is an amitie and naturall concord betwixt Swine and Crocodiles is alſo ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, becauſe they onely among all other liuing foure-footed beaſtes, doe without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, <note place="margin">Calcagninus.</note> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> dwell, feede and inhabite vppon the banks of <hi>Nilus,</hi> euen in the midſt of the Croco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diles; and therefore it is probable that they are friends in nature. But oh how ſmall a ſum of friends hath this beaſt, and how vnwoorthy of loue among all creatures, that neuer in nature hath but two, in heauen or earth, ayre or water, that will aduenture to come neere it, and one of theſe alſo, which is the beſt deſeruing, it deuoureth and deſtroyeth, it it get it within his danger.</p>
            <p>Seeing the friendes of it are ſo few, the enemies of it muſt needes be many, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore require a more large catalogue or ſtory. In the firſt ranke whereof commeth, (as wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the firſt place, the <hi>Ichneumon,</hi> or <hi>Pharaohs-mouſe,</hi> who rageth againſt their egges and <note place="margin">Diod: Sicul.</note> their perſons, for it is certaine that it hunteth with all ſagacity of ſence to finde out theyr <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> neſts, and hauing found them, it ſpoyleth, ſcattereth, breaketh &amp; emptieth all theyr egs. They alſo watch the old ones aſleepe, and finding their mouthes open againſt the beames of the Sunne, ſuddenly enter into them, and being ſmall, creepe downe theyr vaſt &amp; large <note place="margin">Strabo.</note> throates before they be aware, and then putting the Crocodile to exquiſite and intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble torment, by eating their guttes aſunder, and ſo their ſoft bellies, while the Crocodile tumbleth to and fro ſighing and weeping, now in the depth of water, now on the Land, neuer reſting till ſtrength of nature fayleth.

Fiſhes alſo in their kinde are enemies to Crocodiles, the firſt place whereof belongeth to the moſt noble Dolphin. Of theſe Dolphins it is thought there be two kinds, one bred in <hi>Nilus,</hi> the other forraine and comming out of the Sea, both of them profeſſed enemies to the Crocodile: for the firſt, it hath vpon the backe of it ſharp thorny prickles or finnes, as ſharp as any ſpeares poynt, which are well knowne to the fiſh that beareth them, as her armour and weapons againſt all aduerſaries. In the truſt and confidence of theſe prickles, the Dolphin will allure and draw out the Crocodile from his denne or lodging place, into the depth of the Riuer, and there fight with him hand to hand. For the Dolphin, as it knoweth his owne armour and defence, like other beaſts and fiſhes, ſo doth it knowe the weakeſt parts of his aduerſary, and where his aduantage of wounding lyeth. Now, as we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> haue ſaid already, the belly of the Crocodile is weake, hauing but a thinne skin, and pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trable with ſmall force, wherefore when the Dolphin hath the Crocodile in the midſt of <note place="margin">Strabo. Solinus.</note> the deepe waters, like one afrayd of the fight, vnderneath him he goeth, &amp; with his ſharp finnes or prickles on his backe, giueth his weake and tender belly mortall wounds, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by his vitall ſpirits, with his guts &amp; entralls, are quickly euacuated. The other Dolphins of the Sea being greater, are likewiſe armed with theſe prickles, and of purpoſe come out of the Sea into <hi>Nilus</hi> to bid battell to the Crocodiles.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Bibillus</hi> (a worthy Romane) was Gouernour of Egypt, hee affirmed that on a ſeaſon the Dolphins and the Crocodiles mette in the mouth of <hi>Nilus,</hi> and bade battell the one to the other, as it were for the ſoueraigntie of the waters, and after that ſharp combat, <note place="margin">Senecae.</note> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> it was ſeene how the Dolphins by diuing in the waters, did auoyd the byting of the Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codiles, and the Crocodiles dyed by ſtrokes receiued from the Dolphins vpon their bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyes. And when many of them were by this meanes as it were cut aſunder, the reſidue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke themſelues to flight, and ranne away, giuing way to the Dolphins. The Croco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diles doe alſo feare to meddle with the Sea-hogge, or Hog-fiſh, becauſe of his briſtles all about his head, which hurt him alſo when he commeth nigh him: or rather I ſuppoſe, as it is a friend to the Swine of the earth, and holdeth with them a ſympathy in nature, ſo it is vnto the Swine of the water, and forbeareth one in the Sea, as it doth the other on the Land.</p>
            <p>There is likewiſe a certaine Wild-oxe or Bugill among the <hi>Parthians,</hi> which is an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> to the Crocodile, for as <hi>Albertus</hi> writeth, if he find or meete with a Crocodile out of the water, he is not onely not afrayd of him, but taketh hart and ſetteth vppon him, and with the waight and violent agitation of his body, treadeth him all to pectes: &amp; no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, for all beaſts are enemies to the Crocodiles on the Land, euen as the Crocodile ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in waite to deſtroy all them in the water. Hawkes are alſo enemies to Crocodiles, &amp; <note place="margin">Orus.

For vvhich cauſe, when the Egyptians will write or decypher a rau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>It hath beene ſildome ſeene that Crocodiles were taken, yet it is ſaide that men hunt them in the waters, for <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith, that there is an aſſured perſwaſion, that with the gall and fat of a Water-Adder, men are wonderfully holpen, &amp; as it were armed againſt Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codiles, and by it enabled to take and deſtroy them, eſpecially when they carry alſo about them the herbe <hi>Potamegeton.</hi> There is alſo a kind of thorny Wilde-beane growing in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, which hath many ſharpe prickles vpon the ſtalkes, this is a great terrour to the Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codile, for he is in great dread of his eyes, which are very tender &amp; eaſie to be wounded. Therefore he auoydeth their ſight, being more vnwilling to aduenture vpon a man that <note place="margin">Creſcenſun:</note> beareth them, or one of them, then he is to aduenture vpon a man in compleate Armour, and therefore all the people plant great ſtore of theſe, and alſo beare them in theyr hands <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> when they trauaile.</p>
            <p>There be many who in the hunting and proſecuting of theſe Crocodiles, doe neither giue themſelues to runne away from them, nor once to turne aſide out of theyr common path or roade, but in a fooliſh hardineſſe, giue themſelues to combat with the beaſt, when they might very well auoyd the danger, but many times it hapneth that they pay decrely
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:22894:75"/>
for their raſhnes, and repent too late the too much reputation of their owne man-hoode: for whiles with their ſpeares and ſharpe weapons they thinke to pierce his ſides, they are deceiued, for there is no part of him penetrable except his belly, and that he keepeth ſafe enough from his enemies, blunting vpon his ſcales (no leſſe hard then plates ofyron) all the violence of theyr blowes and ſharpneſſe of weapons, but clubbes, beetles, and ſuch like weapons, are more irkeſome to him, when they be ſette on with ſtrength, battering the ſcales to his body, and giuing him ſuch knocks as doth diſmay and aſtoniſh him. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede <note place="margin">Diodorus.</note> there is no great vſe of the taking of this Serpent, nor profit of merchandize com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth thereby, his skinne and fleſh yeelding no great reſpect in the world.</p>
            <p>In auncient time they tooke them with hookes bayted with fleſh, or els incloſed them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> with nettes as they doe fiſhes, and now and then with a ſtrong yron inſtrument caſt out a boat downe into the water vpon the head of the Crocodile. And among all other there is this one worthy to be related. The Hunter would take off the skin from a Swines backe and there-withall couer his hooke, whereby hee allured and inticed the Serpent into the midſt of the Riuer, &amp; there making it faſt, hee went afterward to the next watering place, and there holding another Hogge, did beate and ſmyte him, till he cryed ardentlie, vvith which voyce or cry, the Crocodile beeing mooued, goeth preſently to the bayte &amp; ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth <note place="margin">Herodotus.</note> it vppe, and maketh after the noyſe: at laſt, comming to the Land, the Hunter with valiant courage and diligence, caſteth mudde and durt into his eyes, and ſo blindeth him that he may oppreſſe and kill him with eaſe. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Leo Afric:</hi> relateth alſo this meanes or way to take Crocodiles: There be many Trees planted vpon the bankes of <hi>Nilus,</hi> vnto one of theſe there is a long and ſtrong rope tyed, and at the end of the ſame there is faſtened a hooke of a cubite long, and a finger in quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie: vnto this hooke for a bayte, is tyed a Ramme or a Goate, which beeing ſette cloſe to the Riuer, and tormented with the hooke vppon which it is faſtened, cryeth out amaine, by hearing of whoſe voyce, the hunger-greedy Crocodile is rayſed out of his denne, and inuited as he thinketh to a rich prey, ſo hee commeth (although it ſelfe of a trecherous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet ſuſpecteth not any other) and ſwalloweth the bayte, in which he findeth a hooke not to be diſgeſted. Then away he ſtriueth to goe, but the ſtrength of the rope ſtayeth his iourney, for as faſt as the bayte was to the rope and hooke, ſo faſt is he alſo enſnared and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> tyed vnto it, which while hee waueth and ſtrayneth to vnlooſe and breake, hee wearieth himſelfe in vaine. And to the intent that all his ſtrength may be ſpent againſt the tree and the rope, the Hunters are at one end thereof, and cauſe it to be caſt to and fro, pulling it in, and now letting it goe againe, now terrifying the beaſt with one noyſe and feare, and anone with another, ſo long as they perceiue in him any ſpirit of moouing or reſiſtance: ſo beeing quieted, to him they come, and with clubbes, ſpeares, beetles, ſtaues, and ſuch manner of inſtruments, pierce thorough the moſt tendereſt partes of his body and ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> hath alſo other meanes of taking Crocodiles. Their nature is, that when they goe to the Land to forrage and ſeeke after a prey, they cannot returne backe againe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> but by the ſame footſteps of their own which they left imprinted in the ſand: whervpon, when the country people perceiue theſe footeſteppes, inſtantly with all the haſt they can make, they come with Spades and Mattocks and make a great ditch, and with boughes couer the ſame, ſo as the Serpent may not eſpy it, and vpon the boughes they alſo againe lay ſand to auoyde all occaſion of deceit, or ſuſpition of fraude at his returne: then vvhen all thinges are thus prepared, they hunt the Crocodile by the foote vntill they finde him, then with noyſes of bells, pannes, kettles, and ſuch like thinges, they terrifie and make him returne as faſt as feare can make him runne towardes the waters againe, and they fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him as neere as they can, vntill hee falleth into the ditch, where they come all about him, and kill him with ſuch inſtruments or weapons as they haue prepared for him: and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> ſo beeing ſlayne, they carry him to the great Cittie <hi>Caire,</hi> where for theyr reward they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue ten peeces of gold, which amounteth to the value of ten nobles of our Engliſh coine.</p>
            <p>There haue beene ſome brought into that Citty aliue, as <hi>P. Martyr</hi> affirmeth, whereof one was as much as two Oxen &amp; two Cammels could beare and draw, and at the ſame time there was one taken by this deuiſe before expreſſed, which had entered into a vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage

            <p>We doe read that Crocodiles haue beene taken and brought aliue to Rome.

            <p>
               <hi>Aurelius Feſtiuus</hi> writeth, that <hi>Firmus</hi> a Tyrant of Aegypt beeing condemned to <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> to be deuoured by Crocodiles, before hand bought a great quantity of the fat of Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codiles, and ſo ſtripping himſelfe ſtarke naked, layde the ſame all ouer his body, ſo hee went among the Crocodiles and eſcaped death: for this ſauage beaſt beeing deceiued with the ſauour of it owne nature, ſpared the man that had but ſo cunningly carryed it. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> And this is a wonderfull worke of almighty GOD, that ſo ordereth his actions in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <note place="margin">Uadian<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>And ſome againe ſay, that all venomous beaſtes runne away from the ſauour of the fat heereof; and therefore no maruaile if it alſo be afraide, being venomous, as well as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <note place="margin">Aetius.</note> other. Wherefore the ſaying of <hi>Firmus</hi> was not to bee attributed to any indulgence of the Crocodile toward their owne kinde, but rather to a deadly antipathy reflecting themſelues vppon themſelues, though not in ſhape and figure as the Cockatrice, yet in ſence, ſauour, and rankneſſe of their peſtiferous humour. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/>

            <p>The vſe of crocodiles taken, is for their skinne, fleſh, caule, and medicine aryſing out of it. Their skinne as it is exceeding hard vppon their backes while they are aliue, ſo is it <note place="margin">P: Martyr.</note> alſo when they are dead, for with that the common people make them better armour then coats of Mayle, againſt Darts, Speare, or Shielde, as is well knowne in all Aegypt at this day. For the fleſh of crocodiles, it is alſo eaten among thoſe people that do not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip it: as namely, the people about <hi>Elephantina Apollinopolis.</hi> Notwithſtanding by the <note place="margin">Herodoius.</note> Law of God Leuit. 11. it is accounted an vncleane beaſt, yet the taſt thereof being found pleaſant, and the relliſh good, without reſpect of GOD or health, the common people make vſe thereof.</p>
            <p>The medicines ariſing out of it are alſo many. The firſt place belongeth to the caule, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> which hath moe benefits or vertues in it, then can be expreſſed. The bloud of a croco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dile <note place="margin">Dioſcorid.</note> is held profitable for many thinges, and among other it is thought to cure the bitings of any Serpent. Alſo by annoynting the eyes, it cureth both the dregs or ſpots of bloud in them, and alſo reſtoreth ſoundneſſe and cleareneſſe to the ſight, taking away all dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or deadneſſe from the eyes. And it is ſaid, that if a man take the liquor which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth <note place="margin">Pliny.</note> from a peece of a crocodile fryed, and annoynte therewithall his wound or har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med part, that then he ſhall bee preſently rid of all paine and torment. The skinne both of the Land &amp; water crocodile dryed into powder, and the ſame powder with Vineger <note place="margin">Arnoldus.</note> or Oyle, layd vpon a part or member of the body, to be feared, cut off, or lanced, taketh away all ſence and feeling of paine from the inſtrument in the action. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/>
            </p>
            <p>All the Aegyptians doe with the fat or ſewet of a crocodile annoynt all them that be ſick of Feauers, for it hath the ſame operation which the fat of a Sea-dogge or Dog-fiſh hath, and if thoſe parts of men and beaſts which are hurt or wounded with crocodiles teeth, be <note place="margin">Aetius.</note> annoynted with this fat, it alſo cureth them. Being concocted with water and Vineger, and ſo rowled vppe and downe in the mouth, it cureth the tooth-ach: and alſo it is out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvardly <note place="margin">Rhazes.</note>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:22894:76"/>
applyed agaynſt the byting of Flyes, Spyders, Wormes, and ſuch like, for this cauſe, as alſo becauſe it is thought to cure Wennes, bunches in the fleſh, and olde woundes. It is ſolde deare, and held pretious in <hi>Alcair. Scaliger</hi> writeth, that it cureth the <hi>Gangren.</hi> The canyne teeth which are hollow, filled with Frankinſence, and tyed to a man or woman which hath the tooth-ach, cureth them, if the party know not of the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying them about: And ſo they write, that if the little ſtones which are in their belly be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken forth and ſo vſed, they work the ſame effect againſt Feauers. The dung is profitable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the falling off of the hayre, and many ſuch other things.</p>
            <p>The biting of a Crocodile is very ſharp, deepe, and deadly, ſo that whereſoeuer he lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his teeth, ſeldome or neuer followeth any cure. But yet the counſell of Phyſitions is, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> 
               <note place="margin">Aetius.</note> that ſo ſoone as the patyent is wounded, he muſt be brought into a cloſe Chamber wher are no windowes, and there bee kept without change of ayre, or admiſſion of light, for the poyſon of the Crocodile worketh by cold Ayre and light; and therefore by the want <note place="margin">Arnoldus.</note> of both is to be cured. But for remedy (if any bee) they preſcribe the ſame which is giuen for the cure of the biting of a mad Dog, or (as <hi>Auicen)</hi> the byting of a Dogge not madde. But moſt proper is the dung of a man, the Fiſh <hi>Garum</hi> and <hi>Myſy</hi> pounded together, and ſo applyed, or elſe the broth of ſalt-ſod-fleſh, &amp; ſuch other things as are vulgarly knowne to euery Phyſition: and therefore ſeeing we liue in a country far from the annoyance of this Serpent, I ſhall not neede to blot any Paper to expreſſe the cure of this poyſon.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here haue beene ſome that haue reckoned Scinkes and Lizards among Wormes, but as the Greeke wordes <hi>Erpetx,</hi> and <hi>Scolex,</hi> differ in moſt apparant dialect, and ſignification, and therefore it is an opinion not worth the confuting, for there are no worms of this quantity. But for the better explycation of the nature of this beaſt, becauſe ſome haue taken it for one kind, and ſome for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> another. ſome for a Crocodile, and others for a beaſt like a cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codile; wee are to know that there are three kindes of Croco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diles: the firſt is a water-beaſt or Serpent, and vulgarly tearmed a Crocodile, the ſecond is a Scinke or a Crocodile of the earth, which is in all partes like that of the water, except
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:22894:77"/>
               <figure/>
in his colour and thickneſſe of his skinne: the third kinde of Crocodile is vnknowne to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> vs at this day, yet <hi>Pliny</hi> and others make mention of it, and deſcribe it to bee a beaſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his ſcales like a Gorgon, growing or turning to his head from the tayle, and not as others do, from the head to the tayle.</p>
            <p>The Graecians call this beaſt <hi>Skigkos,</hi> and ſome vnlearned Apothecaries <hi>Stincus,</hi> and <hi>Myrepſus Sigk.</hi> It is alſo called <hi>Kikeros,</hi> and the Haebrew <hi>Koach,</hi> doth more properly ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie this beaſt, then any other Crocodile or Chamaeleon, or Lizard. Some of the Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes doe expound <hi>Zab</hi> for a Scinke, and from thence the Chaldaes and the Arabians <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> haue their <hi>Dad</hi> and <hi>Aldab,</hi> turning <hi>Z</hi> into <hi>D:</hi> So we read <hi>Guaril</hi> and <hi>Adhaya,</hi> for a Scinke or Crocodile of the earth: <hi>Alarbian</hi> is alſo for the ſame ſerpent among the Arabians, <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecola,</hi> and <hi>Ballecara Schanchur,</hi> and <hi>Aſchanchur,</hi> and <hi>Askincor,</hi> and <hi>Scerantum,</hi> &amp; <hi>Nudalep,</hi> and <hi>Nudalepi,</hi> are all of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Synonymaes, or rather corrupted words for this crocodile of the earth. But there are at this day certain <hi>Pſeudoſcinkes</hi> ſet out to be ſeen &amp; ſold by Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries, that are nothing elſe but a kind of Water-Lizzard: but the true difference is betwixt them, that theſe water-Lizards are venomous, but this is not, and neither liuing in the Northerne partes of the world, nor yet in the water: and ſo much ſhall ſuffice for the name and firſt enterance into this Serpents Hiſtory.</p>
            <p>They are brought out of the Eaſterne Countries, or out of Aegypt: yet the Monkes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> of <hi>Meſuen</hi> affirme, that they had ſeene Scinkes or Crocodiles of the earth about Rome. <hi>Syluaticus</hi> and <hi>Platearius</hi> in <hi>Apulia.</hi> But howſoeuer their affections may lead them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture of this ſerpent, I rather beleeue that it is an <hi>Affrican</hi> beaſt, &amp; ſeldome fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in <hi>Aſia</hi> or Europe. They loue the bankes of <hi>Nilus,</hi> although they dare not enter the water, and for this cauſe ſome haue thought (but vntruely) that when the Crocodile layeth her egges in the water, the young is there alſo engendered and hatched, and is a Crocodile of the water, but if they lay theyr egges on the dry Land, from thence commeth the Scinke or Crocodile of the earth. This folly is euidently refuted, becauſe that they neuer lay egges in the water, but all vpon the dry Land. They are found (as I haue ſaid before) in Aegypt, and alſo in <hi>Affricke,</hi> and among the <hi>Lydians</hi> of <hi>Mauritania,</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>Lodya,</hi> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> 
               <hi>Lybia,</hi> among the Paſtorall or Plow-men-<hi>Affricans;</hi> among the Arabians, and neere the red Sea, for all thoſe at this day ſolde at <hi>Venice,</hi> are brought from thoſe partes. The greateſt in the world are in <hi>India,</hi> (as <hi>Cardan</hi> teacheth) who are in all thinges like Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards, ſauing in their excrements, which ſmell or ſauour more ſtrongly, and generally the difference of their quantity ariſeth from the Country which they inhabite, for in the hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and moyſter country they are greater, in the hotter dryer Region they are ſmaller, &amp; generally they exceede not two or three cubits in length, with an anſwerable proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable body, which is thus deſcribed.</p>
            <p>There bee certaine croſſe lines which come along the backe one by one, ſomewhat white, and of a dusky colour, and thoſe that be dusky haue alſo in them ſome white ſpots. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> The vpper part of the necke is very dusky, the head and the tayle are more white, the feet and all the neather part of the breaſt and belly are white, with appearance vpon them of ſome ſcales, or rather the skinne figured in the proportion of ſcales: vppon either feete they haue fiue diſtinct fingers or clawes, the length of their Legges is a Thumbe and a halfe: that is, three inches, the tayle two fingers long, the body ſixe, ſo that the whole
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:22894:77"/>
length from the head to the tippe of the tayle, (which is firſt thicke, and then very ſmall at the end) is about eyght fingers. When they haue taken them they bowell them, and fill theyr bodies with Sugar, and Silke of Wooll, and ſo they ſell them for a reaſonable price. That which I haue written of their length of eyght fingers, is not ſo to bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, as though they neuer exceeded or came ſhort of that proportion: for ſome-times they are brought into theſe partes of the World twenty or foure and twenty fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers long, ſometimes againe not aboue fiue or ſixe fingers long.</p>
            <p>When they lay theyr Egges, they commit them to the earth, euen as the Crocodiles <note place="margin">Ariſtotle.</note> of the water doe. They liue vpon the moſt odoriferous flowers, and therefore is his fleſh ſo ſweete, and his dung or excrements odoriferous. They are enemies to Bees, and liue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> much about Hiues, inſomuch as ſome haue thought they did lay their Egges in Hiues, and there hatch their young ones: But the occaſion of this error was, that they ſavve young ones brought by theyr Parents into ſome Hiue, to feede vpon the labouring Bee. For the compaſſing of theyr deſire they make meale of any tree, which they haue ground in the Mill of their owne mouths, and that they mix with blacke Hellebor iuyce, or with the liquor of Mallowes, this meale ſo tempered they lay before the hiues, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of aſſoone as the Bees taſt, they dye, and then commeth the Crocodile with her young ones, and lick the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp; and beſide Bees, I doe not read they are hurtfull to any. The <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> haue a little beaſt about the quantity of a little Dogge, which they call <hi>Phattage,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Aelianus.</note> very like to a Scinke or Crocodile of the Earth, hauing ſharp ſcales, as cutting as a ſaw. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/>
            </p>
            <p>There is ſome hurt by this beaſt vnto men, for which cauſe I may iuſtly reckon it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the venomous, for if it chance to bite any man, if the wounded man fall into a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <note place="margin">Rhazes.</note> before he make water, he dyeth for it, but if he firſt make water, the beaſt dyeth and the man eſcapeth.</p>
            <p>It is thought that it containeth a kind of naturall magicke, witch-craft, or ſorcery; and therefore they ſay it hath a ſtupifying power, changing the mind from louc to hatred, and from hatred to loue againe. The powder of this Serpent drunke in Wine, if it ſtirre venerous luſt, it hurteth the Nerues and ſinnewes. There be certaine magicall deuiſes rayſed out of this Serpent which are not woorth the writing, as not hauing in them any dram of wit, learning, or truth; and therefore I will not trouble the Reader with them, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> but follow on the concluſion of this Crocodiles ſtory in the Narration of the medicinall vertues, which are farre moe and more operatiue then thoſe in the former Crocodile, for I thinke Almighty GOD bleſſeth meekenes and innocency with exceſſe of grace in men and beaſtes, as may be ſeene in theſe two kindes of Crocodiles, the dung and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement of the one, beeing more worth then the body of the other, through harmeleſſe innocency.</p>
            <p>The body of this Serpent to be dryed, after it hath line long in ſalt, and to bee preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in Nooſewort, as <hi>Ruellius</hi> and <hi>Marcellus</hi> write: (but truth is, there is no need of Salt where Noſewort is applyed, becauſe the <hi>Arcrimony</hi> of this Hearb doth eaſily dry vp the moyſture of the beaſt, keeping Wormes from breeding in it.) With the powder thus prepared, venerious men ſtirre vp their luſtes. Mithridate is called <hi>Diaſincu,</hi> becauſe it is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> compounded of the Scinke or Crocodile of the earth, and it containeth in it a moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Antidote againſt all poyſons. <hi>Gallen</hi> had an Antidote againſt Scorptions, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other thinges containeth in it the fleſh of a Crocodile of the Earth, wherewithall he cured all them that had beene ſtung with Scorpions in <hi>Lybia.</hi> It is alſo good agaynſt the byting of mad beaſtes, and pleuriſes; againſt poyſoned Hony, or the crudity and loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that commeth in the ſtomacke by eating of ſound Honny: It is profitable againſt empoyſoned Arrowes or Dartes, being taken immediately before or after the wound, as <hi>Apelles</hi> hath obſerued.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Serapio</hi> did make a medicine compounded of the dung of this Crocodile, and apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſame againſt the falling ſickneſſe. Of the body of this Scinke, except the head and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> the feete being ſod or roſted, and eaten by them that haue the Sciattica, an old cough (eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially children,) or the paine of the loynes, giueth them much eaſe. They are alſo mixed with medicines againſt the paine of the feete, as <hi>Galen</hi> did for <hi>Amarantus</hi> the <hi>Grammartan.</hi> They are alſo good in medicine againſt the coldneſſe of the ſinnewes. This
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:22894:78"/>
beaſt is very hot, and therefore increaſeth the ſeede of man, and prouoketh luſt; and for this purpoſe the greateſt and fatteſt, &amp; ſuch a one as is taken in the ſpring time, when they burne in luſt for copulation is preferred. But this is not to be meant of the fleſhy partes, but onely of thoſe partes that are about the reynes, if a man drinke thereof the weight of a groat in Wine afterwardes, for the alaying of the heate thereof, the Phyſitions doe preſcribe a decoction of Lentiles with Hony, and the ſeede of Lettice drunke in Water. The ſnout of this Crocodile with the feete drunke in white wine, hath the ſame operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: but we haue ſhewed already, that theſe parts are to be cut offand throwne away, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if there be any venome in the beaſt it lyeth in them.</p>
            <p>A perfume being made of the body and intrals of this Crocodile vnder the wombe of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> a Woman labouring with child, is thought to yeald much help, for her ſafe, ſpeedy, and eaſie trauaile, or flockes of wooll perfumed therewith, and layd to her belly. But it is the part of good Phyſions to be very warie in giuing of medicines for ſtirring vp of luſt in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, except in marryed perſons, and then alſo when they are young, to procure a lawfull iſſue and poſterity in the world: otherwiſe they ſhall both decay the body, for all violent helpes of carnall copulation, do in the end prooue detriments to nature, if they continue any time, and alſo they are hurtfull to the Soule, when not onely the vnnaturall deſire of luſt, but alſo the intemperate pleaſure of ſinne is increaſed thereby; and that is a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable cure, which killeth the Soule to help one part of the body. Beſides all kinds of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines for this purpoſe, (amongſt which this Crococodile is the cheefe) haue their pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culier <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> venome, and when they are miniſtred, either they haue no effect at all through age or ouermuch impotency, or elſe they worke too violently, which is moſt dangerous, or ſome one hurt or other followeth the poyſon: and ſo I will leaue the proſecution of this part.</p>
            <p>The duſt of the skinne of this Crocodile being annoynted with Vineger or Oyle vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any part or member which is to be cut off, taketh away the ſence of paine in the time of execution. The bloud is good for the eyes, and taketh away the filthy skinne of the body, with the ſpots and burles in the face, reſtoring the firſt, true, natiue, and liuely co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. The fat taketh away the paine in the reines, and cauſeth a diſtillation of the ſeede of man, yet this fatte touching the hayre of a man, maketh it to fall off, and a man an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> heerewith, is ſafe from the annoyance of Crocodiles, although they play with him. It alſo cureth the bytinges of Crocodiles, the inſtillation of this Crocodile, foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vp in the wooll of a blacke Sheepe of the firſt birth, and wherein is no other colour, hath power to driue away a quartan Ague. And <hi>Raſis</hi> ſaith, that it beeing hung ouer the head of a woman being in trauaile, keepeth her from deliuery. In the gall of this Serpent there is a power againſt the falling off of the hayre, eſpecially if the medicine bee made of the rootes of Beetes to neeſe withall; and beſides, the eyes beeing annoynted therewith, and with Hony, there is nothing more profitable againſt ſuffuſions. The ſtones &amp; reines haue power to prouoke generation, and <hi>Aetius</hi> preſcribeth an Antidote to bee made of the taile of this beaſt, againſt the gout. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/>
            </p>
            <p>Great is the vertue of the dung or excrement of this Serpent, if the ſame could be caſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly found, but while it is ſought for, it looſeth the vertue. It is called <hi>Crocodillia,</hi> and is profitable to giue a good colour to womens faces, that is the beſt which is whiteſt, ſhort, and not heauy, feeling like Leauen betwixt the fingers, that is, ſmelling ſomewhat ſharp like Leauen.</p>
            <p>It is adulterated with Meale, Chalke, white-earth, or painting, but it is deſcerned by the heauineſſe. The reaſon of the vertue of this is, becauſe it feedeth vpon the ſweeteſt &amp; beſt ſmelling Herbs, whereby it commeth to paſſe, that it doth not onely ſmell fragrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but alſo containe in it many excellent vertues. Firſt therefore it is good for the come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe of the face, to giue colour to it, according to the ſaying of <hi>Horace: Colorque ſtercore</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> 
               <hi>fucatus Crocodili:</hi> A colour in-grained with the dung of a Crocodile, and for this cauſe alſo is the verſe of <hi>Ouid: Nigrior ad pharij confugit picis opem:</hi> That is, The black Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man goeth to craue helpe of the Fiſh <hi>Pharius,</hi> to become more beautifull; for by the fiſh <hi>Pharius,</hi> is vnderſtood a Crocodile. As ſome thinke eight, graynes of this dung, or rather the weight of eyght groates, with halfe ſo much Muſtard-ſeede and Vineger, cureth the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:22894:78"/>
falling off of the haire. <hi>Arnoldus</hi> doth preſcribe a compoſition of the dung and Cantha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rides, for the regenerating and bringing againe of haire that is decayed. If a perfume hereof be made and infuſed by a Tunelli into the holes of Serpents, it will driue them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, by reaſon of the ſharp and leaueniſh ſauour thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tralianus</hi> maketh a medicine thereof for an Eye-ſalue againſt the whiteneſſe and bloud-ſhot-eyes. It is good alſo againſt dimneſſe and ſuffutions, being annoynted with the iuyce of Leekes: and to conclude, it is drunk in ſweetwine and Vineger, againſt the falling ſickneſſe, and alſo being applyed vnto women, ſtirreth vp their monthly courſes. And thus much ſhall ſuffice for the ſtory of the Crocodile.</p>

            <p>There is ſome difference among Authours about the nature of this Serpent: for <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianus</hi> confoundeth it with the Snake of the Earth, called <hi>Cherſydrus,</hi> and ſayth it liueth ſometime in the Water and ſometime on the Land, lying in waight to deſtroy all ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Creatures. And (hee ſayth) it vſeth this fraud, it euer lyeth hidde in ſecret neere the high-wayes, and many times climbeth vppe into trees where it roundeth it ſelfe round into a circle, and hideth his head within the foldes of his owne body, ſo ſoone as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> euer it eſpyeth a Paſſenger, eyther a man or beaſt, it leapeth vppon him as ſwift as a Dart flyeth. For it is able to leape twenty cubits ſpace, and ſo lighting vppon the man or beaſt, ſticketh faſt vnto it without falling off of his owne accord, vntill they fall downe dead.</p>
            <p>But herein <hi>Aelianus</hi> ſeemeth to be deceiued, becauſe hee maketh but one Serpent of twaine: namely, this Dart and the Land-Snake, which are moſt apparantly different in nature, kind, and quality.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aetius</hi> alſo confoundeth this ſerpent with the Millet-ſerpent, called <hi>Cenchrites,</hi> and ſayth it is of the quantity of two cubits, great on the head, and the fore part ſmaller at the tayle, being of a greeniſh colour. And he ſaith further, that at ſuch time as the Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let-ſeede <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> groweth and flowriſheth, this ſerpent is moſt ſtrong and hurtfull, and ſo with the reſidue hee agreeth vvith <hi>Aelianus,</hi> but heerein hee is alſo deceiued, writing by here ſay as himſelfe confeſſeth, and therefore it is more ſafe for vs to haue recourſe to ſome eie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witneſſe for the deſcription of this ſerpent, then to ſtand vppon the opinions of them which writ by the relation of others.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:22894:79"/>
               <hi>Bellonius</hi> ſaith; that he ſaw one of theſe in Rhodes, being full of ſmall round black ſpots, not greater then the ſeedes of Lentiles, euery one hauing a round circle about him like an eye, after ſuch faſhion as is to be ſeene in the little Eiſh called the <hi>Torpedo.</hi> In length it exceedeth not three palmes, and in bigneſſe no greater then the little finger. It was of an Aſhe-colour, comming neere to the whiteneſſe of Milke, but vnder the belly it was altogether white: vpon the backe it had ſcales, but vppon the belly a thin skin, as in all other Serpents.</p>
            <p>The vpper part of the backe was ſomewhat blacke, hauing two blacke lines in the middle, which beginne at the head, and ſo are drawne along the whole body to the tayle. As for the <hi>Cafezati,</hi> and <hi>Alterarati</hi> or <hi>Altinatyri,</hi> thoſe are redde Serpentes, (as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> 
               <hi>Autcen</hi> ſaith) which are but ſmall in quantity, yet as deep and deadly in poyſon as in any other, for they hurt in the ſame manner that theſe Darters do. Some of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do ſo wound with theyr poyſon, as the afflicted perſon dyeth incontinent without ſence or payne: Some againe dye by languiſhing payne after many hopes of recouery, looſing life. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all the people of the Worlde, the <hi>Sabians</hi> are moſt annoyed with this kinde of redde Serpentes; for they haue many odoriferous and ſweete ſmelling Woods, in the which theſe Serpentes doe abound, but ſuch is their rage and hatred againſt men, that they leape vppon them and wounde them deadly, whenſoeuer they come within their compaſſe. And ſurely if it be lawfull to coniecture what kinde of Serpentes thoſe were, which in the Scripture are called fiery Serpentes, and did ſting the Iſraelites to death in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> the Wilderneſſe, vntill the brazen Serpent was erected for their cure; among all the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentes in the world, that kind of paine and death can be aſcribed to none more porperly then to theſe <hi>Cafezati</hi> or Red-Dart-Serpents.</p>
            <p>For firſt the wilderneſſe which was the place wherein they annoyed the people, doth very well agree to their habitation. Secondly, thoſe fiery Serpentes are ſo called by figure, not that they were firey, but as all Writers doe agree, eyther becauſe they were redde like fire, or elſe becauſe the paine which they inflicted, did burne like fire, or rather for both theſe cauſes together which are ioyntly and ſeuerally found in theſe red Serpents; and therefore I will conclude for my opinion, that theſe Serpents (as the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt poyſon in nature) were ſent by GOD to afflict the ſinning Iſraelites, whoſe poyſon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> was vncurable, except by Diuine miracle.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Matthiolus</hi> alſo telleth a ſtory of a Shepheard which was ſlaine in Italy by one of theſe, as hee was ſleeping in the heate of the day vnder the ſhaddow of a tree, his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Shepheardes beeing not farre off looking to theyr flockes, ſoddainely there came one of theſe Dart-Serpentes out of the tree, and wounded him vppon his left pappe, at the byting whereof the man awaked and cryed out, aad ſo dyed incontinently: his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Shepheards hearing this noyſe, came vnto him to ſee what he ayled, and found him dead, with a Serpent vpon his breaſt; now knowing what kind of Serpent this was, they forſooke their flockes and ran away for feare.</p>
            <p>The cure of this Serpentes byting, if there bee any at all, is the ſame vvhich cureth the Viper, as <hi>Aetius</hi> and <hi>Auicen</hi> writeth, and therefore I will not relate it in this place. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> The gall of this beaſt mixed with the <hi>Sythian</hi> Stone, yealdeth a very good Eye-ſalue. The which Gall lyeth betwixt the backe and the Lyuer: And thus much ſhall ſuffice for this Serpent.</p>

When it hath a purpoſe to auoyde that thing which it feareth, or where-withall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> it is offended, hee doth but onely change his courſe back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward as he went forward; ſo that it is as happy a <hi>Lyntius,</hi> whom the Poets faine to be very quick-ſighted, or as thoſe Monſters which are ſaid to haue eyes in their backs, or rather like to <hi>Ianus,</hi> which is ſayde to haue two faces, one forward, and another backward, and therefore I haue called it <hi>Double-head,</hi> I truſt fitly enough to expreſſe the Greeke word, although compounded of two words together, for ſo is the Greeke word alſo, which the French doe expreſſe by a like compounded word, <hi>Double-marcheur,</hi> that is, going two waies. It is likewiſe called <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſime, Alchiſmus,</hi> &amp; <hi>Amphiſilenem.</hi> And thus much may ſuffice for the name.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid that this Serpent is found in the Iland <hi>Lemnus,</hi> but among the Germans it is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> vnknowne.

               <l>This Serpent Double-head, is grieuous to be ſeene,</l>
               <l>Whoſe clouen-head doth kill with ſight and hiſsing keene.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>Vnto this alſo <hi>Elianus</hi> ſubſcribeth, that it is a true Serpent, and hath two heads, ſo that whenſoeuer it is to goe forward, one of them ſtandeth in the place of the tayle, but when it is to goe backward, then the head becommeth the tayle, and the tayle the head. So alſo <hi>Mantuan</hi> ſayth it is a double-headed Serpent, and a fearefull ſtinging Aſpe. And ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally all the Auncients, vntill <hi>Mathiolus</hi> and <hi>Greuinus</hi> time, who firſt of all began to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary this opinion, affirming it to be impoſſible in nature, for one Serpent to haue tvvo heads, except it be monſtrous; and exceede the common courſe of nature. Such a one was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> that Serpent with two heads that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſpeaketh of, which doth eaſily happen to all thoſe creatures which at one birth bring forth many young ones; for ſo theyr bodies may be conioyned into one, whiles theyr heads ſtand aſunder like twaine. And they ſay that this Serpent doth reſemble a Worme of the earth, whoſe head and tayle is hard to be be diſtinguiſhed aſunder except you ſee it going. And they ſay further, that this Serpent is
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:22894:82"/>
like to the <hi>Scytall,</hi> of which we ſhall ſpeake afterwards, differing from it in nothing except in going backward and forward, and this is all that they can bring againſt the opinion of the Auncients, whom I will not ſtand to confute, but leaue the Reader to beleeue one or other: for it ſhall not bring to mee any great diſaduantage, except the loſſe of his newe Engliſh name, for I haue dealt faithfully with the Reader in ſetting downe the opinion of both ſides, and if I doe fayle in a fit name, yet will I not ſwarue from the beſt deſcription of his nature.</p>
            <p>The whole proportion of his body is of equall magnitude or greatnes, and the two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities doe anſwer the middle.

            <p>To conclude, the auncient Romans (as <hi>Vegetius</hi> writeth) carried in all their bands the Eſcutchion of a Dragon, to ſignifie their fortitude and vigilancie, which were borne vp <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> by certaine men called for that purpoſe <hi>Draconarij.</hi> And therefore when <hi>Constantius</hi> the Emperour entered into the City of Rome, his Souldiers are ſaid to beare vppe vppon the toppes of their ſpeares, dragons gaping with wide mouthes, and made faſt with golden chaines and pearle, the wind whiſtling in their throates, as if they had beene aliue, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning deſtruction, and theyr tayles hanging looſe in the ayre, were likewiſe by the vvinde toſſed to and fro, as though they ſtroue to come off from the ſpeares, but when the wind was layd, all theyr motion was ended, where-vpon the Poet ſaith:</p>

            <p>The tale alſo of the Golden-fleece, if it be worth any place in this ſtorie, deſerueth to be inſerted heere, as it is reported by <hi>Diodorus Siculns.</hi> When <hi>Actës</hi> raigned in <hi>Pontus,</hi> he
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:22894:83"/>
receiued an aunſwere from the Oracle, that hee ſhould then dye when ſtrangers ſhould come thether with ſhippes and fetch away the Gol-den-fleece. Vpon which occaſion hee ſhewed himſelfe to be of a cruell nature, for he did not onely make Proclamation that he would ſacrifice all ſtrangers which came within his dominions, but did alſo performe the ſame, that by the fame and report of ſuch crueltie, he might terrifie all other Nations fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hauing acceſſe vnto that Temple. Not contented heere-with, hee raiſed a great ſtrong vvall round about the Temple wherein the Fleece was kept, and cauſed a ſure watch or guarde to attend the ſame day &amp; night, of whom the Graetians tell many ſtrange fables. For they ſay there were Bulls breathing out fire, and a Dragon warding the Temple and defending the Fleece, but the truth is that theſe watchmen becauſe of their ſtrength were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> called Bulls, becauſe of their cruelty, were ſaid to breathe out fire, and becauſe of their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilancie, crueltie, ſtrength and terrour, to be dragons.</p>
            <p>Some affirme againe, that in the Gardens of <hi>Heſperides</hi> in <hi>Libia,</hi> there were golden Apples, which were kept by a terrible Dragon, which dragon was afterward ſlaine by <hi>Hercules,</hi> and the Apples taken away by him, &amp; ſo brought to <hi>Euryſhteus.</hi> Others affirme that <hi>Heſperides</hi> had certaine flocks of ſheepe, the colour of whoſe woll was like gold, and they were kept by a valiant Sheepheard called <hi>Draco:</hi> but I rather agree with <hi>Solinus,</hi> who giueth a more true reaſon of this fable, <hi>Nefamae licentia vulneretur fides,</hi> leaſt (as he ſaith) fayth and truth ſhould receiue a diſgrace or wound by the lauiſh report of fame. There was among the <hi>Heſperides</hi> a certaine winding Riuer comming from the ſea, and including <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> within it the compaſſe of that land which is called the Gardens of <hi>Heſperides,</hi> at one place whereof, the falling of the water broken by a Rocke, ſeemeth to be like the falling downe of Snakes, to them that ſtand a farre off, and from hence ariſeth all the occaſion of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble afore-ſaid.</p>
            <p>Indeed there was a ſtatue of <hi>Hercules,</hi> in the left hand wherof were three Apples, which he was ſaid to haue obtained by the conqueſt of a dragon, but that conqueſt of the dragon did morrally ſignifie his owne concupiſcence, whereby hee raigned ouer three paſsions, that is to ſay, ouer his wrath by patience, ouer his cupiditie by temperance, and ouer his pleaſures by labour &amp; trauaile: which were three vertues farre more precious then three golden Apples. But I will ſtay my courſe from proſecuting theſe morrall diſcourſes of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> dragon, and returne againe to his naturall hiſtory; from which I haue ſomewhat too long digreſſed.</p>
            <p>There are diuers ſorts of Dragons, diſtinguiſhed partly by their Countries, partlie by their quantitie and magnitude, and partly by the different forme of their externall partes. There be Serpents in Arabia called <hi>Sirenae,</hi> which haue winges, beeing as ſwift as horſes, running or flying at their owne pleaſure, and when they wound a man, hee dyeth before he feeleth paine. Of theſe it is thought the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> ſpeaketh, chap. 13. ver. 22. <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens clamabit in Templis voluptarijs:</hi> and for Serpents, the old Tranſlators read <hi>Syrenae,</hi> &amp; ſo the Engliſh ſhould be, the <hi>Syrene</hi> dragons ſhould cry in their Temples of pleaſure: and the auncient diſtinction was, <hi>Anguis aquarum, Serpentes terraru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Dracones Temploru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:</hi> that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> is to ſay, Snakes are of the water, Serpents of the earth, &amp; Dragons of the Temples. And I thinke it was a iuſt iudgement of God, that the auncient Temples of the Heathen-Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters were annoyed with dragons, that as the deuill was there worſhipped, ſo there might be appearance of his perſon in the vglie forme and nature of a dragon. For God himſelfe in holy Scripture, doth compare the deuill vnto a dragon, as <hi>Reue: 12. ver:</hi> 3. And there appeared another wonder in Heauen, for behold a great Redde-dragon, hauing 7. heads, and tenne hornes, and ſeauen crownes vpon his head. <hi>verſe</hi> 4. And his tayle drewe the third part of the ſtarres of heauen, and caſt them to the earth: and the dragon ſtoode be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Woman which was ready to be deliuered, to deuoure her child when ſhee had brought it forth. <hi>Verſe</hi> 5. So ſhe brought forth a man-child, which ſhould rule all Nations <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> with a rodde of yron. And her Sonne was taken vp vnto God and to his throne. <hi>Verſe</hi> 6. And the Woman fledde into the Wildernes, where ſhe hath a place prepared of God, that they ſhould feede her there 1260. dayes. <hi>Verſe</hi> 7. And there was a battaile in heauen, <hi>Michaell</hi> and his Angels fought againſt the Dragon, and the Dragon fought and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. <hi>Verſe</hi> 8. But they preuailed not, neither was theyr place found any more in heauen.
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:22894:84"/>
               <hi>Verſe</hi> 9. And the great Dragon that old Serpent called the deuill and Satan, was caſt out, which deceiueth all the world, he was euen caſt vnto the earth, and his Angels were caſt out with him. <hi>Verſe</hi> 13. And when the dragon ſaw that he was caſt vnto the earth, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted the VVoman which had brought forth a man-child: and ſo forth, as it followeth in the Text. Where-vppon S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> writeth, <hi>Diabolus draco dicitur propter inſidias, quia occulte inſidiatur:</hi> that is, the deuill is called a dragon becauſe of his treachery, for he doth treacherouſly ſet vpon men to deſtroy them.</p>
            <p>It was wont to be ſaid, becauſe dragons are the greateſt Serpents, that except a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent eate a ſerpent, he ſhall neuer be a dragon: for theyr opinion was, that they grew ſo <note place="margin">Aelianus.</note> great by deuouring others of their kind; and indeede in Ethiopia they grow to be thirtie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> yardes long, neither haue they any other name for thoſe dragons but Elephant-killers, &amp; they liue very long.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oneſicritus</hi> writeth, that one <hi>Apoſiſares</hi> an Indian, did nouriſh two Serpents dragons, whereof one was ſixe and forty cubits long, and the other foureſcore; and for the more famous verification of the fact, he was a very earneſt ſuter to <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, when he was in India to come and ſee them, but the King beeing afraid, refuſed.</p>
            <p>The Chroniclers of the affayres of <hi>Chius</hi> doe write, that in a certaine valley neere to the foote of the mountaine <hi>Pellenaus,</hi> was a valley full of ſtraite tall Trees, wherein was bred a dragon of wonderfull magnitude or greatnes, whoſe onely voyce or hiſsing, did terrifie all the Inhabitants of <hi>Chius,</hi> and therefore there was no man that durſt come nigh vnto <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> him, to conſider or to take a perfect view of his quantitie, ſuſpecting onely his greatneſſe by the loudeneſſe of his voyce, vntill at length they knewe him better by a ſinguler acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent worthy of eternall memory. For it hapned on a time that ſuch a violent wind did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe, as did beate together all the Trees in the wood, by which violent colliſion, the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches fell to be on fire, and ſo all the wood was burned ſuddainely, compaſſing in the dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, whereby he had no meanes to eſcape aliue, and ſo trees fell downe vpon him &amp; bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him. Afterward, when the fire had made the place bare of wood, the inhabitants might ſee the quantity of the dragon, for they found diuers of his bones &amp; his head, which were of ſuch vnuſuall greatnes, as did ſufficiently confirme them in their former opinion: and thus by diuine miracle was this monſter conſumed, who neuer any man durſt behold <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n=""/> beeing aliue, and the inhabitants of the Country ſafely deliuered from their iuſt concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued feare.</p>
            <p>It is alſo reported, that <hi>Alexander</hi> among many other beaſtes which hee ſaw in India, did there finde in a certaine denne a dragon of ſeauentie cubites long, which the Indians accounted a ſacred beaſt, and therefore intreated <hi>Alexander</hi> to doe it no harme. When it vttered the voyce with full breath, it terrified his whole Armie: they could neuer ſee the proportion of his body, but onely the head, and by that they geſſed the quantitie of the whole body, for one of his eyes in their appearance ſeemed as great as a Macedonian buckler. <hi>Maximus Tyrius</hi> writeth, that in the dayes of <hi>Alexander,</hi> there was likewiſe ſeene a dragon in India, as long as fiue roodes of land are broade, which is incredible. For hee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> likewiſe ſaith, that the Indians did feede him euery day with many ſeuerall Oxen and ſheepe. It may be that it was the ſame ſpoken of before, which ſome ignorant men, and ſuch as were giuen to ſette forth fables, amplified beyond meaſure and credite.</p>
            <p>Whereas dragons are bredde in India and Affrica, the greateſt of all are in India, for in Ethiopia, Nubia, and Heſperia, the dragons are confined within the length of fiue cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, &amp; twenty cubits: for in the time of <hi>Euergetes,</hi> there were three brought into Egypt, one was nine cubits long, which with great care was nouriſhed in the Temple of <hi>Eſcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius,</hi> the other two were ſeauen cubits long. About the place where once the Tower of Babell was builded, are dragons of great quantitie, and vnder the Equinoctiall, as <hi>Nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorus Callistus</hi> writeth, there are Serpents as thicke as beames, in teſtimony wherof their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> skinnes haue been brought to Rome. And therefore it is no maruell, although S. <hi>Austine</hi> writing vpon the 148. Pſalme, doth ſay, <hi>Draconis magna quedam ſunt animantia maiora non ſunt ſuper terram:</hi> dragons are certaine great beaſts, and there are none greater vpon the earth. Neither is it to be thought incredible that the ſouldiours of <hi>Attilius Regulus</hi> did kill a dragon which was a hundred and twenty foote long, or that the dragons in the
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:22894:84"/>
dennes of the Mountaine <hi>Atlas,</hi> ſhould grow ſo great that they can ſcarce moue the fore-parts of their bodie. I am yet therefore to ſpeake of the dragons in the Montaines <hi>Emodij,</hi> or of <hi>Arigia,</hi> or of <hi>Dachinabades,</hi> or the Regions of the Eaſt, or of that which <hi>Augustus</hi> ſhewed publiquely to the people of Rome, beeing fiftie cubits long; or of thoſe which be <note place="margin">Stumpſius.</note> in the Alpes, which are found in certaine Caues of the South-ſides of the hills, ſo that this which hath beene ſaid, ſhall ſuffiſe for the quantitie and Countries of dragons. Beſides, there are other kindes of dragons which I muſt ſpeake of in order: and firſt of all of the <hi>Epidaurian</hi> dragons, which is bred no where but in that Country, beeing tame, and of yellow golden-colour, wherefore they were dedicated to <hi>Aeſculapius,</hi> of whom <hi>Nicander</hi> writeth in this manner; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/>

But among all dragons, there was none more famous then the dragon <hi>Python,</hi> or <hi>Pithias,</hi> as the Poets faine, which was bred of the ſlyme of the earth, after the flood of <hi>Ducalion,</hi> and ſlaine af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards by <hi>Apollo,</hi> whereof there lieth this tale; That when <hi>Latona</hi> was with childe by <hi>Iupiter</hi> of <hi>Apollo</hi> and <hi>Diana, Iuno</hi> reſiſted their birth, but when they were borne and layde in the cradle, ſhe ſent the dragon <hi>Python</hi> to deuoure them, <hi>Apollo</hi> beeing but a young In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> did kill the dragon with a darte. But this tale ſeemeth too fabulous and incredible, and therefore they haue mended the matter with another deuice; For they ſay that <hi>Python</hi> by the commaundement of <hi>Iuno,</hi> did perſecute <hi>Latona</hi> throughout all the world, ſeeking to deuoure her, ſo as ſhe had no reſt vntill ſhee came vnto her ſiſter <hi>Aſteria,</hi> who receiued her into <hi>Delos,</hi> where ſhe was ſafely deliuered of <hi>Apollo</hi> and <hi>Diana.</hi> Afterward, when the child was growne vp, he ſlew the dragon in remembrance &amp; reuenge of the wrong done to his mother. But the true cauſe of this hiſtory is deliuered by <hi>Pauſanias</hi> &amp; <hi>Macrobius,</hi> to be thus; That <hi>Apollo</hi> killed one <hi>Python</hi> a very wicked man in <hi>Delphos,</hi> &amp; that the Poets in excuſe of the fact, did faine him to be a dragon, as afore-ſaid. And ſo I ſhall not neede to ſay any more of <hi>Python,</hi> except theſe verſes following out of <hi>Ouid</hi> about his generation. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/>

When they come downe from the mountaines into the plaine to hunt, they are neither afraid of Marſhes nor violent waters, but thruſt themſelues greedily into <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> all hazards and dangers: and becauſe they are of longer and ſtronger bodies then the dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons of the Fennes, they beguile them of their meate, &amp; take away from them their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared booties. Some of them are of a yellowiſh fieric-colour, hauing alſo ſharpe backs like ſawes; theſe alſo haue beardes, and when they ſette vppe their ſcales they ſhine like ſiluer.

               <hi>Gyllius, Pierius,</hi> and <hi>Greuinus,</hi> following the authoritie of this Poet, doe affirme that a Dragon is of a blacke colour, the bellie ſome-what greene, &amp; very beautifull to behold, hauing a treble rowe of teeth in theyr mouthes vppon euery iawe, and with moſt bright and cleere-ſeeing eyes, vvhich cauſed the Poets to faine in their writings, that theſe dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons are the watchfull-keepers of Treaſures. They haue alſo two dewlappes grovving vnder their chinne, and hanging downe like a beard, which are of a redde colour: theyr <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> bodies are ſette all ouer with very ſharpe ſcales, and ouer theyr eyes ſtand certaine flexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble eye-liddes. When they gape wide with their mouth, and thruſt foorth their tongue, theyr teeth ſeeme very much to reſemble the teeth of, Wilde-Swine: And theyr neckes haue many times groſſe thicke hayre growing vpon them, much like vnto the briſtles of a VVilde-Boare.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:22894:86"/>
Their mouth, (eſpecially of the moſt tame-able Dragons) is but little, not much big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then a pype, through which they drawe in theyr breath, for they wound not vvith theyr mouth, but with theyr tayles, onely beating with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> when they are angry. But the Indian, Ethiopian, and Phrygian dragons, haue very wide mouthes, through which they often ſwallow in whole foules and beaſts. Theyr tongue is clouen as if it were double, and the Inveſtigators of nature doe ſay, that they haue fifteene teeth of a ſide. The males haue combes on their heads, but the females haue none, and they are likewiſe diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by their beards.</p>
            <p>They haue moſt excellent ſences both of ſeeing and hearing, and for this cauſe theyr name <hi>Drakon</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth of <hi>Derkein,</hi> and this was one cauſe why <hi>Iupiter</hi> the Heathens great <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> God, is ſaid to be metamorphiſed into a Dragon, whereof there flieth this tale: vvhen he fell in loue with <hi>Proſerpina,</hi> he rauiſhed her in the likenes of a dragon, for hee came vnto her and couered her with the ſpires of his body; and for this cauſe the people of <hi>Sabazij</hi> did obſerue in their miſteries or ſacrifices, the ſhape of a dragon rowled vp within the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of his ſpires: ſo that as he begot <hi>Ceres</hi> with child in the likenes of a Bull, he likewiſe deluded her daughter <hi>Proſerpina</hi> in the likenes of a dragon; but of theſe tranſmutations we ſhall ſpeake more afterwards, &amp; I thinke the vanity of theſe, tooke firſt ground fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the <hi>Affricans,</hi> who beleeue that the originall of dragons tooke beginning from the vnnaturall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iunction of an Eagle &amp; a ſhee-Wolfe. And ſo they ſay that the Wolfe growing great by this conception, doth not bring forth as at other times, but her belly breaketh, and the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> dragon commeth out, who in his beake and wings reſembleth the dragon his father, and in his feete and tayle, the vvolfe his mother, but in the skin neither of them both: but this kind of fabulus generation, is already ſufficiently confuted. Their meates are fruites and herbes, or any venomous creature, therfore they liue long without foode, and when they eate, they are not eaſily filled. They grow moſt fat by eating of egs, in deuouring wherof they vſe this Art, if it be a great dragon, he ſwalloweth it vp whole, and then rowleth him ſelfe, whereby hee cruſheth the egges to peeces in his belly, and ſo nature caſteth out the ſhells, &amp; keepeth in the meate. But if it be a young dragon, as if it were a dragons whelp, he taketh the egge within the ſpire of his tayle, and ſo cruſheth it hard, &amp; holdeth it faſt, vntill his ſcales open the ſhell like a knife, then ſucketh hee out of the place opened all the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> meate of the egge. In like ſort do the young ones pull off the feathers fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the foules which they eate, and the old ones ſwallow them whole, caſting the feathers out of theyr bellyes againe.</p>
            <p>The dragons of <hi>Phrygia</hi> when they are hungry, turne themſelues toward the weſt, &amp; gaping wide, with the force of their breath doe draw the birdes that flie ouer their heads into their throats, which ſome haue thought is but a voluntary lapſe of the fowles, to be drawne by the breath of the dragon, as by a thing they loue, but it is more probable, that ſome vaporous and venomous breath is ſent vp from the dragon to them, that poyſoneth and infecteth the ayre about them, whereby their ſences are taken from them, and they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhed fall downe into his mouth. But if it fortune the dragons find not foode enough <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> to ſatisfie their hunger, then they hide themſelues vntill the people be returned from the market, or the Heard-men bring home their flocks, and vppon a ſuddaine they deuoure eyther men or beaſtes, which come firſt to their mouthes: then they goe againe and hide themſelues in their dennes and hollow Caues of the earth, for theyr bodies beeing excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding hote, they very ſildome come out of the cold earth, except to ſeeke meate and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment. And becauſe they liue onely in the hotteſt Countries, therefore they common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie make theyr lodgings neere vnto the waters, or elſe in the coldeſt places among the Rocks and ſtones.</p>
            <p>They greatlie preſerue their health (as <hi>Aristotle</hi> affirmeth) by eating of Wild-lettice, for that they make them to vomit, and caſt foorth of theyr ſtomacke what-ſoeuer meate <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> offendeth them, and they are moſt ſpeciallie offended by eating of Apples, for theyr bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are much ſubiect to be filled with winde, and therefore they neuer eate Apples, but firſt they eate Wilde-lettice. Theyr ſight alſo (as <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſayth) doth many times grow weake and feeble, and therefore they renew and recouer the ſame againe by rubbing their eyes againſt Fennell, or elſe by eating of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:22894:86" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Their age could neuer yet be certainely knowne, but it is coniectured that they liue long, and in great health, like to all other Serpents, &amp; therefore they grow ſo great. They doe not onely liue on the land, as we haue ſaid already, but alſo ſwimme in the water, for many times they take the Sea in Ethyopia, foure or fiue of them together, folding theyr tayles like hurdles, and holding vp their heads, ſo ſwim they ouer to ſeeke better foode in Arabia.</p>
            <p>We haue ſaid already, that when they ſet vpon Elephants, they are taken and killed of men: now the manner how the Indians kill the Mountaine-dragons is thus; they take a garment of Scarlet, and picture vpon it a charme in golden letters, this they lay vpon the mouth of the Dragons denne, for with the redde colour and the gold, the eyes of the dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> are ouer-come, and he ſalleth aſleepe, the Indians in the meane-ſeaſon watching, &amp; muttering ſecretly words of Incantation, when they perceiue he is faſt aſleepe, ſuddaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they ſtrike off his necke with an Axe, and ſo take out the balls of his eyes, wherein are lodged thoſe rare &amp; precious ſtones which containe in them vertues vnvtterable, as hath beene euidently prooued by one of them, that was included in the Ring of <hi>Gyges.</hi> Manie times it falleth out, that the dragon draweth in the Indian both with his Axe and Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments into his denne, and there deuoureth him, in the rage whereof, hee ſo beateth the Mountaine that it ſhaketh. When the dragon is killed, they make vſe of the skin, eyes, teeth, and fleſh, as for the fleſh, it is of a vitriall or glaſſie colour, and the Ethiopians doe eate it very greedily, for they ſay it hath in it a refrigeratiue power. And there be ſome <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> which by certaine inchaunting verſes doe tame Dragons, and rydeth vpon their necks, as a man would ride vpon a horſe, guiding and gouerning them with a bridle.</p>
            <p>Now becauſe we haue already ſhewed, that ſome dragons haue winges, leaſt it ſhould ſeeme vncredible, as the fooliſh world is apt to beleeue no more then they ſee, I haue therefore thought good to adde in this place, a particuler relation of the teſtimonies of ſundry Learned-men, concerning theſe winged Serpents or dragons. Firſt of all <hi>Mega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtenes</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Aelianus. Scaliger.</note> writeth, that in India there be certaine flying Serpents, which hurt not in the day, but in the night time, and theſe do render or make a kind of vrine, by the touching where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, all the parts of mortall creatures doe rotte away. And there is a Mountaine which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uideth aſunder the Kingdome of <hi>Narſing a</hi> from <hi>Alabaris,</hi> wherein be many winged-ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> ſitting vpon trees, which they ſay poyſon men with their breath. There be many peſtilent winged-ſerpents which come out of Arabia euery yeere by troupes into Egypt, theſe are deſtroyed by a certaine Black-bird called <hi>Ibis,</hi> who fighteth with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence <note place="margin">Aelianus. Herodotus.</note> of that Country where ſhe liueth, ſo that there lye great heapes of them many times deſtroyed vpon the earth by theſe Birds, whoſe bodies may be there viſibly ſeene to haue both wings and legges, and their bones beeing of great quantitie and ſtature, remaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſumed for many yeeres after. Theſe kinde of Serpents or Dragons, couet to keepe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Trees of Frankinſence which grow in Arabia, and when they are driuen away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence with the fume or ſmoake of Stirax, then they flie (as is afore-ſaid) into Egypt, and this is to be conſidered, that if it were not for this Stirax, all that Country would be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> conſumed with Dragons.</p>
            <p>Neither haue wee in Europe onely heard of Dragons and neuer ſeene them, but alſo euen in our own Country, there haue (by the teſtimonie of ſundry Writers) diuers been diſcouered and killed. And firſt of all, there was a Dragon or Winged-ſerpent brought vnto <hi>Frauncis</hi> the French-King when hee lay at <hi>Sancton,</hi> by a certaine Country-man, <note place="margin">Brodaus Scaliger</note> who had ſlaine the ſame Serpent himſelfe with a Spade, when it ſette vppon him in the fields to kill him. And this thing was witneſſed by many Learned &amp; credible men which ſaw the ſame: and they thought it was not bredde in that Country, but rather driuen by the winde thither from ſome forraine Nation. For Fraunce was neuer knowne to breede any ſuch Monſters. Among the <hi>Pyrenes</hi> alſo, there is a cruell kinde of Serpent, not paſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> foure foote long, and as thicke as a mans arme, out of whoſe ſides growe winges much like vnto griſtles.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Geſner</hi> alſo ſaith, that in the yeere of our Lord 1543. there came many Serpents both with wings and legs into the parts of Germany neere <hi>Stiria,</hi> who did bite &amp; wound ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men incurably. <hi>Cardan</hi> alſo deſcribeth certaine ſerpents with wings, which hee ſaw at
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:22894:87" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Parris, whoſe dead bodies were in the hands of <hi>Gulielmus Muſicus,</hi> hee ſaith that they had two legges and ſmall winges, ſo that they could ſcarce flie, the head was little, and like to the head of a Serpent, their colour bright, and without haire or feathers, the quantitie of that which was greateſt, did not exceede the bignes of a Cony, and it is ſaide they vvere <note place="margin">Crinitus</note> brought out of India. Beſides, a further confirmation of theſe beaſtes, there haue beene noted in all ages; for it is written in the Romaine Chronicles, the times of their appariſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and manifeſtation.</p>
            <p>When the Riuer of <hi>Tiber</hi> ouer-flowed aboue the bankes, then were many Serpents diſcouered, and many Dragons, as in the time of <hi>Mauritius</hi> the Emperour, at what time a dragon came along by the Citty of Rome, vpon the waters in the ſight of all men, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> ſo paſſed to the Sea: after which prodigie, there followed a great mortall peſtilence. In <note place="margin">Stumpſius.</note> the yeere 1499. the twenty ſixe day of May, there came a dragon to the Citty of <hi>Lucerne,</hi> which came out of the Lake through <hi>Ruſa,</hi> downe along the Riuer, many people of all ſorts beholding the ſame.</p>
            <p>There haue beene alſo Dragons many times ſeene in Germanie, flying in the ayre at mid-day, and ſignifying great and fearefull fiers to follow, as it happened neere to the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie called <hi>Niderburge,</hi> neere to the ſhore of the <hi>Rhyne,</hi> in a maruailous cleere ſun-ſhine day, there came a dragon three times ſucceſſiuely together in one day, &amp; did hang in the ayre ouer a Towne called <hi>Sanctogoarin,</hi> and ſhaking his tayle ouer that Towne euery time: it appeared viſibly in the ſight of many of the inhabitants, and afterwards it came to paſſe, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> that the ſaid towne was three times burned with fire, to the great harme and vndooing of all the people dwelling in the ſame; for they were not able to make any reſiſtance to quench the fire, with all the might, Art, and power that they could raiſe. And it was fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther obſerued, that about that time there were many dragons ſeene waſhing themſelues in a certaine Fountaine or Well neere the towne, and if any of the people did by chaunce drinke of the water of that Well, theyr bellyes did inſtantly begin to ſwell, and they died as if they had beene poyſoned. Where-vpon it was publiquely decreed, that the ſaid well ſhould be filled vp with ſtones, to the intent that neuer any man ſhould afterwards be poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned with that water; and ſo a memory thereof was continued, and theſe thinges are written by <hi>Iustinus Goblerus,</hi> in an Epiſtle to <hi>Geſner,</hi> affirming that hee did not write fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> things, but ſuch things as were true, and as he had learned from men of great honeſtly and credite, whoſe eyes did ſee and behold both the dragons, and the miſhaps that follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed by fire.</p>
            <p>When the body of <hi>Cleomines</hi> was crucified, and hung vpon the Croſſe, it is reported by them that were the watch-men about it, that there came a dragon and did wind it ſelfe about his body, and with his head couered the face of the dead King, oftentimes licking the ſame, and not ſuffering any bird to come neere and touch the carkaſſe. For vvhich cauſe there began to be a reuerent opinion of diuinitie attributed to the King, vntill ſuch time as wiſe and prudent men, ſtudious of the truth, found out the true cauſe hereof. For they ſay that as Bees are generated out of the body of Oxen, and Drones of horſes, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> Hornets of Aſſes: ſo doe the bodyes of men ingender out of their marrow a Serpent, and for this cauſe, the Auncients were moued to conſecrate the dragon to noble-ſpirited men, and therefore there was a monument kept of the firſt <hi>Affricanus,</hi> becauſe that vnder an Oliue planted with his owne hand, a dragon was ſaid to preſerue his ghoſt.</p>
            <p>But I will not mingle fables and truth together, and therefore I will reſerue the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall diſcourſe of this beaſt vnto another place; and this which I haue written, may be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to ſatisfie any reaſonable man, that there are winged Serpents and dragons in the world. And I pray God that we neuer haue better arguments to ſatisfie vs, by his corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and liuely preſence in our Country, leaſt ſome great calamity followe there-vppon. Now therefore we will proceed to the loue and hatred of this beaſt, that is obſerued with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> man, and other creatures.</p>
            <p>And firſt of all, although Dragons be naturall enemies to men, like vnto all other Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, yet many times (if there be any truth in ſtory) they haue beene poſſeſſed with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary loue, both to men, women and children, as may appeare by theſe particulers following. There was one <hi>Aleua</hi> a Theſſalian Neatheard, which did keepe oxen in <hi>Oſſa,</hi>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:22894:87"/>
hard by the fountaine <hi>Hemonius,</hi> there was a Dragon fell in loue with this man, for his haire was as yellow as any gold, vnto him for his hayre did this dragon often come, cree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping cloſely as a Louer to his Loue: and when he came vnto him, he would lick his haire and face ſo gently, and in ſo ſweete a manner, as the man profeſſed he neuer felt the like, <note place="margin">Aelianus.</note> ſo as without all feare he conuerſed with him, and as he came, ſo would hee goe away a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, neuer returning to him empty, but bringing ſome one gift or other, ſuch as his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and kind could lay hold on.</p>
            <p>There was a Dragon alſo which loued <hi>Pindus</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Macedo</hi> King of <hi>Emathia:</hi> This <hi>Pindus</hi> hauing many Brothers moſt wicked and lewd perſons, and he onely beeing a valiant man of honeſt diſpoſition, hauing likewiſe a comly and goodly perſonage, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> the trechery of his bretheren againſt him, bethought himſelfe how to auoyd theyr hands and tyrannie. Now foraſmuch as hee knew that the kingdome which hee poſſeſſed, was the onely marke they all ſhot at, he thought it better to leaue that to them, and ſo to ridde himſelfe from enuy, feare and perrill, then to embrew his hands in theyr blood, or to looſe his life and kingdome both together. Wherefore hee renounced and gaue ouer the gouernment, and betooke himſelfe to the exerciſe of hunting, for he was a ſtrong man, fit to combat with wilde-beaſtes, by deſtruction of whom, hee made more roome for many men vppon the earth, ſo that hee paſſed all his dayes in that exerciſe. It hapned on a day that he was hunting of a Hind-calfe, and ſpurring his horſe with all his might and maine in the eager purſute thereof, hee rode out of the ſight of all his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> and ſuddainely the Hind-calfe leaped into a very deepe Caue, out of the ſight of <hi>Pindus</hi> the Hunter, and ſo ſaued himſelfe. Then he alighted from his horſe and tyed him to the next Tree, ſeeking out as diligently as he could for a way into the Caue, wherein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Hind-calfe had leaped: and when he had looked a good while about him, &amp; could find none, he heard a voyce ſpeaking vnto him, and forbidding him to touch the Hind-calfe, which made him looke about againe, to ſee if hee could perceiue the perſon from whom the voyce proceeded, but eſpying none, hee grew to be afraide, and thought that the voyce proceeded from ſome other greater cauſe, and ſo leaped vpon his horſe haſtily, and departed againe to his fellowes.</p>
            <p>The day after, he returned to the ſame place, and when he came thether, beeing terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> with the remembrance of the former voyce, hee durſt not enter into the place, but ſtoode there doubting and wondering with himſelfe, what Shepheards, or Hunters, or other men might be in that place, to diſwarne him from his game, and therefore he went round about to ſeeke for ſome, or to learne from whence the voyce proceeded. While he was thus ſeeking, there appeared vnto him a Dragon of a great ſtature, creeping vpon the greateſt part of his body, except his necke and head lifted vp a little, and that little was as high as the ſtature of any man can reach, and in this faſhion hee made toward <hi>Pindus,</hi> who at the firſt ſight was not a little afraid of him, but yet did not runne away, but rather gathering his wits together, remembred that hee had about him birds, and diuers parts of ſacrifices, which inſtantly he gaue vnto the dragon, and ſo mitigated his furie by theſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> gyfts, and as it were with a royall feaſt, changed the cruell nature of the dragon, into kind vſage. For the Dragon beeing ſmoothed ouer with theſe gyfts, and as it were ouer-taken with the liberality of <hi>Pindus,</hi> was contented to forſake the old place of his habitation, and to goe away with him. <hi>Pindus</hi> alſo beeing no leſſe gladde of the company of the Dragon, did daily giue vnto him the greateſt part of his hunting, as a deſerued price and ranſome of his life, and conqueſt of ſuch a beaſt. Neither was hee vnrequired for it, for Fortune ſo fauoured his game, that whether he hunted foules of the ayre, or beaſtes of the earth, hee ſtill obtayned and neuer miſſed. So that his fame for hunting, procured him more loue and honour, then euer could the Imperiall crowne of his Country.</p>
            <p>For all young men deſired to follow him, admiring his goodly perſonage &amp; ſtrength, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> the virgins and maydes falling in loue, contended among themſelues who ſhould marry him: the wiues forſaking their husbands, contrary to all womanly modeſtie, rather deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his company the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſocietie of their husbands, or to be preferred among the number of the Goddeſſes. Onely his Bretheren inraged againſt him, ſought all meanes to kill &amp; deſtroy him. Therfore they watched all opportunities, lying in continuall ambuſh where
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:22894:88" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he hunted, to accompliſh theyr accurſed enterpriſe, which at laſt they obtained: for as he followed the game, they encloſed him in a narrow ſtraight neere to a Riuers ſide, vvhere he had no meanes to auoyde their hands, they and their company beeing many, and hee alone, wherefore they drew out their ſwords and ſlew him.</p>
            <p>When he ſaw no remedy but death, he cryed out aloude for help, whoſe voyce ſoone came to the eares of the watchfull Dragon, (for no beaſt heareth or ſeeth better) out hee commeth from his denne, and finding the murtherers ſtanding about the dead body, he preſently ſurpriſed them and killed them, ſo reuenging the quarrell of <hi>Pindus,</hi> &amp; then fell vpon the dead body of his friend, neuer forſaking the cuſtodie thereof, vntill the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours adioyning to the place, taking knowledge of the fact, came to burie the bodies. But <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> when they came and ſaw the Dragon among them, they were afraid, and durſt not come neere, but ſtoode a farre off, conſulting what to doe; till at laſt they perceiued that the dragon beganne to take knowledge of their feare, who with an admirable curteſie of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, perceiuing their mourning and lamentation for their dead friend, and withall, their abſtinence from approching to execute his exequies, or funeralls, began to thinke that he might be the cauſe of this their terror, &amp; farre ſtanding off from the dead bodies, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he departed, taking his farewell of the body which he loued, and ſo gaue them leaue by his abſence, to beſtow vpon him an honourable buriall, which they performed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, and the Riuer adioyning, was named by the name of <hi>Pindus-death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By which ſtory may appeare, that theſe ſauage Dragons are made louing and tame to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> men, by good turnes &amp; benefites beſtowed vpon them, for there is no nature which may not be ouer-come by kindnes. And yet I may not leaue this matter thus, nor from theſe two examples alone, conclude the practiſe and poſſibility of loue betwixt men and dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons: I will therefore adde ſome three or foure examples more.</p>
            <p>There was a Dragon the louer of <hi>Aetholis</hi> (as <hi>Plutarch</hi> writeth) who came vnto her e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery night, and did her body no harme, but gently ſlyding ouer her, played with her till morning, then alſo would he depart away as ſoone as light appeared, that hee might not be eſpyed. The Maydens friends came to the knowledge heereof, and ſo remooued her farre away, to the intent the dragon might come no more at her: and thus they remained aſunder a great while, the dragon earneſtly ſeeking for the mayden, wandered farre and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> neere to find her out. At laſt he met with her, and not ſaluting her gently as he was wont, <note place="margin">Gillius.</note> flew vppon her, binding her hands downe with the ſpire of his body, hiſſing ſoftly in her face, &amp; beating gently with his tayle her back-parts, as it were taking a moderate reuenge vpon her, for the neglect of his loue by her long abſence.</p>
            <p>Another like ſtory vnto this is reported by <hi>Elianus,</hi> of a great Dragon which loued a fayre woman, beloued alſo of a fayre man, the woman oftentimes did ſleepe with this dragon, but not ſo willingly as with the man: wherefore ſhee forſooke the habitation of her place for a month, and went away where the dragon could not find her, thinking that her abſence might quench his deſire. But he came often to the place where hee was wont to meete with the woman, and not finding her, returned quietly backe againe, and came <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> againe another time: at laſt he grew ſuſpicious, &amp; like a louer fayling in his expectation, grew very ſorrowfull, and ſo continued till the month was exſpyred, euery night viſiting the accuſtomed place. At laſt the woman returned, and the dragon preſently mette with her, and in an amourous faſhion, full of ſuſpition and iealouſie, winding about her body, did beate her as you haue heard in the former ſtorie: and this (ſaith <hi>Elianus)</hi> happened in <hi>Iudea,</hi> in the dayes of <hi>Herod</hi> the King.</p>
            <p>There was a little Dragon-whelpe bredde in <hi>Arcadia,</hi> and brought vp familiarly with a little boy from his infancie, vntill the boy became a young man, and the dragon alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came of great ſtature, ſo that one of them loued another ſo well as man and beaſt could loue together, or rather two play-fellowes from the Cradle. At laſt the friends of the boy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> ſeeing the dragon grow ſo great in ſo ſhort a ſpace, began to be ſuſpicious of him, where-vpon they tooke the bedde wherein the boy and the dragon were lodged, and carried the ſame into a farre remote place of woods and wildernes, and there ſet downe the bed with the boy and the dragon together. The boy after a little while returned, and came home againe to his friends; the dragon wandered vp and downe in the woods, feeding vpon
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:22894:88" rendition="simple:additions"/>
herbes and poyſon, according to his nature, and neuer more cared for the habitation of men, but reſted contented with a ſolitary life. In the length of time it came to paſſe that the boy grew to be a perfect man, and the dragon alſo remained in the wood; &amp; although abſent one from the other, yet mutually louing as well as euer. It hapned that this young man trauelled through that place where the dragon was lodged, and fell among theeues, when the young man ſaw their ſwords about his eares, he cryed out, &amp; the dragons den beeing not farre off, his cry came to the dragons cares, who inſtantly knowing the voyce of his play-fellow, anſwered the ſame with another, at whoſe hyſſing the theeues grew a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid, and began to runne away, but their legges could not carry them ſo faſt, as to eſcape the dragons teeth and clawes; for he came ſpeedily to releaſe his friend, &amp; all the theeues <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> that he could find, he put to cruell death, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did he accompany his friend out of the place of perrill, and returned backe againe to his den, neither remembering wrath, for that hee was expoſed to the Wilderneſſe, and there left by his play-fellow, nor yet like peruerſe men, forſaking their olde friend in danger.</p>
            <p>They that deſire to reade more of this ſubiect, ſhall finde ſtore of examples in <hi>Elianus</hi> his ſixt and thirteene bookes. To conclude, when <hi>Meſſalina</hi> the wife of <hi>Claudius,</hi> did ſend certaine men to take away the life of <hi>Nero,</hi> who was a riuall of <hi>Britanicus,</hi> it is ſaide, that when they had him in their hands to ſtrangle him, a dragon appeared out of the earth, or floore of the chamber, and did ſo terrifie theſe hangmen, that they ranne away &amp; ſpared <hi>Neros</hi> life. By which example, another example of pietie in dragons is obſerued. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/>

I will adde but this one example more of their loue of chaſtitie in men and women.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Lauinium</hi> there was a great holy wood, neere vnto which ſtood a Temple of <hi>Iuno,</hi> in that wood there was a great deepe denne of a dragon, vnto the which dragon the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> came euery yeere beeing blind-folded with clouts, and carrying Marchpanes in their hands: When they entred the wood, there was a certaine ſpirit (as it was ſaid) without offence did leade them to the denne of the dragon, and ſo euery one of the virgins did ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerally offer vp their Marchpanes to the dragon: the dragon receiued the Marchpane at the hand of euery pure virgine and vnſpotted, but if they were defiled, and held onely the name of Virgins, then the dragon refuſed the Marchpane, and therefore they were all examined at their comming forth, that thoſe which had loſt their virginity might be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed by the Law. And by this ſtory, (although none but Heathens will beleeue it to be true, becauſe it is a fable, meerely inuented to defend Idolatry, which with my ſoule and ſpirit I doe deteſt) yet I may collect thus much as a morrall out of fable, that dragons in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> auncient time, did honour virginity. And thus ſeeing they neither loue, nor are beloued of any other creature, I will heere leaue to talke of their loue and friendſhip, and paſſe on to their hatred and aduerſaries.</p>
            <p>The examples before expreſſed beeing all extraordinary &amp; beſide nature, do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude but that there is an ordinary hatred betwixt men and dragons, and therefore in the diſcourſe of their enemies, men muſt haue the firſt place, as their moſt worthy aduerſarie, for both dragons haue perriſhed by men, and men by dragons, as may appeare by theſe ſtories following. When the Region of <hi>Heluetta</hi> beganne firſt to be purged from noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome beaſts, there was a horrible dragon found neere a Country towne called <hi>Wilſer,</hi> who did deſtroy all men and beaſtes that came within his danger in the time of his hunger, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that that Towne and the fields there-to adioyning, was called <hi>Dedwiler,</hi> that is, a Village of the Wildernes, for all the people and inhabitants, had forſaken the ſame, &amp; fledde to others places.</p>
            <p>There was a man of that Towne whoſe name was <hi>Winckelriedt,</hi> who was baniſhed for manſlaughter, this man promiſed if he might haue his pardon, and be reſtored againe to <note place="margin">Stumpſius</note>
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:22894:89" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his former inheritance, that he would combat with that Dragon, and by Gods helpe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy him: which thing was granted vnto him with great ioyfulnes. Wherefore he was recalled home, and in the preſence of many people went foorth to fight with the dragon, whom he flow and ouercame, whereat for ioy hee lifted vppe his ſword imbrued in the dragons blood, in token of victory, but the blood diſtilled downe from the ſword vppon his body, and cauſed him inſtantly to fall downe dead. And thus this noble Conquerour, a man worthy to be remembred in all ages &amp; Nations, who had ſtrength to kill the dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon beeing aliue, yet had no power to reſiſt the venome of his blood, he being dead. But had it not beene that his hand had beene before imbrewed in the blood of a man, I do not beleeue that the blood of a dragon could haue fallen ſo heauy vppon him. But this is the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> iudgement of GOD, eyther to puniſh murder in the ſame kind, or elſe to teach vs, that we ſhould not reioyce in our owne merrits, leaſt God ſee it and be angry. For our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our <hi>Christ</hi> forbade his Diſciples that they ſhould reioyce that the deuils were ſubiect vnto them; and therefore much leſſe may we poore creatures reioyce for ouer-comming men or beaſts.</p>
            <p>And yet one thing more is to bee conſidered in the death of this man, who was bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed for killing a man, and was pardoued for killing a dragon, and yet killed by the dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon after the dragon was ſlaine. Thus blood was the ſinne becauſe it brought death, and death againe brought blood to be the reuenger of the firſt, that the blood of man might be waſhed away with the blood of man, the blood of a Serpent comming betwixt. And <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> thus I may truly ſay as the Chriſtian Poet ſaith in another caſe, <hi>Sanguine ſuc creuit, ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine finis erit,</hi> as it grew, ſo ſhall it end in blood.</p>
            <p>In the dayes of <hi>Phillip</hi> King of <hi>Macedon,</hi> there was a way into a Mountaine of <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> ouer which the King had prayed, that neuer man might goe but he might die: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">Ariſtotle</note>

It is thought that ſuch a one was the Serpent that deceiued <hi>Eue,</hi> for <hi>Beda</hi> ſaith it had a Virgins countenaunce, and therfore the woman ſeeing the likenes of her owne face, was the more eaſily drawne to belieue it: into the which when the deuill had entred, they ſay he taught <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> it to couer the body with leaues, and to ſhew nothing but the head and face. But this fable is not worthy to be refuted, becauſe the Scripture it ſelfe dooth directly gaine-ſay euerie part of it. For firſt of all it is called a Serpent, and if it had beene a dragon, <hi>Moſes</hi> vvould haue ſaid ſo, and therefore for ordinary puniſhment, God doth appoint it to creepe vpon the belly, wherefore it is not likely that it had either winges or feete. Secondly, it was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible and vnlikely, that any part of the body was couered or conceited from the ſight of the woman, ſeeing ſhe knew it directly to be a Serpent, as afterward ſhee confeſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore GOD and her husband.</p>
            <p>There be alſo certaine little dragons called in Arabia, <hi>Veſga,</hi> and in <hi>Catalonia,</hi> dragons of houſes, theſe when they bite, leaue their teeth behind them, ſo as the wound neuer cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerh <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> ſwelling as long as the teeth remaine therein, and therefore for the better cure there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the teeth are drawne forth, and ſo the wound will ſoone be healed. And thus much for the hatred betwixt men and dragons, now we will proceede to other creatures.</p>
            <p>The greateſt diſcord is betwixt the Eagle and the Dragon, for the Vultures, Eagles, Swannes and dragons, are enemies one to another. The Eagles when they ſhake theyr

winges, make the dragons afraide with their ratling noyſe, then the dragon hideth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe within his den, ſo that he neuer fighteth but in the ayre, eyther when the Eagle hath taken away his young ones, and he to recouer them flieth aloft after her, or elſe whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Eagle meeteth him in her neſt, deſtroying her egges and young ones: for the Eagle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoureth the dragons and little Serpents vpon earth, and the dragons againe and Serpents doe the like againſt the Eagles in the ayre. Yea many times the dragon attempteth to take away the prey out of the Eagles talants, both on the ground and in the ayre, ſo that there ariſeth betwixt them a very hard and dangerous fight, which is in this manner deſcribed by <hi>Ni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In the next place we are to conſider the enmitie that is betwixt Dragons &amp; Elephants, for ſo great is their hatred one to the other, that in Ethyopia the greateſt dragons haue no other name but Elephant-killers. Among the Indians alſo the ſame hatred remaineth, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> whom the dragons haue many ſubtile inuentions: for beſides the great length of their bodies, where-withall they claſpe and begirt the body of the Elephant, continually byting of him vntill he fall downe dead, and in the which fall they are alſo bruzed to pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; for the ſafegard of themſelues they haue this deuice. They get and hide themſelues in trees, couering their head, and letting the other part hang downe like a rope: in thoſe trees they watch vntill the Elephant come to eate and croppe of the branches, then ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly before he be aware; they leape into his face, and digge out his eyes, then doe they claſpe themſelues about his necke, and with their tayles or hinder parts, beate and vexe the Elephant, vntill they haue made him breatheleſle, for they ſtrangle him with theyr fore-parts, as they beate them with the hinder, ſo that in this combat they both perriſh: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> and this is the diſpoſition of the dragon, that he neuer ſetteth vpon the Elephant, but with the aduantage of the place, and namely from ſome high tree or Rocke.</p>
            <p>Sometimes againe a multitude of dragons doe together obſerue the pathes of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants, and croſſe thoſe pathes they tye together their tailes as it were in knots, ſo that when the Elephant commeth along in them, they inſnare his legges, and ſuddainly leape
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:22894:90"/>
vppe to his eyes, for that is the part they ayme aboue all other, which they ſpeedily pull out, and ſo not beeing able to doe him any more harme, the poore beaſt deliuereth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe from preſent death by his owne ſtrength, and yet through his blindneſſe receiued in that combat, hee perriſheth by hunger, becauſe hee cannot chooſe his meate by ſmelling, but by his eye-ſight.</p>
            <p>There is no man liuing that is able to giue a ſufficient reaſon of this contrariety in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture betwixt the Elephant &amp; the Dragon, although many men haue laboured their wits, and ſtrayned their inuentions to finde out the true cauſes thereof, but all in vaine, except this be one that followeth. The Elephants blood is ſaide to be the coldeſt of all other Beaſts, and for this cauſe it is thought by moſt Writers, that the dragons in the Sommer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> time doe hide themſelues in great plenty in the waters where the Elephant commeth to drinke, and then ſuddenly they leape vppe vppon his eares, becauſe thoſe places cannot be defended with his truncke, and there they hang faſt, and ſucke out all the blood of his body, vntill ſuch time as hee poore beaſt through faintneſſe fall downe and die, and they beeing drunke with his blood, doe likewiſe perriſh in the fall.</p>
            <p>The Gryffins are likewiſe ſaid to fight with the dragons and ouer-come them. The Panther alſo is an enemy vnto the Dragons, and driueth them many times into theyr dennes. There is a little bird called <hi>Captilus,</hi> by eating of which the dragon refreſheth himſelfe when he is wearied in hunting of other beaſts. And to conclude, he is an enemy vnto all kinde of Beaſtes, both wilde and tame, as may appeare by theſe verſes of <hi>Lucan,</hi>

            <p>In the next place I will paſſe vnto the poyſon and venome of dragons, omitting all poeticall diſcourſes about the worſhipping and tranſmutation of dragons from one kind to another, ſuch as are the haires of <hi>Orpheus,</hi> or the teeth of the dragon which <hi>Cadmus</hi> ſlew, into Armed-men, and ſuch like fables, which haue no ſhew nor apparance of truth, but are onely the inuentions of men, to vtter thoſe things in obſcure termes, which they were afraid to doe in plaine ſpeeches.</p>
            <p>It is a queſtion whether dragons haue any venom or poyſon in them, for it is thought that he hurteth more by the wound of his teeth, then by his poyſon. Yet in Deuteron. 22. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaketh of them as if they had poyſon, ſaying: Their wine is as the poyſon of dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> and the cruell venome of Aſpes. So alſo <hi>Heliodorus</hi> ſpeaketh of certaine weapons dipped in the poyſon of dragons. For which cauſe wee are to conſider, that they wanting poyſon in themſelues, become venomous two maner of wayes: Firſt by the place wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they liue, for in the hoter Countries they are more apt to doe harme then in the colder and more temperate, which cauſed the Poet in his verſes to write of them in this manner following;</p>

               </gap>or called <hi>Draco volans,</hi> a Fire-drake, which doth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie times deſtroy the fruites of the earth, ſeeming to be a certaine burning fire in the ayre, ſometime on the Sea, and ſometime on the Land, whereof I haue heard this credible ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie from men of good worth and reputation, happening about ſome twelue yeeres agoe, vpon the Weſterne-Seas, vpon the Coaſtes of England, which becauſe it is well worthy to be kept in rememberance of all poſteritie, and containeth in it a notable worke of God, I haue thought good to ſette it downe in this place.</p>
            <p>There was an olde Fiſher-man which with his two hyred ſeruaunts went forth to take fiſh, according to his accuſtomed manner and occupation, and hauing layd theyr nettes, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> watched them earneſtly to finde the bootie they came for, and ſo they continued in theyr labour vntill mid-night or there abouts, taking nothing. At the laſt there came by them a Fire-drake, at the ſight whereof the old-man beganne to be much troubled and afrayde, telling his ſeruaunts, that thoſe ſights ſildome pretended any good, and therefore prayed God to turne away all euill from them, and withall, willed his ſeruaunts to take vp their Nettes, leaſt they did all repent it afterward; for he ſaid he had knowne much euill follow ſuch apparitions.</p>
            <p>The young men his ſeruaunts comforted him, telling him there was no cauſe of feare, and that they had already committed themſelues into the handes of Almightie GOD, vnder whoſe protection they would tarry vntil they had taken ſome fiſh: the old man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> contented with their confidence, and rather yeelded vnto them, then was perſwaded by them. A little while after, the fire-drake came againe, and compaſſed round about the boate, and ranne ouer the Nettes, ſo that new f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Wherefore they then reſolued to ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie no longer, but haſted to take vp their nettes, and to be gone. And taking vppe theyr Nettes, at one place they did hang ſo faſt as without breaking they could not pull them out of the water, wher<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fore they ſette theyr Grabbe-hookes vnto them to looſe them, for the day before they remembred that a Shippe was caſt away in the ſame place, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they thought that it might be the Nettes were hanged vppon ſome of the tacklings thereof: and therein they were not much deceiued, for it happened that finding the place <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> where-vppon the Net did ſtay, they pulled and found ſome difficultie to remoue it, but at laſt they pulled it vp, and found it to be a chayre of beaten gold. At the ſight hereof their ſpirits were a little reuiued, becauſe they had attayned ſo rich a bootie, and yet like men burdened with wealth, (eſpecially the old-man,) conceiued newe feares, and wiſhed hee were on Land, leaſt ſome ſtorme ſhould fall, and lay both it and them, the ſecond time in the bottome of the Sea.</p>
            <p>So great is the impreſſion of feare, and the naturall preſage of euill, in men that knowe but little in things to come, that many times they proue true Prophets of their owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, although they haue little reaſon till the moment of perrill come vppon them: and ſo it fell out accordingly in this old-man, for whilſt hee feared death by ſtormes and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> tempeſts on the Sea, it came vpon him, but by another way and meanes. For behold the deuill entred into the harts of his two ſeruants, &amp; they conſpired together to kill the old-man their Maiſter, that ſo betweene themſelues they might be owners of that great rich chayre, the value whereof (as they conceiued) might make them Gentlemen, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine them in ſome other Country all the dayes of their life. For ſuch was the reſolution that they conceiued vpon the preſent, that it would not be ſafe for them to retu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

So that not giuing him any war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his death, one of them in moſt ſauage and cruell manner daſhed out his braines, and the other ſpeedily caſt him into the Sea. And thus the feare of this old-man, concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued without all reaſon, except ſuperſtition for the ſight of a fire-drake, came vpon him in a more bloody manner then hee expected: but life ſuſpected itſelfe, and rumors of perrill
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:22894:91"/>
vnto guiltie conſciences, (ſuch as all wee mortall men beare) are many times as forcible as the ſentence of a Iudge to the hart of the condemned priſoner, and therefore it vvere happy that either we could not feare, except when the cauſes are certaine, or elſe that wee might neuer perriſh but vpon premonition. And therefore I conclude with the example of this man, that it is not good to holde a ſuperſtitious feare, leaſt God ſee it, and beeing angry there-with, bring vppon vs the euill which wee feare. But this is not the end of the ſtory, for that fire-drake, (as by the ſequell appeareth) prooued as euill to the ſeruaunts, as he did to the Maiſter.</p>
            <p>Theſe two ſonnes of the deuill, made thus rich by the death of their Maiſter, foorth-with they ſayled towards the Coaſts of Fraunce, but firſt of all they broke the Chayre in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> peeces, and wrapped it vppe in one of theyr Nettes, making account that it was the beſt fiſh that euer was taken in that Net, and ſo they layde it in one end of theyr Barcke or fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſher-boate. And thus they laboured all that night and the next day, till three or foure of the clocke, at what time they eſpied a Port of Brittaine, whereof they were exceeding gladde, by reaſon that they were wearie, hungry, and thirſtie with long labour, alvvaies rich in their owne conceit by the gold which they had gotten, which had ſo drawne their harts from God, as they could not feare any thought of his iudgement; And finallie it ſo blinded theyr eyes, and ſtopped theyr eares, that they did not ſee the vengeance that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them, nor heare the cry of theyr Maiſters-blood.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, as they were thus reioycing at the ſight of Land, behold they ſuddainely <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> eſpyed a Man-of-Warre comming towards them, whereat they were appalled, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to thinke with themſelues that theyr rich hopes were now at an end, and they had laboured for other, but yet reſolued to die rather then to ſuffer the bootie to be taken from them. And while they thus thought, the Man-of-Warre approched and hailed them, ſummoning them to come in and ſhew what they were: they refuſed, making forward as faſt to the Land as they could. Wherefore the Man-of-warre ſhot certaine Muskets at them, and not preuailing, nor they yeelding, ſent after them his Long-boate, vppon the enterance whereof they fought manfully againſt the aſſaylants, vntill one of them vvas ſlaine, and the other mortallie wounded; who ſeeing his fellow kild, &amp; himſelfe not like, lie to liue, yet in enuy againſt his enemy, ranne preſently to the place where the Chayre <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> lay in the Nette, and lyfting the ſame vp with all his might, caſt it from him into the Sea, inſtantly falling downe after that fact, as one not able through weakeneſſe to ſtand any longer, wherevppon he was taken, and before his life left him, hee related the whole ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to them that tooke him, earneſtly deſiring the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſignifie ſo much into England, which they did accordingly: and as I haue heard, the whole ſtory was printed, &amp; ſo this ſecond Hiſtory of the puniſhment of murder, I haue related in this place, by occaſion of the fire-drake, in the hiſtory of the Dragon.</p>
            <p>A ſecond cauſe why poyſon is ſuppoſed to be in Dragons, is for that they often feede vppon many venomous rootes, and therfore theyr poyſon ſticketh in theyr teeth, where-vppon many times the partie bytten by them, ſeemeth to be poyſoned; but this falleth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> out accidentally, not from the nature of the dragon, but from the nature of the meate which the dragon eateth. And this is it which <hi>Homer</hi> knewe and affirmed in his verſes, when hee deſcribed a dragon making his denne neere vnto the place where many veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous rootes and herbes grew, and by eating whereof, hee greatly annoyeth man-kinde when hee byteth them.</p>

            <p>Their mouth is ſmall, and by reaſon thereof they cannot open it wide to byte deepe, ſo as their byting maketh no great paine; and thoſe kind of dragons which do principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie fight with Eagles, are defended more with their tayles then with their teeth: but yet <note place="margin">Aetius.

            <p>The cure hereof, is like to the cure for the byting of any other beaſt wherin there is no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> venome, and for this cauſe there muſt be nothing applyed there-vnto which cureth veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous bytings, but rather ſuch things as are ordinary in the cure of euery Vlcer.</p>
            <p>The ſeede of graſſe, commonly called Hay-duſt, is preſcribed againſt the byting of dragons. The Barble beeing rubbed vppon the place where a Scorpion of the earth, a Spyder, a Sea or Land-dragon byteth, doth perfectly cure the ſame. Alſo the heade of a dogge or dragon which hath bytten any one, beeing cutte off and fleyed, and applyed to the wound with a little <hi>Euphorbium,</hi> is ſaid to cure the wound ſpeedily.</p>
            <p>And if <hi>Albediſimon</hi> be the ſame that is a dragon, then according to the opinion of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uicen,</hi> the cure of it muſt be very preſent, as in the cure of Vlcers. And if <hi>Alhatraf</hi> &amp; <hi>Hau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem</hi> be of the kind of dragons, then after theyr byting there followeth great coldnes and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> ſtupiditie; and the cure thereof muſt be the ſame meanes which is obſerued in colde poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. For which cauſe, the wound or place bitten, muſt be embrewed or waſhed with luke-warme Vineger, and emplaiſtered with the leaues of Bay, annoynted with the oyle of herbe-<hi>Mary,</hi> and the oyle of Wilde-pellitory, or ſuch things as are drawne out of thoſe oyles, wherein is the vertue of Nettles, or Sea-Onyons.</p>
            <p>But thoſe thinges which are giuen vnto the patient to drinke, muſt be the iuyce of Bay-leaues in Vineger, or elſe equall portions of Myrrhe, Pepper, and Rewe in Wine, the powder or duſt whereof, muſt be the full vveight of a golden-groat, or as we ſay, a French-Crovvne.</p>
            <p>In the next place, for the concluſion of the hiſtory of the dragon, we will take our fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> of him in the recitall of his medicinall vertues, which are briefely theſe that follow. Firſt, the fatte of a Dragon dryed in the ſunne, is good againſt creeping Vlcers: and the ſame mingled with Hony and Oyle, helpeth the dimneſſe of the eyes at the beginning. The head of a dragon keepeth one from looking a ſquint: and if it be ſette vp at the gates and dores, it hath beene thought in auncient time to be very fortunate to the ſincere wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:22894:92"/>
of GOD. The eyes beeing kept till they be ſtale, and afterwards beate into an Oyle with Hony and made into an oyntment, keepe any one that vſeth it from the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of night-viſions and appariſions.</p>
            <p>The fatte of a Hart in the skinne of a Roe, bound with the nerues of a Hart vnto the ſhoulder, was thought to haue a vertue to fore-ſhew the iudgement of victories to come. The firſt ſpindle by bearing of it, procureth an eaſie paſſage for the pacification of higher powers. His teeth bound vnto the feete of a Roe, with the nerues of a Hart, haue the ſame power. But of all other, there is no folly comparable to the compoſition which the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitians draw out of a dragon to make one invincible, and that is this. They take the head and tayle of a dragon, with the hayres out of the fore-head of a Lyon, and the marrow of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> a Lyon, the ſpume or white mouth of a conquering horſe, bound vppe in a Harts-skinne, together with a clawe of a dogge, and faſtned with the croſſe nerues or ſinew of a Hart, or of a Roe; they ſay that this hath as much power to make one invincible, as hath anie medicine or remedy whatſoeuer.</p>
            <p>The fatte of dragons is of ſuch vertue that it driueth away venomous beaſtes. It is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo reported, that by the tongue or gall of a dragon ſodde in wine, men are deliuered from the ſpirits of the night, called <hi>Incubi</hi> and <hi>Succubi,</hi> or elſe Night-mares. But aboue all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts, the vſe of theyr blood is accounted moſt notable. But whether the <hi>Cynnabaris</hi> be the ſame which is made of the blood of the dragons and Elephants, collected from the earth when the dragon and the Elephant fall downe dead together, accordings as <hi>Pliny</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> deliuereth, I will not heere diſpute, ſeeing it is already done in the ſtory of the Elephant: neither will I write any more of this matter in this place, but onely referre the Reader vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that which hee ſhall finde written thereof in the hiſtory of our former booke of Foure-footed-beaſtes.</p>
            <p>And if that ſatisfie him not, let him read <hi>Langius</hi> in the firſt booke of his Epiſtles, and ſixtie-fiue Epistle, where that learned man doth abundantly ſatisfie all men concerning this queſtion, that are ſtudious of the truth, and not prone to contention. And to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, <hi>Andreas Baluacenſis</hi> writeth, that the Blood-ſtone, called the <hi>Haematite,</hi> is made of the dragons blood: and thus I will conclude the hiſtory of the dragon, with this ſtorie following out of <hi>Porphyrius,</hi> concerning the good ſucceſſe which hath beene ſignified vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> men and women, eyther by the dreames or ſight of dragons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mammea</hi> the Mother of <hi>Alexander Seuerus</hi> the Emperour, the night before his birth, dreamed that ſhe brought forth a little dragon, ſo alſo did <hi>Olympia</hi> the Mother of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> the great, and <hi>Pomponya,</hi> the Mother of <hi>Scipio Affricanus.</hi> The like prodigie gaue <hi>Augustus</hi> hope that he ſhould be Emperor. For when his mother <hi>Actia</hi> came in the night time vnto the Temple of <hi>Apollo,</hi> and had ſette downe her bedde or couch in the Temple among other Matrons, ſuddainely ſhee fell aſleepe, and in her ſleepe, ſhee dreamed that a dragon came to her, and claſped about her bodie, and ſo departed without dooing her any harme. Afterwards the print of a dragon remained perpetually vppon her belly, ſo as ſhee neuer durſt any more be ſeene in any bath. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/>
            </p>
            <p>The Emperour <hi>Tyberius Caeſar,</hi> had a dragon which hee daily fedde with his owne handes, and nouriſhed like good fortune, at the laſt it happened that this dragon was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced with the byting of Emmets, and the former beautie of his body much obſcured: Wherefore the Emperour grewe greatly amazed thereat, &amp; demaunding a reaſon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of of the Wiſemen, hee was by them admoniſhed to beware the inſurrection of the common people. And thus with theſe ſtories, repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting good and euill by the dragon, I will take my leaue of this good and euill Serpent. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/>

Within the ſcales of this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> there are bred certaine Flyes with yellow winges, as yellow as any Braſſe, the which Flyes at length do cate and deſtroy the ſerpent that breedeth them. The colour of theyr <note place="margin">Aetius.</note> backe is blackiſh, and not white as ſome haue thought, and the ſauour or ſmell comming from them like to the ſmell of a Horſes hide, wet as it commeth out of the pit, to be ſhauen by the hand of the Tawyer or Glouer.

And likewiſe he ſaith, that he ſaw a skinne of one of theſe ſtuffed with hayre, which did equall in quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity the legge of a great man. The head of this beaſt is broad and flat, and <hi>Olaus Magnus</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> writeth, that many times, and in many places of the North, about the beginning of ſummer, theſe Serpents are found in great companies vnder Oakes, one of them beeing their head or Captaine, who is known by a white creſt or comb on the top of his crowne, whom all the reſidue do follow, as the Bees doe their King and Captaine. And theſe by the relation of old men are thought to beget a certaine ſtone, by their mutable breathing vpon ſome venomous matter, found in the trees leaues, or earth where they abide: For they abide not onely in the rootes, but in the hollow bodies of the trees, and ſometimes for their meate and foode, they leaue their habitation, and diſcend into the Fennes and Marſhes to hunt Frogges: and if at any time they bee aſſaulted with the Horſe-flye, they inſtantly returne backe againe into their former habitation. When they goe vppon the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> earth, they go directly or ſtraight, for if they ſhould wind themſelues to run, they would make an offenſiue noyſe, or rather yeeld a more offenſiue ſmell: according to theſe verſes of the Poet <hi>Lucan;</hi>

The nature of this Serpent is very venemous and hot, and therefore it is worthily pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced among the firſt degree or ranke of Serpentes, for the ſmell thereof dooth ſo ſtupifie a man, as it doth near ſtrangle him, for nature refuſeth to breath, rather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to draw in ſuch a filthy ayre.

            <p>In the next place wee are to conſider the diuerſity and kindes of Frogges, as they are diſtinguiſhed by the place of their abode: for the greateſt difference is drawn from thence; ſome of them therefore are Water-Frogges, and ſome are Frogges of the Land: the Water-Frogges liue both in the water and on the Land, in Marſhes, ſtanding-pooles, running ſtreames, and bankes of Ryuers, but neuer in the Sea; and therefore <hi>Rana Marina</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> is to be vnderſtood of a Fiſh, and not a Frog, as <hi>Maſſarius</hi> hath learnedly prooued againſt <hi>Marcellus.</hi> The frogs of the land are diſtinguiſhed by their liuing in gardens, in Meddows, in hollow Rockes, and among fruites: all which ſeuerall differences ſhall be afterward ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, with their pictures in their due places: here onely I purpoſe to talke of the vulgar and common frogge, whoſe picture with her young one is formerly expreſſed. Beſides theſe differ in generation: for ſome of them are engendered by carnall copulation, &amp; ſome of the ſlime and rottenneſſe of the earth. Some are of a greene colour, and thoſe are ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in Germany and in Flanders; ſome againe are yellow, and ſome of an Aſhe-colour, ſome ſpotted, and ſome blacke, and in outward forme and faſhion they reſemble a Toad, but yet they are without venome, and the female is alwaies greater then the male: when <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> the Aegyptians will ſignifie an impudent man, and yet one that hath a good quicke ſight, they picture a frogge, becauſe he liueth continually in the Mire, and hath no bloud in his body, but about his eyes.</p>
            <p>The tongue is proper to this kinde, for the fore-part thereof cleaueth to the mouth, as in a fiſh, and the hinder part to the throat, by which he ſendeth forth his voyce: and this is to bee vnderſtood, that all frogges are mute and drunke, except the greene frogs, and the frogs of the Water, for theſe haue voyces. And many times the voyces of frogs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from the nature of the Countreyes wherein they liue: for once all the frogges in <hi>Macedonia</hi> and <hi>Cyrenia,</hi> were drunke, vntill there were ſome brought thither out of ſome other Countries, as at this day the frogges of <hi>Seriphus</hi> are all drunke, whereuppon came <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> the Prouerb, <hi>Batrachos ec Seriphou,</hi> A frogge of <hi>Seriphus,</hi> becauſe the frogs of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey doe neuer croake, although you carry them into any other Country.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Seriphus</hi> is one of the Iſlands of the <hi>Sporades</hi> in <hi>Greece,</hi> wherein is the Lake called <hi>Pierius,</hi> which doth not runne in the Summer, but onely in the winter, and all the frogs which are caſt into that lake, are perpetually ſilent, and neuer vtter their voyce; whereof there are aſſigned two cauſes, one <hi>Fabulous,</hi> and the other true and naturall. The firſt, the <hi>Seriphians</hi> ſay, that when <hi>Perſeus</hi> returned with the head of <hi>Meduſa,</hi> hauing gone very far till he was weary, layd him downe beſide that lake to ſleep, but the croaking frogs made ſuch a noyſe, as he could take no reſt: Whereat <hi>Perſeus</hi> was much offended; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore prayed <hi>Iupiter</hi> to forbid the frogs from crying, who inſtantly heard his prayer, &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> perpetuall ſilence to the frogs in that water: and this is the <hi>Fabulous</hi> reaſon, being a meere fiction of the Poets.</p>
            <p>The ſecond and more true reaſon is that of <hi>Theophrastus,</hi> who ſaith, that for the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the water: the frogs are not able to cry in that place. The voyce of frogges is ſaid by the Latiniſts to bee <hi>Corare,</hi> and by the Graecians <hi>Ololugon,</hi> peculiar words to ſet forth
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:22894:95"/>
this crying: now becauſe their tongue cleaueth to the pallet of their mouth, and theyr voyce proceedeth but from their throat to their mouth, and the ſpirit is hindered by the tongue, ſo as it cannot proceed directly; therefore it hath two bladders vppon either ſide of the mouth, one which it filleth with wind, and from thence proceedeth the voyce. Now when it croaketh, it putteth his head out of the water, holding the neather lip euen with the water, and the vpper lip aboue the water: and this is the voyce of the male pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoking the female to carnall copulation.</p>
            <p>They haue but very ſmall lungs, &amp; thoſe without bloud, ful of froth like to al other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the water, which do lay egges, and for this cauſe they do neuer thirſt: wherefore alſo Sea-calues and Frogges are able to liue long vnder the Water. They haue a double <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> Liuer, and a very ſmall Melt, their Legges behind are long, which maketh them apt to leape; before they are ſhorter, hauing deuided clawes which are ioyned together, with a thinne broad skinne, that maketh them more apt to ſwimme. The moſt place of their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode is in fennes, or in warme Waters, or in fiſh-pooles: but yellow and Aſhe-coloured frogs abide in Riuers, Lakes, and ſtanding pooles, but in the Winter time they all hyde themſelues in the earth. And therefore it is not true that <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith, that in the VVinter time they are reſolued into ſlyme, and in Summer they reſume againe their firſt bodyes, for they are to be ſeene many times in the winter; eſpecially in thoſe waters that are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer frozen, as <hi>Agrecolaana Mathiolus,</hi> hath ſoundly obſerued, and they haue beene ſeene in certaine running ſtreames, holding ſmall fiſhes in their mouths, as it were ſucking meat <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> out of them.</p>
            <p>Sometimes they enter into their holes in Autumne, before winter, and in the ſpring time come out againe. When with their croaking voyces the Male prouoketh the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall to carnall copulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which he performeth not by the mouth (as ſome haue thought) but by couering her backe: the inſtrument of geneneration meeting in the hinder parts, and this they performe in the night ſeaſon, nature teaching them the modeſty or ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtneſſe of this action: And beſides, in that time they haue more ſecurity to giue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to mutuall imbraces, becauſe of a generall quietneſſe, for men and all other their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries are then at ſleepe and reſt. After their copulation in the waters, there appeareth a thicke Ielly, out of which the young one is found. But the Land-frogges are ingende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> out of Egges, of whom wee diſcourſe at this preſent; and therefore they both ſuffer copulation, lay their egges, and bring forth young ones on the land. When the Egge breaketh or is hatched, there commeth forth a little black thing like a peece of fleſh, which the Latines call <hi>Gyrini,</hi> from the Greeke word <hi>Gyrrinos,</hi> hauing no viſible part of a liuing creature vpon them, beſides their eyes and their tailes, and within ſhort ſpace after their feet are formed, and their taile deuided into two parts, which taile becommeth their hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Legs: wherefore the Aegyptians when they would deſcribe a man that cannot moue himſelfe, and afterwardes recouereth his motion, they decypher him by a frog, hauing his hinder legges. The heads of theſe young <hi>Gyrini,</hi> which we call in Engliſh Horſe-nailes, becauſe they reſemble a Horſe-naile in their ſimilitude, whoſe head is great, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> part ſmall, for with his taile he ſwimmeth. After May they grow to haue feete, and if before that time they bee taken out of the water, they dye, then they beginne to haue foure feete.</p>
            <p>And firſt of all they are of a blacke colour and round, and heereof came the Prouetbe, <hi>Rana Gyrina ſapientior,</hi> wiſer then a Horſe-naile; becauſe through the roudndneſſe and ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lubility of his body, it turneth it ſelfe with wonderfull celerity, which way ſoeuer it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth. Theſe young ones are alſo called by the Graecians <hi>Moluridae, Brutichoi,</hi> and <hi>Batrachi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> but the Latines haue no name for it, except <hi>Ranunculus,</hi> or <hi>Rana Naſcens.</hi> And it is to be remembred, that one frogge layeth an innumerable company of Egges, which cleaue together in the water, in the middle whereof ſhe her ſelfe lodgeth. And thus much may <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> ſuffice for the ordinary procreation of frogges by generation out of Egges. In the next place I muſt alſo ſhew how they are likewiſe ingendered out of the duſt of the earth by warme, aeſtiue, and Summer ſhevvers, whoſe life is ſhort, and there is no vſe of them.</p>

            <p>And of theſe Frogs it is that <hi>Pliny</hi> was to be vnderſtood, when he ſaith, that Frogs in the Winter time are reſolued into ſlyme, and in the Summer they recouer their life and ſubſtaunce againe. It is certaine alſo, that ſometime it raineth frogs, as may appeare by <hi>Philarchus</hi> and <hi>Lembus,</hi> for <hi>Lembus</hi> writeth thus: Once about <hi>Dardania,</hi> and <hi>Paeonia,</hi> it rained frogs in ſuch plentifull meaſure, or rather prodigious manner, that all the houſes and high-waies were filled with them, and the inhabitants did firſt of all kill them, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards perceiuing no benifit thereby, they ſhut their doores againſt them, and ſtopped vp all their lights to exclude the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of their houſes, leauing no paſſage open, ſo much as a frog might creepe into, and yet notwithſtanding all this diligence, their meat ſeething on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> the fire, or ſet on the table, could not be free from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but continually they found frogs in it, ſo as at laſt they were inforced to forſake that Countrey. It was likewiſe reported, that certaine <hi>Indians</hi> &amp; people of Arabia, were inforced to forſake their countries through the multitude of frogs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cardan</hi> ſeemeth to find a reaſon in nature for this raining of frogges, the which for the better ſatisfaction of the Reader, I will here expreſſe as followeth: <hi>Fiunt haec omnia ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torum ira,</hi> and ſo forward in his 16. booke <hi>De ſubtilitate,</hi> that is to ſay; theſe prodigious raines of frogs and Mice, little Fiſhes and ſtones, and ſuch like thinges is not to be wonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at: for it commeth to paſſe by the rage of the winds in the tops of the Mountaines, or the vppermoſt part of the Seas, which many times taketh vp the duſt of the earth, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealeth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> them into ſtones in the ayre, which afterwards fall downe in raine; ſo alſo doth it take vp frogs and fiſhes, who beeing aboue in theayre, muſt needes fall downe againe. Sometimes alſo it taketh vp the egges of frogs and fiſhes, which beeing kept aloft in the ayre among the Whirle-windes, and ſtormes of ſhewers, doe there engender and bring forth young ones, which afterwards fall downe vpon the earth, there being no poole for them in the ayre. Theſe and ſuch like reaſons are approued among the learned for naturall cauſes of the prodigious raining of frogs.</p>
            <p>But we read in holy Scripture among the plagues of Aegypt, that frogges were ſent by GOD to annoy them; and therefore whatſoeuer is the materiall cauſe, it is moſt certaine that the wrath of GOD and his almighty hand, is the making or efficient cauſe, and for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> the worthineſſe of that deuine ſtory, how God maketh and taketh away frogs, I will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe it as it is left by the Holy-ghoſt, in Cap. 8. <hi>Exod.</hi> verſe 5. Alſo the Lord ſaide vnto <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſay thou vnto <hi>Aaron,</hi> ſtretch out thy hand with thy rodde vpon the ſtreames, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Riuers, and vpon the ponds, and cauſe frogs to come vpon the land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> ver. 6. Then <hi>Aaron</hi> ſtretched out his hand vpon the waters of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the frogs came vp &amp; couered the land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> verſe. 7. And the Sorcerers did likewiſe with their Sorceries, and brought frogs vp vpon the land of Aegypt. Verſe 8. Then <hi>Pharao</hi> called for <hi>Moſes</hi> &amp; <hi>Aaron,</hi> and ſaid; pray ye vnto the Lord, that he may take away the frogs from mee, and from my people, and I will let the people goe, that they may doe ſacrifice to the Lord, verſe 9. And <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaide vnto <hi>Pharao,</hi> concerning me, commaund when I ſhall pray for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> thee and thy ſeruants, and for thy people, to deſtroy the frogges from thee, and from thy houſes, that they may remaine in the Riuer onely, verſe 10. Then he ſaid tomorrow, &amp; he anſwered, be it as thou haſt ſaid, that thou mayſt know that there is none like the Lord our GOD. verſe 11. So the frogges ſhall depart from thee, and from thy houſes, &amp; from thy people, and from thy Seruants onely, they ſhall remaine in the Riuer. verſe 12. Then
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:22894:96"/>
               <hi>Moſes</hi> &amp; <hi>Aaron</hi> went out from <hi>Pharao,</hi> &amp; <hi>Moſes</hi> cryed vnto the Lord concerning the frogs which he had ſent vnto <hi>Pharao.</hi> ver. 13. And the Lord did according to the ſaying of <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſo the frogs dyed in the houſes, and in the Townes, and in the fieldes. ver. 14. And they gathered them together by heapes, and the land ſtanke of them, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And this was the ſecond plague of Aegypt, wherein the Lord turned all the fiſhes into Frogges, (as the booke of wiſedome ſaith) and the Frogs abounded in the Kinges cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: and notwithſtanding this great iudgement of God for the preſent, <hi>Pharao</hi> would not let the people goe, and afterwardes that blind ſuperſtitious Nation became worſhippers of Frogges, (as <hi>Philastrias</hi> writeth) thinking by this deuotion, or rather wickodneſſe in this obſeruant manner, to pacifie the wrath of God, chooſing their owne wayes before <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> the word of Almighty God: But vain is that worſhip which is inuented without heauenly warrant, and better it is to bee obedient to the will of God, then goe about to pleaſe him with the cogitations of men, although in their pretended holineſſe wee ſpend much time, wealth, and bloud.</p>
            <p>There was one <hi>Cypſelus</hi> the Father of <hi>Periander,</hi> who by his Mother was hidde in a Cheſt called <hi>Kypſele,</hi> to be preſerued from the handes of certaine murtherers, which were ſent to kill him. Wherefore afterwards the ſaid <hi>Cypſelus</hi> conſecrated a houſe at <hi>Delphos</hi> to <hi>Apollo,</hi> becauſe he heard his crying when he was hidde in a Cheſt, and preſerued him. In the bottome of that houſe, was the trunke of a palme-tree and certaine Frogges pictu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red running out of the ſame: but what was meant thereby is not certainely knowne, for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> neither <hi>Plutarke</hi> which vvriteth the ſtory, nor <hi>Cherſias</hi> which relateth it, giueth any ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification thereof: but in another place where he inquireth the reaſon why the Oracle of <hi>Pithias</hi> gaue no anſwer, hee coniectured becauſe it was that the accurſed thing brought out of the Temple of <hi>Apollo</hi> from <hi>Delphos,</hi> into the <hi>Corinthian</hi> houſe, hadde ingrauen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath the brazen Palme, Snakes, and Frogs, or elſe for the ſignification of the Sunne riſing.</p>
            <p>The meat of Frogges thus brought foorth are greene Hearbes, and Humble-Bees, or ſhor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

In the month of Auguſt, they neuer open <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> their mouthes, either to take in meate or drinke, or to vtter any voyce, and their chaps are <note place="margin">Albertus.</note> ſo faſt ioyned or cloſed together, that you can hardly open them with your finger, or with a ſticke. The young ones of this kinde are killed by caſting Long-wort, or the leaues of Sea-Lettice, as <hi>Elianus</hi> and <hi>Suidus</hi> write: and thus much for the deſcription of their parts, generation, and ſuſtentation of theſe common Frogs.</p>
            <p>The wiſedome or diſpoſition of the Aegyptian frogs is much commended, for they ſaue themſelues from their enemies with ſingular dexterity. If they fall at any time vpon a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Snake, which they knowe is their mortall enimy, they take in their mouthes a round Reede, which with an inuincible ſtrength they hold faſt, neuer letting goe, although the Snake haue gotten her into her mouth, for by this meanes the Snake cannot ſwallow hir, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> and ſo ſhe is preſerued aliue.</p>
            <p>There is a pretty fable of a great Bull which came to the water to quench his thirſt, and whileſt the beaſt came running greedily into the Water, hee trod in peeces two or three young Frogs; then one of them which eſcaped with life, went and told his mother the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable misfortune and chance of his fellowes: ſhe asked who it was that had ſo killed her young ones, to whom he anſwered: It was a great one, but how great he could not tell: the fooliſh mother-frog deſirous to haue ſeene ſome body in the eyes of her Sonne, began to ſwell with holding in of her breath, and then asked the young one if the beaſt were as bigge as ſhe? And he anſwered much greater, at which words ſhe beganne to ſwell more, And asked him againe if the beaſt were ſo bigge? To whom the young one aunſwered, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> Mother leaue your ſwelling, for though you breake your ſelfe, you will neuer be ſo bigge as he: and I thinke from this ſame fable came the Prouerbe, <hi>Rana Gyrina ſapientia,</hi> wiſer then the young Frogge.

And thus much ſhall ſuffice to haue ſpoken of the wiſedome of Frogs.</p>
            <p>Their common enimies are the Weaſels, Poule-cats, and Ferrets, for theſe do gather them together, and lay of them great heapes within their dens: whereupon they feede in Winter. The Hearne alſo and Bittor, is a common deſtroyer of Frogges, and ſo likewiſe are ſome kind of Kites. The Night-Birds, <hi>Gimus</hi> and <hi>Gimeta,</hi> the Water-Snake (at whoſe preſence in token of extreame terrour) the Frogge ſetteth vppe her voyce in lamentable manner. The Moles are alſo enemies to Frogs, &amp; it is further ſaid, that if a burning Candle be ſet by the water ſide, during the croaking of Frogs, it will make them hold their peace. Men do alſo take Frogs, for they were wont to baite a hooke with a little red wooll, or a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> peece of red cloth, alſo the gall of a Goat put into a veſſell, and ſet in the earth, will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly draw vnto it all the Frogs that be neare it, as if it were vnto them a very gratefull thing: And thus much ſhal ſuffice to haue ſpoken of the enemies of frogs. Now in the next place we are to conſider the ſeuerall Vſes, both naturall, Medicinall, and Magicall, which men do make of Frogs.</p>
            <p>And firſt of all the Greene Frogs, and ſome of the yellow which liue in flouds, Riuers, Lakes, and Fiſh-pooles, are eaten by men; although in ancient time they were not eaten, but onely for Phyſicke, for the broth wherein they were ſod, &amp; the fleſh alſo, was thought to haue vertue in it to cure the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which were ſtrucken by any venomous-creeping-beaſt, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially mixed with Salt and Oyle: but ſince that time <hi>Aetius</hi> diſcommendeth the eating <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> of Frogs, prouing that ſome of them are venomous, and that by eating thereof, extream vomits hath followed, and they can neuer be good, except when they are newly taken, &amp; their skins diligently flayed off, and thoſe alſo out of pure running waters, and not out of muddy ſtinking puddles: and therefore aduiſeth to forbeare in plenty of other meate, this wanton eating of Frogs, as thinges perilous to life and health, and thoſe Frogs alſo which are moſt white when the skin is taken off, are moſt dangerous &amp; fulleſt of venom, according to the couſell of <hi>Fiera,</hi> ſaying;</p>

            <p>And thus much for the naturall vſe of Frogs. Now followeth Magicall.

Kiranides.

Now if this magicall foolery were true, we had more need of Frogs then of Iuſtices of Peace, or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates in the common-wealth.</p>
            <p>But to proceede a little further, and to detect the vanity of theſe men, they alſo ſay, that the ſtaffe wherewith all a Frog is ſtrucke our of a Snakes mouth, laide vpon a woman <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> in trauaile, ſhall cauſe an eaſie deliuerance: and if a man cut off a foot of a frog as he ſwims in the water, and binde the ſame to one that hath the gout, it will cure him. And this is as true as a ſhoulder of Mutton worne in ones Hat, healeth the tooth-ach.</p>
            <p>Some againe doe write, that if a Woman take a Frogge and ſpit three times in her mouth, ſhe ſhall not conceiue with Childe that yeare. Alſo if Dogges eate the Pottage wherein a Frogge hath beene ſodde, it maketh him dumbe and cannot barke. And if a man caſt a ſodde Frogge at a Dogge, vvhich is ready to aſſault him, it will make him runne away, (I thinke as faſt an olde hungry Horſe from a bottle of Hay.)

euery venomous creature. Frogges ſod or roaſted, are profitable, eſpecially the broth, if it be giuen to the ſicke perſon without his knowledge, mixed with Oyle and Salt, as wee haue ſaid already. The fleſh of Water-frogs is good againſt the byting of the Sea-hare, the Scorpion, and all kind of Serpents: againſt Leproſie and ſcabs, and rubbed vpon the body, it doth cure the ſame.</p>
            <p>The broath taken into the body with rootes of Sea-halme, expelleth the Salamander: ſo alſo the Egges, of the frogge, and the egges of the Tortoyce, hath the ſame operation, being ſod with Calamynth. The little Frogs are an antidote againſt the Toades and great Frogges. <hi>Albertus</hi> alſo among other remedies preſcribeth a Frogge to bee giuen to ſicke Faulkcons or Hawkes: It is alſo good for crickes in the necke, or the Cramp. The ſame <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> ſod with Oyle, caſeth the paines and hardneſſe of the ioynts and ſinnewes: they are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe giuen againſt an old Cough, and with old Wine and ſod Corne drunke out of the Veſſell wherein they are ſod, they are profitable againſt the Droſie, but with the ſharpeſt Vineger, Oyle, and ſpume of Niter ſod together, by rubbing and annoynting, cureth all ſcabs in Horſes, and peſtelent tumours.</p>
            <p>There is an Oyle likewiſe made out of Frogs, which is made in this manner, they take a pound of Frogges, and put them into a veſſell or glaſſe, and vppon them, they poure a pinte of Oyle, ſo ſtopping the mouth of the glaſſe, they ſeeth it as they do the Oyle of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, with this they cure the ſhrinking of the ſinnewes, and the hot gout, they prouoke ſleep, and heale the inflammations in Feauers, by annointing the Temples.

            </p>
            <figure/>
            <p>It is the leaſt of all other Frogs, &amp; liueth in trees, or among fruites, and trees eſpecially in the woods of Haſels, or Vines, for with his ſhorte Legges it climbeth the higheſt trees: inſomuch that ſome haue thought it hadd winges. It is greene all ouer the body, except the feete and the fingers, which are of duſty or reddiſh colour, and the toppes of his nailes or clawes are blunt and round: In the diſſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therof there was bloud found in euery part of the body, and yet but little. The Heart of it is white, the Liuer blacke, mixed with the Gall. It hath alſo a Melt, and in the end of Iuly it layeth Egges. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/>
            </p>
            <p>It is a venemous beaſt, for ſometimes Cattle as they brouſe vppon trees, do ſwallovv down one of theſe vpon the leaues not diſcerning it, becauſe it is of the ſame colour: but preſently after they haue eaten it their bellyes begin to ſwell, which muſt needes proceed from the poyſoned Frogge.</p>
            <p>A ſecond reaſon prooueth it to bee venomous, is for that many Authors doe affirme, that hereof is made the <hi>Pſilothrum,</hi> for the drawing out of teeth by the roots, and for this cauſe is concluded to bee venomous, becauſe this cannot bee performed without ſtronge poyſon. But for the cure of the poyſon of this Frogge, wee ſhall expreſſe it afterward in the Hiſtory of the Toade, and therefore the Reader muſt not expect it in this place. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies before raine they climbe vppe vpon the trees, and there cry after a hoarſe manner <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> very much, which cauſed the Poet <hi>Serenus</hi> to call it <hi>Rauco garrula questu:</hi> at other times it is mute, and hath no voyce: vvherefore it is more truely called <hi>Mantis,</hi> that is, a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet or a Deuiner, then any other kinde of Frogge, becauſe other Frogges which are not altogether mute, doe cry both for feare, and alſo for deſire of carnall copulation, but this neuer cryeth but before raine.</p>
            <p>Some haue beene of opinion, that this is a dumbe Frogge; and therefore <hi>Vincentius Belluacenſis</hi> ſaith, that it is called a mute Frog from the effect: for there is an opinion, that this put into the mouth of a Dog, maketh him dumbe, which if it bee true, it is an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the extreame poyſon therein contained, ouercomming the nature of the Dogge, whoſe cheefeſt ſences are his taſt and his ſmelling. And thus much ſhall ſuffice for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> of this Frog.</p>
            <p>The medicinall vertues obſerued herein are theſe that follow. Firſt if a man which hath a cough, do ſpet into the mouth of this Frogge, it is thought that it doth deliuer him from his cough, and being bound in a Cranes skinne vnto a mans thigh, procureth venerious deſires: but theſe are but magicall deuices, and ſuch as haue no apparant reaſon in nature,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:22894:99"/>
wherefore I vvill omit them, and proceede to them that are more reaſonable &amp; naturall. Firſt for the Oyle of Frogs, that is the beſt which is made out of the Greene-Frogs, as it is obſerued by <hi>Siluius,</hi> and if they are held betwixt a mans handes, in the fit of hot burning Ague, do much refreſh nature, and eaſe the paine. For Feauer-heptickes they prepare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thus: they take ſuch frogs as haue white bellies, then cut off their heads and pull out their bowels, afterwards they ſeeth them in water, vntill the fleſh fall from the bones, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they mingle the ſaid fleſh with Barly Meale, made into Paſte, wherewithall they cram &amp; feed Pullen with that paſte, vpon which the ſicke man muſt be fed, and in default of Frogs they do the like with Eeles, and other like Fiſhes. But there is no part of the Frog ſo medicina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as is the bloud, called alſo the matter or the iuyce, and the humour of the Frogge, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> ſome of them write, that there is no bloud but in the eyes of a Frogge: firſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with this they kill haire, for vpon the place where the haire was puld off, they poure this bloud, and then it neuer groweth more: And this as I haue ſaid already, is an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the venome of this Frogge; and it hath beene proued by experience, that a man holding one of theſe Frogges in his hand, his hands haue begunne to ſwell, and to break out into bliſters. Of this vertue <hi>Serenus</hi> the Poet writeth;</p>

Frogges, ſuch as is that which the Germans call <hi>Feurkrott,</hi> and our late Alchymiſts <hi>Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrunon,</hi> that is, a Fire-frogge, becauſe it is of the coloure of fire: This is found deepe in the earth, in the midſt of Rocks and ſtones when they are cleft aſunder, and amongſt met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls, where-into there is no hole or paſſage, and therefore the wit of man cannot deuiſe how it ſhould enter therein, onely there they find them when they cleaue thoſe ſtones in ſunder with their wedges &amp; other inſtruments. Such as theſe are, are found neere <hi>Towers</hi> in Fraunce, among a redde ſandy ſtone, whereof they make Milſtones, and therfore they breake that ſtone all in peeces before they make the Milſtone vp, leaſt while the Paddock is included in the middle, and the Mill-ſtone going in the Mill, the heate ſhould make the Paddocke ſwell, and ſo the Mill-ſtone breaking, the corne ſhould be poyſoned. As ſoone <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> as theſe Paddocks come once into the ayre, out of their cloſe places of generation and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation, they ſwell and ſo die.</p>
            <p>This crooke-backed Paddocke is called by the Germans <hi>Gartenfroſch,</hi> that is, a Frog of the Garden, and <hi>Grasfroſch,</hi> that is, a Frogge of the graſſe. It is not altogether mute, for in time of perrill, when they are chaced by men, or by Snakes, they haue a crying voyce, which I haue oftentimes prooued by experience, and all Snakes and Serpents doe verie much hunt and deſire to deſtroy theſe: alſo I haue ſeene a Snake hold one of them by the legge, for becauſe it was great ſhe could not eaſily deuoure it, &amp; during that time, it made a pittifull lamentation.</p>
            <p>Theſe Paddocks haue as it were two little hornes or bunches in the middle of the back, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> and their colour is betweene greene and yellow, on the ſides they haue redde ſpots, and the feete are of the ſame colour, their belly is white, and that part of their backe which is directly ouer their breaſt, is diſtinguiſhed with a few blacke ſpots. And thus much may ſerue for the particuler deſcription of the Paddocke, not differing in any other thing that I can reade of from the former Frogges, it being venomous as they are, and therefore the cure is to be expaected heereafter, in the next hiſtory of the Toade.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Now I find of theſe Toades two kinds, the one called <hi>Rubeta palustris,</hi> a Toade of the fennes, or of the waters, the other, <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beta terrestris,</hi> a Toade of the earth: And theſe in Authors are sometimes confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, one taken for ang<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

and ſharpe boned, the belly white and yellowe, or rather betwixt both, the eyes of a gold flaming colour, the buttocks and hinder legges hairy, and beſides that place, theſe kind of Toades are no where found. They haue a very ſhrill voyce, ſo as they are heard a great way off, like a ſmall bell or trumpet, and they neuer vtter their voyce but in the Spring, and the fore-part of the Summer, for about September they hide themſelues in Trees, neither doe they liue among the waters, but on the dry land; when they cry, it is certaine that the night following will bring forth no froſt.</p>
            <p>Like vnto this there is a Toade in Fraunce called <hi>Bufo cornutus,</hi> a horned Toade, not becauſe it hath hornes, for that is moſt apparantly falſe, but for that the voyce thereof is like to the ſound of a Cornet, or rather (as I thinke) like to a Rauen called <hi>Cornix,</hi> and by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> a kind of barbariſme called <hi>Bufo cornutus.</hi> The colour of this Toade is like Saffron on the one part, and like filthy durt on the other: beſides, there are other venomous Toades li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in ſinckes, priuies, and vnder the rootes of plants.</p>
            <p>There is another kind alſo, like to the Toade of the water, but in ſteed of bones it hath onely griſſels, and it is bigger then the Toade of the Fenne, liuing in hot places. There is another alſo, which although it be a Toade of the water, yet hath it beene eaten for meate not many yeeres ſince: the mouth of it is very great, but yet without teeth, which he doth many times put out of the water like a Torteyſe to take breath, and in taking of his meate, which are flyes, Locuſtes, Catterpillers, gnattes, and ſmall creeping things, it imitateth the Camaelion, for it putteth out the tongue, and licketh in his meate by the ſpace of three <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> fingers, in the toppe whereof there is a ſoft place, hauing in it viſcous humour, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth all thinges to cleaue faſt vnto it which it toucheth, by vertue whereof it deuoureth great flyes.

The head is broade and thicke, and the colour thereof on the nether part about the necke is white, that is, ſome-what pale, the backe plaine without bunches, and it is ſaide that there is a little bone growing in theyr ſides, that hath a vertue to driue away dogge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> from him that beareth it about him, and is therefore called <hi>Apocynon.</hi> The whole aſpect of this Toade is vglie and vnpleaſant. Some Authours affirme that it carrieth the hart in the necke, and therefore it cannot eaſily be killed, except the throate thereof be cutte in the middle. Theyr liuer is very vitious, and cauſeth the whole body to be of ill temperament: And ſome ſay they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> haue two liuers. Theyr melt is very ſmall, and as for theyr copulation and egges, they differ nothing from Frogges.</p>

               <hi>Braſauolus</hi> ſaith, that he found ſuch a thing in the head of a Toade, but he rather tooke it to be a bone then a ſtone, the colour wherof was browne, inclyning to blacknes. Some ſay it is double, namely outwardly a hollow bone, and inwardly a ſtone contained <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> in, the vertue whereof is ſaid to breake, preuent, or cure the ſtone in the bladder now how this ſtone ſhould be there ingendered, there are diuers opinions alſo, &amp; they ſay y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſtones are ingendered in liuing creatures two manner of wayes, either through heate, or extreame cold, as in the Snaile, Pearch, Crabbe, Indian Tortizes and Toades; ſo that by extremitie of cold this ſtone ſhould be gotten.</p>
            <p>Againſt this opinion the colour of the ſtone is obiected, which is ſome-times white, ſometimes browne, or blackiſh, hauing a cittrine or blew ſpot in the middle, ſometimes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> all greene, wher-vpon is naturally engrauen the figure of a Toade: and this ſtone is ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times called <hi>Borax,</hi> ſometimes <hi>Crapodinae,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>Niſae,</hi> or <hi>Nuſae,</hi> and <hi>Chelonites.</hi> Others doe make two kindes of theſe ſtones, one reſembling a great deale of Milke mixed with a little blood, ſo that the white exceedeth the Redde, and yet both are apparant and viſible: the other all blacke, wherein they ſay is the picture of a Toade, with her legges ſpredde before and behind. And it is further affirmed, that if both theſe ſtones be held in ones hand in the preſence of poyſon, it will burne him. The probation of this ſtone, is by laying of it to a liue Toade, and if ſhe lift vp her head againſt it, it is good, but if ſhee run away from it, it is a counterfeyte.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Geor: Agricola</hi> calleth the greater kind of theſe ſtones, <hi>Brontia,</hi> and the leſſer &amp; ſmoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> ſort of ſtones, <hi>Cerauniae,</hi> although ſome co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary this opinion, ſaying that theſe ſtones <hi>Brantia</hi> &amp; <hi>Cerauniae,</hi> are bred on the earth by thundering and lightning. Whereas it is ſaid before, that the generation of this ſtone in the Toade proceedeth of colde, that is vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly vnpoſſible, for it is deſcribed to be ſo ſolide and firme, as nothing can be more hard, and therefore I cannot aſſent vnto that opinion, for vnto hard and ſolide things, is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red abundance of heate: and againe, it is vnlikely, that whatſoeuer this Toade-ſtone be, that there ſhould be any ſtore of them in the world as are euery where viſible, if they were to be taken out of the Toades aliue, and therefore I rather agree with <hi>Salueldenſis</hi> a Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard, who thinketh that it is begotten by a certaine viſcous ſpume, breathed out vppon the head of ſome Toade, by her fellowes in the Spring-time. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/>
            </p>
            <p>This ſtone is that which in auncient time was called <hi>Batrachites,</hi> and they attribute vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it a vertue beſides the former, namely, for the breaking of the ſtone in the bladder, and againſt the Falling-ſicknes. And they further write that it is a diſcouerer of preſent poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for in the preſence of poyſon it will change the colour. And this is the ſubſtaunce of that which is written about this ſtone. Now for my part I dare not conclude either with it or againſt it, for <hi>Hermolaus, Maſſarius, Albertus, Syluaticus,</hi> and others, are directlie for this ſtone ingendered in the braine or head of the Toade: on the other ſide, <hi>Cardan</hi> and <hi>Geſner</hi> confeſſe ſuch a ſtone by name and nature, but they make doubt of the generation of it, as others haue deliuered; and therefore they beeing in ſundry opinions, the hearing were of might confound the Reader, I will referre him for his ſatisfaction vnto a Toade, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> which hee may eaſily euery day kill: For although when the Toade is dead, the vertue thereof be loſt, which conſiſted in the eye, or blew ſpot in the middle, yet the ſubſtaunce remaineth, and if the ſtone be found there in ſubſtance, then is the queſtion at an end, but if it be not, then muſt the generation of it be ſought for in ſome other place.</p>
            <p>Thus leauing the ſtone of the Toade, we muſt proceede to the other parts of the ſtory, and firſt of all their place of habitation, which for them of the water, is neere the vvater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and for them of the earth, in buſhes, hedges, Rockes, and holes of the earth, neuer comming abroade while the Sunne ſhineth, for they hate the ſunne-ſhine, and theyr na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture cannot indure it, for which cauſe they keepe cloſe in their holes in the day time, and in the night they come abroad. Yet ſometimes in rainy-weather, and in ſolitary places, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> they come abroade in the day-time. All the Winter-time they liue vnder the earth, fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vppon earth, herbes, and wormes, and it is ſaid they eate earth by meaſure, for they eate ſo much euery day as they can grype in theyr fore-foote, as it were ſizing themſelues, leaſt the whole earth ſhould not ſerue them till the Spring.

            <p>About their generation there are many worthy obſeruations in nature, ſomtimes they are bredde out of the putrefaction and corruption of the earth, it hath alſo been ſeene that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> out of the aſhes of a Toade burnt, not onely one, but many Toades haue been regenerated the yeere folowing. In the <hi>New world</hi> there is a Prouince called <hi>Dariene,</hi> the ayre where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is wonderful vnwholſome, becauſe all the country ſtandeth vpon rotten Mariſhes. It is there obſerued, that when the ſlaues or ſeruants water the pauements of the dores, from the drops of water which fall on the right hand, are inſtantly many Toades ingendered, as in other places ſuch drops of water are turned into gnats. It hath alſo beene ſeene, that women conceiuing with child, haue likewiſe conceiued at the ſame time a frog, or a toade or a Lizard, and therefore <hi>Platearius</hi> ſaith, that thoſe thinges which are medicines to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke the menſtruous courſe of women, doe alſo bring foorth the Secondiues. And ſome haue called <hi>Bufone<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fratrem Salernitanorum, et lacertum fratre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Lombardoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:</hi> that is, a toade <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> the brother of the <hi>Salernitans,</hi> &amp; the Lizard the brother of the <hi>Lombards:</hi> for it hath been ſeene that a woman of <hi>Salernum,</hi> hath at one time brought forth a boy and a toade, and therfore hee calleth the toade his brother; ſo likewiſe a woman of <hi>Lombardy,</hi> a Lizard, &amp; therefore he calleth the Lizard the <hi>Lombards</hi> brother. And for this cauſe, the women of thoſe countries, at ſuch time as their child beginneth to quicken in their wombe, do drink the iuyce of Parſly &amp; Leekes, to kill ſuch conceptions if any be.</p>
            <p>There was a woman newly married, and when in the opinion of all ſhe was with child, in ſteed of a child ſhe brought forth foure little liuing creatures like frogs, and yet ſhee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in good health, but a little while after ſhee felt ſome paine about the rymne of her belly, which afterward was eaſed by applying a fewe remedies. Alſo there was another <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> woman, which together with a man-child, in her ſecondines did alſo bring forth ſuch ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beaſt; and after that a Marchants wife did the like in <hi>Anconitum.</hi> But what ſhould be the reaſon of theſe ſo ſtrange &amp; vnnaturall conceptions, I wil not take vpon me to diſcide in nature, leaſt the omnipotent hand of God ſhould be wronged, and his moſt ſecrete &amp; iuſt cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſell preſumptuouſly iudged &amp; called into queſtion. This we know that it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied in the <hi>Reuelation,</hi> that Frogs &amp; Locuſts ſhould come out of the whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the bottomleſſe pit, and therfore ſeeing the ſeate of the Whore of <hi>Babylon</hi> is in Italy, it may be that God would haue manifeſted the deprauation of Chriſtian religion, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning among the Italians, and there continued in the conioyned birth of men &amp; ſerpents: for ſurely, none but deuils incarnate, or men conceiued of Serpents brood, would ſo ſtifly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> ſtand in <hi>Romiſh</hi> error as the <hi>Italians</hi> do, &amp; therefore they ſeeme to be more addicted to the errors of their Fathers, (which they ſay is the religion wherin they were borne) then vnto the truth of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> which doth vnanſwerably detect the pride &amp; vanity of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> faith.</p>
            <p>But to leaue ſpeaking of the conception of toades in women, we wil proceed further vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their generation in the ſtomacks &amp; bellies of men, wherof there may more eaſily a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be giuen then of the former. Now although that in the earth toades are generated of putrified earth &amp; waters, yet ſuch a generation cannot be in the body of man, for although there be much putrifaction in vs, yet not ſo much as to ingender bones &amp; other orgynes, ſuch as are in toades; as for wormes they are all fleſh, &amp; may more eaſily be conceiued of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> the putrifaction in our ſtomacks. But then you wil ſay how comes it to paſſe that in mens ſtomacks there are ſound frogs &amp; toades? I anſwer that this euill hapneth vnto ſuch men as drinke water, for by drinking of water, a toades egge may eaſily ſlip into the ſtomack, &amp; there being of a viſcous nature, cleaueth faſt to the rough parts of the ventricle, and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a contrary nature to man, can neuer be diſgeſted or auoyded, and for that cauſe, the

If ſhee take <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> hold of any thing in her mouth, ſhe will neuer let it goe till ſhee die, and many times ſhee ſendeth forth poyſon out of her buttocks or backer parts, where-withall ſhe infecteth the ayre, for reuenge of them that doe annoy her: and it is well obſerued that ſhee knoweth the weakenes of her teeth, &amp; therefore for her defence ſhe firſt of all gathereth abundance of ayre into her body, where-withall ſhe greatly ſwelleth, and then by ſighing, vttereth that infected ayre as neere the perſon that offendeth her as ſhe can, and thus ſhee worketh her reuenge, killing by the poyſon of her breath. The colour of this poyſon is like milke, of which I will ſpeake afterward, particularly by it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>A Toade is of a moſt cold tempriament, and badde conſtitution of nature, &amp; it vſeth one certaine herbe where-withall it preſerueth the ſight, and alſo reſiſteth the poyſon of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> Spyders, whereof I haue heard this credible hiſtory related, from the mouth of a true ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable man, and one of the moſt charitable Peeres of England, namely, the good Earle of <hi>Bedford,</hi> and I was requeſted to ſet it downe for truth, for it may be iuſtified by manie now aliue which ſaw the ſame.</p>
            <p>It fortuned as the ſaid Earle trauailed in Bedfordſhire, neere vnto a Market-towne cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Owbourne,</hi> ſome of his company eſpyed a Toade fighting with a Spider, vnder a hedge in a bottome, by the high-way-ſide, whereat they ſtood ſtill, vntill the Earle their Lord and Maiſter came alſo to behold the ſame; and there he ſaw how the Spyder ſtill kept her ſtanding, and the Toade diuers times went backe from the Spyder, and did eate a peece of an herbe, which to his iudgement was like a Plantine. At the laſt, the Earle hauing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> ſeene the Toade doe it often, and ſtill returne to the combat againſt the Spyder, hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded one of his men to goe and with his dagger to cutte off that herbe, which he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed and brought it away. Preſently after the Toade returned to ſeeke it, and not find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it according to her expectation, ſwelled &amp; broke in peeces: for hauing receiued poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon from the Spyder in the combat, nature taught her the vertue of that herbe, to expell and driue it out, but wanting the herbe, the poyſon did inſtantly worke and deſtroy her. And this (as I am informed) was oftentimes related by the Earle of <hi>Bedford</hi> himſelfe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon ſundry occaſions, and therefore I am the bolder to inſert it into this ſtory.</p>
            <p>I doe the more eaſily beleeue it, becauſe of another like hiſtory, related by <hi>Eraſmus</hi> in his booke of friendſhip, hapning likewiſe in England, in manner as followeth.

            <p>Now to conclude, the premiſſes conſidered which haue beene ſaid of the Toade, the vſes that are to follow are not many, except thoſe which are already related in the Frog. When the Spanyards were in <hi>Bragua,</hi> an Iland of the <hi>Newe-found-World,</hi> they were brought to ſuch extremitie of famine, that a ſicke-man amongſt them was forced to eate two Toades, which he bought for two peeces of Gold-lace, worth in Spaniſh monie ſixe Duckets. I doe maruell why in auncient time the Kings of Fraunce gaue in their Armes the three Toades in a yellow fielde, the which were afterwards changed by <hi>Clodoueus</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to three Flower-deluſees in a field Azure, as Armes ſent vnto him from Heauen. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/>

            <p>When the Troyans dwelt neere <hi>Moeetis,</hi> after the deſtruction of Troy, they were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much annoyed by the Gothes, wherefore <hi>Marcomirus</hi> their King, determined to leaue that Country, and to ſeeke ſome-where elſe a more quiet habitation. Being thus minded, he was admoniſhed by an Oracle that he ſhould goe and dwell in that Country where the Riuer <hi>Rhene</hi> falleth into the Sea, and he was alſo ſtirred vp to take vpon him that iourney, by a certaine Magitian-woman, called <hi>Alrunna,</hi> for this cunning Woman cauſed in the night-time a deformed appartion to come vnto him, hauing three heads, one of an Eagle, another of a Toade, and the third of a Lyon, and the Eagles head did ſpeake vnto him in this manner, <hi>Genus tuum ô Marcomire opprimet me, et conculcabit Leonem et interficiet bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fonem,</hi> that is to ſay, Thy ſtocke or poſteritie, ô <hi>Marcomirus,</hi> ſhall oppreſſe mee, it ſhall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> tread the Lyon vnder-foote, and kill the Toade.

            <p>It is an opinion held by ſome Writers, that the Weaſels of the water doe ingender in copulation with the Toades of the water, for in their mouthes, and feete of theyr bellie, they doe reſemble them. VVherevpon theſe verſes were made;</p>

            <p>We haue ſhewed already that the Toade is a cold creature, and therefore the ſame ſod in water, and the body annoynted there-with, cauſeth hayre to fall off from the members ſo annoynted. There is a medicine much commended againſt the Gowte, which is this: Take ſixe pound of the rootes of Wilde-cucumber, ſixe pound of ſweet oyle of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> of Harts, Turpentine, and Waxe, of eyther ſixe ounces, and ſixe Toades aliue, the which Toades muſt be bored through the foote, and hanged by a thred in the oyle vntill they grow yellow, then take them out of the oyle by the threds, and put into the ſaid oyle the ſlyced roote of Cucumber, and there let it ſeeth vntill all the vertue be left in the oyle. Afterwards melt the Waxe and Turpentine, and then put them altogether in a glaſſe, ſo vſe them morning and euening againſt the Gowte, Sciatica, and paines of the ſinewes, &amp; it hath beene ſeene that they which haue lyen long ſicke, haue beene cured thereof, and growne perfectly wel &amp; able to walke. Some haue added vnto this medicine oyle of Saf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fron, <hi>Opobalſamum,</hi> blood of Torteyſes, oyle of Sabyne, Swynes-greace, Quickſiluer, &amp; oyle of Bayes. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/>

            <p>For the ſcabbes of horſes, they take a Toade killed in wine and water, and ſo ſodde in a brazen veſſell, and afterwards annoynt the horſe with the liquour thereof. It is alſo ſaide that Toades dryed in ſmoake, or any peece of them carried about one in a lynnen-cloath, doe ſtay the bleeding at the noſe. And this <hi>Fredericke</hi> the Duke of Saxonie was wont to practiſe in this maner; he had euer a Toade pierced through with a peece of wood, which Toade was dried in the ſmoake or ſhadow, this he roled in a lynnen cloth, and when hee came to a man bleeding at the noſe, he cauſed him to hold it faſt in his hand vntill it waxed hote, and then would the blood be ſtayed. Whereof the Phiſitians could neuer giue any reaſon, except horrour and feare conſtrained the blood to runne into his proper place, through feare of a beaſt ſo contrary to humane nature. The powder alſo of a toade is ſaid <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> to haue the ſame vertue, according to this verſe;</p>

            <p>I will not ſtand about the difference of Authors, whether this Serpent be to be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Aſpes or to the Vipers, for it is not a poynt materiall, and therefore I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede to the deſcription of his nature, that by his whole hiſtory, the Reader may chooſe whether he wil account him a ſubordinate kind vnto others, or els a principall of himſelfe. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> It is an Affrican Serpent, bredde in the <hi>Lybian</hi> ſandie-ſeas, places not inhabited by men, for the huge mountaines of ſands are ſo often mooued by the windes, that it is not onelie impoſſible for men to dwell there, but alſo very dangerous &amp; perrillous to trauell through them, for that many times whole troopes of men and cattell, are in an inſtant ouerwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and buried in thoſe ſands.

They haue certaine red ſtrakes croſſe theyr backe like a Crocodile of the earth, and the skins of ſuch as are bred in Aegypt are very ſoft, ſtretching like a Cheuerell-gloue, both in length &amp; breadth, as it did appeare by a certaine skinne taken off from one being dead: for beeing ſtuffed with Hay, it ſhewed much greater then it was being aliue, but in other Countries <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> the skins are not ſo.</p>
            <p>I haue heard this Hiſtory of three of theſe Serpents brought out of Turky, and giuen to a Noble man of <hi>Venice</hi> aliue, who preſerued them aliue in a great glaſſe, (made of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) vpon ſand, in that glaſſe nere the fire: The deſcription as it here followeth, was take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by <hi>Iohn Faltoner,</hi> an Engliſh traueller, ſaying. They were three in number, whereof one was thrice ſo bigge as the other two, and that was a Female, and ſhe was ſaid to be theyr Mother: ſhe had layd at that time in the ſandes foure or fiue egges, about the bigneſſe of Pigeons egges. She was in length three foote, but in breadth or quantity almoſt ſo big as a mans Arme: her head was flat, and broad as two fingers, the apple of the eye blacke all the other part being white. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/>
            </p>
            <p>Out of her eye-lids grew two hornes, but they were ſhort ones, and thoſe were truely Hornes, and not fleſh. The necke compared with the body was very long and ſmall, all the vpper part of the skinne was couered with ſcales, of aſh-colour, and yet mixed vvith blacke. The tayle is as it were brown whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it was ſtretched out. And this was the deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the old one: the other two being like to her in all things, except in their hornes, for being ſmall, they were not yet growne.

theſe mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſters do not foreſhew any euil to the chriſtians.

Thus farre this inſcribing Deuiner. But this fellovv ought firſt of all to haue enquired about the truth of this Picture, whether it were ſincere or counterfeit, before he had giuen his iudgment vpon it, for that there ſhold be ſuch a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent with ſeauen heads, I thinke it vnpoſſible, and no more to bee beleeued and credited then that <hi>Castor</hi> and <hi>Pollux</hi> were conceiued in an Egge, or that <hi>Pluto</hi> is the GOD of Hell; or that Armed menne were created out of Dragons teeth, or that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/>

But let it be as it is, how doth he know that this euill doth more belong to the Turkes then to the Chriſtians? For ſhall we be ſo blind and flatter our ſelues ſo far, as not to acknowledge our ſinnes, but to lay all the tokens of Iudgement vpon our aduerſaries?

There haue beene ſome Lizards taken in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> the beginning of September, whoſe colour was like Braſſe, yet darke and dusky, and their belly partly white, and partly of an earthy colour, but vpon either ſide they had cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine little prickes or ſpottes like printed Starres: their length was not paſt foure fingers, their eyes looked backward, and the holes and paſſages of their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ares were round, the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of their feet were very ſmall, beeing fiue in number, both before and behinde, vvith ſmall nailes, and behind that was the longeſt which ſtandeth in the place of a mans fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finger, and one of them ſtandeth different from the other, as the Thumbe doth vppon a mans hand, but on the forefeete all of them ſtand equall, not one behinde or before ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>Theſe little Lizards doe differ from the Stellions in this; that they haue bloud in their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> veines, and they are couered with a hard skinne, wincking with the vpper eye-lid. All manner of Lizards haue a clouen tongue, and the toppe thereof is ſomewhat hairy, or at the leaſtwiſe deuided like the faſhion and figure of haire. Their teeth are alſo as ſmall as haire, beeing blacke, and very ſharpe, and it ſeemeth alſo they are very weake, becauſe
<figure/>
when they bite, they leaue them in the wound. Their lungs are ſmall and dry, yet apt to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> ſwell &amp; receiue wind by inflamation: their belly is vniforme and ſimple, their intrals, long their Melt round &amp; ſmall, &amp; their ſtones cleaue inwardly to their loynes: their taile is like the taile of a Serpent: &amp; it is the opinion of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> that the ſame being cut off, groweth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> againe. The reaſon whereof is giuen by <hi>Cardan,</hi> becauſe imperfect creatures are full of moyſtneſſe; and therefore the parts cut off do eaſily grow againe.

            <p>In <hi>Lybia</hi> there are Lyzards two cubits long, and in one of the Fortunate-Ilands called <note place="margin">S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In the Iland of <hi>Dioſcorides,</hi> neere to Arabia the leſſer, there are very great Lyzards, the fleſh whereof the people eate, and the ſatte they ſeeth, and vſe in ſteede of oyle: theſe are two cubits long, and I know not whether they be the ſame which the Affricans call <hi>Dubh,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> and liue in the deſarts of Lybia. They drinke nothing at all, for water is preſent death vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, ſo that a man would thinke that this Serpent were made all of fire, becauſe it is ſo preſently deſtroyed with water. Beeing killed, there commeth no blood out of it, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath it any poyſon but in the head &amp; tayle. This the people hunt after to eate, for the taſt of the fleſh, is like the taſt of Frogges fleſh, and when it is in the hole or denne, it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hardly drawne forth, except with ſpades and Mattocks, whereby the paſſages are ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and beeing abroad it is ſwift of foote.</p>
            <p>The Lyzards of India, eſpecially about the Mountaine Niſa, are 24. foote in length, <note place="margin">Aelianus. Polycletus</note> their colour variable, for their skin ſeemeth to be flouriſhed with certaine pictures, ſoft &amp; tender to be handled. I haue heard that there hangeth a Lyzard in the Kinges houſe at <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> Paris, whoſe body is as thicke as a mans body, and his length or ſtature little leſſe; it is ſaid it was taken in a priſon or common Gaole, beeing found ſucking the legges of priſoners: and I doe the rather beleeue this, becauſe I remember ſuch a thing recorded in the Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles of Fraunce, and alſo of another ſome-what leſſer, preſerued in the ſame Cittie, in a Church called Saint <hi>Anthonies.</hi> And to the intent that this may ſeeme no ſtrange nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible thing, it is reported by <hi>Volatteran,</hi> that when the King of Portugall had conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red certaine Ilands in Ethiopia, in one of them they ſlew a Lyzard, which had deuoured or ſwallowed downe a whole infant, ſo great &amp; wide was the mouth thereof: it was eight cubits long, and for a rare miracle it was hanged vppe at the gate <hi>Flumentana</hi> in Rome, in the roofe, &amp; dedicated to the virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> Beſides theſe, there are other kind of Lyzards, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> as that called <hi>Lacerta vermicularis,</hi> becauſe it liueth vpon wormes &amp; Spyders, in the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row walls of old buildings. Alſo a ſiluer-coloured Lyzard, called <hi>Liacome,</hi> liuing in dry and ſunne-ſhining places. Another kind called <hi>Senabras,</hi> and <hi>Adare,</hi> and <hi>Sennekie. Scen</hi> is a redde Lyzard, as <hi>Siluaticus</hi> writeth, but I rather take it to be the Scincke, or Crocodile of the earth, which abound neere the Red-Sea.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:22894:109"/>
There is alſo another kinde of Lyzard called <hi>Lacertus Solaris,</hi> a Lyzard of the Sunne, to whom <hi>Epiphanius</hi> compareth certaine Heretickes called <hi>Sapmſaei,</hi> becauſe they perceiue their eye-ſight to bee dimme and dull. They turne themſelues faſting in theyr Caues to the Eaſt, or Sunne-ryſing, whereby they recouer their eye-ſight againe.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Sarmatia,</hi> a Countrey of the <hi>Rutenes,</hi> there is a Prouince called <hi>Samogithia,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Lyzards are very thicke, blacke, and great, which the fooliſh Countrey people do worſhippe very familiarly, as the Gods of good fortune, for vvhen any good befalleth them, they intertaine them with plentifull banquets and liberall cheare: but if any harme or miſchaunce happen vnto them, then they vvith-dravv that liberality, and intreate them more courſely, and ſo theſe dizzardly people thinke to make theſe Lizards by this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> meanes, more attentiue and vigilant for theyr welfare and proſperity.</p>
            <p>In the Prouince of <hi>Caraia,</hi> Subiect to the <hi>Tartars,</hi> there are very great Lizards, (or at leaſt, wiſe Serpents like Lizard) sbred, containing in length ten yards, with an anſwerable and correſpondent compaſſe and thickneſſe.</p>
            <p>Some of theſe want their fore-Legges, in place whereof they haue clawes like the clavves of a Lyon, or talants of a Falcon. Their head is great, and their eyes like two great Loaues. Their mouth and the opening thereof ſo wide, as it may ſwallow downe a whole man armed, with great, long, and ſharp teeth, ſo as neuer any man or other creature durſt without terror looke vpon that Serpent. Wherefore they haue inuented this art or way to take them. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/>
            </p>
            <p>The Serpent vſeth in the day time to lye in the Caues of the Earth, or elſe in hollovv plaees of Rockes and Mountaines. In the night time it commeth forth to feede, ranging vp and and down ſeeking what it may deuour, neither ſparing Lyon, Beare, nor Bull, or ſmaller beaſt, but eateth all he meeteth with vntill he be ſatisfied, and ſo returneth againe to his den. Now for as much as that Countrie is very ſoft and myery: the great and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy bulke of this Serpent maketh as it were a Ditch by his weight in the ſand or mire, ſo as where you ſee the traling of his body, you would thinke there had beene rowled ſome great veſſell full of VVine, becauſe of the round and deepe impreſſion it leaueth in the earth.</p>
            <p>Now the Hunters which watch to deſtroy this Beaſt, doe in the day time faſten ſharpe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> ſtakes in the earth, in the path and paſſage of the Serpent, eſpecially neere to his hole or lodging, and theſe ſtakes are pointed vvith ſharpe Iron, and ſo couered in the Earth or Sand, whereby it commeth to paſſe, that when in his wonted manner he commeth forth in the night ſeaſon to feede, hee vnawares faſtneth his breaſt, or elſe mortally woundeth his belly vppon one of thoſe ſharpe-pointed ſtakes. Which thing the Hunters lying in waite obſeruing, do preſently vpon the firſt noyſe with their ſwords kill him if he be aliue, and ſo take out his Gall which they ſell for a great price, for therewithall the biting of a madde Dogge is cured, and a Woman in trauell taſting but a little of it, is quickely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcharged of her burthen. It is good alſo againſt the Emerods and Pyles. Furthermore, the fleſh of this Serpent is good to be eaten, and theſe things are reported by <hi>Paulus Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> and this ſtory following.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Americus Veſputius</hi> ſayled in his iourney from the fortunate Iſlands, hee came vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Countrey where hee found the people to feede vppon ſodde fleſh, like the fleſh of a Serpent, and afterwardes they found this beaſt to bee in all thinges like a Serpent vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wings, for they ſavv diuers of them aliue, taken and kept by the people to kill at their owne pleaſure. The mouthes whereof were faſt tyed with ropes, ſo as they could not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen them to bite either man or beaſt, and their bodies were tyed by the Legges. The aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of theſe beaſtes was fearefull to his company, and the ſtrangers which did behold it, for they tooke them to bee Serpents, beeing in quantity as bigge as Roe-Buckes, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing long feete and ſtronge clawes, a ſpeckeled skinne, and a face like a Serpent: from the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> Noſe to the tippe of his taile, all along the backe there grew a briſtle, as it were the briſtle of a Boare, and yet the ſaide Nation feedeth vppon them, and becauſe of their ſimilitude with Lizards, I haue thought good to inſert their relation among the Lyzards in this place, leauing it to the further iudgement of the Reader, whether they be of this kind or not.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="207" facs="tcp:22894:109"/>
In <hi>Calechut</hi> there are Serpents alſo, or rather beaſts remaining in the fenny places of the Country, whoſe bodies are all pild without haire like Serpents: alſo in their mouth, eies, and taile they reſemble them, and in their feete Lizards, being as great as Boares, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they want poyſon, yet are their teeth very hurtfull where they faſten them. Like vnto theſe are certaine others bred in <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> in an Iſland called <hi>Hyuana,</hi> hauing pric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles on their backe, and a combe on their head, but without voyce, hauing foure feete, &amp; a taile like Lizards, with very ſharpe teeth. They are not much greater then Hares or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, yet they liue indifferently in trees, and on the earth, being very patient, and induring famme many daies. Their skinne ſmooth and ſpeckled like a Serpents, &amp; they haue a crap on the belly from the chin to the breaſt, like the crap of a Bird. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides theſe, there are alſo ſome called <hi>Bardati,</hi> about the bigneſſe of Conyes, and of a White-aſh-colour, yet theyr skinne and taile like a Snakes, and they reſemble trapped Horſes. They haue foure feet, and with the formoſt they dig them holes in the earth, our of which they are drawne againe like Conies to be eaten of men, for they haue a pleaſant taſt. To conclude, wee doe read that in the yeare 1543. there came many winged Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents and Lizards into Germany, neere <hi>Syria,</hi> and did bite many mortally: And in the yeare 1551. there were ſuch bred in the bodyes of men and women, as wee haue ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed already in the generall diſcourſe of Serpents, firſt of all recited in the beginning.</p>
            <p>In all the nature of Lizards, there is nothing more admirable then that which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of them by <hi>Aelianus</hi> of his owne knowledge. When a certaine man had taken a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> great fat Lizard, he did put out her eyes with an Inſtrument of Braſſe, and ſo put her into a new earthen pot, which hadde in it two ſmall holes or paſſages, bigge inough to take breath at, but too little to creepe out at, and with her moyſt earth and a certaine Hearbe, the name wherof he doth not expreſſe: and furthermore, he tooke an Iron Ring, wherein was ſet an <hi>Engagataes</hi> Stone, with the Picture of a Lizard ingrauen vpon it. And beſides, vpon the Ring he made 9. ſeuerall marks, whereof he put out euery day one, vntill at the laſt hee came at the ninth, and then hee opened the pot againe, and the Lizard did ſee as perfectly as euer he did before the eyes were put out, whereof <hi>Albertus</hi> enquiring the reaſon, could giue none, but hauing read in <hi>Iſidorus,</hi> that when the Lizards grow olde, and their ſight dimme or thicke, then they enter into ſome narrow hole of a Wall, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> ſo ſet their heads therein, directly looking towards the Eaſt or Sunne ryſing, and ſo they recouer their ſight againe. Of this <hi>Albertus</hi> giueth good reaſon, becauſe he ſaith, the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of their blindneſſe commeth from frigidity congealing the humor in their eyes, which is afterward attenuated and diſſolued by the helpe and heate of the Sun. The voice of the Lizard is like the voyce of other Serpents, and if it happen that any man by chance doe cut the body of the Lizard aſunder, ſo as one part falleth from another, yet neither part dyeth, but goeth away vppon the two Legges that are left, and liue apart for a little ſeaſon, and if it happen that they meete againe, they are ſo firmely and naturally conioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the ſecret operation of nature, as if they had neuer beene ſeuered, onely the ſcatre remaineth. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/>
            </p>
            <p>They liue in caues of the earth, and in graues, and the greene Lizards in the fields and Gardens, but the yellowiſh or earthy browne Lizard among hedges and Thornes. They deuoure any thing that comes to their mouth, eſpecially Bees, Emmets, Palmer-wormes, Graſſehoppers, Locuſts, and ſuch like thinges, and foure months of the yeare they lie in the earth and eate nothing.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of the yeare about March, they come out againe of their holes, and giue themſelues to generation, which they performe by ioyning their bellies together, wreathing their tailes together, &amp; other parts of their bodies afterwards the female bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth egges, which ſhe committeth to the earth, neuer ſitting vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, but forgetteth in what place they were laid (for ſhe hath no memory.) The young ones are conceiued of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> themſelues, by the help of the ſun. Some there be which affirme, that the old one deuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the young ones aſſoone as they be hatched, except one which ſhe ſuffereth to liue, &amp; this one is the baſeſt &amp; moſt dullard, hauing in it leaſt ſpirit of all the reſidue; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, afterwards it deuoureth both his parents, which thing is prooued falſe by <hi>Alber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> for ſeeing they want memory to finde out their owne Egges, it is not likely that they
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:22894:110"/>
haue ſo much vnderſtanding as to diſcerne their own young ones, nor yet ſo vnnaturall as to deſtroy the nobleſt of their broode, but rather they ſhould imitate the crocodile, which killeth the baſeſt and ſpareth the beſt ſpirits.</p>
            <p>It is affirmed, that they liue but halfe a yeare or ſixe months, but it is alſo falſe, for they hide themſelues the foure coldeſt monthes; and therefore it is likely they liue more then ſixe, for elſe what time ſhould they haue for generation. Twice a yeare they change their skinne, that is in the Spring and Autume like other Serpents that haue a ſoft skinne, and not hard like the Tortoyces. Their place of conception and emiſſion of their Egges is like to Birds: and therefore it is a needleſſe queſtion to inquire whether they bring egges foorth of their mouth or not, as ſome haue fooliſhly affirmed, but without all warrant of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> truth or nature.</p>
            <p>They liue by couples together, and when one of them is taken, the other waxeth mad, and rageth vppon him that tooke it, whether it be Male or Female: In the old Teſtament Lizards, Weaſels, and Mice are accounted impure beaſtes, and therefore forbidden to be eaten, not onely becauſe they liue in Graues and deſigne in conſtancy of life, but alſo Theeues and trecherous perſons. They are affraide of euery noyce, they are enemies to Bees, for they liue vpon them; and therefore in ancient time they mixed Meale and iuyce of Mallowes together, and layde the ſame before the Hiues, to driue away Lizards and Crocodiles. They fight with all kind of Serpents, alſo they deuour Snailes, and contend with Toades and Scorpions. The Night-Owles and the Spiders doe deſtroy the little Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards,, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> for the Spider doth ſo long wind her thred about the iawes of the Lizard, that hee is not able to open his mouth, &amp; then ſhe faſteneth her ſtings in her braines. The Storkes are alſo enemies to Lizards, according to this ſaying of the Poet;</p>

Wee haue alſo ſhewed already, that the Inhabitants of <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> Iſle, do eate the fleſh of Lizards, and the fat after it is boyled, they vſe inſtead of Oyle.</p>
            <p>Concerning the venome or poyſon of Lizards, I haue not much to ſay, becauſe there is not much thereof written: yet they are to be reproued which deny they haue any poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon at all, for it is manifeſt, that the fleſh of Lizards eaten, (I meane of ſuch Lizards as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> are in Italy,) do cauſe an inflamation and apoſtemation, the heare of the head-ach, and blindneſſe of the eyes. And the Egges of Lizards doc kill ſpeedily, except there come a remedy from Faulkens dung and pure VVine. Alſo when the Lizard byteth, he leaueth his teeth in the place, which continually aketh, vntill the teeth bee taken out: the cure of which wound is firſt to ſuck the place, then to put into it cold water, &amp; afterward to make a plaiſter of Oyle and Aſhes, and apply the ſame therevnto. And thus much for the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall deſcription of the Lizard.</p>
            <p>The Medicines ariſing out of the Lizard, are the ſame which are in the Crocodile, and the fleſh thereof is very hot: wherefore it hath vertue to make fat, for if the fatte of a Lizard bee mixed vvith Wheate Meale, Halinitre, and Cummen, it maketh Hennes ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fat, and they that eate them much fatter: for <hi>Cardan</hi> ſaith, that their bellies will breake <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> vvith fatneſſe, and the ſame giuen vnto Hawkes, maketh them to chaunge theyr Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. <note place="margin">Marcellus</note>

<pb n="209" facs="tcp:22894:110"/>
applyed thereunto, and it is alſo ſaid, that if it bee mingled with Oyle, it cauſeth hayre to to grow againe vpon the head of a man, where an Vlcer made it fall off. Likewiſe a Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard cut aſunder hot, and ſo applyed, cureth the ſtinging of Scorpions, and taketh away Wennes.</p>
            <p>In Ancient time with a field-Lizard dryed and cut aſunder, and ſo bruzed in peeces, they did draw out teeth without paine, and with one of theſe ſod and ſtamped, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed vvith Meale or Frankenſence to the forehead, did cure the watering of the eyes.</p>
            <p>The ſame burned to powder, and mixed with Creticke Hony by an oyntment, cureth blindneſſe.

They onely abound in Italy, and it is a beaſt very louing and friendly vnto man, and an enemy to all other Serpentes. For if at any time they ſee a man, they inſtantly gather about him, and laying their heads at the one ſide, with great admiration behold his face: and if it chance a man doe ſpet, they licke vp the

The poore Lizard came running vnto the behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and ſhewed he bloodie ſide, as it were deſiring helpe and commizeration, ſtanding ſtill when they ſtood ſtill, and following when they went forward, ſo that it acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the ſoueraigntie of man, appealing vnto him as the chiefe Iuſtice, againſt all his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and oppreſſours.</p>
            <p>It is reported by the Italians, that many times while men fall aſleepe in the fieldes, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents come creeping vnto them, and finding their mouthes open, doe ſlyde downe into their ſtomacks: Wherfore, when the Lizard ſeeth a Serpent comming toward a man ſo <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> ſleeping, ſhe waketh him, by gently ſcratching his hands and face, whereby hee eſcapeth death and deadly poyſon.</p>
            <p>The vſe of theſe Greene-Lizards, is by their skinne and gall to keepe apples from rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and alſo to driue away Catterpillers, by hanging vp the skinne on the tops of trees, and by touching the apples with the ſaid gall: alſo when the head, feete or intralls are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <note place="margin">Palladius. Pliny.</note> away, the fleſh of the Greene-Lyzard, is giuen in meate to one that hath the Sciatica, and thus much for the naturall vſes of the Greene-Lyzard.</p>
            <p>The remedies ariſing out of this Lyzard, are briefely theſe: firſt it is vſed to be giuen to Hawkes, and to be eaten in ſmall peeces, prouided ſo as it be not touched vvith theyr tallants, for it will hurt their feete, &amp; draw their clawes together; alſo they ſeeth it in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> then beate it in a morter. Laſtly, when they haue powred warme water vppon it, they let the Hawke waſh her feete in it, and ſo it cauſeth her to caſt her old feathers and coate, and bringeth a new in the roome thereof. This Lyzard eaten with ſauces to take avvay the loathing thereof, is good for the Falling-euill: and beeing ſod in three pynts of vvine, vntill it be but one cup-full, and thereof taken euery day a ſpoonefull, is good for them that haue a diſeaſe in the lunges. It is alſo profitable for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that haue paine in the loynes. <note place="margin">Marcellus</note> And there are many wayes to prepare it for the eyes, which I will not ſtand to relate in this place, becauſe they are ſuperſtitious, and therefore likely to doe more harme then good to the Engliſh Reader.</p>
            <p>There is an oyle made of Lyzards, which is very precious, and therfore I will deſcribe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> it as I find it in <hi>Braſauolus.</hi> Take ſeauen greene Lyzards, and ſtrangle them in two pound of common oyle, therein let them ſoke three dayes, and then take them out, &amp; afterwards vſe this oyle to annoynt your face euery day, but one little drop at once, and it ſhall won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully amend the ſame. The reaſon hereof ſeemeth to be taken from the operation of the dunge or excrements, becauſe that hath vertue to make the face white, and to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the ſpots.</p>
            <p>If the vpper part in the paſtorne of a horſe be broken, put thereinto this oyle with a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle vineger, then rub the hoofe about there-with, ſo ſhall it increaſe and grow again, &amp; all the paine thereof ſhall paſſe away. The making of the medicine is this. Take a newe ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then pot, put there-into three pints of oyle, wherein you muſt drowne your Lyzards, &amp; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> ſo ſeeth them till they are burned away, then take out the bones, and put in ſoft lyme, halfe a pound, liquid pitch a pint, of Swines-greace two pound, then let them be all ſod toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againe, and afterwards preſerued, and vſed vpon the hoofe as need ſhall require: for it ſhall faſten and harden the horſes hoofe, &amp; there is nothing better for this purpoſe then this oyle. The aſhes of a greene Lizard do reduce skars in the body to their owne colour.</p>

The bones of a Greene-Lyzard are good againſt the falling euill, if they bee prepared on this manner following: put your Greene-Lizard aliue into a veſſell full of Salt, and there ſhut it in ſafe, ſo in few daies it vvill conſume all the fleſh and Intrals from the bones, and ſo the bones may bee taken and vſed in this caſe like the hoofe of an Elke, which are very precious for this ſickneſſe, and no leſſe precious are theſe bones. The bloud dooth cure the beating, bruizinges, and thicke skinnes in the feet of men and beaſts, beeing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed in flockes of wooll.</p>
            <p>The eye is ſuperſtitiouſly giuen to be bound to ones arme on a Quartane-Ague, and the eyes preſſed out aliue, and ſo included in golden buttons or Bullets, &amp; carryed about, do alſo help the paine of the eyes, and in default hereof the bloud taken out of the eyes in a peece of purple wooll, hath the ſame operation. The hart of a Lizard is alſo very good <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> againſt the exulcerations of the Kings euill, if it bee but carryed about in the booſome in ſome ſmall Siluer veſſell. The gall taketh away the hayres vpon the eye-liddes that are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemely, if it be dryed in the ſame to the thickeſſe of Hony; eſpecially in the Dog-daies, &amp; mixed with white-wine, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being annoynted vpon the place, it neuer ſuffereth the haires to grow againe. And thus much for the hiſtorie of the greene Lizard.</p>

            <p>It is a very dangerous Serpent to meete withall, and therefore not onely the valianteſt man, but alſo the ſtrongeſt beaſt is, and ought iuſtly to be afraide thereof, for his treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous deceits and ſtrength of body; for when it hath gotten the prey or booty, he beclaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> it with his taile, and giueth it fearefull blowes, in the meane time faſteneth his iawes or chaps to the man or beaſt, and ſucketh out all the bloud till it be fully ſatisfied, and like a Lyon he beateth alſo his owne ſides, ſetting vp the ſpires of his body when he aſſaulteth any aduerſary, or taketh any reſiſting booty.

            <p>The nature of it is very hot, and therefore venomous in the ſecond degree: wherefore when it hath bitten any, there followeth putrifaction and rottenneſſe, as fleſh where wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter lyeth betwixt the skinne, like as in the Dropſie: for beſides, the common affections it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> hath with the Viper, and the byting thereof, alike in all thinges, more deadly and vnreſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable euils followeth as drouzy, ſleepineſſe, and lethargy, paine in the belly, eſpecially the collicke, paine in the Liuer and ſtomacke, killing within two daies if remedy bee not prouided.</p>

ſmall ſpots on the ſides and belly: yet ſometimes there are of them that are of a duſty ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy colour, and towards the tayle yellowiſh. The skinne is ſtrong and hard, ſo as a knyfe can ſcarſe cut the ſame, and beeing cut, there iſſueth out a kind of white mattery liquour, like as is in Salamanders.</p>
            <p>

            <p>Beeing taken, it ſhutteth the mouth ſo hard as it cannot be eaſily opened, neither doth it endeuour to byte although it be plucked and prouoked. The tongue is very ſhort and broade, and the teeth ſo ſhort and ſmall, as they are ſcarcely viſible within the lippes. Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> the fore-feete it hath foure fingers or clawes, but vppon the hinder feete it hath fiue. The tayle ſtandeth out betwixt the hinder legges in the midle, like the figure of a wheele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whirle, or rather ſo contracted, as if many of them were conioyned together, &amp; the voyd or empty places in the coniunctions were filled vp. The tayle beeing cutte off, liveth lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then the body, as may be ſeene in euery dayes experience, that is, by motion giueth longer ſignes and token of lyfe.</p>
            <p>This Serpent is bredde in fatte waters and ſoyles, and ſometimes in the ruines of olde walls, eſpecially they delight in white muddy waters, hiding themſelues vnder ſtones in the ſame water if there be any, and if not, then vnder the banks ſides of the earth, for they ſildome come to the Land. They ſwymme vnderneath the water, and are rarely ſeene at <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> the toppe. Theyr egges are not paſt ſo bigge as peaſe, and they are found hanging toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in cluſters. One of theſe beeing put aliue into a glaſſe of water, did continually hold his head aboue the water like as Frogges doe, ſo that therby it may be coniectured it doth often neede reſpiration, and keepeth not vnder water except in feare, and ſeeking after meate.</p>
            <p>There is nothing in nature that ſo much offendeth it as ſalt, for ſo ſoone as it is layde vppon ſalt, it endeuoureth with all might &amp; maine to runne away, for it byteth &amp; ſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the little beaſt aboue meaſure, ſo that it dyeth ſooner by lying in ſalt where it cannot auoyde, then it would by ſuffering many ſtripes, for beeing beaten it liueth long, &amp; dieth very hardly. It doth not like to be without water, for if you try one of them, and keepe it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> out of water but one day, it will be found to be much the worſe.</p>
            <p>Beeing mooued to anger, it ſtandeth vpon the hinder legges, and looketh directlie in the face of him that hath ſtirred it, and ſo continueth till all the body be white, through a kind of white humour or poyſon, that it ſwelleth outward, to harme (if it were poſſible) the perſon that did prouoke it. And by this is their venomous nature obſerued to be like the Salamander, although theyr continuall abode in the water, maketh their poyſon the more weake.</p>
            <p>Some ſay that if in Fraunce a hogge doe eate one of theſe, hee dyeth thereof, and yet doth more ſafely eate the Salamander. But in England it is otherwiſe, for I haue ſeene a hogge without all harme carry in his mouth a Newte, &amp; afterward eate it. There be ſome <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> Apothecaries which doe vſe this Newte in ſteed of Scinks or Crocodiles of the earth, but they are deceiued in the vertues and operation, and do alſo deceiue other, for there is not in it any ſuch wholeſome properties, and therefore not to be applyed without ſinguler danger. And thus much may ſuffice to be ſaid for this little Serpent, or water-creeping creature.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Will not contrary their opinion which reckon the Salamander among the kinds of Lyzards, but leaue the aſſertion as ſomewhat tollerable: yet they are not to be followed, or to be beleeued, which would make it a kinde of Worme, for there is not in that opinion eyther reaſon or reſemblance. What this beaſt is called among the Hebrewes I cannot learne, and therfore I iudge that the Iewes (like many other Nations) did not acknowledge that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> there was any ſuch kinde of creature, for ignorance bringeth infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitie in ſtrange things and propoſitions.</p>
            <p>The Graecians call it <hi>Salamandra,</hi> which word or terme is retained almoſt in all Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, eſpecially in the Latine, and therefore <hi>Iſidore</hi> had more boldneſſe and wit, then reaſon, to deriue the Latine <hi>Salamandra, quaſi valincendram,</hi> reſiſting burning, for bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Greeke word, it needeth not a Latine notation. The Arabians call it <hi>Saambras,</hi> and <hi>Samabras,</hi> which may wel be thought to be deriued or rather corrupted, from the former word <hi>Salamandra,</hi> or elſe from the Hebrew word <hi>Semamit,</hi> which ſignifieth a Stellion. Among the Italians and Rhaetians it retaineth the Latine vvord, and ſometimes in Rhae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia it is called <hi>Roſada.</hi> In the dukedome of Sauoy, <hi>Pluuina.</hi> In Fraunce, <hi>Sourd, Blande, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brenne,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> and <hi>Arraſsade,</hi> according to the diuers Prouinces in that Kingdome. In Spayne it is called <hi>Salamantegna.</hi> In Germany it is called by diuers names, as <hi>Maall,</hi> and <hi>Punter maall, Olm, Moll,</hi> and <hi>Molch,</hi> becauſe of a kinde of liquour in it like milke, as the Greeke word <hi>Molge,</hi> from <hi>àmelgein</hi> to ſucke milke. Some in the Country of Heluetia doe call it <hi>Quattertetesh.</hi> And in <hi>Albertus</hi> it is likewiſe called <hi>Rimatrix.</hi> And thus much may ſuffiſe for the name thereof.</p>
            <p>The deſcription of theyr ſeuerall parts followeth, which as <hi>Auicen</hi> and other Authours write, is very like a ſmall and vulgar Lyzard, except in their quantitie, which is greater, theyr legges taller, and their tayle longer. They are alſo thicker and fuller then a Lyzard, hauing a pale white belly, and one part of their skinne exceeding blacke, the other yellow <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> like Verdigreace, both of them very ſplendent and gliſtering, with a blacke line going all along their backe, hauing vppon it many little ſpots like eyes: And from hence it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be called a Stellion, or <hi>Animal ſtellatum,</hi> a creature full of ſtarres, and the skinne is rough and balde, eſpecially vpon the backe where thoſe ſpots are, out of which as wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the <hi>Scholiaſt,</hi> iſſueth a certaine liquour or humour, which quencheth the heate of the fire when it is in the ſame.</p>
            <p>This Salamander is alſo foure-footed like a Lyzard, and all the body ouer it is ſet with ſpots of blacke and yellow, yet is the ſight of it abhominable and fearefull to man. The <note place="margin">Matthiolus</note> head of it is great, and ſometimes they haue yellowiſh bellyes and tayles, and ſome-times earthy. It is ſome queſtion among the Learned, whether there be any diſcretion of ſexe, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> as whether there be in this kinde a male and a female. <hi>Pliny</hi> affirmeth that they neuer en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gender, and that there is not among them eyther male or female, no more then there are among Eeles. But this thing is iuſtly croſſed, both by <hi>Bellonius</hi> and <hi>Agricola,</hi> for they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme vpon their owne knowledge, that the Salamander engendereth her young ones in her belly like vnto the Viper, but firſt conceiueth egges, and ſhe bringeth forth fortie and
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:22894:115"/>
fiftie at a time, which are fully perfected in her wombe, and are able to runne or goe ſo ſoone as euer they be littered: and therefore there muſt be among them both male and female.</p>
            <p>The Countries wherein are found Salamanders, are the Region about Trent, and in the Alpes, and ſome-time alſo in Germany. The moſt commonly frequent the coldeſt and moyſteſt places, as in the ſhaddow of Woods, in hedges neere Fountaines and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, and ſome-times they are found among Corne &amp; thornes, and among Rocks. They are ſildome ſeene except it be eyther in the Spring-time, or againſt raine, &amp; for this cauſe it is called <hi>Animal vernale,</hi> and <hi>Pluuioſum,</hi> a Spring or raynie creature. And yet there were many of them found together in a hole neere vnto the Citty <hi>Sneberge</hi> in Germanie, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> in the month of February, for they loue to liue in flocks and troupes together, and at an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other time in Nouember, a liuing Salamander was found in a Fountaine. Howbeit, if at any time it be ſeene forraging out of his denne or lodging place, it is held for an aſſured preſage of rayne. But if the Spring-time fortune to be colde or froſtie, then they keepe home, and goe not viſibly abroade.</p>
            <p>Some doe affirme that it is as cold as Iſe, and that it therefore quencheth heate or fire like a peece of Iſe, which if it be true, then is the old phyloſophicall Maxime vtterly falſe, namely, that all liuing creatures are hot and moyſt, beeing compared to creatures with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out life and ſence, for there is not any dead or ſenceleſſe body that ſo quencheth fire as the Iſe doth. But the truth is, that the Salamander is cold, and colder then any Serpent, yet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> not without his naturall heate, which beeing compared to Armans, may truly be ſaid to be hot, and therefore the venome of the Salamander is reckoned among Septicks, or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roding things.</p>
            <p>It naturally loueth milke, and therefore ſome-times in the Woods or neere hedges, it ſucketh a Cow that is layde, but afterward that Cowes vdder or ſtocke dryeth vppe, and neuer more yeeldeth any milke. It alſo greatly loueth the Honny-combe, and ſome Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours haue affirmed, that they vſe to gape after ayre or freſh breath, like the Camaelion, <note place="margin">Will<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </note> yet they which haue kept Salamanders in glaſſes, neuer perceiued by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any ſuch thing.

            </p>
            <p>But the greateſt matter in the Salamander to be inquired after, is whethet it can liue and be nouriſhed by and in the fire, or whether it can pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe thorough the fire without any harme, or quench and put out the ſame. Which opinions in the very relation and firſt hearing, doe croſſe one another, for how can that either be nouriſhed or liue in the fire, which quencheth the ſame beeing put into it? <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> that neuer ſaw a Salamander himſelfe, but wrote thereof by heare-ſay, hath giuen ſome colour to this opinion, becauſe he writeth, <hi>nonulla corpora eſſe animalium quae igne non abſumantur Salamandra document<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> est: quae (vt aiunt) ignem inambulans per eum extinguit.</hi> That is to ſay, the Salamander is an euidence, that the bodies of ſome creatures are not waſted or conſumed in the fire, for (as ſome ſay) it walketh in the fire and extinguiſheth the ſame. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/>
            </p>
            <p>Now whether this beſeemed ſo great a Phyloſopher to write vppon heare-ſay, vvho tooke vpon him to gather all naturall learning into his owne Graunge or ſtore-houſe, &amp; out of the ſame to furniſh both the preſent and all future ages, I leaue it to the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of euery indifferent Reader that ſhall peruſe this ſtory. I for mine owne part, rather iudge it to be lightnes in him, to inſert a matter of this conſequence in the diſcourſe of this beaſt, without either Authours, or experience gathered by himſelfe. This one thing I maruaile at, why the Egyptians, when they will expreſſe or ſignifie a man burnt, doe in <note place="margin">Orus.</note> theyr Hierogliphicks paint a Salamander, except eyther fire can burne a Salamander, or elſe contrary to all their cuſtome, they demonſtrate one contrary by another.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nicander</hi> plainely affirmeth, that the Salamander dooth without all harme paſſe tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the fire, and the Scholiaſt addeth, that there are certaine paſſages in the skinne, out <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> of vvhich iſſueth a kind of liquour that quencheth the fire: And hee telleth a ſtory of one <hi>Andreas,</hi> who did dippe a peece of cloth in the blood of a Salamander, and tried after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward whither it would burne or not, but did not find that it would burne, wherfore he put it vppon his hand, and thruſt that into the fire, and then alſo he felt no manner of paine.
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:22894:115"/>
And therefore the ſaid <hi>Nicander</hi> calleth this creature <hi>Ciporrhinon,</hi> becauſe of a certaine fatte humour which iſſueth out of it, quenching the fire, but I rather thinke that this fat humour maketh the skinne to gliſter, for if it were properly fatte, it would rather kindle and encreaſe the fire then quench or extinguiſh the ſame.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Suidas</hi> followeth the common receiued opinion, that the Salamander quencheth the fire, (although it be not bredde of the fire as Krekets are) like Iſe, and when the fire is ſo quenched, it is in vaine to blow or kindle the ſame againe with any bellowes, as they ſay hath beene tryed in the forges of Smithes.

                  </expan> obnoxia flammis:</hi> the potent Salamander is neuer hurt by flames. <hi>Seneca</hi> conſenteth heere-vnto, and <hi>Zoroastres:</hi> and ſo great hath beene the dotage about <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> this opinion, that ſome haue written that it aſcendeth vp to the fire neere the moone, farre aboue the reach of the Eagles or ſwifteſt Fowles. Thus ſay they that write, and maintaine the Salamanders abyding in the fire without harme. Now on the contrary, let vs alſo heare their opinions, vvhich deny this naturall operation in the Salamander.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pliny</hi> affirmeth, that in his owne experience hee found that a Salamander was conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the fire, and not the fire by it, for he ſaith he burned one to powder, and vſed the ſame powder in medicines.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sextius</hi> alſo denyeth that it quencheth the fire, and vnto this opinion agreeth <hi>Dioſeori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des. Aetius</hi> writeth, that when it is firſt put into the fire, it deuideth the flame, and paſſeth thorough ſpeedily without harme, but if it tarry long therein it is burned and conſumed, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> becauſe the liquour or humiditie thereof is waſted. And this is alſo graunted by <hi>Galen, Theophraſtus,</hi> and <hi>Niphus.</hi> And <hi>Matthaeolus</hi> affirmeth that hee tryed the ſame, and found that if burning coales were layde vppon it, then it burned like vnto any other rawe fleſh, but beeing caſt into the fire, it burneth not ſpeedily.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Albertus</hi> writeth, that there were ſome which brought to him a certaine thing which they called Wooll, and ſaid that it would not burne, but he found it not <hi>Laua,</hi> vvooll, but <hi>Lamygo,</hi> that is, a vapoury adhaerencie of a thing which flyeth from the ſtrokes o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The ſaid Authour affirmeth, that hee tooke a Spyder, and layde the ſame vpon a hot <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> burning yron, where it continued vnburned and vnharmed without motion a great while, by reaſon of his thicke skinne and coldneſſe, and vnto another hee ſuffered a little Candle to be put, which inſtantly put it out. And for the ſame cauſes, that is to ſay, both the thickneſſe of the skinne, and cold conſtitution, commeth it to paſſe, that a Salaman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der can liue ſo long in the fire without burning or conſuming to aſhes, for indeed the skin thereof is ſo hard, that it is cutte or pierced with a knife with great difficultie: And ſo when the force of the fire hath broken the skinne, then alſo iſſueth foorth a cold humour, which for a ſeaſon keepeth the heate out. For this beaſt is ſaid to be very full of humour, and the certaintie thereof may moſt manifeſtly appeare by his full and groſſe body, and alſo by this, that it is ſildome ſeene to iſſue or come forth of his denne, except it be againſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> raynie weather: and yet as the egges of other Serpents beeing caſt into a hot burning fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, do for a ſeaſon reſt in the ſame vnburned, &amp; yet are afterward conſumed, ſo is it with the Salamander.</p>
            <p>There be ſome that haue found a webbe out of the hayre growing vppon Salaman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, vvhich can by no meanes be ſette on fire, but this is very falſe, becauſe the Salaman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <note place="margin">Cordus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> hath no haire vpon it at all. And this kind of webbe rather commeth of a kind of flaxe that <hi>Pliny</hi> vvriteth of, or rather of the Amiantus-ſtone, called the <hi>Asbest,</hi> which is found in Cyprus, whereof they vſed to make couerings for the Theaters. This beeing caſt into <note place="margin">Dioſcorid.</note> a fire, ſeemes to be forthwith all in a flame, but beeing taken out againe, it ſhyneth the more gloriouſly. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/>
            </p>
            <p>Some alſo doe affirme, that ſuch a peece of cloth or webbe, may be wrought out of the Salamanders skin, but <hi>Braſauolus</hi> denyeth both the vertue of the ſtone, and of the Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders hyde or ſhell, for hee ſaith hee tried the ſtone, and it would not be wrought into wooll or ſpun into thred, and when hee caſt the Salamanders ſhell or hide into the fire, it burned, and the mattery cold liquor thereof did almoſt flye into his face.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="220" facs="tcp:22894:116"/>
But ſome then will demaund, where had Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> that coate, which could not be purged but by fire, which made it alway as white as ſnow, or that map or net at Rome wherin (it is ſaid) the napkin of our Sauiour <hi>Christ</hi> is preſerued, which men ſay is not wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed but in the fire, which thing was ſent to a Biſhop of Rome for a preſent from the king of Tartars. Vnto whom I aunſwer out of <hi>Paulus Venetus</hi> as foloweth. There is a prouince in Tartaria called <hi>Chinchnitalas,</hi> wherein is a mountaine abounding with Mines of Steele and Copper; now in this Mountaine there is a kind of earth digged vp, which yeeldeth a thred like the thred of wooll. After the digging of it vp they dry it in the ſunne, and then beate it in a brazen morter, afterward they ſpinne it and weaue it, in the ſame maner that they ſpin and weaue other wollen cloth. After it is made, they haue no meanes to purge <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> it from ſpots or from filthines, but to caſt it into the fire for the ſpace of an houre, and then it is taken forth againe as white as any ſnow.</p>
            <p>There is alſo an Allum called <hi>Alumen Sciolae,</hi> and it is the ſame which among the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients is called <hi>Aſter ſamius,</hi> out of which alſo is made cloth that cannot burne, by reaſon of a certaine oyle that it containeth or yeeldeth to reſiſt the fire. So out of the ſtone <hi>Pyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis</hi> found in <hi>Kiſheba,</hi> there commeth out a greene liquour preſſed with dead coales, &amp; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">Cardan.</note> that, no fire can burne that cloth. There are alſo certaine Mantles in Bohemia, (as wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth <hi>Agricola)</hi> which could neuer be burned. And out of the <hi>Magneſia</hi> a ſcaly ſtone in <hi>Boldecrana,</hi> they make tables, which cannot be clenſed but by fire. It is alſo recorded, that the fore-named <hi>Aster ſamius</hi> and pitch quenched in the iuyce of Mallowes or Mercuriall, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> beeing annoynted vpon a mans hand, doth keepe them from burning, or ſence of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary heate. So <hi>Albertus</hi> writeth of a ſtone which he calleth <hi>Iſcullos,</hi> or <hi>Iſcuſtos,</hi> which I take to be a kind of the <hi>Asbeste</hi> or <hi>Amiantus.</hi> And this ſtone is found (as the ſame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour writeth) in the fartheſt parts of Spaine, neere the Straights and <hi>Hercules-pillers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this thing ſeemeth the leſſe ſtrange<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe they which are annoynted with bird<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime, or elſe with vineger and the white of an egge, do not ſo quickly feele the ſtrength of fire and heate, when they thruſt theyr hands into the midſt of it. It is alſo found, that the harts of them that dye of the hart-burning diſeaſe, or elſe are killed by poyſon, cannot be <note place="margin">Pliny.</note> burned with fire. And therefore when <hi>Germanicus Caeſar</hi> was dead, it being ſuſpected that he was poyſoned by <hi>Piſo,</hi> they caſt his hart into the fire and it would not burne, vvhich <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> thing was alleadged againſt him by <hi>Vitellius</hi> the Oratour. And one <hi>Aeſculapius</hi> in an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle which he wrote to <hi>Octauian Augustus</hi> ſaith, that there is a poyſon ſo extreame cold, that it keepeth the hart of a man poyſoned there-with from burning, and if it lye long in the fire, it waxeth as hard as a ſtone, which ſo concreted is called <hi>Profilis,</hi> from the force of the fire, and from the matter whereof it conſiſteth it is called an humane ſtone. Hee alſo ſaith, that this is redde in colour, mixed with ſome white, and is accounted precious, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe both it maketh a man that weareth it to be a Conquerour, and alſo preſerueth him from all manner of poyſon.</p>
            <p>When the Salamander is prouoked, it caſteth foorth a white mattery liquour or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and it is an audacious and bold creature, ſtanding to his aduerſary, and not flying <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> the ſight of a man; and ſo much the leſſe, if it perceiue that a man proſecute and follow it, to harme and kill it. The byting of it is very exitiall and deadly, and therefore the French men vſe this ſpeech vpon the byting of a Salamander.

            <p>That is, if a Salamander byte you, then betake you to the coffin and winding ſheete. The <hi>Rhaetians</hi> alſo doe ordinarily affirme, that when a man is bytten by a Salamander, he hath neede of as many Phiſitians as the Salamander hath ſpots. And <hi>Arnoldus</hi> ſaith, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> it hath in it as many venoms and meanes of hurting, as it hath colours diſtinguiſhed one from another. For when it once byteth and faſteneth teeth, it neuer letteth goe, and bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pulled of, it leaueth the teeth behind, and then there neuer can be any remedie, and therefore it muſt be ſuffered to hang vpon the wound vntill it fall off, eyther willingly or wearied, or els compelled by the medicines that the wounded patient receiueth. For by
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:22894:116"/>
this meanes onely is the patient kept aliue: yet this is alway to be remembred, that the Salamander doth not alway bite, although prouoked, for <hi>Geſner</hi> affirimeth, that hee ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing two of them, could neuer by beating make them open their mouthes, nor that in all his life did he euer heare of any man bytten by them. And of this thing hee not onely ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth the difference of time, wherein their rage ſheweth it ſelfe by byting, and when not, but alſo the difference of place and region, for that they byte in ſome Countries, and not in other. When they haue bitten, there followeth a vehement payne and ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>The poyſon hereof is great, and not inferiour to the poyſon of any other Serpent, for ſometimes by creeping vpon Apple-trees, it infecteth and poyſoneth all the fruite, ſo that thoſe which eate the ſame, dye and languiſh they know not whereof: and if the heele of a man doe but touch any ſmall part or portion of the ſpettle of a Salamander, it maketh all the hayre of the body to fall of. The poyſon it ſelfe is not cold, as ſome haue thought, but <note place="margin">Aelianus.</note> hote, like to the poyſon of Cantharides, and therefore to be cured by the ſame meanes, as by vomits, Glyſters, Ephemeron, and ſuch like. Onely Swyne doe eate Salamanders without harme or damage, for there is in them a kinde of reſiſtance in nature, and yet if man or dogge doe chaunce to eate of that Swyne that hath eaten a Salamander, it hath beene obſerued that they perriſhed by the ſame. And this poyſon ſpreadeth it ſelfe the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther when it is dead, becauſe it is ſtrengthened by putrefaction, and wine or water wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> one of theſe lyeth dead, is empoyſoned &amp; made mortall thereby to others. But in our dayes Salamanders are not ſo venomous, if there be any credite in <hi>Braſauolus,</hi> howbeit I haue heard and read, that if at this day a Salamander g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And as <hi>Arnoldus</hi> writeth, it caſteth forth a certaine mattery white humour like milke out of the mouth, wherevpon, if a man or any other liuing creature doe but tread, he is poyſoned thereby, and at the leaſt, all the hayre of their body falleth off, and in like ſort they in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Sometimes it happeneth that beaſts or men haue ſwallowed Salamanders, and then the tongue is inflamed, and all the body falleth into grieuous torment, by cold corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and putrefaction, part after part, and alſo paines in the fundament &amp; in the ſtomack, likewiſe dropſies, and impoſtumation, in the belly, crampe of the guttes, and relention of vrine. For the cure whereof they giue ſweete water, Calamynts, Saint Iohns-wort, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Out of the Salamander it ſelfe ariſe alſo ſome medicines, for it hath a ſeptick power to eate and corrode to take away hayres, and the powder thereof cureth cornes and hardnes in the feete. The hart tyed to the wriſt in a blacke skinne, taketh away a quartane-Ague, and alſo <hi>Kiradides</hi> writeth, that being bound vnto a womans thigh, it ſtayeth her month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie flowers, and keepeth her barren: But this is worthily reproued for vntruth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will not commend it to the Reader.

            <p>The kindes of Scorpions I finde alſo to be many, but generally they may be referred vnto twayne, whereof one is called the Scorpion of the earth, and the other the Scorpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the water or of the Sea, whoſe diſcourſe or hiſtory is to be found among the fiſhes, for we in this place doe onely write of the Scorpion of the earth, which is alſo called by <hi>Auicen</hi> a wild Scorpion. Of this kind there are many differences. Firſt they differ in ſex, for there are males and females, and the female is greater then the male, beeing alſo fatte, hauing a groſſer body, and a greater &amp; ſharper ſting, but the male is more fierce then the female. Againe, ſome of theſe haue wings, and ſome are without wings, and ſome are in <note place="margin">Gillius.</note> quantitie greater then a Beane, as in Heluetia, neere <hi>Rapirſnill</hi> by <hi>Zuricke.</hi> The Scorpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons called <hi>Vinulae,</hi> are of reddiſh colour, as it were roſe-water and wine mixed together: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> and from thence it is probable that they tooke their name, and from their colour, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours haue obſerued ſeauen ſeuerall kinds.</p>
            <p>The firſt is white, and the byting of this is not deadly.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is reddiſh, like fire flamant, and this when it hath wounded cauſeth thirſt.</p>
            <p>The third is of a pale colour, and therefore called by the Graecians <hi>Zophorides,</hi> &amp; theſe when they haue wounded a man, cauſe him to liue in continuall motion and agitation of his body, ſo as he cannot ſtand ſtill, but remaineth diſtract &amp; without wit, alway laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, like a foole.</p>
            <p>The fourth kind is greeniſh, and therefore termed <hi>Chloaos,</hi> which hauing wounded, cauſeth intollerable trembling, ſhaking and quiuering, and alſo cold, ſo that if the patient <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> be layd in the hot ſunne, yet he thinketh that he freezeth like hayle, or rather feeleth hayle to fall vpon him.</p>
            <p>The fift kind is blackiſh-pale, and it is called <hi>Empelios,</hi> it hath a great belly and broade, whereof the poyſon is great, and cauſeth after ſtinging an admirable heauineſſe, and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull ſpirit. This kind is called by <hi>Geſner, Ventricoſum,</hi> becauſe of the large belly, by the Arabians <hi>Algetarat,</hi> and by <hi>Ponzettus, Geptaria.</hi> It eateth herbes, and the bodyes of men, and yet remaineth inſatiable, it hath a bunch on the backe, and a tayle longer then other Scorpions.</p>
            <p>The ſixt is like a Crabbe, &amp; this is called by <hi>Elianus</hi> a flamant Scorpion, it is of a great body, and hath tonges and takers very ſolide and ſtrong, like the Gramuell or Creuiſh, &amp; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> is therefore thought to take the beginning from that fiſh.</p>
            <p>The ſeauenth is called <hi>Mellichlorus,</hi> becauſe of the honny-colour thereof, or rather waxe-colour, and the wings it hath on the backe, are like the wings of a Locuſt.</p>
            <p>Alſo Scorpions do differ among themſelues in regard of their outward parts, for ſome of them haue wings, as thoſe in India, which are ſpoken of by <hi>Strabo, Nicander,</hi> &amp; others, and therefore many times when they ſettle themſelues to flie, they are tranſported by the wind from one country to another.</p>
            <p>There is alſo another difference obſerued in their tayles, and in their ſtings, for ſome of them haue ſixe knots on their tayles, and ſome of them ſeauen, and thoſe which haue <note place="margin">Elianus. Pliny.</note> ſeauen, are more hardy &amp; fierce, but this falleth out very ſildome that the Scorpions haue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> ſeauen knots in their tayle, and therefore much ſildomer to haue nine, as writeth <hi>Apollo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus.</hi> For if any haue ſeauen, then is there likewiſe in them a double ſting, for there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo another difference, ſome of them hauing a ſingle, and ſome a double ſting, yea ſome-times <note place="margin">Ariſtotle</note> a treble one, and the ſting of the male is more thicke and ſtrong then the ſting of the female.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="224" facs="tcp:22894:118"/>
And to conclude, there is alſo a difference in motion, for ſome of them holde vp theyr tayles from the earth, and theſe are not much venomous, others againe draw them along vpon the earth, a little rowled together, and theſe are moſt deadly and poyſonfull, ſome of them alſo flye from one Region to another, as we haue ſhewed already.</p>
            <p>Againe, there is nothing that giueth a man a more liuely difference then the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their poyſon, for the Scorpions of <hi>Pharus,</hi> and that part of the Alpes neere <hi>Nori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum,</hi> doe neuer harme any liuing creature, and therfore are they ſuffered to abound, ſo as they liue vnder euery ſtone. In like ſort, in the Ile <hi>Sanguola,</hi> the Scorpions are like vnto thoſe that are in Caſtilia or Spayne, for there the ſting of the Scorpion dooth not bring death, yet they cauſe a ſmarting paine, like the paine that commeth by the ſtinging of a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> Waſpe, differing heerein, that the Scorpions ſtinging is more laſting &amp; continueth lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then the ſtinging of a Waſpe, for it tarrieth about a quarter of an houre, and by the byting thereof all are not payned alike, for ſome feele more, and ſome leſſer paine. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to theſe are the Scorpions of <hi>Peſcara</hi> in Affrick, who euer with theyr tayles vvound mortally. And thoſe in Scythia, which are great, and hurtfull vnto men and beaſtes, kyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <note place="margin">Pliny. Aelianus.</note> ſwyne, who doe not much care for any other ſerpent, eſpecially the blacke ſwyne, who doe alſo dye the ſooner, if they drinke immediatly after the wound receiued. The like may be ſaid of the Scorpions of Egypt. And thus much for the different kinds of Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions, wherein nature produceth a notable varietie, as may appeare by all that hath been ſaid. Now it followeth that wee likewiſe make ſome relation of theyr congruity one with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> another.</p>
            <p>They are all little liuing creatures, not much differing in proportion from the great Scarabee or Horſe-flie, except in the faſhion of theyr tailes. Their backe is broad and flat, diſtinguiſhed by certaine knots of ſeames, ſuch as may be ſeene in Sea-crabbes, yet theyr head differeth, and hath no reſemblance with the Crabbe, becauſe it is longer, and han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth farre out from the body, the countenaunce whereof is fawning, and virgin-like, and all the colour a bright browne. Notwithſtanding the fayre face, it beareth a ſharpe ſting in the tayle, which tayle is full of knots, where-withall it pricketh and hurteth that which it toucheth. And this <hi>Pliny</hi> affirmeth to be proper to this inſect, to haue a ſting in the tayle and to haue armes: For by armes hee meaneth the two croſſe ſorkes or tonges which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> come from it one both ſides, in the toppes whereof are little thinges like pynſons, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and hold faſt, that which it apprehendeth, whiles it woundeth with the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ing in the tayle.</p>
            <p>It hath eyght feete, foure on the one ſide, and foure on the other, from whence, as we haue ſhewed already, it is called <hi>Octopos.</hi> For the feete and armes therof is very much like vnto the Sea-crabbe, and therefore may not vnfitly be called eyther the Mother or the Daughter thereof. They haue alſo tongues, where-withall they vſe often to licke and ſmooth ouer theyr owne bodyes. And ſeeing of all other things they loue freſh &amp; cleane linnen, whereinto they inſinuate and wrappe themſelues when they can come vnto it, then alſo firſt of all they clenſe theyr whole bodyes all ouer with theyr tongues, and next <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> to their fleſh put on this cleane linnen, as a man would put on a ſhirt.</p>
            <p>As wee haue ſaid alreadie, it hath a tayle, wherein the ſting thereof is placed, but what this ſting is, diuers Authours are of diuers opinions concerning the ſame, ſome affirming it to be hollow, others denying it, finding in it no paſſage at all to containe or couay poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. <hi>Aelianus</hi> againe ſayth, that there muſt needs be in it a paſſage or cauitie, although it be ſo ſmall, as by no meanes it can be perceiued with the eyes of any mortall man, and in that ſting is the poyſon leſſe viſible, which when it ſtriketh, diſperſeth it ſelfe inſtantly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the wound. But what ſhould this poyſon be? whether a ſubſtance or ſpirituall humor, ſurely a ſubſtaunce, which although it be <hi>Mole minima,</hi> yet <hi>facultate maxima,</hi> that is, of great power, although of ſmall quantitie. And therefore another Authour (namely <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rardus,)</hi> writeth thereof after this manner; <hi>Scorpius è centro quod cauum eſſe creditur emit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tit</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> 
               <hi>humorem venenoſum:</hi> That is to ſay, the Scorpion out of a hollow center, ſendeth foorth a venomous humour. And of this venom wee will afterwards diſcourſe more at large. Thus much in this place may ſerue, to make knowne the ſeuerall parts and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of this Serpent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="225" facs="tcp:22894:118"/>
Now then it followeth, that we enquire about the manner of their breede or generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which I find to be double, as diuers Authors haue obſerued, one way is by putrefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the other by laying of egges, and both theſe wayes are conſonant to nature, for <hi>Lacinius</hi> writeth, that ſome creatures are generated onely by propagation of ſeed, ſuch are men, Vipers, Whales, &amp; the Palme-tree, ſome againe onely by putrefaction, as the louſe, the flye, graſſe, &amp; ſuch like imperfect things, &amp; ſome both wayes, as myce, ſcorpions, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets, ſpyders, Purſlaine, which firſt of all were procuced by putrefaction: and ſince their generation are conſerued by the ſeede and egges of their owne kind. Now therefore wee will firſt of all ſpeake of the generation of Scorpions by putrefaction, and afterward by propagation. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/>

            <p>
               <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith, that when Sea-crabbes dye, and theyr bodyes are dryed vppon the earth when the Sunne entereth into <hi>Cancer</hi> and <hi>Scorpius,</hi> out of the putrefaction thereof ariſeth a Scorpion; &amp; ſo out of the putrified body of the Creuiſh burned, ariſe Scorpions, which cauſed <hi>Ouid</hi> thus to write;</p>

            <p>And therefore it is reported by <hi>Elianus,</hi> that about <hi>Eſtamenus</hi> in India, there are abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Scorpions generated, onely by corrupt raine-water ſtanding in that place. Alſo out of the Baziliske beaten into peeces and ſo putrified, are Scorpions engendered. And <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> when as one had planted the herbe <hi>Baſilica</hi> on a wall, in the roome or place thereof hee found two Scorpions.

            <p>
               <hi>Hollerius,</hi> to take away all ſcruple of this thing, writeth that in Italy in his dayes, there <note place="margin">Kramdes</note> was a man that had a Scorpion bredde in his braine, by continuall ſmelling to this herbe Baſill, and <hi>Geſner</hi> by relation of an Apothecary in Fraunce, writeth likewiſe a ſtorie of a young mayde, who by ſmelling to Baſill, fell into an exceeding head-ach, whereof ſhee dyed without cure, and after her death beeing opened, there were found little Scorpions in her braine. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/>

And wee haue ſhewed already in the hiſtory of the Crocodile, that out of the Crocodiles egges doe many times come Scorpions, which at <note place="margin">Philes Aelianus.</note> their firſt egreſſion doe kill theyr dam that hatched them, which cauſed <hi>Archelaus</hi> which wrote Epigrams of wonders vnto <hi>Ptolomaeus,</hi> to ſing of Scorpions in this manner.</p>

            </lg>
            <p>And thus much for the generation of Scorpions out of putrefaction. Now we wil pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede to the ſecond manner of their generation, which is by propagation of ſeede: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:22894:119"/>
               <hi>Ponzettus</hi> make ſome queſtion about their copulation, yet he himſelf inclineth to that opinion, as neerer vnto truth, which attributeth carnall copulation vnto them, and therefore he alledgeth the example of flyes, which admitte copulation although they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gender not thereby. Wherefore wee will take it for graunted, that Scorpions lay egges after copulation, which hapneth both in the Spring and Autumne.</p>
            <p>And theſe are for the moſt part in number eleuen, vpon which they ſit and hatch their young ones, and when once they are perfected within, thoſe egges (which are in ſight like the little wormes out of which Spyders are engendered) then doe they breake theyr egges, and driue the young out. For as <hi>Iſidorus</hi> writeth, otherwiſe the olde ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed of the young, euen as are the Crocodiles. Some againe ſay, that the old Scorpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <note place="margin">Pliny.</note> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> doe deuour theyr young ones.</p>
            <p>Beeing thus produced by generation, they liue vppon the earth, and thoſe which are bredde of the Sea-crabbe, doe feede vppon the foame of the Sea-water, and a continuall white mould or chalke neere the Sea. But the Scorpions of Ethyopia doe eate all kind of wormes, flyes, and ſmall Serpents. Yea thoſe Serpents whoſe very dunge beeing troden vpon by man, bringeth exulcerations: And a tryall that Scorpions eate flyes, was made by <hi>Wolphius</hi> at <hi>Montpelier,</hi> for hauing a young one in a boxe, for one whole month toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it liued vpon flyes, and grew by the deuouring of them bigger, beeing put into the glaſſe vnto him.</p>
            <p>They liue among tyles and bricks very willingly, and for this cauſe they abound in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> Rome in the hill called <hi>Testaceus.</hi> They are alſo in Bononia found in the walls of old hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, betwixt the ſtones and the morter. They loue alſo cleane clothes, as we haue ſayd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and yet they abhorre all places whereon the Sunne ſhyneth. And it ſeemeth that the ſunne is vtterly againſt their nature, for the ſame Scorpion which <hi>Wolphius</hi> had at <hi>Montpelier,</hi> liued in the glaſſe vntill one day he ſet in the Sunne, and then preſently after it dyed.</p>
            <p>To conclude, they loue hollow places of the earth neere gutters, and ſometimes they creepe into mens beddes, where vnawares they doe much harme: and for this cauſe the <hi>Lybians,</hi> who among other Nations are moſt of all troubled with Scorpions, do vſe to ſet theyr beddes farre from any wall, and very high alſo from the floore, to keepe the Scorpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> from aſcending vp vnto them. And yet fearing all deuiſes ſhould be too little to ſecure them againſt this euill, they alſo ſet the feete of theyr beddes in veſſells of water, that ſo the Scorpion may not attempt ſo much as to climbe vp vnto them for feare of drowning. And alſo for their further ſafegard, they were ſocks and hoſe in theyr beddes ſo thicke as the Scorpion cannot eaſily ſting thorough them.</p>
            <p>And if the bed be ſo placed that they cannot get any hold thereof beneath, then they clymbe vp to the ſieling or couer of the houſe, &amp; if there they find any hold for their pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching legges to apprehend and faſten vppon, then in their hatred to man-kind, they vſe this pollicie to come vnto him. Firſt one of them (as I haue ſaid) taketh hold vppon that place in the houſe or ſieling ouer the bed wherein they find the man aſleepe, and ſo hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <note place="margin">Aelianus.</note> thereby, putting out and ſtretching his ſting to hurt him, but finding it too ſhort, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> not beeing able to reach him, he ſuffereth another of his fellowes to come and hang as faſt by him as he doth vpon his hold, and ſo that ſecond giueth the wound: and if that ſecond be not able likewiſe, becauſe of the diſtance, to come at the man, then they both admit a third to hang vpon them, and ſo a fourth vpon the third, and a fift vpon the fourth, vntill they haue made themſelues like a chayne, to deſcend from the toppe to the bedde wherin the man ſleepeth, and the laſt ſtriketh him: after which ſtroke, he firſt of all runneth away by the backe of his fellow, and euery one againe in order, till all of them haue withdrawne themſelues.</p>
            <p>By this may be collected the crafty diſpoſition of this Scorpion, and the great ſubtiltie and malice that it is indued withall in nature, and ſeeing they can thus accord together in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> harming a man, it argueth their great mutuall loue and concord one with another, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I cannot but maruell at them, who haue written that the old ones deſtroy the young, all but one, which they ſet vpon theyr owne buttocks, that ſo the damme may be ſecured from the ſting and bytings of her ſonne. For ſeeing they can thus hang vpon one another
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:22894:119"/>
without harme, fauouring their owne kinde, I ſee no cauſe but that nature hath grafted much more loue betwixt the old and the young ones, ſo as neither the old do firſt deſtroy the young, nor afterward, that young one preſerued, in reuenge of his fellowes quarrell, killeth his Parents.</p>
            <p>It is reported by <hi>Aristotle,</hi> that there is a hill in <hi>Caria</hi> wherein the Scorpions doe neuer ſting any ſtrangers that lodge there, but onely the naturall borne people of that country. And heere-vnto <hi>Pliny</hi> and <hi>Elianus</hi> ſeeme to ſubſcribe, when they write that <hi>Scorpiones ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traneos leniter mordere,</hi> that is, Scorpions byte ſtrangers but gently. And heereby it may be collected, that they are alſo by nature very ſagacious, and can diſcerne betwixt nature and nature; yea the particuler differences in one &amp; the ſame nature. To conclude, Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> haue no power to hurt, where there is no blood.</p>
            <p>The naturall amity and enmity they obſerue with other creatures commeth now to be handled, and I find that it wanteth not aduerſaries, nor it againe hath no defect of poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or malice to make reſiſtance and oppoſition, and to take vengeance on ſuch as it mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth withall. The principall of all other ſubiects of their hatred are virgins and vvomen, whom they doe not onely deſire to harme, but alſo when they haue harmed, are neuer <note place="margin">Albertue.</note> perfectly recouered. And this is at all times of the day, but vnto men they are moſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous in the morning faſting, before they haue vented their poyſon, and this is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, that their tayles are neuer vnprouided of ſtings, and ſufficient ſtore of venome, to hurt vpon all occaſions. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/>
            </p>
            <p>The Lyon is by the Scorpion put to flight whereſoeuer hee ſeeth it, for he feareth it as the enemy of his life, and therefore writeth S. <hi>Ambroſe, Exigno Scorpionis aculeo exagita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur Leo,</hi> the Lyon is much mooued at the ſmall ſting of a Scorpion. Scorpions doe alſo deſtroy other Serpents, and are likewiſe deſtroyed by them. There was one <hi>Cellarius</hi> a Phiſitian in Padua, who put together into one viall a Viper and a Scorpion, where they continually fought together vntill they had killed one another. The Swyne of Scythia, which doe ſafely eate all other kind of Serpents and venomous beaſts, without all harme, <note place="margin">Aelianus</note> yet are deſtroyed by eating of Scorpions, and ſo great is the poyſon of the <hi>Sibarite</hi> Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion, that the dung thereof beeing trode vppon, breedeth vlcers.</p>
            <p>And as in this manner we ſee the virulence, and naturall euill of Scorpions againſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> liuing creatures, ſo now we are to conſider the terrours of the Scorpion, for God in nature hath likewiſe ordained ſome bodies, whereby the Scorpion ſhould be, and is dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen away, ſcarred, and deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>Firſt of all therefore men, which are the cheefe, and head of all liuing creatures, do by naturall inſtinct, kill and deſtroy Scorpions, and therefore <hi>Galen</hi> wryteth thus, Let vs (ſaith he) kill Scorpions, Spyders and Vipers, not becauſe they are euill in themſelues, but becauſe it is ingrafted in vs by nature, to loue that which is good vnto vs, but to hate and auert from that which is euill vnto vs, <hi>Non conſider antes genitum ne it a ſit an ſecus,</hi> not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering whether it were ſo bred or not. As we haue ſhewed their generation out of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction to be by heate, ſo alſo is their deſtruction by heate, for they are not able to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> the heate of the ſunne, and therefore, although they cannot liue in cold Northerne Countries, but in the hotter, yet in the hotter they chooſe ſhaddowes, holes of the earth, couerture of houſes, and ſuch like vile and obſcure places, to ſuccour and ſecure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in.</p>
            <p>It is alſo reported, that if Scorpions doe at any time behold a Stellion, they ſtand ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed and wonderfully aſtoniſhed. The Viper alſo hauing killed a Scorpion, becommeth <note place="margin">Gallen.</note> more venomous, and the Ibis of Egypt deſtroyeth Scorpions.

            <p>Now this vertue againſt Scorpions, is not onely in liuing things, but alſo in the plants of the earth, &amp; therefore <hi>Sestius</hi> writeth, that the ſeede of Noſe-wort burned or ſcorched

            <p>Theſe and ſuch like things are obſerued by our painefull and induſtrious Aunceſtours about the nature of Scorpions, as well that which is hurtfull vnto them, &amp; they are afraid of, as thoſe to which they are enemies in nature, &amp; wound mortally when they light vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them. It is remembred by <hi>Textor,</hi> that <hi>Orion</hi> was ſlaine by a Scorpion, vvherevpon the Poets haue made many tales. They ſay that when he was growne to be a man, he was a great hunter, and a continuall companion of <hi>Diana,</hi> who glorying much in his ovvne ſtrength, boaſted that he was able to ouer-come any Serpent, or other wild beaſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at the Gods beeing angry, for reuenge &amp; taking downe the pride of this young man, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the earth to bring forth a Scorpion, who killed <hi>Orion.</hi> Whereat <hi>Diana</hi> was very ſory, and therefore in lamentation of her champion, and for the good deedes he had done vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> her, tranſlated him into heauen, cloſe by the conſtellation of the Bull. <hi>Lucan</hi> on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide ſaith, that <hi>Diana</hi> ſent this Scorpion to kill him, enuying his famous ſucceſſe in hunting, and that afterward the Goddeſſe taking pitty on him, tranſlated him into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. Others write againe, that he had his eyes put out by <hi>Oenopion,</hi> &amp; that he came blind into the Iland <hi>Lemnus,</hi> where he receiued a horſe of <hi>Vulcan,</hi> vppon which hee rode to the Sun-riſing, in which iourney, he recouered againe his eye-ſight, and ſo returning, he firſt determined to take reuenge vpon <hi>Oenopion</hi> for his former cruelty. Wherefore hee came into <hi>Creete,</hi> and ſeeking <hi>Oenopion,</hi> could not find him, becauſe he was hid in the earth by his Cittizens, but at laſt comming to him, there came a Scorpion and killed him for his malice, reſcuing <hi>Oenopion.</hi> Theſe and ſuch like fables are there about the death of <hi>Orion,</hi>

            <p>There be ſome learned Writers who haue compared a Scorpion to an Epigram, or rather an Epigram to a Scorpion, becauſe as the ſting of the Scorpion lyeth in the tayle, ſo <note place="margin">Gyraldus.</note> the force and vertue of an Epigram is in the concluſion, for <hi>velacriter &amp; falsè mordeat, vel iucundè &amp; dulciter delectet,</hi> that is, eyther let it bite ſharply at the end, or els delight plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingly. There be many wayes of bringing Scorpions out of their holes, and ſo to deſtroy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> and take them, as we haue already touched in part, vnto which I may adde theſe that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: A perfume made of Oxe-dung, alſo Storax and Arſenicke. And <hi>Pliny</hi> writeth, that tenne water-Crabs beaten with Baſill is an excellent perfume for this purpoſe, and ſo is the aſhes of Scorpions. And in Padua they vſe this Arte, with ſmall ſticks or ſtraw they touch and make a noyſe vpon the ſtones and morture wherein they haue their neſts, then <note place="margin">Cardan.</note> they thinking them to be ſome flyes for their meate, inſtantly leape out, and ſo the man that deluded them, is ready with a paire of tonges or other inſtrument, to lay hold vpon them and take them, by which meanes they take many, and of them ſo taken, make oyle of Scorpions. And <hi>Conſtantius</hi> writeth, that if a mans hand be well annointed with iuyce of Radiſh, he may take them without danger in his bare hand. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/>
            </p>
            <p>In the next place we are to proceede to the venom &amp; poyſon of Scorpions, the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or ſting whereof, lyeth not onely in the tayle, but alſo in the teeth, for as <hi>Ponzettus</hi> writeth, <hi>Laedit ſcorpius morſu &amp; ictu,</hi> the Scorpion harmeth both with teeth &amp; tayle, that is, although the greateſt harme doe come by the ſting in the tayle, yet is there alſo ſome that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth by their byting. This poyſon of Scorpions, (as <hi>Pliny</hi> out of <hi>Apollodorus</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth) is white, and in the heate of the day is very feruent and plentifull, ſo as at that time they are inſatiably and vnquenchably thirſty, for not onely the wild or wood Scorpion, but alſo all other, are of a hot nature, and the ſymptomes of their bytings are ſuch as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the effects of hote poyſons: and therefore ſaith <hi>Raſis,</hi> all their remedies are of a colde qualitie. Yet <hi>Galen</hi> thinketh otherwiſe, and that the poyſon is cold, and the effects there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> are alſo cold. For which cauſe <hi>Rondeletus</hi> preſcribeth oyle of Scorpions to expell the ſtone, and alſo the cure of the poyſon is by ſtrong Garlicke and the beſt Wine, which are hote things. And therefore I conclude, that although Scorpions be moſt hote, yet is their poyſon of a cold nature.</p>
            <p>In the next place, I thinke is needfull to expreſſe the ſymptomes following the ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king or ſtinging of theſe venomous Scorpions, and they are (as <hi>Aetius</hi> writeth) the very ſame which follow the byting or poyſon of that kinde of great <hi>Phalanx</hi> Spyder, called al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo <hi>Teragnatum,</hi> and that is, they are in ſuch caſe as thoſe perſons be which are ſmitten with the Falling-ſickneſſe.</p>
            <p>He which is ſtung by a Scorpion, thinketh that he is preſſed with the fall of great and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> cold hayle, beeing ſo cold, as if hee were continually in a cold ſweat, and ſo in ſhort ſpace the poyſon diſperſeth it ſelfe vvithin the skinne, and runneth all ouer the body, neuer cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing vntill it come to poſſeſſe ſome predominant or principall vitall part, and then follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth death. For as the skinne is ſmall and thin, ſo the ſting pierceth to the bottom thereof, and ſo into the fleſh, where it woundeth and corrupteth eyther ſome veyne, or arterie,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:22894:121"/>
or ſinew, and ſo the member harmed, ſwelleth immediatly into an exceeding great bulke and quantity and aking, with inſufferable torment. But yet (as we haue already ſaid) there is a difference of the paine, according to the difference of the Scorpion that ſtingeth. If a man be ſtung in the lower part of his body, inſtantly followeth the extenſion of his virile member, &amp; the ſwelling thereof: but if in the vpper part, then is the perſon affected with cold, and the place ſmitten, is as if it were burned, his countenaunce or face diſcorted, glewiſh ſpots about the eyes, &amp; the teares viſcous and ſlymie, hardnes of the articles, fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <note place="margin">Aetius. Aelianus.</note> downe of the fundament, and a continuall deſire to egeſtion, foaming at the mouth, coughing, conuulſions of the braine, and drawing the face backward, the hayre ſtandes vpright, paleneſſe goeth ouer all the body, and a continuall pricking like the pricking of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> needels.</p>
            <p>Alſo, <hi>Gordomus</hi> writeth, that if the pricke fall vppon an artery, there followeth ſwou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but if on a nerue, there ſpeedily followeth putrefaction and rottenneſſe. And thoſe Scorpions which haue wings, make wounds with a compaſſe like a bow, whoſe ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſymptomes are both heate and cold, and if they hurt about the caniculer dayes, their wounds are very ſildome recouered.</p>
            <p>The Indian Scorpions cauſe death three months after their wounds. But moſt won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull is that which <hi>Strabo</hi> relateth of the <hi>Albenian</hi> Scorpions and Spyders, whereof hee ſaith are two kinds, and one kind killeth by laughing, the other by weeping. And if any Scorpion hurt a vaine in the head, it cauſeth death by madneſſe, as writeth <hi>Paracelſus.</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> When an oxe or other beaſt is ſtrooken with a Scorpion, his knees are drawne together, and he halteth, refuſing meate; out of his noſe floweth a greene humour, and when hee is layd, he careth not for riſing againe.</p>
            <p>Theſe and ſuch like are the ſymptomes that follow the bytings and ſtingings of Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions, for the cure whereof I will remit the Reader to that excellent diſcourſe written by <hi>Wolphius,</hi> wherein are largely and learnedly expreſſed, whatſoeuer Art could collect out of nature. And ſeeing we in our Country are free from Scorpions, and therefore ſhal haue no neede to feare their poyſon, it ſhall not I truſt offend my Reader, if I cut off the relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Scorpions cures, as a thing which cannot benefit either the Engliſh-Reader, or elſe much adorne this hiſtory, and ſo I will proceede to the medicines drawne out of Scorpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/>
            </p>
            <p>The application or vſe of Scorpions in medicine, is eyther by powder, or by oyle, or by applying them bruſed to their owne wounds, wherefore euery one of theſe are to be handled particularly; and firſt of all for the powder, it is made by vſtion or burning in this manner. They take tenne Scorpions and put them aliue into a new earthen potte, whoſe mouth is to be dammed vp with loame or ſuch like ſtuffe, then muſt it be ſette vpon a fire of Vine-tree-ſhreddes, and therein muſt the pot ſtand day and night vntill all within it be <note place="margin">Haly.</note> conſumed to powder, and you ſhall know by their white colour when they be enough; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, if they be browne or burned, they muſt be continued longer, and the vſe of this powder is to expell the ſtone. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/>
            </p>
            <p>Againe, they vſe to make this powder another way, they take twentie Scorpions, and put them in a little earthen pot with a narrow mouth, which mouth muſt be ſtopped, and then the potte put into a Furnace by the ſpace of ſixe houres, which Furnace muſt alſo be kept cloſe within, and with a gentle fire: then after ſixe houres take off the pot, and bruſe the Scorpions into powder, and keepe that powder for the vſe afore-ſaid. There are other waies alſo to prepare this powder, but in all preparations the attendant and aſſiſtant muſt take heede of the fume or ſmoake that commeth from it, for that is very venomous and contagious.</p>
            <p>But beſides, there are many things to be obſerued heerein, as firſt, that the Scorpions be aliue, and that they be killed in oyle, then, that they be put in whole, with euery mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> without mutilation, and that the Scorpions appointed for this confection, be of the ſtrongeſt poyſon, and the time of their collection to be when the Sunne is in <hi>Leo,</hi> and not in <hi>Scorpius,</hi> as ſome without reaſon haue imagined.</p>
            <p>The oyle ſo made, is diſtinguiſhed into two kindes, one ſimple, and the other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound. The ſimple is made of a conuenient number of Scorpions, (as it were twentie if
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:22894:121"/>
they be great, and moe if they be little, and they beeing put into a glaſſe veſſell, oyle of bitter-Almonds muſt be poured vppon them, and ſo the veſſell ſtopped cloſe and ſette in the ſunne by the ſpace of thirtie dayes, and then ſtirred and vſed. Yet the women of Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rara vſe Oyle-oliue in ſteede of oyle of Bitter-almonds, and alſo obſerue no quantitie of <note place="margin">Braſauolus</note> oyle, but fill the pot full, and likewiſe no order in the number of the Scorpions, putting one to day, and another to morrow, and ſo more the next weeke or month, as they can find them.</p>
            <p>The compound-oyle is thus made, they take round Aſtrologe, Cypreſſe, and Genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, the rootes of Capars, and vppon theſe they poure oyle of Bitter-almonds, and ſoake the rootes in the oyle in the hot ſun for the ſpace of twentie dayes, then take they a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> number of Scorpions, from betwixt tenne to fifteene, theſe they put againe to the oyle, and ſo ſtoppe vp the mouth againe, and ſet it the ſecond time in the ſun thirty dayes, and afterward ſtraine it and vſe it. This compound-oyle is not ſo much approued by <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſauolus,</hi> as the former ſimple, becauſe the firſt hath more Scorpions, &amp; the ſecond is ſtuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed or ſeaſoned with Spyces.</p>
            <p>The greene Scorpion which is bredde of Baſill, hauing ſeauen knots in the tayle, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beaten and pounded with the herbe Scorpion, and ſo made into pills, then dryed and <note place="margin">Kiranides.</note> put into a glaſſe, are very profitable to him that hath the Falling-ſickneſſe, if hee take of them three euery morning faſting in temperate Wine, but theſe beeing giuen to a ſound man, putteth him cleane out of his wits. If a man take a vulgar Scorpion and drowne the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> ſame in a portinger of oyle in the wane of the Moone, and there-withall afterward an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynt the backe from the ſhoulders to the hyppes, and alſo the head and fore head, with the typpes of the fingers and toes of one that is a daemoniacke or a lunaticke perſon, it is reported that he ſhall caſe and cure him in ſhort time. And the like is reported of the Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions ſting ioyned with the toppe of Baſill wherein is ſeede, and with the hart of a Swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, all included in a peece of Harts-skinne.</p>
            <p>The oyle of Scorpions made of common Oyle-oliue, is good for the paine in the eares infuſed by diſtillation; alſo it cureth a Plureſie in this manner. They take meale out of a Windmill, and make thereof with water, paſte, or little cakes, in quantitie like a French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crowne, theſe muſt be ſodde in a frying-panne in oyle of Scorpions, and ſo applyed as hot <note place="margin">Alexius</note> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> as can be to the place where the pricking is, and ſo kept to the ſame very hot, and when it beginneth to be cold, let new be applyed ſtill, nine times together, ſucceſſiuely one time after another. Scorpions bruſed in new ſweete Wine, doe cure the Kings-euill. The a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes of a Scorpion infuſed by the yard into the bladder, breaketh and diſperſeth both the <note place="margin">Galenus.</note> ſtone of the bladder and the reynes. And the like operation hath a vulgar Scorpion eaten, with vineger and Roſe-cakes applyed to the gowtie members, it many times eaſeth the inflaming paines thereof.</p>
            <p>The oyle of Scorpions is very auayleable in the time of plague, both by oyntment and alſo in potion: where-withall one did affirme to <hi>Wolphius</hi> that hee gayned a great ſumme of money, which he prepared in this manner. He tooke a hundred Scorpions, and ſodde them in the oldeſt Oyle-oliue he could get, vntill ſuch time as the Scorpions were conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> then did he ſtraine them thorough a linnen cloth, adding vnto it an ounce of Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barbe, and ſo ſhutting it cloſe in a glaſſe bottle, he ſet it fortie dayes together in the ſunne, and afterward hee gaue of it to be vſed in time of infection, aduiſing them that had it to apply it in oyntment to the pulſe, hart, hinder-part of the head, necke and noſtrills. And if a man began to be ſicke, within twelue houres after the firſt ſence of his paine, hee was annoynted heere-with about the tumour, and then was it launced. This oyntment is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo commended againſt all manner of poyſon, not onely of other Serpents and venomous beaſts, but alſo of the Scorpion it ſelfe. And thus much for the hiſtory of the Scorpion. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mong the manifold kinds of Sea-ſerpents, as well knowne as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> vnknown, (wherof ſome are like the Lamprey, ſome like the <hi>Myrus,</hi> and many other like the Serpents of the earth, except in their head, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> writeth, for that is more like the head of a Conger then a ſerpent) it peculiarly hath one kind, in colour &amp; forme not vnlike an Eeele, in length about three cubits, in the gylls &amp; finnes reſembling a Conger, but it hath a longer ſnout or beake, which is alſo fortified inwardly with very many ſmall ſharpe teeth, the eyes not ſo great, a ſmooth or pield skinne, and hanging ouer at the backe, hauing no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> ſcales, ſo as it may eaſily be fleyed. The belly of it is betwixt redde and white, and all the body ouer is ſet with ſpires, ſo as beeing aliue, it is not handled without danger. And this is by <hi>Pliny</hi> called the Dragon of the Sea, which commeth out of the Sea into the Sands, and therein with an admirable celerity and dexteritie maketh his lodging place. For the ſnout thereof is ſharper then the Serpents of the earth, therefore there-with it diggeth and hideth it ſelfe in the hole or hollow place which it hath made. This is alſo called by <hi>Pliny Ophidion,</hi> but I thinke it better to follow <hi>Aristotle,</hi> who doth call it <hi>Ophis thalattios,</hi> a Sea-ſerpent, the colour whereof is blacker or dymmer then the Conger.</p>
            <p>There be alſo Vipers of the Sea, which are in ſhew little fiſhes, about a cubit long, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a little horne in their fore-head, the byting or ſting whereof is very deadly, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> when the Fiſher-men haue taken any one of theſe, they inſtantly cut off the head and bury it in the ſand, but the body they eate for good meate: yet theſe Serpents are thought to be none other then the Fiſhes called <hi>Aranei,</hi> or Spyder-fiſhes, ſauing that they are ſaid to haue a ſharpe ſting in their head, and this a horne, for all Water or Sea-Serpents, haue harder and leſſe heads then the Serpents of the Land.</p>
            <p>

            <p>
               <pb n="235" facs="tcp:22894:123"/>
In the Germaine-Ocean there is found a Serpent about the bigneſſe of a mans legge, which in the tayle carryeth a ſting as hard as any horne, this haunteth onely the deepeſt part of the Sea, yet is it ſome-time taken by the Fiſhermen, and then they cut off the tayle and cate the reſidue of the body. Yet I will not expreſly define whether this may be called a Sea-Serpent, or a Serpentine-fiſh; it may be it is the ſame that is a Forke-fiſh, or Ray, which by reaſon of the tayle thereof, it might giue occaſion to <hi>Albertus</hi> to call it a ſerpent of the Sea.</p>
            <p>There be alſo Snakes or <hi>Hyders</hi> in the Sea, for although all water-ſerpents, as well of the freſh, ſalt, &amp; ſweet waters may be called <hi>Hyders,</hi> or Snakes, yet there be ſome peculiar Snakes, ſuch are thoſe in the Indian-Sea, where they haue broade tayles, and they harme <note place="margin">Elianus</note> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> more by byting with the ſharpnes of their teeth, then by any venome that is contained in them; and therefore in this they ſome-what reſemble the Snakes of the earth. And <hi>Plinie</hi> vvriteth, that once before <hi>Perſis,</hi> vppon the coaſts of certaine Ilands, there were ſeene of <note place="margin">Solinus</note> theſe Sea-<hi>Hyders</hi> very many, of the length of twenty cubits, where-withall a whole Nauy or fleet of ſhips were mightily affrighted. And the like is reported of three other Ilands, lying betwixt the promontory of <hi>Carmania</hi> and <hi>Arabia;</hi> and ſuch were thoſe alſo in the Affrican-ſea, who are ſaid by <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> not to be affraid of a Gally, but will ſet vppon the men therein, and ouer-turne it. And he himſelfe ſaw many bones of great wild-oxen, who had beene deſtroyed by theſe kind of Sea-ſnakes or <hi>Hyders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The greateſt Riuer that falleth into the Red-ſea, is called <hi>Sinthus,</hi> the fall whereof a far <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> off, ſeemeth to the beholders to be like winding Snakes, as though they were comming againſt the paſſengers, to ſtay them from enterance into that Land; and there is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a ſight or reſemblance of Serpents there, but alſo the very truth of them, for all the Sea-men know when they are vpon theſe coaſts, by the multitude of Serpents that meet them. And ſo do the Serpents called <hi>Graae</hi> about <hi>Perſis.</hi> And the Coaſt of <hi>Barace</hi> hath the ſame noyſome premonſtration, by occurrence of many odious, blacke, and very great Sea-ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents. But about <hi>Barygaza,</hi> they are leſſe, and of yellow earthy colour; their eyes bloody, or fierie red, and their heads like Dragons. <hi>Keranides</hi> writeth of a Sea-dragon, in this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, ſaying: The Dragon of the Sea is a fiſh without ſcales, and when this is growne to a great and large proportion, whereby it doth great harme to other creatures, the winds or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> clowdes take him vp ſuddenly into the ayre, and there by violent agitation, ſhake his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to peeces: the parcels whereof ſo mangled and torne aſunder, haue beene often ſound in the tops of the mountaines. And if this be true, (as it may well be) I cannot tell whether there be in the world a more noble part of Diuine prouidence, &amp; ſigne of the loue of God to his creatures, who armeth the clowdes of heauen to take vengeane of their deſtroyers. The tongue of this Sea-dragon (ſaith hee) is like a horſes tayle, two foote in length; the which tongue preſerued in oyle, and carried about by a man, ſafegardeth him from lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing infirmities, and the fat thereof, with the Herbe-Dragon annoynted on the head or ſick-parts, cureth the head-ache, and driueth away the Leproſie, and all kind of ſcabs in the skinne. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/>
            </p>
            <figure/>
            <p>Heere is alſo the picture of another Sea-ſerpent, very like to the ſerpent of the earth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> 3. or 4. cubits long, hauing a rounder belly then an Eele, but a head like a Conger, &amp; <note place="margin">Rondoletu.</note> the vpper chap is longer, and ſtandeth out further then the neather chap; the teeth grovv therein as they doe in Lampreys, but they are not ſo thicke, and it hath two ſmall finnes neere the gills like an Eele. The colour of it is yellow, but the beake and belly is of Aſh-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, the eyes yellow, and in all the inward parts it doth not differ from a Lamprey, and
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:22894:124"/>
there is no man of any vnderſtanding, (as writeth <hi>Rondeletius)</hi> but at the very firſt ſight, will iudge the ſame to be a Serpent, although the fleſh thereof be no more harmefull then the Conger or Lamprey; yet for ſimilitude with other Serpents, I could not chuſe but expreſſe the ſame in this place.</p>
            <figure/>
            <p>There be alſo in the <hi>Sueuian-</hi>Ocean or <hi>Balthicke-</hi>ſea, Serpents of thirty or forty foote in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> length, whoſe picture is thus deſcribed, as it was taken by <hi>Olaus Magnus,</hi> and hee further writeth, that theſe doe neuer harme any man vntill they be prouoked.</p>

            <p>The ſame Authour alſo expreſſeth likewiſe the figure of another Serpent, of a hundred and twenty foote long, appearing now and then vpon the coaſts of Norway, very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and hurtfull to the Sea-men in calmes and ſtill weather, for they lift vp themſelues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the hatches, and ſuddainely catch a man in their mouthes, and ſo draw him into the Sea out of the Shippe: and many times they ouer-throw in the waters, a laden veſſell of great quantitie, with all the wares therein contained. And ſometimes alſo they ſette vp ſuch a Spire aboue the water, that a boate or little Barke without ſayles may paſſe thorow the ſame. And thus much for the Sea-Serpents.</p>

            <p>By the relation of <hi>Pellinus,</hi> it is in length fiue ſpannes and fiue fingers, the head alſo compared with the body, is long, and in the necke thereof are two blanches, and betwixt them a hollow place, the backe part whereof is attenuated into a thinne and ſharpe tayle, and vppon eyther chappe they haue many teeth, which are ſharpe, and without poyſon, for when they byte, they doe no more harme then fetch blood onely, and theſe, men for oſtentation ſake weare about their necks, and women are much terrified by them in the hands of wanton young boyes. The backe of this Snake, (as writeth <hi>Erastus)</hi> is blackiſh, and the other parts greene, like vnto Leekes, yet mixed with ſome whiteneſſe, for by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it feedeth vppon herbs, it beareth that colour.

            <p>Among the Northerne people they haue houſehold-Snakes, as it were houſhold-gods, and they ſuffer them both to eate and to play with their Infants, lodging them in the cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles <note place="margin">Olaus.</note> with them, as if they were faythfull Keepers about them, and if they harme any body at any time, they account it <hi>Pium piaculum,</hi> a very diuine and happy miſchaunce.

            <p>For this cauſe we will leaue the diſcourſe of the harmeleſſe Snake, and come to thoſe which are no way inferiour to any other Serpent, their quantitie and ſpirit beeing conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, wherefore we are to conſider, that of Snakes which are venomous and hurtfull, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> there are two kinds, one called the Water-Snake, the other the Land-Snake. The Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Snake is called in Greeke, <hi>Hydra, hydros, hydrales, karouros,</hi> &amp; <hi>Enhydris,</hi> in Latine <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix,</hi> and <hi>Lutrix. Munster</hi> calleth it in Hebrew, <hi>Zepha,</hi> and <hi>Auicen</hi> relateth certaine barbe, rous names of it, as <hi>Handrius, Andrius,</hi> and <hi>Abides,</hi> and <hi>Kedaſuderus, Echydrus</hi> and <hi>Aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtichon.</hi> The Germans call it <hi>Nater, Waſser-nater,</hi> and <hi>Waſſer-ſchlange:</hi> and they deſcribe it in the manner as it is found in their Country, which doth not very farre differ from them of our Country heere in England. It is (as they ſay) in thicknes like the arme of a man or child, the bellie thereof yellow, and of a golden colour, and the backe blackiſh-greene, &amp; the very breath of it is ſo venomous, that if a man hold to it a rodde newly cutte off from the Tree, it will ſo infect it, that vppon it ſhall appeare certaine little bagges of gall or poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>And if this Serpent fortune to byte a man in the foote, then is the poyſon preſently di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed all ouer the body, for it hath a fiery qualitie, and therefore it continually aſcendeth, but when once it commeth to the hart, the man falleth downe and dyeth. And therefore the meeteſt cure is to hang the party ſo wounded vppe by the heeles, or elſe ſpeedilie to cut off the member that is bitten. And that which is heere ſaid of the vvater-Snake, doth alſo as properly belong to the Land-ſnake, ſeeing there is no difference betwixt theſe, but that at certaine times of the yeere they forſake the water when it draweth or falleth lowe, and ſo betake themſelues to the Land. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/>

            <p>In like ſort, the vertue of this ſtone is applyed againſt the rhume in the legges, or any fluxe of the eyes, eares or head, but the vſe of it muſt not exceede the quantitie of three houres at a time. It alſo driueth out of the body all venomous wormes, and is a ſpecial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> againſt their byting and ſtinging.

                  </gap>s,</hi> but it is queſtionable whether it be generated in the head of the Snake, or by theyr vapourous breath, concurring together in the Spring or Winter-ſeaſon. Some of theſe ſtones are ſayd to be of a blewiſh-greene colour, and the forme thereof pyramidall. <hi>Alber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> ſaith, he hath ſeene one of them that was blacke, and not lightſome, onely about the edges of it there was ſome paleneſſe apparant, and in the ſuperficies or vpper part therof, there was (as he writeth) a beautifull picture of a Snakes proportion, and the vertue ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of did put to flight venomous beaſts, and alſo eure theyr harmefull poyſons.</p>
            <p>Such like things we haue already ſhewed to be in the ſtone which the Toade is ſaid to haue, but this ſtone is more likely to be the <hi>Ophites,</hi> for in the Caſtle of <hi>Tangra,</hi> once the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> ſeate or habitation of <hi>Charles</hi> the fourth, there is a Chappell wherein are many precious ſtones, wrought in the vvalls and doores, and among diuers other theſe <hi>Ophites.</hi> But where as there is a pyramidall forme attributed to theſe ſtones, I take it therefore that it is the ſame which <hi>Pliny</hi> calleth <hi>Gloſſapetra,</hi> for in ſhew it reſembleth the tongue of a Snake, and the tongue of a Snake beeing great or broade at the roote, and ſmaller toward the end or typpe thereof, is rightly ſaid to be of a pyramidall forme: and among the Germans it is called by a peculiar word, <hi>Naterzungen,</hi> that is, Snakes-tongue.</p>
            <p>And ſuch a kind of ſtone as this Snakes-tongue, (as <hi>Agricola</hi> and ſome other Authors vvriteth) is found in a certaine earth neere <hi>Linuburgh</hi> in Saxonie. And <hi>Conradus Geſner</hi> affirmeth, that there is a certaine Towne in Germanie called <hi>Aenipon,</hi> where there is one <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> of theſe ſtones halfe a cubite long, and therefore it ſeemeth that they are not all generated in Serpents or Snakes heads.

               </gap> wont to be a ſuperſtitious way to extract or expreſſe this ſtone from out of the Snake, which was done in this manner; Firſt, when they had taken the Snake aliue, they did preſently hang her vppe by the tayle, then iuſt vnderneath her they did make a ſuffumigation of Laurell, and ſo did coniure the Snake, ſaying; <hi>Per Dominum qui te crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uit, lapidem tuum quem in capite tenes te instanter eijcere iubeo:</hi> This kind of enchaunting Charme, I hold not worthy to be tranſlated, and yet let mee not be blamed for the relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, ſeeing it is pertinent to this ſtory to know all the good and euill about theſe Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> And therefore, not to expreſſe the ſame at all, might argue in mee, eyther igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce, or ſilly preciſeneſſe: and againe on the other ſide, to make it vulgar, might bring mee into ſuſpition of ſome approbation: therefore let the Reader know it from mee, but vnderſtand it from ſome other.</p>

And for mine owne opinion, I account no better of theſe Snake-ſtones then I doe of the Toade-ſtones, concerning which I haue already giuen my opinion in another place. And therefore what heere is related of this ſtone, let it be examined, and then be eyther receiued or refuſed.</p>
            <p>Many, and almoſt infinite are the Epithets which are giuen to Snakes, whereby their nature is expreſſed, as <hi>Aliger anguis,</hi> the winged-ſnake, blacke, fierce, blew, greedy, wild, cold, Gorgonean, wreathen, ſlyding, deadly, lightſome, ſpotted, martiall, threatning, purple, wholſome, ſcaly, terrible, winding, grym, ſwelling, fearefull, venomous, greene, infolded or implicite, horrible, hiſsing, marſian, maurian, peſtilent, retorted, and ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like, as it hath pleaſed the ſeuerall Authours writing heereof to aſcribe and attribute <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> vnto it. Which we will not proſecute with any explication, but onely leaue them to the Readers pleaſure, beeing onely content to nominate them.</p>
            <p>There is great account or reckoning made of their egges, which they lay in the Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer-time, for firſt of all they are ſo glewed and conioyned together, partly with the ſpet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and moyſtnes which proceedeth from their mouthes, and partly with the ſpume and froath of their owne body, that a man ſeeing their heapes, would iudge them to be cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled together by ſome artificiall deuiſe. Theſe egges thus knotted together in bunches, the Latines call <hi>Anguinum.</hi> The <hi>Druides</hi> or auncient Wiſards of England and Scotland, haue deliuered, that if the Snake hyſſe, theſe will of their owne accord flye vppe into the ayre, and then if ſome Wiſe-man take them by preuention, before they touch the ground <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> againe, the Snakes will follow him as faſt as any horſe, vntill he come to ſome Riuer, into the which they dare not enter.</p>
            <p>And the folly of theſe alſo proceeded ſo far, that they were not a ſhamed to report, that if one of theſe <hi>anguines</hi> or bunches of egges, were tyed to a peece of gold, it would ſwym in a Riuer againſt the ſtreame. Theſe they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended vnto Princes and great men to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry about with them in the time of warres and other contentions, and that therefore when a Romane Knight of <hi>Volontij,</hi> was found by <hi>Claudius</hi> to carry one of theſe about him, hee was by the Emperours commaundement put to death.</p>
            <p>But to leaue vanities, we will proſecute the true and naturall deſcription of their egges in this manner. They are round and ſoft, in colour white, cleauing (as we haue alreadie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> ſaid) together in great bunches, forty, or fiftie, or a hundred in a cluſter, without, they are couered with a skinne or cruſt, much harder &amp; whiter then the ſubſtance contained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it, which is like matter, or the rotten egges of a Henne or Ducke, in quantitie as bigge as Bullis, Plummes, and ſildome bigger, beeing moſt commonly very round and orbicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. Yet <hi>Geſner</hi> reporteth, that he had one ſent him of the proportion of a Lentill, and as great as the fiſt of a man, &amp; within euery egge appeare certaine ſmal things, like the tailes of Serpents, or Leaches, beeing in number tenne, fiue greater and fiue ſmaller, one fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded or lapped within another. And theſe haue alſo little puſtules vppon the skinne or cruſts, whereof one doth not touch the other.</p>
            <p>Out of theſe egges come the young ones, but I cannot affirme what great affection the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> old ones beare vnto them, or that when many Snakes lay their egges together, euery one in that multitude hath skill to diſcerne her owne egges from the other. For I haue beene with other my colleagues or Schoole-fellowes when I was young, at the deſtruction of many thouſands of them, and neuer perceiued that the old Snake did with any extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary affection fight for their egges, but rather forſooke them, and ſuffered vs to do with them what we pleaſed: which ſome-times we brake, ſometimes ſcattered abroade vpon the dunghill out of which wee digged them, and ſome-times wee caſt them into the next Riuer we came at, but neuer ſaw any of them recollected againe to their former place by the Snakes, although the place were very full of them, and therefore I conclude for mine owne experience, that Snakes cannot be perceiued to beare any exceeding loue in nature <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> to their egges or young ones.</p>
            <p>Theyr ordinary foode for the moſt part, is earth, frogges, vvormes, Toades, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallie Paddocks, or crooke-backed Frogges, Newtes, and ſmall fiſhes. The Foxes and Snakes which are about the Riuer <hi>Nilus</hi> are at continuall variance, and beſides, the Harts are by nature common enemies to all Serpents.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="246" facs="tcp:22894:129"/>
They are not in venom inferiour to other Serpents, for they infect the waters neere to houſes, and are many times the cauſes of diſeaſes and death, whereof the Phiſitians can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diſcerne. When they bite or ſting, there followeth extreame paine, inflamation, greenenes or blacknes of the wound, dizzines in the head, and death within three dayes. Whereof dyed <hi>Phyloctetes,</hi> Generall of the Fleete of Greece, in <hi>Lemnos, Daedalus</hi> &amp; <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalippus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The cure of this euill muſt be by Origan ſtamped and layd to the ſore with lye &amp; oyle, or aſhes of the roote of an Oake with pitch, or Barly-meale mixed with honny and water and ſod at the fire. And in drinke take wilde Noſewort, Daffadill-flowers, and Fennell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeede in Wine. And it is alſo ſaid, that a man carrying about him the Liuer of a Snake; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> ſhall neuer be bytten by any of that kinde. And this Liuer is alſo preſcribed againſt the ſtone in the bladder, beeing drunke in ſtrong drinke. And thus much for this Serpent.</p>

            <p>All Spyders are venomous, but yet ſome more, and ſome leſſe. Of Spyders that ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> doe nor can doe much harme, ſome of them are tame, familiar, and domeſticall, and theſe be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly the greateſt among the whole packe of them. Others againe be meere wilde, liuing without the houſe abroade in the open ayre, which by reaſon of their raue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:22894:129"/>
gut, and greedy deuouring maw, haue purchaſed to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues the names of wolfes, and hunting-Spyders. The leaſt ſort of theſe weaue no webbes at all, but the greater be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth to make a ſmall and harſh webbe about hedges nie vnto the earth, ſpreading and ſetting the ſame abroade in the very entry, and in voyde places neere their lurking holes, their deceitfull nets, obſeruing very diligently the ſtirring of their deceitfull webbes, and peroeiuing them moouing, though neuer ſo lightly, ſhe maketh no ſtay, but with all ſpeed poſſible haſteneth her ſelfe to the place, and whatſoeuer ſhee there findeth, ſhe ſeazeth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon as her lawfull prize.</p>
            <p>The moſt dangerous &amp; hurtfull Spyders are called <hi>Phalangia,</hi> if they byte any one, (for they neuer ſtrike) their poyſon is by experience found to be ſo perrillous, as that there wil <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> a notable great ſwelling immediatly follow therevpon. Theſe kindes of venomous Spy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, are of two ſundry ſorts, for ſome of them are leſſer, and ſome greater. The leſſer ſort are very vnlike one to another, and of changeable colours, violent, libidinous, hot, ſtyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, ſharpe-topped, holding on their pace and way, as it were in iumping manner or lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping-wiſe: and theſe I find to be called by <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his xj. booke <hi>De Animal. Pſullas,</hi> or <hi>Pulices,</hi> and <hi>Pitheci</hi> or <hi>Simij.</hi> Of ſome they are called <hi>Oribates,</hi> becauſe they are vſuallie found among Trees that grow vppon Mountaines. They are alſo called <hi>Hypodromi,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they liue vnder the leaues.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Phalangium</hi> or <hi>Phalanx</hi> Spyder, is vnknowne in Italy (as <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith) &amp; there are found many ſorts of them. One ſort of them is very like vnto a great Piſmire, but much <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> bigger, hauing alſo a redde head, but all other parts are blacke, ſpeckled, and garniſhed with many white ſpots running all alongſt their bodies. This formicarian or Piſmire-like <hi>Phalanx,</hi> of <hi>Aetius</hi> is deſcribed to haue a body much reſembling ſoote in colour, his necke aſh-coloured, and his backe gliſtering, as it were with many ſtarres on it. <hi>Nicander</hi> calleth it <hi>Agrostes,</hi> and <hi>Aetius, Lucos.</hi> The Latines terme it <hi>Venator,</hi> that is, the Hunter. This ſtingeth but weakely, without any paine at all, but yet it is ſome-what venomous, though not very much. This kind of <hi>Phalanx</hi> is often found among Spyders-webbes, where, (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the faſhion of ſome Hunters) they beguile and intrap flyes, gnats, and Bees, gad-flyes and Waſpes. (And if <hi>Lonicerus</hi> write no more then may be warranted for truth,) thoſe great horſe-flyes or oxe-flyes and Brimſees, that in Sommer-ſeaſon vexe cattle, and what-ſoeuer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> they lay their clowtches on, that they hold faſt and deſtroy; and thus liue they by taking of booties and preyes.</p>
            <p>There is no man (I thinke) ſo ill aduiſed, that will confeſſe this to be the ſame creature which <hi>Aristotle</hi> calleth <hi>Pulex,</hi> for the body of that by his deſcription is broade, rowling, round, and the parts about the necke haue certaine lines or cuts: and beſides, about the mouth there appeare and ſeeme to bud forth three eminenties or ſtandings out.</p>
            <p>There is another ſort of <hi>Phalangiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> called by <hi>Nican: Rox,</hi> of <hi>Aetius, Ragion,</hi> of <hi>Aelianus, Rhax,</hi> (becauſe it is ſo like the kernell or ſtone that is found in Grapes,) and this kinde of Spyder is of a round figure, blacke in colour, the body gliſtering, and round as a ball, with very ſhort ſtumped feete, yet neuertheleſſe of a very ſwift pace. They haue teeth, and their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> mouth is nigh their belly, and when they ſtirre, they gather vp their feete very round. In the deſcription of this Spyder, <hi>Aetius, Aelianus</hi> and <hi>Pliny</hi> doe wholy conſent and agree in opinion, and yet <hi>Aelianus</hi> was a little beſides the way, when he ſet downe <hi>podas macrous,</hi> for <hi>microus,</hi> long feete for ſhort feete, and that this kind of Spyder was onely found in <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia,</hi> and not els where.</p>
            <p>That kind of Spyder termed of <hi>Pliny, Asterion,</hi> ſeemeth to be all one with the former, ſauing that this is more knowne by his little white ſpots made ſtarre-wiſe, &amp; the gliſtering ſtripes or rayes where-with his body ſeemeth to be ouer-ſprinckled. <hi>Pliny</hi> onely mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth this, as if <hi>Aristotle, Galen, Aetius</hi> and <hi>Auicen,</hi> had neuer heard of it.</p>
            <p>The moſt venomous and hurtfull of all theſe, is that which <hi>Nicander</hi> calleth <hi>Pedeoros,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> of colour azure, or bright blew, which hath long, high, and loftie feete on both ſides of the body. The Scholiaſt addeth <hi>Daſu</hi> and <hi>meteoron,</hi> that is, <hi>lanugioſum</hi> and <hi>ſublime,</hi> ſoft like cotten or wooll, and loftie or high, and not <hi>ſublime lanuginoſum,</hi> as <hi>Lonicerus</hi> tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it. <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith, that this Spyder hath a black moſſines or ſoft downe, although it will ſcarce ſinke into my head, that any Spyder that is of an azure or blew colour, hath any
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:22894:130"/>
ſoft hayres, or woollie ſubſtance of a blacke colour.</p>
            <p>There is another kind of <hi>Phalangium</hi> Spyder called of <hi>Nicander, Dyſderi,</hi> which name is neither to be found in <hi>Ariſtotle, Pliny,</hi> nor <hi>Aetius,</hi> nor yet in any other auncient Author that euer I could reade, which ſome others call, and that very properly, <hi>Sphekion, quaſi veſparium,</hi> becauſe it is ſo like a redde Waſpe, ſauing that it lacketh wings, &amp; this waſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Spyder is of a paſſing deepe redde colour, and counted far worſer then the blew-Spy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, although the azure or blew-ſpyder onely by touching doth infect with poyſon, and will breake any Chriſtall glaſſe, if it runne ouer it though neuer ſo ſpeedily, or doe but touch it in glauncing wiſe, as <hi>Scaliger</hi> beareth witneſſe.</p>
            <p>There are two ſorts of <hi>Phalangie-</hi>Spyders called <hi>Tetragnatha,</hi> and the worſer is that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> which hath halfe of his dead deuided with one white line, and another white line running croſſe-wiſe. There is another of theſe not ſo hurtfull as the former, and this is of an aſhe-colour, and very white in the hinder-parts. There is alſo a Spyder coloured as this is, that maketh her webbe by walls ſides for the taking of flyes, which as ſome affirme, hath little or no venome in it at all. <hi>Aetius</hi> ſaith, that the <hi>Tetragnathus</hi> is a kinde of <hi>Phalangium,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a broade and a whitiſh body, rough footed, with two ſwelling or little bunches ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding out in the head, the one ſome-what broad, the other ſtanding right foorth, ſo that at the firſt, one would imagine that it had two mouthes, and foure iawes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aelianus</hi> in his xvij. booke, chap. 40. ſaith, that there is great ſtore of theſe to be found in India about the Riuer <hi>Arrhata,</hi> where their multitude is ſo dangerous and miſchiuous, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> as that they bring death and deſtruction to the Cittizens and people bordering nie thoſe places. And <hi>Strabo</hi> the Geographer, in his xvj. booke telleth vs, that beyond the Lybians and on the weſterne-ſide of Affricke, there is a Country left deſtitute of inhabitants, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing goodly large fieldes and paſtures, beeing vnhabitable by reaſon of the multitude of Scorpions there bred, and of the Spyders called <hi>Tetragnathoi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is to be found in Harueſt-time amongſt Peaſe, Beanes, and other ſorts of pulſe, (when they are gathered and reaped by the hand) certaine ſmall Spyders called <hi>Kanthari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſsi Eikela,</hi> in ſhew like vnto Cantharides or Spaniſh-flyes, of a very redde and fiery co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, ſuch as we Engliſhmen call <hi>Twinges,</hi> by eating or licking vp of which, both oxen &amp; other beaſts doe many times dye. There is another kinde of <hi>phalangium</hi> that breedeth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> in the pulſe, called <hi>Ervum,</hi> which is like vnto Tares, and likewiſe in the Peach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree, which <hi>Nicander</hi> and <hi>Aetius</hi> terme <hi>Cranocalaptes,</hi> and <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> nameth it <hi>Kephalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kroustes,</hi> becauſe it is ſo preſumptious bolde as to ſtrike at the hands of trauailers by the high-wayes, when as eyther it paſſeth downe in glyding manner by her fine thredde, or that ſhe tumbleth downe without any ſtay of thred or other ſupport. It is a ſmall creature to ſee to, keeping on the pace very fearefully, nodding with the head, reeling, and as it were ſtaggering, beeing great and heauie in the belly, ſome-what long of body, and of a greeniſh colour. It carryeth a ſting in the toppe of her necke, and ſtriking at any, ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly aymeth at thoſe parts which are about the head. And as <hi>Aetius</hi> ſaith, <hi>En tois phul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lois tes perſeias trepheteis, kai taptera echei homoia tais en tais kuſtais pſuchais:</hi> That is, they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> are nouriſhed in Peach-tree-leaues, and they haue wings like vnto Butter-flyes that are found amongſt Barly.</p>
            <p>Where-vpon the Scholiaſt ſeemeth to inſinuate to vs, that this kind of Spyder is win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, which no man (as I iudge) hath hetherto obſerued. <hi>Ponzettus</hi> and <hi>Ardoynus</hi> do take the <hi>Cranocalaptes</hi> to be a <hi>Tarantula,</hi> but herein they are both miſtaken, as was <hi>Rabbi Moſes</hi> before them. The Spyder called <hi>Sclerocephalus,</hi> in forme differeth but little from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. It hath a head as hard as a ſtone, and the lineaments and proportion of the body do much reſemble thoſe ſmall creatures which are ſeene about Lamps-lights, or candles in the night time.</p>
            <p>There commeth in the laſt place to be deſcribed, the <hi>Phalangie-</hi>Spyder of <hi>Apulia,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly knowne by the name of <hi>Tarantula,</hi> taking his denomination from the Countrey <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> of <hi>Tarentum,</hi> where there are found great ſtore and plenty of them. <hi>Firdinandus Ponzet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> imagineth, that it hath but onely ſixe feete, and <hi>Ardoynus</hi> is of the ſame iudgment, &amp; further faineth, that it hath a ſtretched out tayle. <hi>Raſis</hi> calleth a <hi>Tarantula,</hi> by the name of <hi>Sypta, Albucaſis, Alſari, Rabbi Moſes, Aggonſarpa, Auicen, Sebigi:</hi> Doctor <hi>Gilbert, Taranta</hi>
               <pb n="249" facs="tcp:22894:130"/>
therein following <hi>Ardoynus,</hi> which maketh two ſorts of <hi>Tarantulaes,</hi> the one of a browne, the other of a yellow colour and cleere ſhyning, ſuch as are to be found in Egypt. <hi>Pliny</hi> (as you read a little before) ſayd that the <hi>Phalangiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> was not knowne in Italy, but in theſe dayes they are found throughout all the Southerne parts of that Country, eſpecially <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e the Sea-ſhore, as both Harueſt-men and Hunters can well teſtifie by their owne wofull experience.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ponzettus</hi> was much deceiued, when in his third booke and xv. chapter entreating of the Scorpion, he expreſly affirmeth the <hi>Phalanx</hi> to be ſuch a venomous flye. It is a vengi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and cruell creature (as <hi>Alexander ab Alexandro</hi> ſaith,) and to be touched, horrible ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomous and peſtilent: and moſt eſpecially theyr byting is exceeding venomous in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> parching heate of the Sommer, but at other ſeaſons of the yeere not ſo great. There be many ſorts of Spyders found in very cold Countries, but no <hi>Phalangies</hi> at all, or if there be any, yet haue they very little poyſon in them, and nothing comparable to them of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Clymates.</p>
            <p>All the ſorts of <hi>Phalangies</hi> doe lay theyr egges in a nette or webbe, (which for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they make very ſtrong and thicke,) and ſitte vpon them in very great number, and when their broode is increaſed to ſome growth, they kill theyr damme by theyr hard em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracements, and fling her cleane away; and further, caſting off all fatherly affection, they many times ſerue the male with the ſame ſauce, if they can come handſomely by him, for he is a helper to the female in ſitting ouer their egges. They hatch at one time three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> as hath been ſeene by the teſtimony of <hi>Bellonius,</hi> in his Booke <hi>Singul obſeruat.</hi> chap. 68. The <hi>Tarantulaes</hi> commonly lye lurking in holes, chincks, and chappes of the earth, and with theyr teeth they bite and wound at vnawares, incircumſpect Mowers, &amp; Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt-folkes, and raſh Huntſmen, who thinke of no ſuch matter: and therefore they that are acquainted with theyr ſleights, doe weare bootes and gloues on theyr hands &amp; legges, for their further defence, ſo often as they goe foorth, eyther to hawking, hunting, or to reaping and mowing, or any ſuch like labour in the common fields.</p>
            <p>All theſe Spyders are venomous euen naturally, for that is ſo ſetled and deepely faſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in them, as it can by no meanes be eradicated or taken away. Neither ſuck they this <note place="margin">The ſignes to know when one is bitten of any Phalanx and the effects of the ſame.</note> venom and poyſonous qualitie from plants or herbes, as many men thinke, which in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> truth they neuer ſo much as taſte of, neither do they purchaſe this venomous complex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion and nature from any naughty, hurtfull, and malignant qualitie that is in their meate, by reaſon their chiefe foode and ſuſtenaunce is flyes, gnats, and Bees, and without que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion they can ſucke and draw no ſuch cacochymicall iuyce from theyr bodies. If the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micarian (which I call the Piſmire-like) <hi>Phalangie</hi> doe byte any man, there will preſentlie follow moſt fearefull accidents: for it bringeth an exceeding great tumor vpon the woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded place, the knees are looſe and feeble, trembling of the hart, and decay of ſtrength doe ſucceede, and ſome-times it induceth death it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nicander</hi> ſaith, that they who are bytten of this kind of Spyder, doe fall into ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found ſleepe, as that they will neuer be awaked, for they haue and ſuffer that which Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> report of <hi>Cleopatra</hi> Queene of Egypt, who to eſcape the fingers of <hi>Pompey,</hi> becauſe ſhe would not be brought to Rome in tryumph, cauſed two Serpents called Aſpes, to be ſette to her breaſts, which did ſting her to death, whoſe nature is to giue a heauineſſe and ſleepe, without any ſhrinking or marke in the skinne, onely putting foorth a gentle ſweat out of the face, as if one were in a traunce and hard to be awaked.</p>
            <p>The Spyder called <hi>Agroſtis,</hi> maketh but a ſmall wound with her byting, and in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner without any paine at all, and no wayes deadly, vnleſſe it be but ſlightly regarded, or that no care be had for the cure in the beginning. The <hi>Phalangie</hi> that is called <hi>Duſderus,</hi> which is faſhioned like a Waſpe, if he hurt any one by his byting, it cauſeth the ſame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents that the azure or blewiſh-coloured Spyder doth, but yet not altogether ſo terrible <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> and vehement. And beſides, the <hi>Duſder-</hi>Spyder with her poyſon, bringeth a waſting and pyning away of the whole body by degrees, without any great ſence.</p>
            <p>If a man be poyſoned with that kind of Spyder which is found among pulſe, and is (as I ſaid before) like vnto Spaniſh-flyes, there will preſently ariſe certaine puſtules, riſings or ſwellings, much like vnto bliſters, as if one were ſcalded with hot water, in which ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:22894:131"/>
there will commonly be much yellowiſh matter, beſides, the patient is much diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eted, vexed, &amp; too much out of order, the eyes ſeeme to be writhed, deformed, looking aſquint on the one ſide, the tongue faltereth and ſtammereth, not beeing able to ſound their words, or to pronounce directly: their talke is idle, they wander and roue vppe and downe in great perplexitie, their hart beeing tormented, toſſed &amp; turmoyled with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie kind of furious paſſion.</p>
            <p>The Spyder that is found in the pulſe, called <hi>Ervum,</hi> which is very like to Tares or Vetches, produceth by his venom the ſame euill effects that the former doth, and if horſes or other beaſts doe by chaunce deuoure any of them, their bodies are ſo inflamed by meanes of the vnquenchable thirſtines the poyſon cauſeth, that many times they burſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> in the midſt. If the <hi>Cranacalaptes</hi> wound any man (as <hi>Pliny</hi> aſſureth vs) it is not long before death it ſelfe doe ſucceede. And yet <hi>Nicander</hi> and <hi>Aetius</hi> hold the contrarie, and would make vs beleeue that his hurt is ſoone remedied, without any great adoe: yet heerein they doe conſent, that if any be hurt with any Spyder of this kinde, there will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a great paine of the head, coldnes, ſwymming and gyddines of the braine, much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietnes of the whole body, and pricking paines of the ſtomack. But notwithſtanding all this (ſaith <hi>Nicander,)</hi> the patient is ſoone remedied, and all theſe aboue rehearſed paſſions quickly appeaſed and brought to an end.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Sclerocephalus,</hi> as it much reſembleth the <hi>Cranocalaptes-</hi>Spyder in forme and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, ſo in his force, effect and violence they are much alike, cauſing the ſame ſympto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> accidents and paſſions as the former. The wound that the Spyder called <hi>Ragion</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicteth, is very ſmall, ſo that a man can hardly diſcerne it with his eyes, but yet if one be hurt there-with, the lowerparts of the eyes, and the eye-liddes waxe very redde. Beſides, the patient feeleth a ſhyuering cold or chyldnes in his loynes, with weakenes and feeble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the knees, yea the whole body is taken with a great quaking cold, &amp; the ſinewes by meanes of the violence and rankneſſe of the poyſon, ſuffer a convulſion. The parts ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to generation, are made ſo impotent and weake, as that they are not able to retaine the ſeede, nor yet to containe their vrine, which they voyde forth much like in colour to a Spyders-webbe, and they feele the like paine as they doe which are ſtunge vvith Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/>
            </p>
            <p>Of the wounding of the Starre-Spyder feeblenes and weakenes followeth, ſo that one cannot ſtand vpright, the knees buckle, ſleepe and ſhaking drouſines ſeaſeth vpon the hurt parts: and yet the worſt of all is the blewiſh Spyder, for this bringeth dimneſſe of the eye-ſight, and vomiting, much like vnto Spyders and cobwebs in colour, fainting and ſwoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, weakenes of the knees, heauy ſleepes, and death it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>If a man be wounded of the <hi>Tetragnathian-</hi>Spyder, the place waxeth whitiſh, vvith an intollerable, vehement, and continuall paine in it, and the member it ſelfe withereth and pyneth away euen to the very ioynts. Finally, the whole body by receiuing any whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome ſuſtenaunce, is nothing at all relieued thereby, yea and after a man hath recouered his health, yet is he neuertheleſſe diſquieted by much watching for a long time after, (as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> 
               <hi>Aetius</hi> writeth.) <hi>Nicander</hi> in expreſſe wordes confeſſeth, that the Aſh-coloured <hi>Tetrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nath,</hi> doth not by his byting infuſe any venome or like hurt. If the ſpeckled <hi>Phalangie</hi> of <hi>Apulia,</hi> which is vſually knowne by the name of <hi>Tarantula,</hi> doe byte any one, there will follow diuers and contrary accidents and ſymptomes, according to the various conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, different complexion, and diſpoſition of the partie wounded. For after they are hurt by the <hi>Tarantula,</hi> you ſhall ſee ſome of them laugh, others contrariwiſe to weepe, ſome will clatter out of meaſure, ſo that you ſhall neuer get them to hold their tongues, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therſome againe you ſhall obſerue to be as mute as fiſhes: this man ſleepeth continuallie, and another cannot be brought to any reſt at all, but runneth vp and downe, raging and rauing like a mad man.</p>
            <p>There be ſome that imagine themſelues to be ſome great Lords or Kings, &amp; that their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> authoritie, Empire and ſignory, extendeth it ſelfe farre and wide, and for that cauſe they will ſeeme to charge others by vertue of their abſolute and kingly authoritie, and as they tender theyr fauours, and will auoyde their diſpleaſure, to ſee this or that buſines diſpat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched; and with others againe the contrary conceite ſo much preuaileth, as by a ſtrong
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:22894:131"/>
imagination they cannot be otherwiſe diſwaded but that they are taken priſoners, that they lye in ſome deepe dungeon or priſon, with bolts and ſhackles about their feete, ſo many as their legges can beare, or that their necke and feete lye continually in the ſtocks. You ſhall ſee ſome of them to be cheerefull, quicke of ſpirit, and liuely, with dauncing, ſwinging, and ſhaking themſelues. With others againe you ſhall haue nothing but ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and heauineſſe of mind, browne-ſtudies, vnaptnes to doe any thing, as if one were aſtonied, ſo that nothing but numneſſe, and dulnes of moouing and feeling, ſeemeth to pinch them, beeing to ſee to very ſenceleſſe.</p>
            <p>In concluſion, as dronkenneſſe to ſundry perſons is not all one, but much different, according to the diuerſitie of complexions, &amp; naturall conſtitution of the braine: ſo ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> is the madnes or frenzie-fits of theſe perſons all one that be infected with a <hi>Tarantu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laes</hi> poyſon: but ſome of them are fearefull, ſilent, euer trembling and quaking: and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers againe are more foole-hardie, raſh, preſumptious, clamorous, full of noyſe, dooing nothing elſe but call and cry out, and ſome fewe ſeeme to be very graue, conſtant &amp; ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt, that will not alter their purpoſes for a world of wealth. But let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be affected eyther with this or that paſſion, yet this is common to them all, as well to one as to another, that they are generally delighted with muſicall inſtruments, and at their ſound or noyſe, vvill ſo tryp it on the toes dauncer-like, applying both their mindes and bodies to dauncing &amp; frisking vp &amp; downe, that during the time of any muſicall harmony, they will neuer leaue mouing their members &amp; lymbes, like a Iack-an-apes that cannot ſtand ſtill. And which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> is more ſtrange, they will vſe theſe motions and geſtures when they are ready to depart this life, through the lingering ſtay and vehement crueltie of the poyſons operation: and yet for all this, though they be ſo neere vnto death, yet if they heare any muſicke, they come againe to themſelues, newly gathering their ſpirits and ſtrength, and with a greater alacritie, promptnes of mind and cheere, they foote it as frolickly as euer they did or could haue done.</p>
            <p>And thus dooing and dauncing both day and night, without any notorious intermiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, &amp; by their continued ſweating, the poyſon being diſperſed into the pores of the skin, and euaporated by inſenſible tranſpiration or breathing out, are arlength by this meanes recouered to their former health &amp; ſtate of body. And if the Pypers of Fidlers ceaſe play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> with their muſicke, though neuer ſo little awhile, before the matter of the poyſon be in ſome part exhauſted, then will they make a recidiuation and returning to their former paſſions and griefes, with which they were at firſt tormented and diſquieted. But yet this is the moſt ſtrange, deſeruing the greateſt admiration of all, that all thoſe perſons vvhich are bytten or wounded by any <hi>Tarantula,</hi> they wil daunce ſo wel, with ſuch good grace &amp; meaſure, and ſing ſo ſweetly, and withall deſcant it ſo finely and tunably, as though they had ſpent all their life-time in ſome dauncing and ſinging-ſchoole.</p>
            <p>Neuertheleſſe, <hi>Cardan,</hi> contrary to all authoritie and experience, calleth in doubt and queſtion this poynt, and at laſt concludeth that they cannot be reſtored to health againe by muſicke. Wherein he doth maruailouſly repugne and contrary, both <hi>Foelix Platerus,</hi>

Trulie, a bare contradiction againſt ſo great authorities, is fatre vnworthy and vnbeſeeming a man any thing (though neuer ſo little) ſeene or exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in Philoſophy: much more ſo great a Philoſopher and Phiſitian as <hi>Cardan</hi> was. Yet ſurely I am of the opinion, that <hi>Cardan</hi> did not erre in Philoſophy through ignoraunce, but hauing a deſire continually to appeare more learned, he did euer bend himſelfe to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne that, which he knew the ſoundeſt and beſt part of men did hold and maintaine. But this little which I haue heere ſpoken, ſhall ſerue ſufficiently for the diſcuſſing of <hi>Cardans</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion.</p>

               <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> concerning the common bytings of hurtfull Spyders or <hi>Phalangies,</hi> vvri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth thus. The accidents (ſaith he) that doe accompany the bytings of Spyders, are theſe that follow. The wounded place waxeth red, yet doth it not ſwell nor grow very hot, but it is ſome-what moyſt. If the body become cold, there will follow trembling and ſhaking, the groyne and hammes doe much ſtroute out, &amp; are exceeding diſtended, there is great prouocation to make water, and ſtriuing to exonerate nature, they ſweat with much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie, labour and paine. Beſides, the hurt perſons are all of a cold ſweat, and teares de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtill from their eyes that they grow dym-ſighted there-with. <hi>Aetius</hi> further addeth, that they can take no reſt or ſleepe, ſometimes they haue erection of the yarde, and the heade itcheth, other-whiles the eyes and calfes of the legges grow hollow and lanke, the bellie is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> ſtretched out by meanes of wind, the whole body is puffed vppe, but in eſpeciall the face, they make a maffeling with theyr mouth, and ſtammer ſo that they cannot diſtinctly be vnderſtood.</p>
            <p>Some-times they can hardly voyd vrine, they haue great paine in the lower parts, the vrine that they make is wateriſh, and as it were full of Spyders-webbes, the part affected, hath a great pricking and ſwelling, which <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> (as you reade a little before) will by no meanes yeeld to, and it is a little red. Thus farre <hi>Aetius,</hi> from whom <hi>Paulus Aegineta, Actuarius, Ardoynus</hi> and ſome others differ but a little. In <hi>Zacynthus</hi> an Ile in the Ionian-Sea, on the Weſt of <hi>Peloponeſus,</hi> if any there be hurt of a <hi>Phalangium,</hi> they are otherwiſe and more grieuouſly tormented then in any other place, for there the body groweth ſtiffe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> and benummed; beſides, it is very weake, trembling, and exceeding cold. They ſuffer al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo vomiting with a ſpaſme or crampe, and inflamation of the virge, beſides an intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble paine in their eares and ſoales of their feete. The people there doe cure themſelues by bathes, into which if any ſound man after that doe enter to waſh himſelfe, or be drawne into the ſame by any guile or deceitfull meanes, hee will foorth-with fall into the ſame greefes &amp; paſſions, that the other ſicke patient endured before he receiued remedie. And the like to this writeth <hi>Dioſcorides,</hi> in his Chapter of <hi>Trifolium aſphaltites,</hi> in theſe words following.</p>
            <p>The decoction (ſaith he) of the whole plant beeing vſed by way of fomentation, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing or ſoking the body, ceaſeth all thoſe paines which are cauſed by the byting or ſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> of any venomous Serpent: and with the ſame bathing or fomenting whatſoeuer vlce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous perſons ſhall vſe or waſh himſelfe withall, he will be affected and haue the ſame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, as he that hath beene bitten of a Serpent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Galen</hi> in his booke <hi>De Theciaca ad Piſonem,</hi> aſcribeth this to miracle, accounting it a thing exceeding common reaſon and nature: but I ſtand in doubt that that Booke vvas neuer <hi>Galens,</hi> but rather fathered vpon him by ſome other man. And yet <hi>Aelianus</hi> writeth more miraculouſly, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he affirmeth that this hapneth to ſome helthy perſons, &amp; ſuch as be in good plight &amp; ſtate of body, neuer ſo much as making any mention of vlcer or ſore. Thus much of the ſymptomes, accidents, paſſions or effects which ſticke and waite vpon thoſe that are hurt by Spyders. And now come I to the cure.</p>
            <p>The generall cure, according to the opinion of <hi>Dioſcorides,</hi> is, that firſt there muſt be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> ſcarification made vpon the wounded place, and that often, and cupping-glaſſes muſt as often be applyed and faſtened with much flame to the part affected. <hi>Abſyrtus</hi> counſell is to make a fumigation with egge-ſhells firſt ſteeped in water, and then beeing caſt on the coales with Harts-horne or Galbanum, to perfume the venomed part there-with. After
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:22894:132"/>
that to vſe ſacrifications, to let bloud, or to ſucke the place, or to draw out the venom with cupping-glaſſes: or (which is the ſafeſt courſe of them all) to apply an actuall cautery, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the place affected be full of ſinnewes. Laſtly to prouoke ſweat well, either in bed, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering the patient well with cloathes, or it is better by long and eaſie walking to procure ſweating. In ſome to attaine to the perfect curation, you muſt worke both with inward &amp; outward meanes, ſuch as here ſhall be preſcribed and ſet before your eyes: whereof the moſt choyce and approued I haue ſet downe for the benefit of the Reader: and firſt I wil beginne with <hi>Dioſcorides.</hi>

For when as any of the Inhabitants in thoſe parts were wounded of any poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous Serpent, by a Meſſenger forthwith fignified the ſame to the old Hermit: who by and by demaunded of the Meſſenger whether he could be content to take or drinke any Medicine in the ſtead of the ſicke patient: which if the other aſſented too, promiſing to take it, the Hermit commaunded him without any further delay, to pull off his right foot ſhoe, and to ſet his foote on the earth, drawing a line round about the foot with his knife: then he willed him to take away his foote, and within the ſpace of the line ſo marked, he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> writ or engraued theſe words following. <hi>Caro Caruze, ſanum reduce, reputata ſanum, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuel paracletus.</hi>

things in earth, and the Art of curing the eyes, was firſt taken from the Swallowes. The Eagles haue taught vs Architecture, and men firſt receiued the light of Phlebotomie or letting of blood from the <hi>Hippopotamus,</hi> which is a Beaſt liuing in the Riuer of <hi>Nilus,</hi> hauing feete like an oxe, and his backe and mane like a horſe, with a winding tayle, and tusked like a Bore. The byrd of Egypt called <hi>Ibis,</hi> firſt gaue knowledge to Phiſitians how to vſe the Gliſter; yea, dogges, Goates, Harts, Storkes, Swallowes and Weaſells, haue taught men many medicines for many diſeaſes.</p>
            <p>To beginne therfore to make an enumeration of their prayſes, I will declare vnto you, the rich vertues and externall goods of the body, fortune and mind. And firſt to beginne with the good gyfts of their bodies. If you will weigh and conſider the matter and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> of a Spyders body, you ſhall find it to be light, pertaking much of fire and ayre, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two of the moſt noble and effectall elements in operation) and hauing but little earthy draggines and droſſie refuſe. If you behold their figure, they haue eyther a Sphaericall and heauenly, or at leaſt-wiſe an Ouall forme, which is next to the Sphaericall, as beeing the perfecteſt of all other. Beſides, theyr ſubſtance is thinne, fine, glyſtering and ſubtile, yea although they ſeeme now and then to be fatted vp with plenty of meate, that they grow as bigge in bulke as a Wallnut, and if the learned <hi>Cardan</hi> may be credited, they growe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whiles as great as a Sparrow: yet for all that, if you caſt your eye on them againſt the light, hanging in their webbe, ſhe glittereth and ſhineth on all parts like vnto the Chriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite, which is a kind of precious ſtone, ſhining with a golden colour quite thorow, cauſing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> a pleaſant reflexion to the eyes, and piercing them with ſinguler delight.</p>
            <p>The colour of a Spyder is ſome-what pale, ſuch as <hi>Ouid</hi> aſcibeth to Louers, and when ſhee hangeth aloft in her webbe, with her legges wide and large ſpread abroade, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The skinne of a Spyder is ſo ſoft, ſmooth, exquiſite, pure, cleane and neate, that it farre ſurpaſſeth by many degrees, the poliſhed skinnes of thoſe mayds that haue the Greene-ſicknes, or thoſe young whores that are ſo carefull in ſparing no coſt to preſerue their beauties; And it is of ſuch creerenes and perſpicuitie, that it will eaſilie repreſent the viſage and phiſnomie of any beholder of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> it, much like vnto a fine glaſſe. Further, it hath fingers, for all the world ſuch as faire vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins deſire to haue, that is to ſay, long, round and ſlender, beeing alſo endued with the moſt exquiſite ſence of touching that poſſibly can be imagined, inſomuch that it farre ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounteth any mortall man liuing, and all other creatures in the world beſides, according to that old and common verſe.</p>

Many Phyloſophers haue not dared to affirme that they are blind, but they themſelues in this poynt are moſt blind. For if they be depriued of their eyes and eye-ſight, I would faine be reſolued hovv they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> could make choyce of ſuch apt and conuenient places for theyr hunting trade, and vvith what guide, Captaine or Director they doe knit, faſten and tye one thred to another, in ſuch admirable order, ranke and range, as the excellenteſt worke-men in the world ſtand amazed at.

by chaunce, or haue the skill to mend them, beeing eyther ſhaken or burſt in ſunder. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, we may all obſerue by our owne experience, that if one take a flye, and hold her at the ſide of the webbe, the familiar, tame, or domeſticall Spyder eſpying her, will make all the haſt ſhe can through thicke and thinne, yea though ſhe be farre off, and will boldly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayle and deuoure her, and will (as a man may ſay) take her out of your handes into her owne, which thing I haue often ſeene done. Surely therfore thoſe perſons are halfe blind, who neither can conceiue nor ſee, that Spyders can ſee.</p>
            <p>Now in that a Spyder ſeemeth to ſome to be an vglie and lothſome creature, and euen at the firſt ſight to be deteſted in regard it is ſo miſhapen, I will not impute this to any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect or default that is in their forme or proportion, but I rather aſcribe it to their excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great melancholy (for this humour is moſt predominant in them) &amp; to their ſtrange <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="01"/> luſting or longing, by reaſon of naughty humours gathered about the mouth of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, yea, and to their lacke of ſtay &amp; moderation in their luſts and affections. For they are no leſſe beholding to Nature for their elegancie, handſome and proper feature, then the Butter-flye, or any other cut-waſt whatſoeuer. To conclude this poynt, GOD hath giuen and beſtowed vppon this ſtrange and admirable body, as ſtrange and admirable a diſpoſition, nature, and conſtitution of the skinne. For a Spyder changeth her skin, not once onely in a yeeres ſpace, (as Vipers doe) but once in the ſpace of a month ſhe renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it, (if ſhe be well fedde and not hunge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>-ſtarued) and putteth on a new hue and skinne, and the ſame in all poynts more feſh, exquiſite and neate, then the old skinne which ſhee caſt off. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/>
            </p>
            <p>Amongſt the bleſſings of Fortune, or rather Fate, I eſteeme this to be the excellenteſt that is conferred vpon them, in that they beare about with them an inexhauſted matter or ſubſtance in their bellyes to make infinite webbes, yea ſuch a matter as can neuer be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, waſted or ſpent, of which they haue ſuch foyſon, as they are able to drawe out in length and breadth, and to ſpinne and deuiſe innumerable threds and ſtuffe to make and finiſh theyr cobwebbes of, ſo that if a hundred flyes light in them, they are of force ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſo to entangle and enſnare them all, as they ſhall neuer get out againe. Furthermore, although they haue neither foode nor ſuſtenaunce layd vp in Barnes or Storehouſes, as Piſmires haue, nor yet any meate ſet or ſowed for them as Bees haue, but get theyr com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons onely by taking of booties caſually, by hunting at all aduentures, and by chauncea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> preyes, yet doe they ſatisfie nature, and expell hunger, by meanes of that hazardous and ſuddaine ſpoyle; and ſometimes you ſhall ſee them growne very thicke, fatte and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wieldie, by reaſon of theſe good diſhes, and fat meſſes of meate which they can purchaſe by their ovvne good-wary husbandry, or by any meanes can lay on, and catch into their clawes.</p>
            <p>Beſides, I muſt tell you that Spyders haue not the leaſt benefit of Fortunes fauour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed vpon them, when as beeing inglutted with courtly viands, they haue beene glad to exchange lodgings with an old Courtier, called <hi>Padagra,</hi> or the Gowte, for it skilleth not whether of theſe two names you will chuſe. For you haue heard before, the wiſe king <hi>Salomon</hi> to haue giuen them the moſt prime and chiefeſt places in Princes Courts, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> ſhe might be an abſolute patterne and preſident of wit, wiſedome, moderate frugality and vertue, and in diuers poynts of regiment they might be our directors for imitation. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, beginning their cobwebs, they haue wholy bent and applyed themſelues to theyr moſt ingenious weauing trade, they haue giuen themſelues to curious and ſuperſtitious hunting, to captious taking at aduantage, watching and eſpying their prey, nothing at all fearing any ambuſhes, treacheries, trappes or treaſons, and no whit dreading any aſſaults, much leſſe tryumphes: and to ſpeake briefely, the wiſeſt creature of the wiſeſt King, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth a great ſtroke, dominereth, and hath (I may ſay) the ſole ſoueraigntie in the moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, greateſt, and ſtatelieſt courts of Princes. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/>
            </p>
            <p>And yet for all theſe vertues, (ſince Salomons time) there haue riſen vp and followed ſome Princes and Gouernours, vnaduiſed, deſperately naught, and vnthriftie, and ſuch as were not well in their wits, and of thoſe it cannot eaſily be ſpoken how churliſhly they entertained her, how they ſent out theyr proclamations and warrants, to expell the Spy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to caſt her downe to the earth, tread vnder-foote, vndoe and kill, as a night-thiefe,

            <p>Surely, miſerable was her condition and eſtate, which in all that abundance of wealth, ſhe onely beeing indigent and bare, deteſting idlenes withall, might not yet be admitted tenant for ſome ſhort terme of time, in ſome ſmall odde corner, in ſuch large and ſpacious buildings, nor yet find one hole to liue at peace in. Againe, the great men, the rich my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> and penny-fathers, following the example of their Princes and Gouernours, they in like ſort ſent packing out of their doores, the Schoole-miſtreſſe of all labour, diligence &amp; vertue, and will not permit a webbe, the very patterne, index, and anathema of ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall wiſedome, to remaine vntouched.</p>
            <p>This ſame Spyder which now we treate of, in times paſt, (it was when dogges &amp; cats could ſpeake, for now becauſe there are ſo many languages in the world, they turne all to plaine barking) tooke a long iourney into a ſtrange Country, and by good hap, fell into company with my Lady <hi>Podagra,</hi> although (beeing none of the beſt footers,) ſhee could hardly keepe way with the Spyder, but legged ſtill behind, and hauing now ſpent one whole day in trauell, the night approching that they ſhould take vp their Inne to lodge <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> in, they reſolued betwixt them two to betake themſelues to ſundry houſes; ſo the Spyder entering the Towne, tooke vp her lodging in the houſe of a certaine wealthy Cittizen, (I ſuppoſe it was neere the ſigne of the three Tunnes in Tower-hill-ſtreete,) where when according to her vſuall manner, hating lewd idlenes, ſhee began to buckle herſelfe to her wonted taske, in weauing her fine Tapiſtrie, and other wrought workes, beeing ſuddenly eſpyed of a company of Corner-creepers, Spyder-catchers, Fault-finders, and Quarrell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pickers, they preſently beginne to expoſtulate the matter with her, &amp; not ſtaying to heare any reaſon for her iuſt defence, they made no more adoe but gaue her Iack-drummes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainement, thruſting her out of doores by the head and ſhoulders, to ſeeke her lodging where ſhe could find it; ſo that ſhe lay abroad without doores a whole Winters-night in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> the raine and cold: and all this happened about Saint <hi>Nicholas</hi> time, when dayes are at the ſhorteſt.</p>
            <p>Now in the meane ſpace, <hi>Podagra,</hi> hauing none of the beſt feete, but indeede beeing ſome-what lame, when ſhe could trauaile no further, ſhee by chaunce light into a poore Cottage or cabbin of turffes, builded with Elder-poles at the Townes end, and yet in this poore ſhed ſhe could hardly be receiued, but yet at length, through her inceſſant ſollicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion beeing admitted, ſhe ſate downe to reſt her weary bones, ſo at length, ſupper beeing prepared, the tender-harted Lady found courſe fare, and commons farre ſhorter &amp; more homely, then euer <hi>Lipſius</hi> found in <hi>Weſtphalia:</hi> ſhe indured all the miſeries in the World, that pittie it was to ſee. There was no infelicitie, no diſtreſſe, misfortune and aduerſity to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> be compared vnto hers, for there was nothing but a little browne Barly-bread ſette on the boorde to ſuppe withall, which this nice peece ſo much miſliked and abhorred, as that at the very ſight thereof ſhee was ready to diſgorge her queaſie ſtomacke, then was there brought ſome cock-crowne keale, hauing no good reliſh, for they were not ſeaſoned with ſalt, ſo that they were in taſte very vntoothſome, &amp; when they ſhould drinke, they fetcht a little cold water out of a pitte or pond, neere adioyning to the houſe in a wodden-diſh, whereof if Miſtreſſe <hi>Podagra</hi> had fetched but one ſound carouſe, it would haue made her runne through an Alphabet of faces: but there was no remedy, hunger breaketh ſtone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>walls, and hard neede makes the old wife trotte, ſhee muſt either quench her thirſt vvith that, or faſt.</p>
            <p>Hauing thus thinlie ſupped, ſhee called for her Chamber, where they ſhewed her to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> clymbe vp a Ladder, (you would haue taken it to haue beene the fleas ladder,) &amp; behind a corner there was prouided a bed ſtuffed with good Wheate-chaffe in ſteed of Downe, to harden her hyde, and vnder her head a hard Oken-logge, with the Winnow-cloth, and the one end of an old Hop-bagge, caſt ouer in ſteed of a Couerlet, (for the poore man

and his wife, thought that none but the Lord of the Towne, &amp; women in child-bed vſed pillowes.) But <hi>Podagra</hi> not knowing how to mend the matter, groned &amp; made a lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table noyſe, and fetching a thouſand ſighes, ſhe couched herſelfe downe.

So ſoone therefore as the day began to breake, ſhe ſtarted vp, and the Spyder and ſhe met together againe at the appointed time and place: and firſt of all the Spyder beganne much to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of the inciuilitie of the rich chuffe his hoſt the Citizen. <hi>Podagra</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trariwiſe found as much or more fault with the ſhort and ſharpe commons, thinne dyet, miſerable pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and indigencie of his poore, bare and leane hoſt, ſhewing her blacke and blew markes and prints, into whoſe tender skinne the bordes and plancks had made a deepe impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="01"/> For which cauſe, beeing both much diſcontented, after the matter was thoroughlie debated betwixt them two, they determined and reſolued with themſelues, that the night following they would change hoſtes and Innes, that is, that the Spyder ſhould enter into ſome poore Cottages, or houſes of poore men, and <hi>Podagra</hi> ſhould bend her courſe vnto Noble and great mens houſes, to Kings courts &amp; princely Pallaces, to ſee what good was to be done there. So <hi>Podraga</hi> not beeing vnmindfull of her word, went with a fine and Snayle-like pace to the houſe of a certaine fat, rich, and well-monied man, &amp; quietly laid herſelfe downe at the feete of this corſie ſire: which as ſoone as the gentle hoſt caſt an eye vpon, it is ſtrange to tell with what mildneſſe, with what alurement and gentle entreatie, with what promptitude and alacritie ſhee was welcommed; they prepared ſoft pallats of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> Downe for her to lye vpon, the Bedſteds and the Settles whereon ſhee ſhould reſt, were couered with pillowes, ſoft cuſhions, and carpets of Perſia, the kitchen ſmokes, and all things are in a readines to giue her a moſt friendlie welcome.

Yes ſurely, very much, not onely becauſe ſhe ſpendeth her dayes more freely and ſafely from danger, but alſo becauſe as out of a high watch-tower, ſhe no longer beholdeth in the houſes of poore perſons, lauiſh and needleſſe prodigality, bankettings, quaffings, ryotting, playes, dauncing, dicing, and whoring, and a thouſand vanities and villanies beſides, whereof ſhe knew herſelfe conſcious, and a priuie witnes vnto, whilſt ſhe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> liued in the Halls and Bowers of the rich and wealthier ſort: who when they had thruſt cleane from houſe and home, and for euer baniſhed the Spyder, (the true Schoole-miſtres of induſtrie and frugality) ſtraight-wayes the lazie Gowte called <hi>Podaga,</hi> arreſted them. Had it not beene better for them (thinke you) to haue graunted a dwelling place, to a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, wiſe, prudent and harmeleſſe little creature, then to haue giuen entertainement to ſuch a baſe, blockiſh companion and gueſt as the Gowte is? Let not therefore, rich, coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous men wonder, if many times they be tormented with this ſore griefe, ſith they vvill neither admit true Phiſitian nor Phiſicke, I meane, trauaile, diligence, induſtry, modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and paines-taking, with the like.</p>
            <p>Now, to touch the rich and rare gifts and graces of the mind, and other noble qualities <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> and diſpoſitions of Spyders, I know not whither I ſhould firſt beginne with the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of their prudence, iuſtice, fortitude, temperance, their <hi>Philanthropia, Philoponia, Autarkeia,</hi> their humanitie and loue towards men, their ſtudious induſtry and loue of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, their contentation as hauing ſufficient, and coueting no more then is allotted vnto them. Theyr wittineſſe, pollicie, quicknes and ſharpnes of ſence, their cleannie neatenes,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:22894:139"/>
with many other vertues, or elſe her admirable cunning and skilfulneſſe in their weauing trade. Their prudence, ſagacity, and wittines to coniecture thinges future, appeareth in this one thing, that when great aboundance of raine, flouds, ſwelling and ouerflowings of Riuers, are like ſhortly to come to paſſe, and thereby to threaten houſes, they then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to build their webs higher by a great deale, then their vſuall cuſtome heretofore hath beene. And this is another proofe of the ſame, in that they weaue not at all in a cleare Sun-ſhine-day, or when it is faire and calme weather, when Flyes are moſt buſie in flying about to and fro, that they may be the better at leaſure to giue themſelues to hunting and watching after them, to take aduantage, and if any chance to light into their nets, forth-with to ſeize vpon them for their repaſt. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/>
            </p>
            <p>Againe, when houſes are ready to drop downe, they with their Copwebs firſt of all fall, and get them away packing, alter their clymate to ſome other ſurer place and dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to reſt in. If any thing touch her body that is hard or painefull, ſhe immediatly draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vp her Legges round on a heape: for this end as I thinke, to feele the leſſe paine, and the better to prouide for the health and ſafety of her head, the director and gouernor of the whole body: for if any other part be hurt, ſhe can eaſily cure it. Who hath manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted and made knowne this vnto them? Hath any <hi>Chaldaean</hi> Starre-gazer, or figure-flin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, by the ſight and poſition of the ſtarres ſhewed it vnto them? No certainely. But a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine prudence and forefeeling knowledge, originally in-bred by Nature to eſchewe that which is hurtfull, which is diffuſed into the Spyder, and as that famous Poet <hi>Virgilius</hi> hath <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> excellently deſcribed:</p>

               <l>Mind mooues the bodies lump, and skinnes.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>Furthermore, ſo ſoone as they eſpy their enemie to be caught in their nets, they do not firſt of all bite and pricke him to death in any hoſtile manner, but they ſeeme with theyr <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> feet gently and ſoftly to ſtroke him, yea euen to entreat and allure him with tickling, and as it were clipping &amp; colling, vntill they haue throughly enſnarled him within their clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and viſcous gins, and beeing at length wearied, turmoyled, and tyred with ſtrugling and ſtriuing in vaine, the ſilly fly is made vnable either to get away, ſtir, or reſiſt. So ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing made ſure worke with one, ſhe hyeth her to the Center of her Web, obſeruing and prying whether any newe prey will come to hand againe: ſo by this pollicy you ſhall ſee ſometimes ten, yea otherwhiles twenty flyes hanging aloft by their ſtrings and fine ſpun threds.</p>
            <p>They onely feede on the iuyce of Flyes, and the dry carkaſe without any moyſture, they caſt away as vnprofitable ſtuffe to be vſed about any buſineſſe. Moreouer, becauſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> the Female Spyder is ſometimes greater then the Male, therefore ſhee chuſeth her ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the lovver part of the webbe, that the poore flyes may ſeeme careleſſe of her, yet is ſhe very obſeruant, taking great heed to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: for they ſeeing her hanging below, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelues ſafe, do fly vp into the vpper part of the net, but by this meanes ſeeking to ſhun <hi>Charybdis,</hi> they fall into <hi>Scilla,</hi> out of the ſmoke into the fire: for though in regard of her bodies magnitude, ſhe bee vnwieldy, and very vnfit to beſtir her ſelfe in this hunting office: yet the crafty Male-Spyder playing Bo-peepe, and pretending ſome other buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, though minding another, playing the diſembling Hypocrite, hydeth himſelfe in the toppe of the Webbe, noting vvell all occurrents, and being ſeene of no body, there he lurketh till ſome fiſh (as we ſay) come to his net, and hauing eſpyed his prey, beeing more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> light, quicke, and liuely, it is a wonder to ſee, how diligent, vigilant, and earneſtly bent hee is to bend his courſe vvithall expedition tovvard this nevv offered booty: for there hee vvill not ſuffer it very long to remayne, but deſcending in a tryce, <hi>Euro velocius,</hi> as quicke as a Bee from the vpper vnto the lovver part (as I haue ſayde) of the Copweb, hee maketh a very quicke diſpatch, and hauing royally feaſted himſelfe, hee reſerueth
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:22894:140"/>
and layeth vp all his other enemies in one place, hanging the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all by one of his own threds till ſome conuenient time to feaſt himſelfe againe withall. Then againe when as by reaſon of long continuance and length of time, the webs haue loſt their binding, viſcoſity, and tenacious ſubſtance, either the Spyder vnweaueth them againe, or elſe confirmeth and new ſtrengthneth them afreſh as it were, with another new glutinoſity, or faſt-bynding clammineſſe. This their worke being finiſhed, they either containe themſelues in the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of it, or keeping ſentinell and warding in the vpper part, they hold as it were in theyr hands a thred drawne from the middeſt or Center, by which they haue eaſie acceſſe and receſſe to and fro to their beguiling nets; and withall this thred ſcrueth to another profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table vſe, for if any prey bee entangled by the light moouing and ſtirring of it, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> feele and perceiue it. But yet to make ſure worke, leaſt ſhe ſhould wind downe in vaine, or take bootleſſe labour about nothing, ſhe draweth backe the thred a little now &amp; then, and by the motion and peize of it, ſhe putteth all out of doubt, being fully aſcertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of the truth.</p>
            <p>Then firſt, withall celerity poſſible ſhee hies her to the Center, which thing the ſilly flyes being faſt, and hauing ſome ſence and feeling (as it ſhould ſeeme) that they are taken Tardie, and fordeeming ſome hurt, are as quiet as a Mouſe in a trappe, making no noyſe at all, leaſt eyther they might bewray or betray themſelues, and ſo be further enfolden in danger. But alaſſe in vayne doth hee auoyde warre, that cannot enioy peace, and boot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe doth he ſhunne payne that hath no meanes to feele reſt: for this auayleth but little, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> for they are not able withall theſe fetches to deceiue their ſharp inquiſitors, for both with eyes and feet, they finely and quickly run vnto them, making a cleane riddance &amp; quicke diſpatch of them euery one.</p>
            <p>But yet it is more to conſider what great iuſtice and equity is obſerued to be in Spyders. For there is not one of them ſo ill bent, ſo malepartly ſawcy, and impudently ſhameles, that can be ſeene to lay claime vnto, or to take away anothers wife or mate: there is none that entermedleth with anothers ſubſtance, buſineſſe, or weauing: euery one liueth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented by the ſweate of his owne browes, by their owne proper goods and induſtrious paynes taking procured by their owne bodily labour: ſo that not one of them dare enter his Neighbors freehold, but it is accounted a haynous matter, and very vnlawfull, not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> one dare be ſo knack-hardy as to breake into their friendes and fellowes fence and enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, but it is euen deteſted as a wicked and curſed deede.</p>

Let men therefore bee ſilent and ceaſe wandering at the amphitheatriall fights of the Romans, which were made with ſeats and Scaffoldes to behold playes and ſightes, and where were preſented to the Spectators the bloudy fights of Elephants, Beares and Lyons, ſithence a ſmall Spyder dare challenge to the fielde, &amp; fight hand to hand with a black and blew Serpent, and not onely to come downe to him in daring-wiſe, but alſo victoriouſly to tryumph ouer him, entirely poſſeſſing all the ſpoyle. Who would not maruaile that in ſo ſmal or in a maner no body at all, which hath neither bones nor ſinnewes, nor fleſh, nor ſcarce any skinne, there could be ſo great force, ſuch incredible audacity and courage, ſuch ſharp and hard bytings, and inuincible fury? Surely we muſt conclude neceſſarily, that this cannot proceede altogether from their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> ſtomacks, but rather from GOD himſelfe: In like ſort, they dare buckle with toads of all ſortes, both of the Land and Water, and in a ſinguler combate ouerthrow and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them, which thing not onely <hi>Pliny</hi> and <hi>Albertus</hi> doe recite and ſet downe for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine truth, but <hi>Eraſmus</hi> alſo in his <hi>Dialogue</hi> entituled <hi>De Amicitia,</hi> maketh mention of, reporting how a certaine Monke lying faſt aſleepe, on whoſe mouth a foule Toade ſat, and yet by the Spyders meanes was freed from all hurt. Yea, they dare enter the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat with winged and ſtinged Hornets, hauing not ſoft, but ſtiffe bodies, and almoſt as hard as horne, who although ſhe many times breaketh through theyr Cobwebbes with mayne ſtrength (as Rich men vndoe and make away through Lawes with Gold, and by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> that meanes many times ſcape ſcot-free) yet for all that, at length beeing ouermaſtered hand to hand in ſingle combat, and entangled and enſnarled with the binding paſtineſſe and tenacious gluyſh ſubſtance of the web, ſhe payeth a deere price for her breaking into anothers houſe and poſſeſſion, yeelding at length to the Spyders mercy.</p>
            <p>I will not omit their temperance, a vertue in former ages proper onely to men, but now it ſhould ſeeme peculiar to Spyders. For who almoſt is there found (if age and ſtrength permit) that contenteth himſelfe with the loue of one as hee ought, but rather applyeth his minde, body, and wandering affections to ſtrange loues But yet Spyders ſo ſoone as they grow to ripeneſſe of age, doe chooſe them Mates, neuer parting till death it ſelfe make the ſeparation. And as they cannot abide corriualles, if any wedlocke breakers, &amp; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> Cockold-makers dare bee ſo ſnappiſh to enter, or ſo inſolently proude as to preſſe into anothers Houſe or Cottage, they reward him iuſtly with condigne punniſhment for his temeratious enterprize, &amp; flagitious fact: Firſt by their cruell bytings, then with baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or exile, and oftentimes with death it ſelfe. So that there is not any one of them, that dare offer villany or violence to anothers Mate, or ſeeke by any meanes vnlawfully to abuſe her. There is ſuch reſtraint, ſuch ſtrict orders, ſuch faithfull dealing, vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of conſcience, and Turtle loue amongeſt them. Further, if you looke into theyr houſe-keeping, you ſhall finde there is nothing more frugall then a Spyder, more labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, cleanely, and fine. For ſhe cannot abide that euen the leaſt end or peece of her thred to be loſt, or to be placed and ſet to no vſe or profit, and they eaſe and releeue themſelues <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> by ſubſtitutes, that ſupply their roomes and take paines for them: for whileſt the Female weaueth, the Male applyeth himſelfe to hunting, if either of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fall ſicke and be weak, the one of them doth the worke of both, that their merits and deſarts may be alike. So ſome-times the female hunteth whileſt the male is buſie about Net-making, if the one ſtand in neede of the others help and furtherance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="268" facs="tcp:22894:141"/>
But yet commonly the Female-Spyder being enſtructed of her Parents when ſhee vvas young and docible, the art of ſpinning and weauing (which cuſtome was amongſt vs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in times paſt) beginneth the cobweb, &amp; her belly is ſufficient to miniſter matter inough for ſuch a peece of worke, whether it be that the nature or ſubſtance of the belly groweth to corruption at ſunne ſet and appointed time (as <hi>Democritus</hi> thought) or whether there be within them a certaine lanigerous fertility naturally as in Silke-wormes. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> is of opinion, that the matter is outward as it were a certaine Shell or pill, and that it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wound, looſened, and drawne out by their fine weauing and ſpinning. But how ſoeuer it be, certaine it is they will not by their good-wils looſe the leaſt iot of a threds end, but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry prouidently ſee to all though neuer ſo little. The loue they beare to their young breed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> is ſinguler, both in the care they haue for their faſhioning and framing to good orders, &amp; for their education otherwiſe, for the auoydance of idleneſſe. For the Male and Female doe by turnes ſit vppon their Egges, and ſo by this way enterchangeably taking courſes, they doe ſtirre vp, quicken, moue, and encreaſe naturall and liuely heate in them, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it hath beene ſundry times obſerued, that they haue brought forth three hunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth young ones at once, yet do they traine them vp al alike without exception, to labour, parſimony, and paynes taking, and invre them in good order, to faſhion and frame all thinges fit for the weauing craft. I haue often wondred at their cleanlines, when to keepe all things f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And this is ſufficient to haue ſpoken of their politicall, ciuill, &amp; domeſticall vertues: now will I proceede to diſcourſe of their skill in weauing, wherewith <hi>Pallas</hi> was ſo much offended: for the Scholler excelled her Maiſters, and in fine cunning and curious worke-manſhip, did far ſurpaſſe her. Firſt then let vs conſider the matter of the web, whoſe ſubſtance is tough, binding, and glutinous, plyant, and will ſticke to ones fingers like Birdlime, and of ſuch a matter it is compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as it neither looſeth his clammineſſe and faſt-holding quality, eyther by ſiccity or moyſture.</p>
            <p>The matter whereof it is made, is ſuch as can neuer bee conſumed, waſted, or ſpent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> whileſt they liue, and being ſo endleſſe, wee muſt needes heere admire and honor the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ending and infinite power of the great God: for to ſeeke out ſome naturall reaſon for it, or to aſcribe it to naturall cauſes, were in my minde meere madneſſe and folly. The <hi>Autumnall</hi> Spyders called <hi>Lupi</hi> or <hi>Holci,</hi> Wolues or Hunters, are thought to be the moſt artificiall and ingenious: For theſe draw out a thred finer and thinner then any Silke, and of ſuch a ſubtilty, that theyr whole vveb being folded together, vvill ſcarce be ſo heauy as one fine thred of Linnen being vveighed together. <hi>Edouardus Monimius</hi> hath very finely and eloquently deſcribed both the Males and Females, <hi>Heptam.

            </lg>
            <p>Of theſe Cobwebs there is great diuerſity, varietie, and difference: for ſome of them are looſe, weake, ſlacke, and not vvell bound: other contrarywiſe well compacted, and cloſe couched together, ſome <hi>Triangular,</hi> otherſome <hi>Quadrangular;</hi> and ſome are made with all ſides equall, but yet not right angled or cornered like a quarry of Glaſſe: others are made of ſuch a forme as will beſt fit the place where they hunt, you ſhal perceiue ſome of them to be orbicular, if they weaue betweene two trees, and you ſhall finde this faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on alſo among Weedes, and oftentimes in Windowes hanging together with many <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> lines and different croſſe-peeces: ſo that herein no man can deny but that they ſhew forth great reaſon, wiſedome, admirable iudgement, and much gallant beauty worthy to ſee to.</p>
            <p>Surely <hi>Euclides</hi> that famous <hi>Geometrician,</hi> who was Scholler to <hi>Socrates,</hi> &amp; liued in the time of <hi>Ptolomy</hi> the firſt, neede not be aſhamed to learne from Spyders the drawing of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of his figures and Geometricall proportions. And Fiſhermen alſo from them haue beene glad to learne the trade of Net-making. For from whom elſe could they borrow &amp; fetch ſuch liuely repreſentations, and ſuch expreſſe patterns, then from ſuch a skilfull and induſtrious Schoole-Maiſter. But the ſtrength of the webbe ſeemeth to bee very ſtrange, which although it ſeemeth to be the moſt weake of all other things, yet wee ſee it is able <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> to hold Hornets, and to endure the furious blaſtes of raging windes, and if one throw or caſt duſt vpon it, the ſame will rather be diſtended and ſtretched, then either vndone, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, or felled downe.</p>
            <p>And yet this is the ſtrangeſt of all, which many a man would thinke impoſſible but that it cannot be called in queſtion, in regard we may daily ſee and obſerue the proofe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of commeth to paſſe, that a Spyder ſhould beginne to place the one end of her thread on the one ſide of a little Riuer or Brooke, and how ſhee ſhould faſten the other end on the other ſide of the water, conſidering that Nature neuer taught them the art eyther of fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or ſwimming. I would faine bee reſolued of this ſcruple, by what meanes they ſayle and paſſe ouer. Or do you imagine that they iump ouer, or conuay themſelues ouer in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> a leape. Surely I dare not ſay ſo, I much doubt thereof, I will not ſtand to it.</p>
            <p>The next that beſt deſerueth to be Marſhalled in the ſecond ranke and place, for cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning worke in weauing and ſpinning, be thoſe kind of Spyders who build and labour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the rafters of Houſes, in Sellers, floures, and about boardes, plankes, and ſuch like, and of theſe ſome are wilder which doe faſhion and dreſſe a broad, thicke, and plaine web
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:22894:142"/>
in the graſſe and fieldes all about, ſtretching out the ſame like a ſaile, or ſome fine ſpread Sheete or Curtaine.</p>
            <p>If you would duely looke into their worke, and throughly conſider the ſtrange trydles of their Loomes, the Shittles they vſe, their Combs to make all cleane, the ſtay of their Loomes wherewith they dreſſe theyr Webbes, theyr Croſſe-lines, the frame, Woufe, their fine ſpinning-ſtuffe, and ſo their whole Cobwebs, you ſhall therein very plainely behold the finger of God working in his poore and weake creatures. And queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onleſſe in this excellent miſtery they are able to put downe, and farre Surmount the Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians, the Lydeans, <hi>Penelope, Tenaquil,</hi> (who was Wife to <hi>Tarquinius, Priſcus) Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtris,</hi> that famous Queene of <hi>Perſia, Claudiana, Sabina,</hi> and <hi>Iulia,</hi> Noble Roman Ladies <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> and all the Queenes of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> who were eſteemed and renowned throughout the whole world, to be the moſt curious &amp; exquiſite in this kind of faculty, &amp; who in needle-worke, Tapeſtry, and all Embroidery were thought to be peereleſſe. For theſe Spyders (euen contrary to all reaſon and Art, as we thinke) make a firme, ſtrong, and well com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted Web with no lines or threds drawne Croſſe-wiſe or ouerthwart, but onely made out and continued ſtill in length. When their worke is perfected and brought to an end, they lay ouer it, and couer it round about with a certaine glutinous kinde of Ielly, or ſlimed iuyce, by touching of which theyr prey being entangled, pay full deerely for their ignorant raſhneſſe, vnaduiſed heede-taking, and lacke of fore-ſight: Their web is of the colour of the ayre, or rather none at all, which eaſily deceiueth the fooliſh vnwary Flyes, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> and ſuch as be quicke-ſighted, circumſpect, and can eſpye thinges very quickly. For if it did repreſent any notorious and manifeſt colour, they would prouide in time againſt ſuch dangerous deuiſes, and take heede of ſuch traps aforehand.</p>
            <p>The baſer and vilder ſort of Spyders, and ſuch as bee leaſt reputed of, are thoſe that liue in holes, Caues, and corners of Houſes, and theſe in reſpect of the former are ſlowe, ſlothfull, and lazy: fat, groſſe, and bigge-bellyed corner-creepers, and theſe ſpinne a very homely, rough, and courſe thred, which they ſpread abroad, and ſet before the hollowe places and chinkes of Walles. Theſe kindes of Spyders haue a more heauy and ponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous body, ſhorter feete, and more vnhandſome to worke or finiſh any Webbes in their Loomes, and as for ſeparating, deuiding, picking, carding, or ſuting their ſtuffe, they are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> very Bunglers to the firſt mentioned.</p>
            <p>They apprehend and take their preyes rather caſually, then take any great paynes to ſeeke farre for it, becauſe their hole being great outwardly, ſeemeth to be a good and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient lurking corner, and a ſafe corner for Flyes to hide themſelues in: but beeing en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled and arreſted in the very entrie, they are ſnatched vp ſodenly by the watchfull Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and carryed away into the more inward places of their dennes, there to be ſlaughte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. For they watch and Ward aloft in high Walles and buildings, as well to deceiue ſuch Birdes as lye in waight to entrappe and take them at vnawares (as Sparrowes, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin-redbreaſts, Wrennes, Nightingales, and Hedge-Sparrowes vvhich are all ſworne e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to Spyders: and beſides, the more eaſily to beguile the ſilly flyes ſuſpecting no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> harme at all.</p>
            <p>There be certaine other ſorts of Spyders which as yet I haue not deſcribed, as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, there is one (the greateſt of all that euer I ſaw) which ſpreadeth her artificiall nettes in the Harueſt-time amongſt the leaues and branches of Roſes, and entangleth eyther a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other little Spyder that is running away, or elſe Gnat-flies, and ſuch like, being caught at vnawares, and hanged by a kind of thred, whom ſhe firſt purſueth and layeth hold on with a wonderfull dexterity and quickneſſe: and being faſt hanged, and ſo made ſure, ſhe there leaueth them, for the ſatisfieng of her hungry appetite till another time. The body of this Spyder is in colour ſomewhat whitiſh, reſembling S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This is one kind of <hi>Autumnall Lupi,</hi> or Wolfe-Spyder, which in a very ſhort ſpace of time do grow from the bigneſſe of a little Peaſe, to a very great bulk and thickneſſe. There are alſo found in all places of this Countrey, Long-legged-Spyders, who make a very

This kind of Spyder liueth altogether in the fields, her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is almoſt of a round figure, and ſomewhat browniſh in colour, liuing in the graſſe, and delighting in the company of Sheepe: and for this cauſe I take it, that we Engliſhmen do call her a Shepheard, either for that ſhe keepeth and loueth to be among their flockes, or becauſe that Shepheards haue thought thoſe grounds and feedings to bee very holeſome wherein they are moſt found, and that no venomous or hurtfull creature abideth in thoſe fields where they be: And herein their iudgment is to be liked, for they are indeed altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnhurtfull, whether inwardly taken, or otherwiſe outwardly applyed; and therefore becauſe I am tyed within a Teather, and thereby reſtrained from all affectionate diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing or dilating vnleſſe of poyſonous and harmefull Creatures, I will come into my path <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> againe, and tell you of another certaine blacke Spyder, that hath very ſhort feete, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about with her an Egge as white as Snow vnder her belly, and running very ſwiftly: the Egge being broken, many Spyders creepe forth, which goe forth with their damme to ſeeke their liuing altogether, and climing vpon her back when night approcheth, there they reſt, and ſo they lodge.</p>
            <p>In rotten and hollow trees there are alſo to be found exceeding blacke Spyders, hauing great bodies, ſhort feet, and keeping together with Cheeſe-lips or thoſe creeping vermine with many feet, called of ſome <hi>Sowes.</hi> We haue ſeene alſo (ſaith the learned <hi>Geſner)</hi> Spy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, that were white all ouer, of a round compact and well knit body, ſomewhat broad, liuing in the flowers of Mountaine <hi>Parſely,</hi> amongſt Roſes, &amp; in the greene graſſe: their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> Egges were little, ſlender, and very long, their mouth ſpeckled, and both their ſides were marked with a red line running all alongeſt. He tooke them to bee very venomous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee ſaw a Marmoſet or Monky to eate of them, and by eating thereof hardly to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape with life, yet at length it did well againe, and was freed from further daunger, onely by pouring downe a great deale of Oyle into his throat. I my ſelfe haue alſo ſeene ſome Spyders with very long bodies and ſharp tailes, of a blackiſh or darke red colour, &amp; I haue noted other-ſome againe to be all ouer the body greene-coloured. I will not deny but that there are many other ſorts of Spyders, and of many moe different colours, but I neuer reade, or yet euer ſaw them: <hi>Neque enim noſtra fert omnia tellus,</hi> The ages enſuing peraduenture will find more. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/>
            </p>
            <p>I will onely put you in remembrance of this one thing worthy to be obſerued, that all weauing and Net-making Spyders, according as they grow in yeares, ſo do they acquire more knowledge, and attaine to greater cunning and experience in their ſpinning trade: but carrying a reſolute and ready will to keepe both time and meaſure with that Muſicke which beſt contents moſt eares, I will now paſſe to ſpeake of the propagation and vſe of Spyders, and ſo I will cloſe vp this diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>The propagation of Spyders for the moſt part is by coupling together, the deſire and action whereof, continueth almoſt the whole Spring time, for at that time by a mutuall and often drawing, and eaſie pulling of their Web, they do as it were woe one another, then approch they nearer together: and laſtly are ioyned with their hippes one agaynſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> another backwards as Camels do, for that is the moſt fit for them iu regard of the round proportion and figure of their bodies. In like ſort do the <hi>Phalangies</hi> ioyne together, and are generated by thoſe of the ſame kinde, (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith:) But the <hi>Phalangies</hi> couple not in the Spring-ſeaſon, as the other Spyders doe, but towardes Winter, at what time they are very ſwift, quicke, nimble, and of moſt certaine hurt, more dangerous, &amp; more venomous in their bytinges. Some of them after their coupling together, doe lay one Egge onely, carrying it vnder their belly, it is in colour as white as Snow, and both Male and Female ſit vpon it by turnes.</p>
            <p>Some Spyders do exclude many little Egges very like vnto the ſeedes of Poppy, out of which it hath beene obſerued, that ſometimes there haue beene hatched three hunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> Spyders at one time, which after their vaine and idle plying and ſporting together in their Webbe, at length come foorth with their Damme, and towardes euening they all trudge home, vntill each one hath learned, and perfectly attained to the skill to ſpinne his owne webbe, that therein he may ſpend the reſidue of his dayes in more pleaſure, eaſe and ſecurity. They make excluſion of their young breede in hopping or skipping-vviſe,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:22894:143"/>
they ſitte on their egges for three dayes ſpace together, and in a months ſpace their young ones come to perfection. The domeſticall or Houſe-Spyder, layeth her egges in a thinne webbe, and the wilde-Spyder in a thicker and ſtronger, becauſe they are more expoſed to the iniuries of winds, and lie more open to the rage of and fury of ſtormes and ſhowers.</p>
            <p>The place and country where they are, helpeth much, and is very auaileable to their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration. There is no country almoſt, but there be many Spyders in it. For in the country about <hi>Arrha,</hi> which is in <hi>Arabia foelix,</hi> there is an infinite number of them to be found, and all the Iland of <hi>Candie</hi> ſwarmeth with <hi>Palangies. Strabo</hi> ſaith, that in Ethiopia there be great number of <hi>Phalangies</hi> found, of an exceeding bignes: although as <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith in his eight booke and 58. chapter, there are neither Wolfes, Foxes, Beares, nor no hurtful <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> creature in it: and yet wee all know, that in the Ile of <hi>Wight</hi> (a member of England,) the contrary is to be found, for although there were neuer dwelling in it, Foxes, Beares, nor Wolfes, yet there be Spyders ynow.</p>
            <p>The Kingdome of Ireland neuer ſaw Spyders, and in England no <hi>Phalangies</hi> will liue long, nor yet in the Ile of <hi>Man,</hi> &amp; neere vnto the Citty of <hi>Grenoble,</hi> in that part of France which lyeth next Italy, <hi>Gaudentius Merula</hi> ſaith, there is an old Tower or Caſtle ſtanding, wherein as yet neuer any Spyder hath beene ſeene, nor yet any other venomous creeping creature, but rather if any be brought thether from ſome other place, they forth-with die. Our Spyders in England, are not ſo venomous as in other parts of the world, and I haue ſeene a madde man eate many of them, without eyther death or deaths harme, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> manifeſt accident or alteration to enſue. And although I will not denie, but that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our Spyders beeing ſwallowed downe, may doe much hurt, yet notwithſtanding we cannot chuſe but confeſſe, that their byting is poyſonleſſe, as being without venome, procuring not the leaſt touch of hurt at all to any one whatſoeuer; and on the contrarie, the byting of a <hi>Phalangie</hi> is deadly.</p>
            <p>We ſee the harmeleſſe Spyders almoſt in euery place, they climbe vp into the Courts of mightie Kings, to be as it were myrrours and glaſſes of vertue, and to teach them ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt proweſſe and valiancie. They goe into the lodgings, ſhoppes and Ware-houſes of poore-men, to commend vnto them contentment, patience, labour, tolerance, induſtry, pouertie and frugalitie. They are alſo to be found in rich-mens chambers, to admoniſh <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> them of their duties. If you enter into your Orchard, they are buſie in clothing euerie Tree; if into the Garden, you ſhall finde them amongſt Roſes; if you trauaile into the field, you ſhall haue them at their worke in hedges, both at home and abroad, whetherſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer you bend your courſe, you cannot chuſe but meete with them, leaſt perhappes you might imagine, or elſe complaine and find ſome faults, that the Scholemiſtres and perfect preſident of all vertue and diligence were in any place abſent.</p>
            <p>Who would not therefore be touched, yea and poſſeſſed with an extreame wonder at theſe vertues and faculties, which we daily ſee &amp; behold with our eyes. <hi>Philes</hi> hath briefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and compendiouſly deſcribed their nature, properties, inclinations, wit and inuention in his Greeke verſes, which beeing turned into Latine, ſound to this effect. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/>

            <p>The Spyder put into a lynnen clowre, and hung vpon the left arme, is an excellent me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine to expell a Quotidian-Ague, as <hi>Trallianus</hi> ſaith: and yet it will be more effectuall if <note place="margin">Theyr vſe.</note> many Spyders be boyled with oyle of Bay to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſtence of a liniment, to annoynt the wriſts and the temples a little before the fit, for by this meanes the Feauer will be abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cured, or will ſildome returne againe. <hi>Kiramides.</hi> A Spyder tempered and wrought vppe with Milt-waſt or <hi>Ceterach,</hi> and ſo ſpred vppon a cloth, to be applyed to the temples, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the fits of a Tertian-Feauer. <hi>Dioſcoride.</hi> The Spyder that is called a <hi>Wolfe,</hi> being put into a quill, and ſo hanged about the necke, performeth the ſame effect, as <hi>Pliny</hi> reporteth. The domeſticall Spyder, which ſpinneth and weaueth a thinne, a white, or a thicke web, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> beeing incloſed in a peece of leather, or a nut-ſhell, and ſo hanged about the necke, or vvorne about the arme, driueth away the fits of a Quartaine-feauer, as both <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> &amp; <hi>Fernelius</hi> haue thought. For the paine in the eares, take three liue Spyders, boyle them with oyle vpon the fire, then deſtill or droppe a little of this oyle into the payned eare, for it is very excellent, as witneſſeth <hi>Marcellus Empiricus. Pliny</hi> ſteepeth them in vineger and
<pb facs="tcp:22894:144"/>
oyle of Roſes, and ſo to be ſtamped together, and a little thereof to be dropped into the pained eare with a little Saffron, and without doubt, ſaith he, the paine will be mittigated, and the ſame affirmeth <hi>Dioſcorides.</hi> Or elſe ſtraine out the iuyce of Spyders, mixing it with the iuyce of Roſes, and with ſome wooll dipped in the ſame liquour, apply it to the eare.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Soraſtus</hi> in his booke <hi>Peri Dakeon</hi> writeth, how that the Spyder which is called <hi>Crano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calaptes,</hi> beeing ſtifled or choked in oyle, is a very preſent helpe againſt any poyſon taken inwardly into the body, as the Scholiaſt of <hi>Nicander</hi> reporteth. There be ſome that catch a Spyder in the left hand, and beate and ſtampe it with the oyle of Roſes, putting ſome of it into the eare, on the ſame ſide the tooth aketh, and as <hi>Pliny</hi> telleth vs, it doth exceeding <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> much good. Spyders applyed and layd vpon their owne bytings, or taken inwardly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the body, doe heale and helpe thoſe hurts themſelues procured.</p>
            <p>What ſhould I talke of the white ſpots of the eyes, a moſt dangerous griefe? and yet are they cleane taken away with very ſmall labour, if ſo be one take the legges, eſpecially of thoſe Spyders which are of the whiter ſort, and ſtamping them together with oyle, do make an oyntment for the eyes. <hi>Pliny.</hi> The moiſt iuyce that is ſquieſed out of a houſe-Spy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, being tempered with oyle of Roſes, or one dramme of Saffron, and a droppe or two thereof dropped into the eyes, cureth the dropping or watering of them, by meanes of a rhume iſſuing out thereat: or elſe the moiſture of a Spyder or his vrine beeing taken by themſelues, laying a little wooll on the top of the part affected, worketh the ſame effect; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> whereby you may well vnderſtand, that there is nothing in a Spyder ſo vile, homelie, or ſordidous, that doth not ſome good, and ſerueth to ſome end.</p>
            <p>Againſt the ſuffogation of the belly, <hi>Aetius</hi> doth counſell to apply a <hi>Cerote</hi> to the nauell made of Spyders, and ſaith that he hath found it to preuaile much in this kind of paſſion. <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith, but he yeeldeth no reaſon for it, that Spyders doe helpe the paine and ſwelling of the Spleene. He writeth alſo further, that if a man catch a Spyder as ſhe is glyding and deſcending downe-wards by her thred, and ſo being cruſhed in the hand, &amp; then applied to the nauell, that the belly will be prouoked to the ſtoole, but beeing taken as ſhee is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending, and applyed after the ſame former manner, that any looſenes or fluxe is ſtayed and reſtrayned thereby. The ſame <hi>Pliny</hi> alſo writeth, that if a man take a Spyder, and lay <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> it vppon a fellon, (prouided that the ſick patient may not know ſo much,) that within the ſpace onely of three dayes, that terrible and painefull griefe will be cleane taken away. And beſides he affirmeth, that if the head and feete of a ſpyder be caſt away, and the reſt of the body rubbed and bruiſed, that it will thoroughly remedie the ſwelling in the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, proceeding of inflamation.</p>
            <p>If any be vexed with ſtore of lyce, and doe vſe a ſuffumigation made onely with Spy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, it will cauſe them all to fall and come away, neither will there afterwards any moe breede in that place. The fat of a Gooſe tempered and mixed with a Spyder and oyle of Roſes together, beeing vſed as an oyntment vpon the breaſts, preſerueth them ſafelie, as that no milke will coagulate or curdle in them after any birth. <hi>Anonymus.</hi> Yea, that ſame <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> knotty ſcourge of rich men, &amp; the ſcorne of Phiſitians, I meane the Gowte, which as ſome learned men hold can by no meanes be remedied, yet feeleth mitigation and diminution of paine, and curation alſo, onely by the preſence of a Spyder, if it be taken aliue, and her hinder legges cut off, and afterward incloſed in a purſe made of the hyde of a Stag. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, we ſee (which all other medicines can neuer doe) that all they are freed for the moſt part, both from the Gowte in the legges and hands, where the ſpyders are moſt found, &amp; where they are moſt buſie in working, &amp; framing their ingenious deuiſed webs. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, this is a rare miracle of nature, &amp; a wonderfull vertue, that is in this contemptible little creature, or rather eſteemed to be ſo vile, abiect, and of no eſtimation. Rich men were happy indeede, if they knew how to make vſe of their owne good. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/>

hard vpon the wound, to ſtay the inordinate effuſion of blood? Queſtionleſſe, if we were as diligent and greedy to ſearch out the true properties and vertues of our owne domeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call remedies, which we would buy of others ſo deerely, we would not enforce our ſelues with ſuch eager purſute after thoſe of forraine Countries, as though things fetcht farre off, were better then our owne neere at hand; or as though nothing were good &amp; wholeſome vnleſſe it came fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Egypt, Arabia or India. Surely, vnleſſe there were ſome wild worme in our brames, or that we were bewitched and poſſeſſed with ſome Furie, we would not ſo farre be in loue with forraine wares, or be ſo much beſotted, as to ſeeke for greedy new phiſicke and phiſicall meanes, conſidering that one poore Spyders webbe will doe more good, for the ſtanching of blood, the curation of vlcers, the hindering of ſanies, ſlyme, or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> ſlough to grow in any ſore, to abate and quench inflamations, to conglutinate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolidate wounds, more then a cart-loade of Bole fetcht out of Armenia, <hi>Sorcocolla, Sanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racha,</hi> or that earth vvhich is ſo much nobilitated by the impreſſe of a ſeale, and therefore called <hi>Terra Sigillata,</hi> the clay of Samos, the durt of Germany, or the loame of Lemnos.

            <p>And in regard of theſe excellent vertues and qualities, it quickly cureth bleedings at the noſe, the Haemorrhoides, and other bloodie-fluxes, whether of the opening of the mouthes of the veines, their opertions, breakings, or any other bloody euacuation that too much aboundeth, beeing either giuen by it ſelfe alone in ſome Wine, eyther inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> or outwardly, or commixed with the Blood-ſtone, <hi>Crocus Martis,</hi> and other the like remedies fit for the ſame intentions.</p>
            <p>The cobwebbe is alſo an ingredient into an vnguent which is made by Phiſitians, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the diſeaſe called <hi>Serpego,</hi> and beeing bound to the ſwellings of the fundament, if there be inflamation ioyned withall, it conſumeth them without any paine, as <hi>Marcellus Empiricus</hi> teſtifieth. It likewiſe cureth the watering or dropping of the eyes, as <hi>Pliny</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth, and beeing applyed with oyle, it conſolidateth the wounds of the ioynts: and ſome for the ſame intent, vſe the aſhes of cobwebbes, with fine Meale and White-vvine mixed together.</p>
            <p>Some Surgeons there be that cure Warts in this manner; They take a Spyders-web, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> roling the ſame vppe on a round heape like a ball, and laying it vppon the wart they then ſet fire on it, and ſo burne it to aſhes, and by this way and order the vvarts are eradicated, that they neuer after grow againe. <hi>Marcellus Empiricus</hi> taketh Spyders webbes that are found in the Cypreſſe-tree, mixing them with other conuenient remedies, ſo giuing them to a podagricall perſon for the aſſwaging of his paine.

            <p>I will adde therefore this one note before I end this diſcourſe, that Apes, Marmoſets or Monkies, the Serpents called Lizards, the Stellion, which is likewiſe a venomous beaſt like vnto a Lizard, hauing ſpots in his necke like vnto ſtarres, Waſpes, and the little beaſt called <hi>Ichneumon,</hi> Swallowes, Sparrowes, the little Titmouſe, and Hedge-ſparrowes, doe often feede full ſauourlie vppon Spyders.

            <p>In the dayes of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, there dwelled in the Cittie of <hi>Alexandria</hi> a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine young mayde, which from her youth vp, was fed and nouriſhed onely with eating of Spyders, and for the ſame cauſe the King was premoniſhed not to come neere her, leaſt peraduenture he might be infected by her poyſonous breath, or by the venome euapora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

by her ſweating. <hi>Albertus</hi> likewiſe hath recorded in his writings, that there vvas a certaine noble young Virgine dwelling at <hi>Colen</hi> in Germany, who from her tender yeeres was fedde onely with Spyders. And thus much we Engliſh-men haue knowne, that there was one <hi>Henry Lilgraue,</hi> liuing not many yeeres ſince, beeing Clarke of the Kitchen to the right noble <hi>Ambroſe Dudley</hi> Earle of Warwicke, who would ſearch euery corner for Spyders, and if a man had brought him thirtie or fortie at one time, he would haue eaten them all vp very greedily, ſuch was his deſirous longing after them.</p>

Yet that there is another and more noble kind of Stellion aunciently ſo called of the Learned, ſhall afterward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in the ſucceeding diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>This Beaſt or Serpent, is called by the Graecians <hi>Colottes, Aſcalobotes,</hi> &amp; <hi>Galeotes,</hi> and ſuch an one was that which <hi>Ariſtophanes</hi> faineth from the ſide of a houſe eaſed her belly into the mouth of <hi>Socrates</hi> as hee gaped, when in a Moone-ſhine night hee obſerued the courſe of the ſtarres, and motion of the Moone. The reaſon of this Greeke name <hi>Aſcala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>botes,</hi> is taken from <hi>Aſcalos,</hi> a circle, becauſe it appeareth on the backe full of ſuch circles <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> like ſtarres, as writeth <hi>Perottus.</hi> Howbeit, that ſeemeth to be a fayned Etymologie, and therefore I rather take it, that <hi>Aſcala</hi> ſignifieth impuritie, and that by reaſon of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleaneneſſe of this beaſt, it was called <hi>Aſcalabetes,</hi> or as <hi>Suidas</hi> deriueth it, of <hi>Colobates,</hi> becauſe by the helpe and dexteritie of the fingers, it clymbeth vppe the walls euen as Rats and myce; or as <hi>Kiramides</hi> will haue it, from <hi>Calos,</hi> ſignifying a peece of wood, becauſe it clymbeth vppon wood and Trees. And for the ſame reaſon it is called <hi>Galeotes,</hi> becauſe it clymbeth like a Weaſill, but at this day it is vulgarly called among the Graecians <hi>Liakoni,</hi> although ſome are alſo of opinion, that it is alſo knowne among them by the words <hi>Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miamithos,</hi> and <hi>Pſammamythe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Among the vulgar Haebrewes, it is ſometimes called <hi>Letaah,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>Semma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,</hi> as <hi>Munster</hi> vvriteth. The Arrabians call it <hi>Sarnabraus,</hi> and <hi>Senabras,</hi> a Stellion of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> the Gardens. And peraduenture, <hi>Guarill, Guaſemabras, Alurel,</hi> and <hi>Gnaſes.</hi> And <hi>Syluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> alſo vſeth <hi>Epithetes</hi> for a Stellion. And the generall Arabian word for ſuch creeping byting things, is <hi>Vaſga,</hi> which is alſo rendered a dragon of the houſe. Inſteed of <hi>Colotes, Albertus</hi> hath <hi>Arcolus.</hi> The Germaines, Engliſh, and French, haue no words for this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:22894:145"/>
except the Latine word, and therefore I was iuſtly conſtrained to call it a Stellion, in imitation of the Latine word.</p>
            <p>As I haue ſhewed ſome difference about the name, ſo it now enſueth that I ſhould doe the like about the nature and place of their abode. Firſt of all therefore I muſt put a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt the Italian Stellion or <hi>Tarentula,</hi> and the Thracian or Graecian, for the Stel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of the Ancients is propper to <hi>Gracia.</hi> For they ſay this Stellion is full of Lentile ſpots, or ſpeckles, making a ſharpe or ſhrill ſhrieking noyſe, and is good to be eaten, but the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Italy are not ſo. Alſo they ſay in Sicilia that their Stellions inflict a deadly byting, but thoſe in Italy cauſe no great harme by their teeth. They are couered with a skin like a ſhell or thicke barke, and about their backes there are many little ſhining ſpots like eyes, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> (from whence they haue their names) ſtreaming like ſtarres, or droppes of bright &amp; cleare water, according to this verſe of <hi>Ouid.</hi>

            </lg>
            <p>It mooueth but ſlowly, the backe and tayle beeing much broader then is the backe and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> tayle of a Lyzard, but the Italian <hi>Tarentulaes</hi> are white, and in quantitie like the ſmalleſt Lyzards: and the other Graecian Lyzards, (called at this day among them <hi>Haconi,)</hi> is of bright ſiluer colour, and are very harmefull and angry, whereas the other are not ſo, but ſo meeke and gentle, as a man may put his fingers into the mouth of it without danger. One reaſon of their white bright ſhining colour, is becauſe they want blood, and therefore it was an errour in <hi>Syluaticus</hi> to ſay that they had blood.</p>
            <p>The teeth of this Serpent are very ſmall and crooked, and whenſoeuer they byte, they ſticke faſt in the wound, and are not pulled forth againe except with violence. The tayle is not very long, &amp; yet when by any chaunce it is broken, bytten, or cut off, then it grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth againe They liue in houſes, and neere vnto the doores and windowes thereof make <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> their lodgings, and ſome-times in dead-mens graues and Sepulchres, but moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they clymbe and creepe aloft, ſo as they fall downe againe, ſome-times into the meate as it is in dreſſing, and ſometimes into other things, (as we haue already ſaid,) into <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> mouth, &amp; when they deſcend of their owne accord, they creepe ſide-long. They eate Hony, and for that cauſe creepe into the hiues of Bees, except they be very carefully ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, as <hi>Virgill</hi> writeth;
<q>
                  <l>Nam ſaepe fauos, ignotus adedit Stellio.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Many times the Stellion at vnawares meeteth with the Hony combes. They alſo of Italy many times eate Spyders. They all lye hidde foure monthes of the yeere, in vvhich <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> time they eate nothing, and twice in the yeere, that is to ſay, both in the Spring-time and Autumne, they caſt theyr skinne, which they greedily eate ſo ſoone as they haue ſtripped it off. Which <hi>Theophrastus</hi> and other Authors write, is an enuious part in this Serpent or creeping creature, becauſe they vnderſtand that it is a noble remedy againſt the Falling-ſickneſſe: vvherefore to keepe men from the benefit and good which might come there-by, they ſpeedily deuoure it.</p>
            <p>And from this enuious and ſubtile part of the Stellion, commeth the cryme in <hi>Vlpianus</hi> called <hi>Crimen Stellionatus,</hi> that is, when one man fraudulently preuenteth another of his money, or wares, or bargaine, euen as the Stellion dooth man-kind of the remedy which commeth vnto them by and from his skinne. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/>
            </p>
            <p>This cryme is alſo called Extortion, and among the Romans, when the Tribunes did with-draw from the Souldiours their prouiſion of victuall and Corne, it is ſaid, <hi>Tribunos qui per Stellatur as Militibus aliquid abstuliſsent, capitali poena affecit.</hi> And therefore <hi>Budaeus</hi> relateth a hiſtory of two Tribunes, who for this ſtellature were worthilie ſtoned to death by the commaundement of the Emperour.

               </l>
            </lg>
            <p>Their bodyes are very brittle, ſo as if at any time they chaunce to fall, they breake their tayles. They lay very ſmall egges, out of which they are generated: and <hi>Pliny</hi> writeth that the iuyce or liquor of theſe egges layde vppon a mans body, cauſeth the hayre to fall off, and alſo neuer more permitteth it to grow againe. But whereas wee haue ſaid, it deuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the skinne, to the damage &amp; hurt of men, you muſt remember, that in auncient time the people did not want their pollicies and deuiſes to take away this skinne from them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they could eate it. And therfore in the Sommer-time they watched the lodging place and hole of the Lyzard, and then in the end of the winter toward the Spring, they tooke Reedes and did cleaue them in ſunder, theſe they compoſed into little Cabonets, and ſet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> them vppon the hole of the Serpent: Now when it awaked and would come forth, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grieued with the thicknes and ſtraightnes of his skinne, preſſeth out of his hole tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough thoſe Reedes or Cabonet, and finding the ſame ſome-what ſtraight, is the more gladde to take it for a remedie; ſo by little and little it ſlydeth thorough, and beeing tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough, it leaueth the skinne behind in the Cabonet, into the which it cannot reenter to
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:22894:146"/>
deuoure it. Thus is this wylie Serpent by the pollicie of man iuſtly beguiled, looſing that which it ſo greatly deſireth to poſſeſſe, and changing nature, to line his guttes vvith his coate, is preuented from that gluttony, it beeing ſufficient to haue had it for a couer in the Winter, and therefore vnſufferable that it ſhould make foode thereof, and it the ſame in the Sommer.</p>
            <p>Theſe Stellings (like as other Serpents) haue alſo theyr enemies in nature, as firſt of all they are hated by the Aſſes, for they loue to be about the maungers and rackes on which the Aſſe feedeth, and from thence many times they creepe into the Aſſes open noſtrills, and by that meanes hinder his eating. But aboue all other, there is greateſt antipathy in nature betwixt this Serpent and the Scorpion, for if a Scorpion doe but ſee one of theſe, it falleth into a deepe feare, and a cold ſweat, out of which it is deliuered againe very ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> and for this cauſe a Stellion putrified in oyle, is a notable remedie againſt the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of a Scorpion, and the like warre and diſſention, is affirmed to be betwixt the Stelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and the Spyder.</p>
            <p>Wee haue ſhewed already, the difference of Stellions of Italie from them of Greece, how theſe are of a deadly poyſonous nature, and the other innocent and harmeleſſe, and therefore now it is alſo conuenient, that wee ſhould ſhew the nature and cure of this poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which is in this manner.</p>
            <p>Whenſoeuer any man is bytten by a Stellion, hee hath ache and payne thereof conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, and the wound receiued looketh very pale in colour, the cure whereof, according to the ſaying of <hi>Aetius,</hi> is to make a playſter of Garlicke and Leekes mixed together, or <note place="margin">Aetius.</note> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> elſe to eate the ſaid Garlice and Leekes, drinking after them a good draught of ſvveete Wine, vnmixed and very pure, or elſe apply <hi>Nigella Romana, Seſamyne,</hi> and ſweet water vnto it. Some (as <hi>Arnoldus</hi> writeth) preſcribe for this cure the dunge of a Faulcon, or a Scorpion to be bruiſed all to peeces, and layd to the wound. But ſometimes it happeneth, that a mans meate or drinke is corrupted with Stellions that fall into the ſame from ſome high place where they deſire to be clymbing, and then if the ſame meate or Wine ſo cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted be eaten or drunk, it cauſeth vnto the partie a continuall vomiting &amp; payne in the ſtomacke. Then muſt the cure be made alſo by vomits to auoyd the poyſon, and by Gly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to open the lower paſſage, that ſo there may be no ſtoppe or ſtay, to keepe the impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned meate or drinke in the body. And principally thoſe thinges are preſcribed in this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> caſe, which are before expreſſed in the Cantharides, when a man hath by any accident beene poyſoned by eating of them.</p>
            <p>The remedies which are obſerued out of this Serpent are theſe: Beeing eaten by Hawkes, they make them quickly to caſt theyr old coates or feathers. Others giue it in meate after it is bowelled, to them that haue the Falling-ſickneſſe. Alſo when the head, <note place="margin">Creſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            </p>
            <p>The oyle of Stellions beeing annoynted vpon the arme-holes or pittes of chyldren, or young perſons, it reſtraineth all hayre for euer growing in thoſe places. Alſo the oyle of Stellions, which are ſod in Oyle-oliue with Lyzards, do cure all boyles and wennes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming them without launcing or breaking. And the aſhes of the Stellion are moſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally commended againſt the Falling-ſicknes, like as alſo is the skinne or truncke, as we haue ſaid before. The head burned and dryed, and afterward mixed with Honny-attick, is very good againſt the continuall dropping or running of the eyes; and in the dayes of <hi>Pliny,</hi> he writeth that they mixed <hi>Stibum</hi> here-withall. The hart is of ſo great force, that it being eaten, bringeth a moſt deepe and dangerous ſleepe, as may appeare by theſe verſes.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> diſtinguiſheth the Triacle of the Viper, from that of the Tyre, and calleth one of them <hi>Trohiſcos Tyri,</hi> and the other, <hi>Trohiſcos Viperae.</hi> So <hi>Gentilis</hi> and <hi>Florentinus,</hi> do like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe put a manifeſt difference betwixt the Tyre and the Viper, although in many thinges they are alike, and agree together.</p>
            <p>This Tyre is called in Latine <hi>Tyrus</hi> and <hi>Tyria,</hi> and alſo among the Arabians, as <hi>Sylua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus</hi> wryteth, <hi>Eoſmari,</hi> and <hi>Alpfahex. Rabbi Moſes</hi> in his Aphoriſmes writeth, that when the Hunters goe to ſeeke theſe Serpents, they carry with them bread, which they caſt vnto them, and while the Tyre doth eate it, hee cloſeth his mouth ſo faſt, that his teeth cannot ſuddainely open againe to doe his hunting aduerſary any harme, and this thing (as hee writeth) is very admirable at the firſt, to them that are ignorant of the ſecrete in nature. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> 
               <hi>Galen</hi> alſo writeth ſo much to <hi>Piſo</hi> of Vipers, and he ſaith that the Circulators, Iuglers or Quackſaluers, did caſt certaine mazes or ſmall cakes to them, which whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they had taſted, they had no power to harme any body.</p>
            <p>This Tyrus is ſaid to be a Serpent about the coaſts of Iericho in the Wildernes, where it hunteth Birds, and liueth by deuouring of them and their egges. And a confection of the fleſh of this Serpent, with the admixture of ſome few other things, taketh away all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxicate poyſon, which confection is called Triacle. It is alſo reported, that whereas the Dragons haue no poyſon of themſelues, they take it away from this Serpent, and ſo poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with a borrowed venom. For this poyſon is very deadly: and there is a tale (which I will not tell for truth) that before the comming and death of our Sauiour <hi>Ieſus Christ,</hi> the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> ſame was vnremediable, and they died thereof, whoſoeuer they were that had been poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned by a Tyre, but on the day of <hi>Christ</hi> his paſſion, one of them was found by chaunce in Ieruſalem, which was taken aliue, and brought to the ſide of our Sauiour hanging vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Croſſe, where it alſo faſtened the teeth, and from that time euer ſince, all the kind haue receiued a qualified and remediable poyſon, and alſo their fleſh made apt to cure it ſelfe, or other venoms.</p>
            <p>It is reported that when the Tyrus is old, he caſteth, or rather wreſteth off his coate, in this manner following; Firſt it getteth off the skinne which groweth betwixt the eyes, by which it looketh as if it were blind, and if it be ſtrange to a man, (I meane the firſt time that euer he ſaw it) he will verily take it to be blind: afterward, it alſo fleyeth off the skin <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> of from the head, and ſo at laſt, by little and little, the whole body, at which ſight it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth as though it were an Embryon, or skinleſſe Serpent. They keepe theyr egges in their belly, and in them breede theyr young ones, as the Vipers doe, for before they come out of the dammes belly, they are in all parts (according to theyr kind) perfect creatures, and ſo euery one generateth his like, as doe foure footed-beaſtes.</p>

I take it by the relation of <hi>Geſner,</hi> that the Dypſas in Italy is called <hi>Tyrus.</hi> Alſo <hi>Cardan</hi> writeth, that there is a ſuppoſed and falſe conceit, that with the fleſh of this <hi>Tyre,</hi> mixed with Hellebore and water, is made a confection to reſtore youth: but the truth is, it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther weakeneth and deſtroyeth bodies, then helpeth them, and maketh a counterfeite or varniſhed falſe youth, but no true youth at all. Thus farre <hi>Cardan,</hi> and thus much of this Serpent, the other things written of it, are the ſame that are written of the Viper.</p>

The Italians call this <hi>Teſtuma teſtudine, vel teſtugire, tartuca, enfuruma, tartocha, &amp; co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorona.</hi> And in Ferraria, <hi>Gallanae, tartugellae, biſcae ſcut llariae.</hi> The inhabitants of <hi>Taurinu, Cupparia.</hi> The Portugalls, <hi>Gagado.</hi> The Spanyards, <hi>Galapago,</hi> and <hi>Tartuga.</hi> The French, <hi>Tortue,</hi> and <hi>Tartue.</hi> And in Sauoy, <hi>Boug coupe.</hi> The Germaines, <hi>Schiltkrot,</hi> and <hi>Tallerkrot.</hi> The Flemings, <hi>Schilt padde,</hi> which aunſwereth our Engliſh word Shell-crab.

            <p>There be of Torteyſes three kinds, one that liueth on the Land, the ſecond in the ſweet waters, and the third in the Sea, or ſalt-waters. There are found great ſtore of theſe in India eſpecially of the Wate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Torteyſes, and therefore the people of that part of the Country, are called <hi>Chelonophagi;</hi> that is, Eaters of Torteyſes, for they liue vpon them: and theſe people are ſayd to be in the Eaſt-part of India. And in <hi>Carmania</hi> the people are likewiſe ſo called. And they do not onely eare the fleſh of them, but alſo couer their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes with their ſhells; and of their abundance, doe make them all manner of veſſels. And <hi>Pliny</hi> and <hi>Solinus</hi> write, that the Sea Torteyſes of India are ſo bigge, that with one of them they couer a dwelling Cottage. And <hi>Strabo</hi> ſayth, they alſo row in them on the waters, as in a Boate.</p>
            <p>The Iſlands of <hi>Serapis</hi> in the Redde-Sea, and the fartheſt Ocean Iſlands, towardes, the Eaſt of the Red Sea, hath alſo very great Torteyſes in it: and euery where in the Red-Sea they ſo abound, that the people there doe take them and carry them to their greateſt Marts and Fayres to ſell them, as to <hi>Rhaphtis,</hi> to <hi>Ptolemais,</hi> and the Iſland of <hi>Dioſcorides,</hi> whereof ſome haue white and ſmall ſhels. In <hi>Lybia</hi> alſo they are found, and in the night time they come out of their lodgings to feede, but very ſoftly, ſo as one can ſcarcely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue their motion.</p>
            <p>And of one of theſe <hi>Scaliger</hi> telleth this ſtory. One night (ſaith he) as I was trauayling, being ouer-taken with darkeneſſe and want of light, I caſt about mine eyes to ſeeke ſome place for my lodging, ſafe and ſecure from Wild-beaſts; and as I looked about, I ſaw (as I thought) a little <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ill or heape of earth, but in truth it was a Torteyſe, couered all ouer with moſſe: vpon that I aſcended and ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>l aſleepe, and ſo ended that nights reſt vppon the backe of the Torteyſe. In the morning, when light approched, I perceiued that I was remooued farre from the place, whereon I firſt choſe to lodge all night; and therefore riſing vp, I beheld with great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration the face and countenaunce of this Beaſt, in the knowledge whereof, (as in a new nature) I went foreward, much comforted in my weariſome iourney.</p>
            <p>The deſcription of the Torteyſe and the ſeuerall partes thereof now followeth to bee handled. Thoſe creatures (ſaith <hi>Pliny)</hi> which bring forth or lay egs, eyther haue feathers as Fowles, or haue ſcales as Serpents, or thicke hides as the Scorpion, or elſe a ſhell like the Torteyſe. It is not without great cauſe that this ſhell is called <hi>Scutrem,</hi> and the Beaſt <hi>Scutellaria,</hi> for there is no buckler and ſhield ſo hard and ſtrong as this is. And <hi>Palladius</hi> was not deceiued when he wrote thereof, that vppon the ſame might ſafelie paſſe ouer a Cart-wheele, the Cart being load<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The Male is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſalacious and giuen to carnall copulation, but the Female is not ſo; for when ſhee is attempted by the Male, they fight it out by the teeth, and at laſt the Male ouercommeth, whereat he reioyceth as much, as one that in a hard conflict, fight, or battaile, hath won a fayre Woman; the reaſon of this vnwillingneſſe is, becauſe it is exceeding paynefull to the Female. They engender by riding or couering one another. When they haue layde theyr Egges, they doe not ſit vpon them to hatch them, but lay them in the Earth, couered, and there by the heat of the Sun is the young one formed, and commeth foorth at due time without any further help from his parents.</p>

            <p>We haue ſhewed already that there are certaine people of the Eaſt called <hi>Chelophagi,</hi> which liue by eating of Torteyſes, and with theyr ſhells they couer theyr houſes, make all theyr veſſels, rowe in them vppon the water, as men vſe to rowe in boates, and make them likewiſe ſerue for many other vſes.</p>
            <p>But as concerning the eating of the fleſh of Torteyſes, the firſt that euer wee read that vſed this ill dyet, were the Amozons, according as <hi>Caelius Rhod:</hi> and other Authours writeth. Beſides, <hi>Aloyſius Cadamustus</hi> affirmeth, that he himſelfe did taſt of the fleſh of a Torteyſe, and that it was white in colour, much like vnto Veale, and not vnpleaſant. But <hi>Raſis</hi> is of a cleane contrary opinion, condemning it for very vnſauourie, and vnwhole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, becauſe the taſte and temperament thereof, is betwixt the Land and the Water, it beeing a beaſt that liueth in both Elements. And in eating heereof the Graecians haue a prouerbe, <hi>Chelones kreas he phagein, he me phagein:</hi> That is, eyther eate Torteyſe fleſh, or eate it not. Meaning that when we eate it, we muſt eate nothing elſe, and therefore muſt be filled ſufficiently onely with that kind of meate: For to eate little, breedeth fretting
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:22894:149"/>
in the belly, and to eate much is as good as a purgation, according to the obſeruation of many actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, which being done <hi>Frigide &amp; ignauiter,</hi> that is, coldly &amp; ſlothfully to halues, doe no good, but beeing done, <hi>Acriter &amp; explicatie,</hi> earneſtly and throughly bring much content and happineſſe.</p>
            <p>But I maruaile why they are vſed in this age, or deſired by Meat-mongers, ſeeing <hi>Apicius</hi> in all his booke of Variety of Meats, doth not mention them; and I therefore wil conclude the eating of Tortoyces to be dangerous, and hatefull to Nature it ſelfe, for vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it be taken like a Medicine, it doth little good, and then alſo the Sawces and decoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or compoſitions that are confected with it, are ſuch as doe not onely qualifie, but vtterly alter all the nature of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, (as <hi>Stephanus Aquaeus</hi> hath well declared) in his French diſcourſe of Frogges and Tortoyces. And therefore to conclude this Hiſtory of the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toyce, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> I will but recite one riddle of the ſtrangeneſſe of this beaſt which <hi>Tertullian</hi> out of <hi>Pacuuius</hi> maketh mention of, and alſo in Greeke by <hi>Moſchopulus,</hi> which is thus tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>

This Tortoyce of the earth is an enemy to Vipers, and other Serpents, and the Eagles againe are enemies to this, not ſo much for hatred as deſirous thereof for Phyſicke, againſt their ſickneſſes &amp; diſeaſes of Nature; and therefore they are called in Greeke <hi>Chelonophagoi aetoi,</hi> Tortoyce-eating-Eagles: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they cannot come by them out of their deepe and hard Shell, yet they take them vp into the ayre, and ſo let them fall downe vppon ſome hard ſtone or Rocke, and there-vpon it is broken all to peeces, and by this means died the famous Poet <hi>Aeſchilus,</hi> vvhich kind of fate was foretold him, that ſuch a day he ſhould dye: wherefore to auoyd his end, in a fayre Sunne-ſhine cleare day he ſat in the fields, and ſuddenly an Eagle let a Tortoyce fall downe vpon his head which brake his ſcull, and cruſhed out his braynes, whereupon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> the Graecians wrote:</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Pliny</hi> calleth this Sea-Tortoyce <hi>Mus Marinus,</hi> a Mouſe of the Sea, and after him <hi>Albertus</hi> doth ſo likewiſe.

<pb n="288" facs="tcp:22894:151"/>
which goe out of his Necke, ſhoulders, and hippes, that tye on and faſten the ſame to his body.</p>
            <p>His forefeet being like hands, are forked and twiſted very ſtrong, &amp; with which it figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and taketh his prey, and nothing can preſſe it to death except the frequent ſtrokes of Hammers. And in al their members except their quantity, &amp; their feet, they are much like the Tortoyces of the Earth, for otherwiſe they are greater, and are alſo blacke in colour. They pull in their heads as occaſion is miniſtred to them, eyther to fight, feede, or be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, and theyr whole ſhell or couer ſeemeth to be compounded of fine Plates. They haue no teeth, but in the brimmes of theyr beakes or ſnouts are certaine eminent diuided thinges like teeth, very ſharp, and ſhut vppon the vnder lippe like as the couer of a Boxe, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> and in the confidence of theſe ſharp prickles, and the ſtrength of their hands and backes, they are not afrayde to fight with men.</p>
            <p>Theyr eyes are moſt cleare and ſplendant, caſting theyr beames farre and neare, and alſo they are white in colour, ſo that for their brightneſſe and rare whiteneſſe, the Apples are taken out and included in Rings, Chaines, and Bracelets. They haue reynes which cleaue to their backes, as the Reines of an Bugle or Oxe. Theyr feete are not apt to be v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in going, for they are like to the feet of Seales or Sea-calues, ſeruing in ſtead of Oares to ſwim withall. Their legges are very long, and ſtronger in their feet and nailes, then are the clawes of the Lyon.</p>
            <p>They liue in Rockes and the Sea-ſands, and yet they cannot liue altogether in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> or on the Land, becauſe they want breathing and ſleepe, both which they performe out of the Water: yet <hi>Pliny</hi> writeth, that many times they ſleepe on the top of the water, <note place="margin">Braſauolus</note> and his reaſon is, becauſe they lye ſtill vnmooueable, (except with the Water) and ſnort like any other Creature that ſleepeth, but the contrary appeareth, ſeeing they are found to ſleepe on the Land, and the ſnorting noyſe they make is but an endeuour to breath, which they cannot well doe on the toppe of the Water, and yet better there then in the bottome.</p>
            <p>They feede in the night-time, and the mouth is the ſtrongeſt of all other Creatures, for with it they cruſh in peeces any thing, be it neuer ſo hard, as a ſtone or ſuch thinges: <note place="margin">Ariſtotle</note> they alſo come and eate graſſe on the dry Land. They eate certaine little Flſhes in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> Winter time, at which ſeaſon their mouth is hardeſt, and with theſe Fiſhes they are alſo bayted by men, and ſo taken. <hi>Pauſanius</hi> writeth, that in <hi>Affrica</hi> there are Maritine Rocks called <hi>Sceleſtae,</hi> and there dwelleth among a creature called <hi>Scynon,</hi> that is <hi>Zytyron,</hi> a Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toyce, and whatſoeuer he findeth on that Rockes which is a ſtranger in the Sea, the ſame he taketh and caſteth downe headlong.

Plinius</note> the copulation with the Male, vntill hee ſet againſt her a ſtalke or ſtemme of ſome Tree or Plant. They lay their Egges and couer them in the earth, planing it ouer with their breaſts, and in the night-time they ſit vppon them to hatch them. Their Egges are great, of diuers colours, hauing a hard ſhell, ſo that the young one is not framed or brought foorth within leſſe compaſſe then a yeere, (as <hi>Aristotle</hi> writeth) but <hi>Pliny</hi> ſayth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> thirty dayes.</p>
            <p>And for as much as they cannot by Nature, nor dare for accident long tarry vppon the Land: they ſet certaine markes with their feete vppon the place where they lay theyr Egges, whereby they know the place againe, and are neuer deceiued. Some againe ſay, that after they haue hidde their Egges in the earth forty dayes, the Female commeth the <note place="margin">Plutarch.</note> iuſt fortith day, not fayling of her reckoning, and vncouereth her Egges wherein ſhee findeth her young ones formed, vvhich ſhe taketh out as ioylfully as any man would do Gold out of the earth, and carryeth them away with her to the Water. They lay ſome-times an hundered Egges, and ſometimes they lay fevver, but euer the number is very great.</p>
            <p>There is vppon the left ſide of <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> a little Iſland vpon the Port <hi>Beata,</hi> which is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> called <hi>Altus-Bellus,</hi> where <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> reporteth ſtraunge thinges of many Creatures; eſpecially of the Tortoyces, for hee writeth, that when they rage in luſt for copulation, they come on ſhore, and there they digge a Ditch wherein they lay together three or foure hundered Egges, beeing as great as Gooſe-Egges, and when they haue made an
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:22894:151"/>
end, they couer them with Sand and goe away to the Sea, not once looking after them: but at the appoynted time of Nature, by the heate of the Sunne, the young Tortoyces are hatched, engendered, and droduced into light without any further helpe of theyr Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</p>
            <p>Great is the courage of one of theſe, for it is not afrayde to ſet vppon three men to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, but if it can bee turned vpward vppon the backe, it is made weake and vnreſiſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And if the head be cut off and ſeuered from the body, it dieth not preſently, nor clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth <note place="margin">Aelianus</note> the eyes, for if a man ſhake his hand at it, then vvill it winke, but if hee put it neere, it will alſo byte if it can reach it. If by the heat of the Sunne theyr backes grow dry, they alſo grow weake and inflexible; and therefore they haſten to the Water to remollifie them, or elſe they dye within ſhort time: and for this cauſe this is the beſt way to take <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> them. In the whotteſt day they are drawne into the deepe, where they ſwimme willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with their backes or ſhelles aboue the Water, where they take breath, and in continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, the Sunne ſo hardeneth them, that they are not able to helpe themſelues in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but they grow very faynt and weake, and are taken at the pleaſure of the Fiſher-man.</p>
            <p>They are alſo taken on the toppes of the Water after they returne weary from theyr feeding in the Night-time, for then two men may eaſily turne them on theyr backes, and in the meane-while another caſteth a Snare vppon them and draweth them ſafely to the Land. In the <hi>Phaenician</hi> Sea they are taken ſafely without daunger, and generally where they may be turned on theyr backe, there they can make no reſiſtaunce, but where <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> they cannot, many times they wound and kill the Fiſher-men, breaking the nets aſunder, and let out all the other Fiſh included with them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bellorius</hi> writeth, that there bee of theſe Sea-Tortoyces two kindes, one long, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther round, and both of them breath at theyr Noſes, bycauſe they want Gilles, and the long ones are moſt frequent about the Port <hi>Torra</hi> in the redde Sea, whoſe couer is varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, for the Males ſhell is playne and ſmooth vnderneath, and the Females is hollow. The Turkes haue a kinde of Tortoyce, whoſe ſhell is bright like the Chryſolite, of which they make haftes for Kniues of the greateſt price, which they adorne with Plates of gold. In <hi>Iambolus,</hi> an Iſland of the South, there are alſo found certaine Monſters or liuing <note place="margin">Boemus</note> creatures, which are not very great, yet are they admirable in Nature, and in the vertue of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> their bloud.</p>
            <p>Their bodyes are round and like the Tortoyce, hauing two croſſe lynes ouer theyr backes, in the ends of which is an eye and an eare at eyther ſide, ſo as they ſeeme to haue foure eares, the belly is but one, into which the meate paſſeth out of the mouth. They haue feete round about, and with them they goe both backward and forward. The ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of their bloud is affirmed to be admirable: for whatſoeuer body is cut aſunder &amp; put together, if it be ſprinkled with this bloud during the time that it breatheth, it covniteth as before.</p>
            <p>The ancient <hi>Troglodytes</hi> had a kind of Sea-Tortoyce, which they call <hi>Celtium,</hi> which had hornes, vnto which they faſtened the ſtrings of their Harpes, theſe alſo they worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> and accounted very holy. Yet ſome thinke that they might better be called <hi>Celetum</hi> then <hi>Celtium,</hi> but I thinke <hi>Hermolaus</hi> dooth better call them <hi>Chelitium apo tes Cheluos,</hi> which ſignifieth both a Tortoyce and their broad breaſtes, and with their Hornes they helpe themſelues in ſwimming. <hi>Albertus</hi> alſo maketh mention of a Tortoyce called <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chora,</hi> but it is thought to be a corrupt word from <hi>Oſtra Codermus.</hi> Theſe Sea-Tortoyces are found ſometimes to be eyght cubits broad, and in India with their ſhelles they couer houſes, and ſuch vſe: they alſo put them vnto in <hi>Tabrobana,</hi> for they haue them fifteene cubits broad. And thus much for all kind of Tortoyces. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/>

            <p>The Haebrevves as it appeareth Eſay. 59. and <hi>Iob.</hi> 6. call it <hi>Aphgnath,</hi> and according to Munſter <hi>Aphgnaim,</hi> plurally for Vipers, becauſe of the variety of colours, wherewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all they are ſet all ouer. The Arabians from the Greeke word <hi>Thereon,</hi> ſignifieng all kind of wilde Beaſtes, doe alſo call it <hi>Thiron,</hi> and that kinde of Viper vvhereof is made the Triacle, they call a <hi>Alafafrai,</hi> and <hi>Alphai:</hi> they alſo call it <hi>Eoſman,</hi> (as <hi>Leonicenus</hi> wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth.) Beſide, it is called <hi>Alphe,</hi> which ſeemeth to bee deriued of the Haebrevves, and <hi>Afis</hi> which may likewiſe be coniectured to ariſe from the Greeke vvord <hi>Ophis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Greekes call the Male peculiarly and properly <hi>Echis,</hi> and the Female <hi>Echidna,</hi> and it is a Queſtion whether the vulgar word among the Gaecians at this day <hi>Ochendra,</hi> doe not alſo ſignify this kinde of Serpent. <hi>Bellonius</hi> thinketh, that it is corrupted of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> 
               <hi>Echidna</hi> the Female Viper. The Germans haue many vvords for a Viper, as <hi>Brandt Schlangen, Natet-Otter, Heck-Nater,</hi> and <hi>Viper-Nater.</hi> The French <hi>Vne Vipere.</hi> The Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards <hi>Biuora,</hi> and <hi>Bicha,</hi> The Italians <hi>Vipera, Maraeſſo, Scurtio,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>Scorzo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nei,</hi> although <hi>Scorzo,</hi> and <hi>Scorzone,</hi> be generall wordes in Italy for all creeping Serpents without feet, and that ſtrike with theyr teeth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="291" facs="tcp:22894:152"/>
There is alſo about the word <hi>Maraeſo</hi> ſome Queſtion, although <hi>Leonicenus</hi> decideth the matter, and maketh it out of all Controuerſie, and <hi>Rhodigimus</hi> thinketh it a very ſignificant vvord deriued from the people <hi>Marſi,</hi> bycauſe they carryed about Vipers. The Mountebankes do alſo call <hi>Suffili,</hi> from <hi>Sibila,</hi> the hiſſing voyce which it maketh. Some will haue <hi>Nepa</hi> to be alſo a Viper, yet wee haue ſhewed that already to ſignyfie a Scorpion.</p>
            <p>The Graecians ſay, that the Viper is called <hi>Echidna paro to echinin eaute ten gonen achri thanaton:</hi> bycauſe to her ovvne death ſhee beareth her young one in her belly; and therefore the Latines doe alſo call it <hi>Vipera, quaſi vipariat:</hi> bycauſe it dyeth by violence of her byrth or young: and they attribute vnto it venome and peſtilence, and generally <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> there are fevve Epithets vvhich are aſcribed to the Serpent, but they alſo belong vnto this. There is a pretious Stone <hi>Echites,</hi> (greeniſh in colour) which ſeemeth to bee like a Viper, and therefore taketh name from it. Alſo an Hearbe <hi>Echite,</hi> like <hi>Scammony,</hi> and <hi>Echidmon</hi> or <hi>Viperina.</hi> In <hi>Cyrene</hi> there are Myce, which from the ſimilitude of Vipers are called <hi>Echenatae.

            <p>When <hi>Hercules</hi> was dryuing away the Oxen of <hi>Geryon,</hi> hee came into <hi>Scythia,</hi> and there fell aſleepe, leauing his Mares feeding on his right hand in his Chariot, and ſo it happened by diuine accident, that vvhiles hee ſlept they vvere remooued out of his ſight and ſtrayed avvay from him. Afterward hee awaked, and miſſing them, ſought all ouer the Countrey for them; at laſt hee came vnto a certaine place, where in a caue hee found a Virgin of a double natured proportion, in one part reſembling a Mayde, and in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Serpent, whereat he wondered much, but ſhee told him, that if he would lye with her in carnall copulation, ſhee would ſhewe him vvhere his Mares and Chariot vvere: whereunto hee conſented and begat vppon her three Sonnes, famous among Poeticall Writers: Nmely, <hi>Agathyrſus, Gelonus,</hi> and <hi>Scythus:</hi> but I will not proſecute eyther <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> the names, or theſe Fables any further, and ſo I will proceede to the deſcription of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers. The colour of Vipers is ſomewhat yellowiſh, hauing vpon theyr skins many round ſpottes, theyr length about a cubit, or at the moſt three palmes. The tayle curled, at the end very ſmall and ſharpe, but not falling into that proportion equally by euen attenua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, growing by little and little, but vneuenly ſharped on the ſudden from thickeneſſe to thinneſſe. It is alſo without fleſh, conſiſting of skinne and bone, and very ſharp.</p>
            <p>The head is very broad, compared with the body, and the Necke much narrower then the head: The eyes very redde and flaming, the belly winding, vppon which it go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all in length, euen to the tayle, and it goeth quickly and nimbly: ſome affirme, that it hath two canyne teeth, and ſome foure. And there is ſome difference betwixt the Male &amp; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> the female; the female hath a broader head, the neceke is not ſo eminent, a ſhorter and thicker body, a more extended tayle, and a ſofter pace, and foure canyne teeth. Againe, the Male hath a narrower head, a necke ſwelling or ſtanding vp, a longer and thinner bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and a ſwifter pace or motion ſo that in the Pictures propoſed in this diſcourſe: the firſt of them are for the Male, and the laſt for the Female, and this is the peculiar outward difference betwixt the Male and the Female Vipers. <hi>Auicen</hi> ſayth beſides, that the tailes of Vipers make a noyſe when they goe or mooue. Thoſe are taken to bee the moſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and liuely, that haue the broadeſt and holloweſt head like a Turbot, quick and liuely <note place="margin">Cardan</note> eyes, two canyne teeth, &amp; a griſtie or claw in the Noſe or tayle, a ſhort body or tayle, a pale colour, a ſwift motion, and bearing the head vpward. For the further deſcription <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> of theyr ſeuerall partes. Theyr teeth are very long vppon the vpper chappe, and in number vppon eyther ſide foure, and thoſe vvhich are vppon the neather Gumbe are ſo ſmall, as they can ſcarce be diſcerned, vntill they be rubbed and preſſed; but alſo it is to bee noted, that while they liue, or when they bee dead, the length of theyr teeeth cannot appeare, excetp you take from them a little bladder, in which they lye concealed. In that
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:22894:153"/>
Bladder they carry poyſon, which they infuſe into the wound they make with their teeth: They haue no eares, yet all other liuing Creatures that generate their like, and bring foorth out of their bellies haue eares, except this, the Sea-Calfe, and the Dolphin, yet in ſtead hereof, they haue a certaine griſtly caue or hollowneſſe in the ſame place where the eares ſhould ſtand. The Wombe and place of conception (ſaith <hi>Pliny)</hi> is double, but the meaning is, that it is clouen as it is in all Females (eſpecially women, &amp; Cowes.) They conceiue Egges, and thoſe Egges are contained neere theyr raynes or loynes. Their skin is ſoft, yeelding alſo to any ſtroake, and when it is fleyed off from the body, it ſtretcheth twice ſo bigge as it appeared while it couered the liuing Serpent: To conclude, <hi>Phyliolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> writeth, that their face is ſomewhat like the face of a man, and from the Nauell it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembleh <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> a Crocodile, by reaſon of the ſmall paſſage it hath, for his egeſtion which excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not the eye of a Needle. It conceiueth at the mouth. And thus much for the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in generall.</p>
            <p>There is ſome difference among this kinde alſo, according to the diſtinction of place wherein they liue, for the Vipers in Aethiopia are all ouer blacke like the men, and in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Countryes they differ in colour, as in England, France, Italy Greece, Aſia, and Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, as writeth <hi>Rellonius.</hi> There is ſcarce any Nation in the World wherein there are not found ſome Vipers. The people of <hi>Amyctae</hi> which were of the Graecian bloud, droue away all kinde of Serpents from among them, yet they had Vipers which did byte mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally; <note place="margin">Herodotus.</note> and therefore could neuer bee cured, beeing ſhorter then all other kindes of Vipers <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> in the World.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe in <hi>Arabia,</hi> in <hi>Syagrus,</hi> the ſweete Promontory of Frankinſence, the <hi>Europaen</hi> Mountaines, <hi>Seiron, Pannonia, Aſelenus, Corax,</hi> and <hi>Riphaeus:</hi> the Mountaines of <hi>Aſia, Aegages, Bucarteron,</hi> and <hi>Cercaphus,</hi> abound vvith Vipers. Likewiſe Aegypt, and in all <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica</hi> they are found alſo, and the <hi>Affrycans</hi> affirme, (in deteſtation heereof) that it is not ſo much, <hi>Animal,</hi> as <hi>Malum naturae:</hi> Thar is, A liuing Creature, as euill of Nature: To conclude, they are found in all Europe. Some haue taken exceptions to <hi>Crete,</hi> becauſe <hi>Aristotle</hi> vvriteth, that they are not found there, but <hi>Bellonius</hi> affirmeth, that in <hi>Creete</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo he ſaw Vipers which the Inhabitants call by the name of <hi>Cheudra,</hi> which ſeemeth to be deriued from the Greeke <hi>Echidna.</hi> At this day it is doubted whether they liue in Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> Germany, or England, for if they doe, they are not knowne by that name: yet I ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily thinke that we haue in England a kinde of yellow Adder which is the Viper that <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonius</hi> ſaw heere, for I my ſelfe haue killed of them, not knowing at that time the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence or ſimilitude of Serpents, but ſince I haue perceiued to my beſt remembrance that the proportion and voyce of it did ſhew that it was a Viper. The moſt different kindes of Vipers are found in Aegypt and Aſia.</p>
            <p>Concerning the quantity, that is the length and greatneſſe of this Serpent, there is ſome difference, for ſome affirme it to be of a cubit in length, and ſome more, ſome leſſe. The Vipers of Europe are very ſmall, in compariſon of them in <hi>Affrica,</hi> for among the <hi>Troglodytes</hi> (as writeth <hi>Aelianus)</hi> they are fifteene cubits long, and <hi>Nearchus</hi> affirmeth as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> much of the Indian Vipers; <hi>Aristobulus</hi> alſo writeth of a Viper that hee ſaw which was nine cubits long, and one hand breadth: and ſome againe (as <hi>Strabo</hi> affirme) that they haue ſeene Vipers of ſixteene Cubits long, and <hi>Nicander</hi> vvriteth thus of the Vipers of Aſia;</p>

Others there bee in <hi>Aſia</hi> ſixteene foote long, and ſome there bee againe twenty, as in the Golden <hi>Caſtiglia,</hi> where theyr heads are like the heads of Kiddes.

            <p>But yet the Male hath beſide his Canyne teeth, as many as hath the Female: and beſides the Male is knowne from the Female, as the ſame <hi>Nicander</hi> vvriteth, becauſe the Female vvhen ſhee goeth, dravveth her tayle as though ſhee vvere lame, but the Male more manlike and nimble, holdeth vppe his head, ſtretcheth out his tayle, reſtrayneth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> the breadth of his belly, ſetteth not vppe his Scales (as doeth the Female;) and beſides, dravveth out his body at length.</p>
            <p>The Meate of theſe Vipers are greene Hearbes, and alſo ſometimes liuing Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: and namely, Hore-flyes, Cantharides, <hi>Pithiocampes,</hi> and ſuch other things as they <note place="margin">Gallen.</note> can come by, for theſe are fit and conuenient meate for them. <hi>Aristotle</hi> writeth, that ſometimes alſo they eate Scorpions, and in <hi>Arabia</hi> they not onely delight in the ſvveete iuyce of <hi>Balſam,</hi> but alſo in the ſhadow of the ſame. But aboue all kinds of drink, they are moſt inſatiable of wine. Sometime they make but little folds, and ſometime greater, but in their wrath their eyes flame, they turne their tailes and put forth their double tongue. In the winter-time as we haue ſaid already, they liue in the hollow Rocks, yet <hi>Pliny</hi> affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> that then alſo they enter into the earth, and become tractable and tangible by the <note place="margin">Aristotle</note> hands of man, for in the cold weather they are nothing ſo fierce as they are in the hot, and in the Sommer alſo they are not at all times alike furious, but like to all other Serpents. They are moſt outragious in the Canicular daies, for then they neuer reſt, but with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall diſquiet mooue vp &amp; downe till they are dead or emptied of their poyſon, or feele an abatement of their heate. Twiſe in the yeare they caſt their skins, that is to ſay, in the Spring, and in the Autumne: and in the ſpring time when they come out of their hole or <note place="margin">Ariſtotle</note> winter lodgings, they help the dimneſſe of their eye-ſight by rubbing their eyes vpon fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell. But concerning their copulation and generation, I find much difference among wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> wherefore in a matter ſo neceſſary to be knowne, I will firſt of all ſet downe the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of other men, aſwell Hiſtorians as Poets, and then in the end &amp; concluſion, I will be <note place="margin">Auicenna.</note> bold to interpoſe my owne iudgement for the better information of the Reeder. <hi>Herodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> in his <hi>Thalia</hi> writeth, that when the Vipers begin to rage in luſt, and deſire to couple one with another, the Male commeth and putteth his head into the mouth of the female, who is ſo inſatiable in the deſire of that copulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that when the male hath filled her with all his ſeed-genitall, and ſo would draw forth his head againe, ſhe byteth it off, &amp; deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth her husband, whereby he dyeth and neuer liueth more: but the female departeth and conceiueth hir young in hir belly, who euery day according to natures inclination, grow to perfection and ripeneſſe, and at laſt in reuenge of their fathers death, doe likewiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> their mother, for they eate out her belly, and by an vnnaturall iſſue come forth into the light of this world: and this thing is alſo thus witneſſed by <hi>Nicander;</hi>

               <hi>Pliny</hi> agreeth with the reſidue for the death of the Male in carnall copulation, but hee differeth in this, about the Female, affirming that when the young Vipers grow ripe and perfect in their Mothers belly, ſhe caſteth foorth euery day one for three dayes together, (for her number is ſometimes twenty) at laſt the other, impatient of delay, gnaw out her guts and belly, and ſo come foorth, deſtroying their Mother: And here is no great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, for in the ſumme and deſtruction of Father and Mother, they all agree, and Saint <hi>Ierom,</hi> Saint <hi>Baſill,</hi> and <hi>Horus</hi> doe agree and ſubſcribe to the truth of theſe opinions. Thus we haue ſhewed the opinions of the Ancient and firſt Writers: now it followeth that we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> ſhould likewiſe ſhew the opinions of the later Writers, which I will performe with as great breuity and perſpicuity as I can. <hi>Pierius</hi> therefore writeth, that in his time there were learned men deſirous to know the truth, who got Vipers, and kept them aliue, both Males and Females, by ſhutting them vp ſafe where they could neither eſcape out, nor doe harme, and they found that they engendred, brought forth, and conceiued like other Creatures, without death or ruine of Male and Female.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Amatus Luſitanus</hi> alſo writeth thus. The Male and Female Viper engender by wrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing their tayles together, euen to the one halfe of their body, and the other halfe ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vpright, mutually kiſſing one another. In the Male there is a genitall member in that part beneath the Nauell, where they embrace, which is very ſecret and hidden, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> the ſame is the Females place of conception, as may appear manifeſtly to him that will looke after the ſame; and therefore all the Philoſophers and Phyſitians haue bin de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, that haue wrote they haue conceiued at theyr mouth, or that the Male periſhed at the time of engendering, or the Female at the time of her deliuery. Thus ſaith <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> he likewiſe writeth in this manner. The young Vipers doe not eate out their way, or open with their teeth theyr Mothers belly, nor (if I may ſpeake merrily) make open their owne paſſage by breaking vp of the doores of their Mothers womb, but the wombe being narrow, cannot containe them; and therefore breaketh of it owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord: and this I haue prooued by experience, euen as the ſame falleth out with the Fiſh <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> called <hi>Acus:</hi> and therefore I muſt craue pardon of <hi>Herodotus,</hi> if I affirme his relation of the generation of Vipers to be meerely fabulous. Thus farre <hi>Theophraſtus. Apollonius</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo writeth, that many haue ſeene the olde Vipers lycking theyr young ones like other Serpents.</p>
            <p>Thus haue I expreſſed the different iudgements of ſundry Authors both new &amp; olde <note place="margin">Caelius</note>
               <pb n="295" facs="tcp:22894:154"/>
touching the generation of Vipers, out of which can be collected nothing but euident co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions, and vnreconcileable iudgements, one mutually croſsing another. So as it is vnpoſſible that they ſhould be both true, and therefore it muſt be our labour to ſearch out the truth, both in their words, and in the conference of other Authors. Wherefore to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne, thus writeth <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi> The Viper amongſt other Serpents, almoſt alone bringeth forth a liuing creature, but firſt of all ſhe conceiueth a ſoft egge of one colour, aboue the egges lyeth the young ones folded vppe in a ſynnes skinne, and ſome-times it falleth out, that they gnaw in ſunder that thinne skinne, and ſo come out of their mothers belly all in one day, for ſhe bringeth forth more then twentie at a time.</p>
            <p>Out of theſe words of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> euilly vnderſtood by <hi>Pliny</hi> and other auncient Wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, came that errour of the young Vipers eating their way out of their mothers belly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> for in ſtead of the little thinne skinne which <hi>Aristotle</hi> ſaith they eate thorough, other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors haue turned it to the belly, which was cleane from <hi>Aristotles</hi> meaning. And ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther error like vnto this, is that wherein they affirme, that the Viper doth euery day bring forth one young one, ſo that if ſhee hath twentie young ones in her belly, then alſo ſhee muſt be twenty dayes in bringing of them forth.</p>
            <p>The words of <hi>Aristotle</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence this errour is gathered, are theſe, <hi>Tectei de en mia emera kathon, Tictei de pleio he ei koſni,</hi> which are thus tranſlated by <hi>Gaza, Parit enim ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulos diebus ſingulis, plures quam viginti numero:</hi> That is to ſay, ſhe bringeth forth euery day one, more then twentie in number. But this is an abſurd tranſlation, and agreeth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the words of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> nor yet with his mind, for his words are theſe: <hi>Parit au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> 
               <hi>vna die ſingulos, parit autem plus quam viginti numero.</hi> That is to ſay in Engliſh, ſhee bringeth forth euery one in one day, and ſhee bringeth foorth more then twentie: ſo that the ſence of theſe words ſhall be, that the Viper bringeth forth her young ones ſeuerallie, one at a time, but yet all in a day.</p>
            <p>But concerning her number, neither the Phyloſopher, nor yet any man liuing, is able to define and ſet it downe certaine, for they varry, being ſometimes more, and ſometimes fewer, according to the nature of other liuing creatures. And although the Viper do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue eggos within her, yet doth ſhee lay them after the manner of other Serpents, but in her body they are turned into liuing Vipers, and ſo the egges neuer ſee the ſunne, neither doth any mortall eye behold them, except by accident in the diſſection of a female Viper <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> when ſhe is with young. I cannot alſo approue them that doe write, that one, namelie the Viper, among all Serpents, bringeth forth her young ones aliue, and perfect into the world, for <hi>Nicander</hi> and <hi>Greuinus,</hi> doe truly affirme, with the conſtant conſent of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Authors, that the horned Serpent called <hi>Ceraſtes,</hi> of which we haue ſpoken alreadie, doth likewiſe bring forth her young ones aliue. And beſides, <hi>Herodotus</hi> writeth of certaine winged-Serpents in Arabia, which doe bring foorth young ones as well as Vipers, and therefore it muſt not be concluded with apparant falſehood, that onely the Viper bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth her young ones perfect into the world.</p>
            <p>The like fable vnto this, is that generall conceit of the copulation together, betwixt the Viper and the Lamprey; for it is reported that when the Lamprey burneth in luſt for co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> ſhe forſaketh the waters, and commeth to the Land, ſeeking out the lodging of the male Viper, and ſo ioyneth herſelfe vnto him for copulation. He againe on the other ſide, is ſo tickled with deſire hereof, that forſaking his owne dwelling and his owne kind, doth likewiſe betake himſelfe vnto the waters and Riuers ſides, where in an amorous ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, hee hyſſeth for the Lamprey, like as when a young man goeth to meete and call his Loue; ſo that theſe two creatures, liuing in contrary elements, the earth and the water, yet meete together for the fulfilling of their luſts in one bed of fornication. Vppon which Saint <hi>Baſill</hi> writeth in this manner: <hi>Vipera infestiſsimum animal eorurquae Serpunt cum mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rena congreditur. &amp;c.</hi> That is to ſay, the Viper a moſt pernitious enemy to all liuing cree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> things, yet admitteth copulation with the Lamprey, for he forſaketh the Land, and goeth to the water-ſide, and there with his hyſsing voyce, giueth notice to the other of his preſence, which ſhe hearing, inſtantly forſaketh the deepe waters, and comming to the Land, ſuffereth herſelfe to be embraced by that venomous beaſt. Alſo <hi>Nicander</hi> wryteth thus thereof in his verſes.</p>

            </lg>
            <p>But this opinion is vaine and fantaſticall, as <hi>Pliny</hi> and diuers others haue very learned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> prooued, for the Lamprey cannot liue on the Land, nor the viper in wet places, beſides the waters: and therfore, beſides the impoſsibility in nature, it is not reaſonable that theſe will hazard their owne liues, by forſaking their owne elements for the ſatisfaction of their luſts, there beeing plenty of eyther kindes to worke vppon, that is to ſay, both of female Vipers in the Land, to couple with the male, and male Lampreys in the water, to couple with the female.</p>
            <p>Although I haue elſe-where confuted this errour, yet I muſt heere againe remember that which is ſaid already. The occaſion of this fable is this; the male Lamprey is excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding like a Viper, for they want feete, and haue long bodies, which ſome one by chaunce <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> ſeeing in copulation with his female, did raſhly iudge it to be a Serpent becauſe of his like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as afore-ſaid; and therefore they deuiſed a name for it, calling it <hi>Myrus,</hi> which ſome haue made a kind of Viper, and others a Snake: but <hi>Andreas</hi> hath notably proued againſt <hi>Archelaus,</hi> that this <hi>Myrus</hi> neither is nor can be any other then the male Lamprey: and ſo I will conclude, that neither Vipers ingender with Lampreys, nor yet the femall Vipers kill the male in copulation, or that the young ones come into the world by the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their dammes.</p>
            <p>In the next place wee are to conſider, the antipathy and contrarietie that it obſerueth with other creatures, and the amitie alſo betwixt it and others. Firſt of all therefore it is certaine and well knowne, what great enmity is betwixt man-kind &amp; Vipers, for the one <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> 
               <note place="margin">Elianus</note> alwayes hateth and feareth the other: wherefore, if a man take a Viper by the necke, and ſpet in his mouth, if the ſpettle ſlide downe into his belly, it dyeth thereof, and rotteth as it were in a conſumption. Vipers alſo are enemies to Oxen, as <hi>Virgill</hi> writeth, <hi>Pestis acer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba boum peccorique aſpergere vinus:</hi> that is, a ſharpe plague of Oxen, caſting his poyſon vppon all other Cattell. They are alſo enemies to Hennes and Geeſe, as <hi>Columella</hi> vvri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, wherefore in auncient time they were wont to make ſure walls for the cuſtody of theyr pullen'againſt Vipers. They are likewiſe enemies to the Dormouſe, and they hunt very greedily after their young ones, whereof <hi>Epiphanius</hi> in a diſcourſe againſt <hi>Origen</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth thus; When the Viper commeth to the neſt of a Dormouſe, and findeth there her young ones, ſhee putteth out all theyr eyes, and afterwards feedeth them very fat, yet kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> euery day one, as occaſion of hunger ſerueth; but if in the meane time a man, or any other creature doe chaunce to eate of thoſe Dormiſe, whoſe eyes are ſo put out by the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, they are poyſoned thereby. And this is a wonderfull worke in nature, that neither <note place="margin">Strabo.</note> the little Dormiſe receiue harme by the poyſon, but grow fat thereby, nor yet the Viper be poyſoned herſelfe while ſhe eateth them, and yet a man or beaſt which is a ſtranger vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, dyeth thereof.</p>
            <p>All kind of Mice are as much afraid of Vipers, as they be of Cats, and therefore when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer they heare the hyſſing of a Viger, inſtantly they looke to themſelues and theyr young ones. There is a kind of harmeleſſe Serpent called <hi>Parea,</hi> whereof I haue ſpoken before in his proper place, which is an enemy vnto Vipers, and that ſame which is harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> vnto men, killeth them. <hi>Albertus</hi> alſo telleth a ſtory of a Viper that climbed vp into a tree, to the neſt of a Megpye, where-vppon the old one was ſitting, this poore Pye did fight with the Viper, vntill the Viper tooke her faſt by the thigh, ſo as ſhee could fight no more, yet ſhe ceaſed not to chatter and cry out to her fellowes to come and helpe her, wherevpon the male Pye came, and ſeeing his female ſo gryped by the Viper, hee ceaſed
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:22894:155"/>
not to pecke vpon his head vntill the braines came out, and ſo the Viper fell downe dead. This ſtory is alſo alledged by <hi>Cardan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Scorpions and the Vipers are enemies one to another, for at Padua a Viper and a Scorpion (for the tryall of this matter) were both included in a viall, where they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued fighting a little while, but at laſt they both dyed by one anothers poyſon. The Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyſe of the earth is alſo an enemy to the Viper, and the Viper to it, wherefore if it can get Origan, or wild-Sauorie, or Rue, it eateth thereof, &amp; then is nothing afraid to fight with <note place="margin">Elianus</note> the Viper, but if the Torteyſe can find none of theſe, then they die incontinentlie by the poyſon of the Viper, and of this there hath beene tryall, as both <hi>Aristotle</hi> and other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours affirme. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/>
            </p>
            <p>And as there is this contrarietie betwixt Vipers and other liuing creatures, ſo there is betwixt them and Plants of the earth, and this bleſſing God in nature hath beſtowed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon many beaſts, that when they feele themſelues to be hurt by one herbe, they know an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other to cure them; as for example, Garlicke is poyſon to the Viper, and therefore hauing taſted thereof ſhe dieth, except ſhe eate ſome Rue. A Viper beeing ſtrooke with a Reede once, it amazeth her, and maketh her ſenceleſſe, but beeing ſtrooke the ſecond time, ſhe recouereth and runneth away: and the like is reported of the Beech-tree, ſauing that it ſtayeth the viper, and ſhe is not able to goe from it. But moſt maruailous is the antipathy betwixt the viper and the Yew-tree, for it is reported by <hi>Mercuriall,</hi> that if you lay fire on the one ſide, and a peece of Yew on the other ſide, and then place a viper in the middle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> them both, ſhe will rather chuſe to runne thorow the fire, then to goe ouer the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Yew.</p>
            <p>The Viper is alſo afraid of Muſtard-ſeede, for it beeing layd in her path, ſhe flieth from it, and if ſhe taſte of it, ſhe dyeth. There is an herbe called <hi>Arum,</hi> if the hands or body of <note place="margin">Gallen.</note> a man be annoynted with the iuyce of the roote therof, the viper will neuer byte him; the like is reported of the iuyce of Dragons, expreſſed out of the leaues, fruite or roote. It is alſo ſaid, that if a viper do behold a good Smaradge, her eyes will melt and fall out of her head. But aboue all other plants in the world, the Viper is moſt delighted with Vetches, <note place="margin">Dioſcorid. Raſis.</note> and the Sauyne tree, for in Italy (as <hi>Cardan</hi> writeth) there was once ſeene a great number of Vipers about a Sauyne-Tree, and many of them did climbe vp and downe vppon that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> Tree.</p>
            <p>There is no loue betweene this Serpent and other creatures, ſaue onely to his ovvne kind, and therefore there are two things memorable in the nature of this ſauage Serpent, the one is the loue of the male to the female, &amp; the other of the female to her young ones. It is reported by Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> and Saint <hi>Baſill,</hi> that when the male miſſeth the female, he ſeeketh her out very diligently, and with a pleaſing and flattering noyſe, calleth for her, and when he perceiueth ſhe approcheth, he caſteth vp all his venome, as it were in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence of matrymoniall dignitie. The female on the other ſide, maketh much of her young ones, licking and adorning their skinnes, fighting for them vnto death, both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt men and beaſts. For this occaſion and ſome medicinall vſes, the Arabians coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> Vipers holy Serpents, for by reaſon (as we haue ſaid already) that the vipers do haunt the Baulſom-trees, whereof there be plentie in that country, they hold them for holy kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of that precious fruite; wherefore they neuer kill them, but at the time of yeere when the Baulſome is ripe, they come vnto the trees bearing in their hands two woodden rules, which they ſmyte one againſt another, by the noyſe whereof the vipers are terrified and driuen away, and ſo the Trees are freed for the Inhabitants to take the fruite thereof at their pleaſure.</p>
            <p>Now foraſmuch as we read that <hi>Porus</hi> King of India ſent many great Vipers for a gyft vnto <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> it is profitable to expreſſe the meanes whereby Vipers are ſafely taken, without dooing any harme. Wherefore <hi>Aristotle</hi> writeth, that they are very much deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> of Wine, and for that cauſe the Country-people ſet little veſſels of vvine in the hed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and haunts of Vipers, where-vnto the vipers comming, eaſily drinke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues tame, and ſo the Hunters come and kill them, or elſe ſo take them, as they are without danger of harme. <hi>Pliny</hi> reporteth, that in auncient time, the <hi>Marſians</hi> in Lybia did hunt vipers, and neuer receiued harme of them, for by a ſecrete &amp; innate vertue, all vipers &amp; ſerpents
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:22894:156"/>
are afraid of their bodies, as we haue already ſhewed in other places. Yet <hi>Gallen</hi> in his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to <hi>Piſo,</hi> writeth that the <hi>Marſians</hi> in his time had no ſuch vertue in them, as hee had often tryed, ſaue onely that they vſed a deceit or ſlight to beguile the people, which vvas in this manner following.</p>
            <p>Long after the vſuall time of hunting Vipers, they vſe to goe abroade to take them, when there is no courage nor ſcant any venome left in them, for the Vipers are then eaſily taken if they can be found: and them ſo taken, they accuſtome to their owne bodies, by giuing them ſuch meates as doth euacuate all their poyſon, or at the leaſt-wiſe doth ſo ſtop vp their teeth, as it maketh the harme very ſmall; and ſo the ſimple people beeing igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of this fraude, and ſeeing them apparantly carrying vipers about them, did ignorant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> attribute a vertue to their natures, which in truth did not belong vnto them. In like manner there were (as hath already in another place beene ſaid) certaine Iuglers in Italy, which did boaſt themſelues to be of the linage of Saint <hi>Paule,</hi> who did ſo deceitfully car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie themſelues, that in the preſence and ſight of many people, they ſuffered Vipers to bite them without any manner of harme.</p>
            <p>Others againe when they had taken a Viper, did drowne her head in mans ſpettle, by vertue whereof the viper beganne to grow tame and meeke. Beſides this, they made a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine oyntment which they ſet foorth to ſale, affirming it to haue a vertue againſt the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Vipers, and all other Serpents, which oyntment was made in this manner. Out of the oyle of the ſeede of Wild-radiſh, of the rootes of Dragons, the iuyce of Daffadill, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> the braine of a Hare, leaues of Sage, ſprigges of Bay, and a few ſuch other things, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they deceiued the people, and got much money: and therefore to conclude, I cannot find any more excellent way for the taking and deſtroying of vipers, then that which is already expreſſed in the generall diſcourſe of Serpents.</p>
            <p>Wee doe reade that in Egypt they eate Vipers &amp; diuers other Serpents, with no more difficultie then they would doe Eeles, ſo doe many people both in the Eaſterne and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterne parts of the New-found-Lands. And the very ſelfe-ſame thing is reported of the Inhabitants of the Mountaine <hi>Athos,</hi> the which meate they prepare and dreſſe on this manner. Firſt they cut off their heads and alſo their tayles, then they bowell them and ſalt them, after which they ſeeth them or bake them, as a man would ſeeth or bake Eecles, but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> ſome-times they hang them vppe and dry them, and then when they take them downe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, they eate them with Oyle, Salt, Annyſeedes, Leckes and vvater, with ſome ſuch other obſeruations. Whoſe dyet of eating vipers I doe much pittie, if the want of other foode conſtraine them there-vnto; but if it ariſe from the inſatiable and greedy intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rancie of their owne appetites, I iudge them eager of dainties, which aduenture for it at ſuch a market of poyſon.</p>
            <p>Now it followeth that wee proceede to the handling of that part of the Vipers ſtorie, which concerneth the venome or poyſon that is in it, which muſt beginne at the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of themperament of this Serpent. It is ſome queſtion among the learned, vvhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a viper be hot or cold; and for aunſwere heereof it is ſaid, that it is of cold conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> becauſe it lyeth hid, and almoſt dead in the Winter-time, wherein a man may carry them in his hands without all hurt or danger: &amp; vnto this opinion for this ſelfe ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, agreeth <hi>Gallen. Mercuriall</hi> maketh a treble diuerſitie of conſtitution among Serpents, whereof the firſt ſort are thoſe which with their wound doe infuſe a mortall poyſon that killeth inſtantly, and without delay: a ſecond ſort are thoſe that kill, but more leyſurelie, without any ſuch ſpeede: and the third are thoſe whoſe poiſon is more ſlow in operation then is the ſecond, among which he aſsigneth the Viper. But although by this ſlownes of operation hee would inforce the coldnes of the poyſon, yet it is alwaies to be conſidered, that the difference of vipers, and of their venome, ariſeth from the place and Region in which they are bredde, and alſo from the time of the yeere wherein they byte &amp; wound, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> ſo that except they fortune to hurt any one during the time of the Caniculer dayes, (in which ſeaſon their poyſon is hoteſt, and themſelues moſt full of ſpyrit,) the ſame it but weake, and full of deadnes. And againe it is to be conſidered, whether the viper harme in her moode and furie, for anger doth thruſt it foorth more fully, and cauſeth the ſame to worke more deadly.</p>
            <p>

Likewiſe the Region wherein they liue, begetteth a more liuely working ſpirit in the Serpent, and therefore before all other, the Vipers of Numidia are preferred, becauſe of the heate of that Country. Alſo their meate cauſeth in them a difference of poyſon, for thoſe that liue in the woods and eate Toades, are not ſo vigorous or venomous, but thoſe that liue in the mountaines, and eate the rootes of certaine herbes, are more poyſonfull and deadly. And therefore <hi>Cardan</hi> relateth a ſtory, which he ſaith was told him by a <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necian,</hi> that a Mountaine-Viper chaſed a man ſo hardly, that he was forced to take a tree, vnto the which when the Viper was come, and could not climbe vppe to vtter her malice vppon the man, ſhe emptied the ſame vppon the Tree, and by and by after, the man in the tree dyed, by the ſauour and ſecret operation of the ſame. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/>

            <p>But of the Arabian Vipers which haunt the Baulſom-trees, I haue read, that if at any time they byte, they onely make a wound like the pricks of yron, voyde of poyſon, becauſe <note place="margin">Pauſanius</note> while they ſucke in the iuyce of that tree, the acerbitie and ſtrength of the venom is aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. About the Mountaine <hi>Helycon</hi> in Greece, the poyſon alſo of Vipers is infirme and not ſtrong, ſo that the cure thereof is alſo ready and eaſie. But yet for the nature of Vipers poyſon, I can ſay no more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Wolphius</hi> hath ſaid, that it is of it ſelfe and in it ſelfe conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, hot: and his reaſon is, becauſe hee ſaw a combat in a glaſſe betwixt a Viper and a Scorpion, and they both periſhed one by the others poyſon. Now he ſaith that it is gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the Scorpion to be of a cold nature, and his poyſon to be cold; therfore by reaſon of the antipathy whereby one dyed by the malice of another, it muſt needes follovv that the Viper is hot, and her poyſon likewiſe of the ſame nature. For a Serpent of a cold nature, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> killeth not another of the ſame nature, nor a hot Serpent, one of his owne kind, but rather it falleth out cleane contrarie, that the hot kill thoſe that are colde, and the cold Serpents the hoter.</p>
            <p>All the Vipers that liue neere the vvaters, are of more mild and meeke poyſon then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. If there be any ſuch, but I rather beleeue there be none, but that the ſame Authour which wrote of the vipers of the water, did intend Serpents of the water. But concerning the poyſon of vipers, there is nothing reported more ſtrange then that of <hi>Vincentius Bellu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acenſis,</hi> who writeth, that if a man chaunce to tread vpon the reynes of a Viper vnawares, <note place="margin">Pliny Nicander.</note> it paineth him more then any venome, for it ſpreadeth it ſelfe ouer all the body incurably. Alſo it is written, that if a woman with childe chaunce to paſſe ouer a viper, it cauſeth her <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> to ſuffer abortment; and the Muſhroms or Toade-ſtooles which grow neere the dennes and lodgings of vipers, are alſo found to be venomous.</p>
            <p>The Scythians alſo do draw an incurable and vnreſiſtable poyſon out of vipers, where-withall they annoynt the ſharpe ends of their darts and arrowes when they goe to vvarre, to the end that if it chaunce to light vppon their aduerſary, hee may neuer any more doe them harme. They make this poyſon in this manner. They obſerued the lyttering pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and time of the vipers, and then with ſtrength and Art, did take the old &amp; young ones together, which they preſently killed, and afterward ſuffered them to lye and rot, or ſoake in ſome moyſt thing for a ſeaſon: then they tooke them and put them into an earthen pot filled with the blood of ſome one man; this potte of mans blood and vipers they ſtopped <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> very cloſe, ſo as nothing might iſſue out at the mouth, and then buried or couered it all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer in a dunghill, where it rotted and conſumed a few dayes, after which they vncouered it againe, and opening it, found at the toppe a kind of watery ſubſtance ſwymming, that they take off, and mixe it with the rotten matter of the Viper, &amp; heereof make this dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poyſon.</p>
            <p>Wee haue ſhewed already, that there is outwardly a difference betwixt the byting wound of the Male and the Female viper, for after the male hath bitten, there appeareth but two holes, but after the female hath bytten, there appeareth foure; and this is alſo a great deale more deadly then is the byting of the male, according to the verſes of <hi>Nican<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> where he ſaith; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/>

            <p>But <hi>Auicen</hi> is directly contrary to this opinion, and ſaith, that as the bytings of male-Dragons <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> are more exitiall and harmefull then are the females, ſo is it betwixt the byting of the male and female Viper. This contrarietie is thus reconciled by <hi>Mercuriall,</hi> namely, that it is true, that the wounds which the female maketh by her byting, beeing well conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, is more deadly then the wounds which the male giueth: yet for the proportion of the poyſon which the male venteth into the wound he maketh, it is more deadly then is the females; ſo that with reſpect of quantitie, they both ſay true which affirme eyther the one or the other. But which ſoeuer is the greateſt, it skilleth not much, for both are dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough, as may appeare by the common ſymptomes and ſignes which follow, and alſo death. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Matthiolus</hi> reporteth a hiſtory of a Country-man, who as hee was mowing of graſſe, chaunced to cut a Viper cleane aſunder about the middle, or ſome-what neerer the head, which beeing done, hee ſtoode ſtill, and looked vppon the dying diſſeuered parts a little while, at laſt, eyther preſuming that it had no power left to hurt, or thinking it was dead, he tooke that part in his hand where-vpon the head was: the angry viper feeling his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries warme hand, turned the head about, and bitte his finger with all the rage, force, and venome that it had left, ſo that the blood iſſued out. The man thus bitten for his bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, did haſtily caſt it away, &amp; began to ſucke the wound, putting his hand to his mouth, which when he had done but a little while, he ſuddenly fell downe dead.</p>
            <p>The like ſtory vnto this, is related by <hi>Amatus Luſitanas</hi> of another, which more bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> then wiſely, did aduenture to take a liue viper into his hand vppon a wager of money, but as the other, ſo this payd for his raſhnes, for the angry Viper did byte him as did the former, and hee ſucked his wound as did the Country-man, and in like maner fell downe dead.</p>
            <p>By both which examples, wee may well ſee the danger of the Vipers poyſon, ſo that if once it come into the ſtomacke, and touch the open paſſage where the vitall parts goe in and out, it neuer ſtayeth long but death followeth. Wherefore <hi>Aetius</hi> ſaith well, that ſometimes it killeth within the ſpace of ſeauen houres, and ſometimes againe within the ſpace of three dayes, and that reſpite of time ſeemeth to be the longeſt, if remedie be not had with more effectuall ſpeede. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/>
            </p>
            <p>The ſignes or effects of the Vipers byting, are briefely theſe, firſt there iſſueth foorth a rotten matter, ſome-times bloody, and ſome-times like liquid or molten fatneſſe, ſome-times againe with no colour at all, but all the fleſh about the ſore ſwelleth, ſometimes ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a redde, and ſome-time a pale hiew or colour vppon it, iſſuing alſo foorth a corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted mattery matter. Alſo it cauſeth diuers little blyſters to ariſe vppon the fleſh, as though the body were all ſcorched ouer with fire, and ſpeedily after this, followeth putrefaction and death.</p>
            <p>The paine that commeth by this Serpents wounding, is ſo vniuerſall, that all the body ſeemeth to be ſet on fire, many pittifull noyſes are forced out of the parties throat by ſence of that paine, turning and crackling of the necke, alſo twinckling and wrying of the eyes, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> wih darkneſſe and heauineſſe of the head, imbecility of the loynes, ſome-times thirſting intollerably, crying out vpon his dry throate, and againe ſome-times freezing at the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers ends, at leaſt ſo as hee feeleth ſuch a payne. Moreouer, the body ſweating a ſweat more cold then ſnow it ſelfe, and many times vomiting forth the bilious tumours of his owne belly. But the colour going and comming is often changed, now like pale lead, then
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:22894:157"/>
like blacke, and anon as greene as the ruſt of braſſe, the gumbes flow with blood, and the Liuer it ſelfe falleth to be inflamed, ſleepineſſe and trembling poſſeſſeth the body and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall parts, and difficultie of making vrine, with Feauers, neezing, and ſhortneſſe of breath.</p>
            <p>Theſe are related by <hi>Aetius, Aegineta, Greuinus</hi> and others, which worke not alwaies in euery body generallie, but ſome in one, and ſome in another, as the humours and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament of nature doth leade, and guide their operation. But I maruaile from whence <hi>Plato</hi> in his <hi>Sympoſium</hi> had that opinion, that a man bytten and poyſoned by a Viper, will tell it to none, but onely to thoſe that haue formerly taſted of that miſery: for although a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other effects of this poyſon, it is ſaid that madnes, or a diſtracted mind alſo follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> yet I think in nature there can be no reaſon giuen of <hi>Platoes</hi> opinion, except he meane that the patient will neuer manifeſt his griefe at all. And this how-ſoeuer alſo, is confuted by this one ſtory of <hi>Greuinus.</hi> There was (as he writeth) a certaine Apothecarie vvhich did keepe Vipers, and it happened one day as hee was medling about them, that one of them caught him by his finger, and did byte him a little, ſo as the prints of his teeth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared as the poynts of needles. The Apothecary onely looked on it, and beeing buſied, either forgot, or (as hee ſaid afterward) felt no paine for an howres ſpace: but after the howre, firſt his finger ſmarted and began to burne, and afterward his arme and vvhole body fell to be ſuddenly diſtempered there-with, ſo as neceſſity conſtrayning him, and opportunitie offering it ſelfe, he ſent for a Phiſitian at hand, and by his good aduiſe, (tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> Gods mercy) was recouered, but with great difficultie; for he ſuffered many of the former paſſions and ſymptomes before he was cured.</p>
            <p>Therefore by this ſtory, eyther <hi>Plato</hi> was in a wrong opinion, or elſe <hi>Greuinus</hi> telleth a fable, which I cannot graunt, becauſe he wrote of his owne experience, knowne then to many in the world, who would quicklie haue contradicted it: or elſe if he had conſented to the opinion of <hi>Plato,</hi> no doubt but in the relation of that matter, he would haue expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed alſo that circumſtance.</p>
            <p>Thus then we haue, as briefely and plainly as we can, deliuered the paines &amp; torments which are cauſed by the poyſon of Vipers; now therefore it followeth, that we alſo briefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declare the vertue of ſuch Medicines, as we find to be applyed by diligent and carefull <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> obſeruations of many learned Phiſitians, againſt the venom of Vipers. Firſt of all they write, that the generall rule muſt be obſerued in the curing of the poyſon of Vipers, which is already declared againſt other Serpents: namely, that the force of theyr poyſon be kept from ſpreading, and that may be done eyther by the preſent extraction of the poyſon, or elſe by bynding the wounded member hard, or elſe by cutting it off, if it be in finger, hand or foote.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Galen</hi> reporteth, that when he was in Alexandria, there came to the Citty a Country-man which had his finger bytten by a Viper, but before he came, hee had bound his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger cloſe to the palme of his hand, and then hee ſhewed the ſame to a Phiſitian, who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly cut off his finger, and ſo he was cured. And beſides, he telleth of another coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-man, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> who reaping of Corne, by chaunce with his ſickle did hurt a Viper, who retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and did raze all his finger with her poyſonfull teeth. The man preſently conceiuing his owne pertill, cut off his owne finger with the ſame ſickle, before the poyſon was ſpred too farre, and ſo was cured without any other Medicine.</p>
            <p>Sometime it hapneth that the byte is in ſuch a part that it cannot be cutte off, and then they apply a Henne cut inſunder aliue, &amp; layd to as hot as can be, alſo one muſt firſt waſh and annoynt his mouth with oyle, and ſo ſucke out the poyſon. Likewiſe the place muſt be ſcarified, and the partie fedde and dieted with old Butter, and bathed in milke or Sea-water, and be kept waking, and made to walke vp and downe.</p>
            <p>It were too long, &amp; alſo needleſſe, to expreſſe all the medicines which by naturall means <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> are prepared againſt the poyſon of Vipers, whereof ſeeing no reaſonable man will expect that at my hands, I will onely touch two or three cures by way of hiſtory, and for others, refer my Reader to Phiſitians, or to the Latine diſcourſe of <hi>Caronus.</hi> In <hi>Norcheria,</hi> the <note place="margin">In Uipera.</note> country of that great and famous <hi>Gentilis</hi> who tranſlated <hi>Auiten,</hi> there is a fountaine, into which if any man be put that is ſtung or bytten by a Serpent, hee is thereof immediatly
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:22894:158"/>
cured; which <hi>Amatus Luſitanus</hi> approoueth to be very naturall, becauſe the continuall cold water killeth the hot poyſon. The ſame Authour writeth, that when a little maid of the age of thirteene yeeres, was bytten in the heele by a Viper, the legge beeing firſt of all bound at the knee very hard, then becauſe the maid fell deſtract, firſt he cauſed a Surgeon to make two or three deeper holes then the Viper had made, that ſo the poyſon might be the more eaſily extracted, then he ſcarified the place, and drawed it with cupping-glaſſes, whereby was exhauſted all the blacke blood, and then alſo the whole legge ouer, was ſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, and blood drawne out of it, as long as it would run of it owne accord. Then was a plaiſter made of Garlicke, and the ſharpeſt Onyons roſted, which being mixed with Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acle, was layde to the bytten place. Alſo the maide dranke three dayes of Triacle in wine, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> and foure houres after a little broth made with Garlicke.</p>
            <p>The ſecond day after the abatement of the paine, he gaue her the iuyce of Yew-leaues faſting, which he commendeth as the moſt notable Antidote in this kind, and ſo made a ſecond plaiſter, which lay on three dayes more, and in the meane time ſhe dranke faſting euery day that iuyce of Yew-leaues, whereby her trembling and diſtracted eſtate was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated, but from the wounded place ſtill flowed matter, and it looked blacke. Then the foure next dayes, the ſaid matter was drawne out by a linnen cloth, wherein was Goates<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dunge, powder of Lawrell, and <hi>Euphorbium</hi> in Wine, all mixed together, and afterward he made this oyntment, which did perfectly cure her, <hi>Rec:</hi> of long <hi>Ariſtolochij</hi> two oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, of Briony and Daffadill one ounce, of Galbanum and Myrrhe, of each one ounce, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> with a conuenient quantitie of oyle of Bayes and Waxe.

            <p>A certaine man infected with the diſeaſe which men call <hi>Elephas,</hi> that is, Leproſie, for a time conuerſed ſtill with his companions, till by his company &amp; conuerſation, ſome of <note place="margin">Gallen.</note> them were infected with the contagion of the diſeaſe, and hee now became lothſome to ſmell, and filthy to ſight. Building therefore a cottage for him neere the Village, on the top of a banke, hard by a fountaine, there they place this man, and daily bring to him ſo <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> much meate as was ſufficient to ſuſtaine life. But at the riſing of the Dog-ſtarre, when by good hap, Reapers, reaped not farre from that place, very fragrant wine was brought for them in an earthen veſſell: he that brought it, ſet it downe neere the Reapers, and depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; but when the time was come that they ſhould drinke it, a young man taking vp the veſſell, that according to their maner hauing filled a boule, hee might mingle the Wine with a competent meaſure of water, hee poured the Wine into the boule, and together with the Wine fell out a dead Viper.</p>
            <p>Wherefore the Reapers amazed thereat, and fearing leaſt if they dranke it, they ſhould receiue ſome harme thereby, choſe rather indeed to quench their thirſt by drinking vva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: but when they departed thence, of humanitie &amp; in pietie, gaue the wine to this Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> ſuppoſing it to be better for him to die, then to liue in that miſery.

            <p>Another example by a chaunce not much vnlike, hapned in <hi>Myſia,</hi> a Country of Aſia, not farre from our Cittie.

            <p>Theſe are two examples of experiment by caſuall occaſion. Moreouer, I will adde al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a third, which proceeded from our imitation. When one was ſicke of this diſeaſe, in mind more then the common ſort philoſophicall, and deſpiſing death, tooke it exceeding grieuouſly, and ſaid it were better once to ſuffer death, then to liue ſo miſerable a life: and drinking wine ſo mingled with poyſon, he became a Leper; and afterward wee cured his Leproſie by our accuſtomed medicines. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/>

            <p>Triacle is very auncient, and hath alwaies very carefully and not without ambition, beene refined by the Phiſitians, till <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dromochus Nero</hi> his Phiſitian, added the fleſh of Vipers, as the full accompliſhment of this drugge.

Vipers are thought to haue leſſe poyſon in them then other Serpents.</p>
            <p>Vipers for Triacle muſt not be taken at any time, but chiefely in the beginning of the Spring, when hauing left their dennes they come forth into the ſunne-ſhine, and as yet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> haue not poyſon much offenſiue.</p>

They are halfe a foot long at leaſt, and being ſtretched out in length they are found to be a foote long, they are of a whitiſh colour, and ſometimes though ſeldome, of a bloudy hue: and for the moſt part they are all adorned with a chaine about their neckes, or rather they ſeeme to weare a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine collor, wherein there is a little bloud contained, and they lacke eyes and eye-ſight as all ſorts of Wormes doe.</p>

Thoſe little heapes which are caſt vp and lye ſhining and wrinkled before the mouth or edges of their holes, I take them to bee their miety excrements: for I could neuer as yet find other excrementitious ſubſtances droſſy matter, or other feculency, but onely bare earth in them, whoſe alimentary Iuyce and moyſture beeing cleane exhauſted, they caſt
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:22894:160"/>
out the remaynder, as an vnprofitable burthen, nothing fit for nouriſhment. At the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of their doores, which yet ſteadeth them to ſome commodious vſe, for ſtopping &amp; damming vp theyr holes that the raine cannot ſo eaſily ſoke in, they are by theſe meanes ſafely defended from many annoyances and daungers, that otherwiſe might light vppon them.</p>
            <p>Their delight is to couple together, eſpecially in a rainy night, cleauing together vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the Morning: and in the ſame they are not folded round about one another like vnto Serpents, but are ſtraightly cloſed together ſide-wiſe, and thus doe they remayne ſticking cloſe the one to the other. They ſend foorth a certaine froathy ſlyme or Ielly when that they ioyne together. They doe euer keepe the middle part of theyr body within the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> earth, I meane their hinder parts: yea, euen in their mutuall ioyning together; neither are they at any time ſo faſt glewed and cloſed, but with the leaſt ſtyrring and motion of the ground that can bee imagined, they are ſtraight-wayes ſeuered, with-drawing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſpeedily into their lurking holes. In Rainy weather they are whiter a great deale then at other times, vnleſſe it be when they couple together, for then they appeare very red. I my ſelfe about the middeſt of Aprill, did once open a thicke Female Worme, and within the fleſh I found a certain receptacle ringed round about, and filling vp the whole cauity of the body, hauing a thinne membrance or ceate encloſing it, and in this aforeſaid ſtirehouſe the earth which ſhe had ſed on, and wherewith ſhe was ſuſteyned, was held and contained. Her Egges were found to bee in a ſafe place aboue the receptacle, next to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> mouth, there were many of them on a heape together, being all of a whitiſh colour.</p>
            <p>The leſſer Earth-Wormes for perſpicuities ſake, we with <hi>Georgius Agricola</hi> will name <hi>Aſcarides:</hi> and theſe are often found in great numbers in Dung-hilles, Mixens, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der heapes of ſtones. Of this ſort ſome are redde, (which we Engliſhmen call <hi>Duggs)</hi> &amp; theſe be they that Anglers and Fiſhers do ſo much deſire, for Fiſhes will greedily deuour them, and for that end they with them do bayte their hookes.</p>
            <p>There be ſome others of theſe leſſer Earth-Wormes that are ſomewhat of a blew co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, otherſome againe are yellow onely about the tayle: whereuppon they haue purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the name of <hi>Yellow-tayles.</hi> Some againe are ringed about the Neckes, withall very fat. Some others there be that haue neyther chaynes nor rings, and theſe commonly be more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> lanke and ſlender of body then the former, and theſe I iudge to bee the Males. Theſe Wormes doe ſpecially breede in Autumne, or at the fall of the leafe, by reaſon then there is but little moyſture in the Earth, and this is <hi>Aristotles</hi> opinion. Both kindes doe liue long in the water, but yet at length for want of ſuſtenance there they dye.

            <p>The greater ſort of Earth-Wormes liue in the bowels of the Earth, and moſt of all in an open free ayre, and where there is ſome repaire and confluence of people. Euery mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning they with-draw themſelues into their ſecret holes &amp; corners within the ground, fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the entrance of them with their excrements they haue voyded foorth, in a fayre and Sunſhine weather: but in rainy weather they vſe to ſtop the mouthes of their holes with ſome ſtalke or leaues of herbs or trees, being drawne a little inwardly into the earth. They feede vpon the roots of thoſe Plantes which haue any ſweete iuyce or moyſture in them; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> and therefore one may many times find them amongeſt the roots of common Meddow-Graſſe: and they do liue for the moſt part by the fat moyſture of the earth, yet will they alſo greedily deuour crummes of white Bread vnleauened, as I haue often ſeene. In the Spring time, they firſt appeare to come foorth from the bowels of the earth, and all the Winter they lye hidde in the ground, but yet if it bee a very ſharpe and pintching colde Winter, and a dry Sommer follow, for lacke of moyſture they doe all-moſt all dye.</p>
            <p>Beſides, if you digge into the earth, or make a great motion, trampling, or hard trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vpon the ſame, pouring in any ſtrange liquor or moyſture into the ſame, wherewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all they are vnaquainted; as for example, the iuyce of Wall-nut-trees, the water where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Hemp, eyther ſeedes or leaues are ſoked, or bin layd to rottein common Lye, and the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> like, they will iſſue out of the earth ſpeedily, and by this meanes Fiſher-men and Anglers, do take them.</p>
            <p>In like manner, they cannot endure Salt, or aromaticall things, nor by their good wil come neere them, for but touching any of theſe they will draw themſelues on a heape, &amp; ſo dye. Wormes are found to bee very venomous in the Kingdome of <hi>Mogor,</hi> and the Inhabitants there doe ſtand in ſo great feare of them, that they bee deſtroyed and ſlaine by them when they trauell any iourney; and therefore there they vſe ordinarily to carry Beſomes with them to ſweepe the playne wayes for feare of further hurt. <hi>Georgius Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cola</hi> ſaith, that the little Wormes called <hi>Aſcarides,</hi> are not all of one colour: for ſome are white, ſome yellow (as I remembred a little before) and others againe are very blacke: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> and many of theſe in tilling the earth are caſt vppe by the plough, and many found in dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers places all on a heape together.

            <p>Some ſay, that thoſe wormes do moſt miſchiefe to corne-grounds, which in ſome places of Italy the people terme <hi>Zaccarolae,</hi> &amp; theſe are thick, almoſt a finger long, being natural-

            <p>Earth-Wormes doe mollifie, conglutinate, appeaſe paine, and by their terreſtriall, and withall wateriſh humidity they do contemper any affected part, orderly and meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably moderating any exceſſe whatſoeuer. The powder of Wormes is thus prepared. They vſe to take the greateſt Earth-Wormes that can bee found, and to wrappe them in Moſſe, ſuffering them there to remayne for a certaine time, thereby the better to purge and clenſe them from that clammy and filthy ſlimyneſſe, which outwardly cleaueth to their bodies. When all this is done, they preſſe hard the hinder part of their bodies neere to the taile, ſquiſing out thereby their excrements, that no impurity ſo neere as is poſſible <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> may be retayned in them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, they vſe to put them into a pot, or ſome fit veſſell with ſome white-wine, &amp; a little Salt, and ſtreyning them gently betweene the fingers, they firſt of all caſt away that Wine, and then doe they poure more wine to them, &amp; after the waſhing of the wormes, they muſt alſo take away ſome of the Wine, for it muſt not all be poured away (as ſome would haue it) and this muſt ſo often bee done and renewed vntill the Wine be paſſing cleare without any filth or droſſineſſe, for by this way their ſlymy ielly, and glutinous e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill quality is cleare loſt and ſpent.

Surely I ſhould not thinke that thoſe Fiſhers and Anglers to be very wiſe, who to take Wormes, vſe to poure <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> Lye or water into the earth wherein Hemp, Sothern-wood, Centery, Worme-wood, or veruen haue bin long ſoked, or any other ſtrange moyſture, cauſing them by this meane to iſſue forth out of the earth, for the Earth. Wormes by this kind of dealing being made more bitter, vnſauory, and vnpleaſant, no fiſhes will once touch or taſt them, but rather ſeeke to auoyde them. But contrary-wiſe, if they will let them lie a whole day in VVheat Meale, putting a little Hony to it, and then bayte their hookes with them, they will be ſo ſweete, pleaſant, and delectable, as that the vnwary Fiſh will ſooner bite at it, then at <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſia,</hi> the very meat of the Gods.</p>
            <p>Earth-Wormes doe alſo much good to men, ſeruing them to great vſe in that they do prognoſticate and fore-tell rainy weather by their ſodaine breaking or iſſuing forth of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> ground: and if none appeare aboue ground ouer-night, it is a great ſigne it will be calme and fayre weather the next day. The ancient people of the world haue euer obſerued this as a generall rule, that if Wormes pierce through the earth violently, &amp; in haſt by heaps, as if they had bored it thorow with ſome little Auger or Piercer, they tooke for it an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible token of Raine ſhortly after to fall. For the Earth being as it were embrued, diſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, made moyſt, and mooued with an imperceptible motion, partly by South-wind, &amp; partly alſo a vaporous ayre, it yeeldeth an eaſie paſſage for round VVormes to wind out of the inward places of the earth, to giue vnto them moyſt food, and to Miniſter ſtore of fat Iuyces, or fattiſh Ielly, wherewith they are altogether delighted.</p>
            <p>Some there be found, that will faſhion and frame Iron after ſuch a manner, as that they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> will bring it to the hardneſſe of any ſteele, after this order following. They take of Earth-VVormes two parts, of Raddiſh-roots one part, after they are bruized together, the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is put into a Limbecke to be diſtïlled, or elſe take of the diſtilled water of VVormes, l. iij. of the iuyce of Raddiſh, l. j. mixe them together, for Iron beeing often quenched in this water, will grow exceeding hard.</p>

            <p>It ſhall not be impertinent to our matter we handle, to adde a word or two concerning <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> thoſe wormes that are found and doe breede in the ſnow, which <hi>Theophanes</hi> in <hi>Strabo</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth <hi>Oripas:</hi> but becauſe it may ſeeme very ſtrange &amp; incredible, to think that any wormes breede and liue onely in the ſnow, you ſhall heare what the Auncients haue committed to writing, and eſpecially <hi>Strabo</hi> his opinion concerning this poynt. It is (ſaith hee) recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued amongſt the greater number of men, that in the ſnow there are certaine clots or hard lumpes that are very hollow, which waxing hard and thicke, doe containe the beſt vva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as it were in a certaine coate; and that in this caſe or purſe there doe breede vvormes. <hi>Theophanes</hi> calleth them <hi>Oripas,</hi> and <hi>Apollonides, Vermes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aristotle</hi> ſaith, that liuing creatures will breede alſo euen in thoſe things that are not ſubiect to putrefaction, as for example, in the fire and ſnow, which of all thinges in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> world, one would take neuer to be apt to putrefie, and yet in old ſnowe Wormes will be bred. Old ſnow that hath lyen long, will looke ſome-what dunne, or of a dulliſh white colour, and therefore the ſnow-wormes are of the ſame hiew, and likewiſe rough &amp; hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. But thoſe ſnow-wormes which are found to breed when the ayre is ſomwhat warme, are great, and white in colour, and all theſe ſnow-wormes will hardly ſtirre, or mooue from place to place. And <hi>Pliny</hi> is of the ſame iudgement, and the Authour of that booke <note place="margin">Lib: 11. cap: 35.</note> which is intituled <hi>De Plantis,</hi> falſely fathered vpon <hi>Aristotle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet ſome there be that denying all theſe authorities, and reiecting whatſoeuer can be obiected for confirmation thereof to the contrarie, doe ſtoutly maintaine by diuers rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that creatures can breede in the ſnow: becauſe that in ſnow there is no heate, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> where no quickning heate is, there can be no production of any liuing thing. Againe, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> writeth that nothing will come of Iſe, becauſe it is (as hee ſaith) moſt cold: and heere-vpon they inferre that in all reaſon, nothing likewiſe can take his beginning from ſnow; neither is it credible, that husbandmen would ſo often wiſh for ſnow in Winter to deſtroy and conſume wormes, and other little vermine, that els would prooue ſo hurtfull to their corne and other fruites of the earth. And if any wormes be found in the ſnow, it followeth not ſtraightwaies that therein they firſt receiue theyr beginning, but rather that they firſt come out of the earth, and are afterwards ſeene to be wrapped vp, and lye on heapes in the ſnow.</p>
            <p>But by their leaues theſe reaſons are very weake, and may readily be aunſwered thus, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> that whereas they maintaine that nothing can breede in the ſnow, becauſe it is voyd of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny heate at all, herein they build vpon a falſe ground. For if wee will adhibite credite to <hi>Auerrhoes,</hi> there is nothing compounded and made of the three Elements, that is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely without heate. And <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his fift booke <hi>De Generatione Animalium,</hi> telleth vs preciſely, that there is no moyſture without heate. His wordes are <hi>Ouden hugron aneu thermou.</hi> Now ſnow is a compact, and faſt congealed ſubſtance, and ſome-what moyſt, for although it proceedeth by congelation, which is nothing els but a kind of exſiccation, yet notwithſtanding, the matter whereof it firſt commeth is a vapour, whoſe nature is moyſt, and with little adoe may be turned into water.</p>
            <p>I muſt needes ſay that congelation is a kind of exſiccation, but yet not ſimply: for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiccation <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> is, when as humidity goeth away, it putteth forth any matter, but in ſnovv there is no humiditie that is drawne out, but it is rather wrapped in and encloſed more ſtrongly, and as it were, bounded round. Furthermore <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his firſt booke of his <hi>Meteors</hi> ſaith, that Snow is <hi>Nubes congelata,</hi> a clowde congelated or thickned together, and that in ſnow there is much heate. And in his fift booke <hi>De Generatione Animalium,</hi> he further
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:22894:164"/>
addeth, that the whitenes of the ſnow is cauſed by the ayre, that the ayre is hot and moiſt, and the ſnow is white; where-vpon we conclude, that ſnow is not ſo cold, as ſome would beare vs in hand. I well hold that nothing will take his originall from Iſe, inregard of his exceſſiue coldnes, but yet ſnow is nothing nie ſo cold as that. So then all the hinderance and let, is found to exceede of cold, which is nothing ſo effectuall or forceable as in Iſe, &amp; the cold beeing prooued to be farre leſſer, there can nothing be alleadged to the contrary, but that it may putrefie.</p>
            <p>Now in that ſnow is ſuch an enemie to wormes, and many other ſmall creatures, as that for the moſt part it deſtroyeth them, yet it followeth not, that the reaſon of <hi>Aristotle</hi> is quite ouer-throwne: becauſe (as wee daily ſee) that thoſe creatures which liue in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> ayre, will for the moſt part be ſuffocate and dye in the water; and contrariwiſe, thoſe that liue in the water, cannot endure the ayre. Yet here-vppon it followeth not, that if they be choked in the water, that none at all will liue in the water, and the ſame reaſon is to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged concerning the ayre. Therefore it is no maruell if thoſe wormes that firſt breede in the earth, and liue in the earth, be killed by the ſnow; yet it neceſſarily followeth not, that no liuing creature can take his firſt beeing either from or in the ſnow. But if it can, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> witneſſeth, it is ſo farre vnlikely that the ſame ſnow ſhould be the deſtroyer of that it firſt was bred of, as I thinke rather it cannot liue ſeperately, but of neceſſitie in the ſame ſnow; no otherwiſe then fiſhes can liue without water, from which they firſt ſprung and had theyr beginning. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/>
            </p>
            <p>And to this opinion leaneth <hi>Theophrastus,</hi> in his firſt booke <hi>De Cauſis Plantaru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> whoſe words be theſe, <hi>Apanta gar phainet ai ta zoa, kai ta phuta, kai diamenonta, kai genomena, en tois oikeiois capois:</hi> For all creatures (ſaith he) whatſoeuer, ſeeme, both plants to remaine, and to be generated and bred, in their owne due and proper places. And after this he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth and vrgeth a little further, <hi>Aparthe men hupo touton:</hi> from his owne home and ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all particuler place of abode, nothing can ſuffer, ſuſtaine harme, or be corrupted. And in his fift booke <hi>De cauſ. Plan:</hi> he ſetteth it downe more perſpicuouſly, how that Wormes which are bred in ſome ſpeciall trees, beeing afterwards tranſlated and changed to other trees, where they neuer came before, cannot poſſibly liue. Wherefore it is more conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to reaſon, and more agreeable to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ſence, to affirme that thoſe wormes which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> are found folded and roled vp in the ſnow, to haue beene firſt bred in the ſame ſnow, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to haue iſſued out of the earth.</p>
            <p>Neither are we to make any queſtion or ſcruple concerning theyr foode; for there is no doubt, but the mother from whence they proceeded, will prouide ſufficient nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for her owne children. For as we ſaid a little before, the ſnow is no ſimple thing, but compacted and concrete together of many, and of this nature ought euery aliment to be. <hi>Iulius Caeſar Scaliger</hi> is of this minde, that wormes are ingendered and brought foorth in the very ſnow, becauſe there is in it much ayre and ſpyrit, which afterwards beeing hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and brought to ſome warmth together, may cauſe them to generate; for it is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and qualitie of ſnow to make fat the earth, of which fattiſh moyſture or Ielly, there <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> may (heate beeing ioyned) be produced a liuing creature.</p>
            <p>There be ſome that doe conſtantly hold, that in the midſt of certaine ſtones, of which they vſe to make Lime, there doe breede diuers creatures, of very different kindes, and ſundry proportions and ſhapes, and likewiſe wormes, with hairy backs, and many feete, which are wont to doe much hurt to Fornaces and Limbekills where they make Limbe. Yet <hi>Caeſalpinus</hi> in his firſt booke <hi>De Metal.</hi> chap. 2. thinketh the contrary, aſſuring vs that in Mettall-mines, Quarries of Marble, and other ſtones, there can neuer any liuing bodie be found. And yet in Rocks of the Sea, within the hollow places and riftes of the ſtones, they doe commonly finde certaine ſmall liuing things called <hi>Dactili.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I doe not doubt, whatſoeuer he ſaith to the contrary, but that many creeping, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> liuing creatures, may be found both in the ſecret Mines of ſtone, and ſome-times al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo amongſt Mettalls, although it be ſildome ſeene. And for confirmation heereof, I vvill alleadge one example happening not many yeeres ſince in our owne Country. At <hi>Harle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,</hi> a myle from <hi>Holdenbie</hi> in <hi>Northamptonſhiere,</hi> there was a Quarry of free ſtone found out, of which they digged for the building of Sir <hi>Christopher Hattons</hi> houſe, where there
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:22894:164"/>
was taken vp one beeing a yard and a halfe ſquare euery way at the leaſt, and beeing clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen aſunder, there was found in the very midſt of it a great Toade aliue, but within a very ſhort ſpace after, comming to the open ayre, it dyed. This ſtone amongſt others, vvas taken very deepe out of the earth, it was ſplyt and cut aſunder by one whoſe name is <hi>Lole,</hi> an old man yet liuing at this day, it was ſeene of fiue hundred perſons, Gentlemen and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, of woorthy repute and eſteeme, the moſt part of them liuing at this howre, whoſe atteſtation may defend mee in this report: and ſurely, if Toades may liue in the midſt of ſtones, I can ſee no reaſon but that wormes may therebe found, but as yet I could neuer ſee it.</p>
            <p>In the yeere of Grace 970. at what time <hi>Romualdus</hi> the ſon of <hi>Sergius</hi> a young Monke, was aduaunced by the Nobilitie of <hi>Rauenna</hi> to be their Archbiſhoppe, there followed a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> great death and murren among Earth-vvormes: after that againe enſued ſcarſitie and deatth of all fruites of the earth, as <hi>Carolus Sigonius</hi> in his Chronicle of the Kingdome of Italy declareth. <hi>Henry</hi> Emperour of Rome, the ſonne of the Emperour <hi>Henry</hi> the third, as <hi>Cramzius</hi> hath written, when he tooke his voyage into Italy, beeing ſuddenly ſtayed of his intended courſe, with an Army ſent againſt him by <hi>Matild,</hi> that he ſhould paſſe no further then Lombardie, yet hauing taken <hi>Mutina,</hi> there appeared a ſtrange and vncouth ſigne in the ayre, for an innumerable company of Wormes, ſmaller and thinner then any Flyes, did flye about in the ayre, beeing ſo thicke that they might be touched with any ſmall ſticke or wand, and ſometimes with the hand, ſo that they couered the face of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> earth one myle in breadth, and darkned likewiſe the ayre two or three myles in length.
