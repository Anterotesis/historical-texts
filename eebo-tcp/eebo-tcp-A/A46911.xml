            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>) lay a dying, that I heard a Voice from Heaven which whiſpered to him, Go up and Die, but ſpake aloud to us, <hi>Do the Prophets live for ever</hi>? It awakened me to review a Sermon which I had preached at the requeſt of ſome godly friends in <hi>Leiceſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> upon a Text given by their Father the day before his Death, and to repeat it to ſome very few of Mr. <hi>Charnocks</hi> Hearers. My intent in publiſhing of it is not ſo much to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie them both, as to endeavour ſome ſmall benefit to the ſouls of ſome weaker Chriſtians as well as theirs, before I go hence and be no more. May not a little milk be handed by me to new born babes, but one or another muſt think ſtrange of it? What if they ſhould? I leave it to others to ſeed ſtrong men with ſtronger meat. This prevails with me, Mr. <hi>Charnock</hi> is dead, <hi>I'm a dying.</hi> Some other reaſons I have acquainted him with who knows my thoughts afar off.

He was the Rational houſe of God, Chriſts ſpiritual build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Temple of the Holy Ghoſt, framed, made up of Orthodox Doctrines and good works. A perſon really transformed into the very Image of God himſelf. Always ſerving the only true and living God, as becomes ſuch a God. All the work wherein he employed and exerciſed himſelf with diligence, skill and conſtancy, was love to God and ſouls. His life he examined and ſquared until it was in every thing exact according to the rule of the Word. His Gravity not affected in the leaſt; his very ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence was more efficacious many times than his own, very often than the ſpeech of others. But all his Miniſterial ſervice always ſuch as brought down fire from Heaven upon the ſpiritual Sacrifices. He being a fountain of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Truth, a larger beam of great light, which always carries much warmth and heat as well as light along with it. He was the very mouth by which the Lord Chriſt ſpake, and a genuine Interpreter of the Holy Ghoſt of his mind in the words, of his meaning in the Doctrines of the Goſpel. That Golden Urn (in the Ark of God) that preſerved Divine Manna, and was fill'd to the brim with
<pb facs="tcp:66312:4"/>
Coeleſtial <hi>food</hi> to nouriſh ſouls in ſpiritual, unto eternal life; his heart ever-flowing, and over-flowing love, and grace abundantly poured round his lips. The Doctrines he ſet forth before his Hearers for food and phyſick, were moſt Divine, whom he never directed into any way of truth wherein he had not walked before them. Chriſts moſt fruitful Vine over-ſpread the walls of his Auditory, well hung with lovely cluſters, and flouriſhing with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant fruit of all the ſalutiferous Doctrines of the Goſpel, whence Miniſters, others carried home baskets full to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice the hearts of new-born babes which they were to bring up for Chriſt. Herein lay his Eminency, he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned all into the hands of his Lord and Saviour that had received him, <hi>viz.</hi> his Eſtate, Reputation, Health, Life, and what ever might be for his comfortable being here, even his Learning and Learned Diſcourſes; enjoying only thus much of all theſe things that he over-looked them, and had wherewith he might make it appear how much he pre-eſteemed Chriſt before them.</p>
