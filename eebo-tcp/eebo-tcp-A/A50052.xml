            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

either a fruit of ambition or over-bold

            <p>A King by vertue of his Kingly Office

            </p>
            <p>His Governing also divideth it self into
two branches;
<list>
                  <item>First, To direct,</item>
                  <item>
                     <pb facs="tcp:61841:4"/>

            </p>
            <p>He directeth, by appointing what shall
be done and forborn of all his subjects in
his Jurisdiction.</p>
            <p>He recompenceth or requiteth, by pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
those which disobey the Laws, with
such punishments as himself thinketh good
to appoint, and to signifie to them in his
penalties by which he ratifieth his Laws;
and by rewarding those which keep the
Laws, with such rewards as he seeth fit to
specifie in his Statutes, and in generall, by
making them partakers of the wealth,
peace, quietness and happiness of his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
            <p>He defendeth his subjects against the
hostility of open enemies, and the injuries
of their fellow-subjects.</p>
            <p>It was an excellent speech of <hi>Henry</hi> the
Great, King of <hi>France,</hi> your Grand-father
by the Mothers side; <hi>When I was born there
were a thousand other souls more born, what

wherein your Majesty is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like

did she undergo, before she came to the

it was much more reasonable that

and others.</p>
            <p>He doubted of some points of Religion

Saints, worshipping of reliques, and such

            <p>He endeavoured to abate the tumorous
greatness of the Clergy at that time,<note place="margin">He is therefore ill spoken of by Clergy men. He claimed the investitute of Prelates to be his right. He forbad appeals to <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </note> and
attributed not so much to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi>
as divers Kings before him had done.</p>
            <p>He restrained his Subjects from going to

of <hi>Peter</hi>-pence, and was often heard to say,

whilest his first fears and jealousies continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that they should enjoy free liberty of
hunting; yet did he afterwards so severely
restrain it, that the penalty for killing a
Deer was death.</p>
            <p>During <hi>Lanfranckes</hi> life, he so lived, that
he might have been a mirrour of Princes;
though afterwards he gave himself to sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall
lust and covetousness. <hi>Matthew Paris</hi>
condemns him much.</p>
            <p>It is reported, that when his Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain
upon a certain morning, brought him
a new pair of Hose, the King demanded
what they cost; and the Chamberlain an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
three shillings; hereat the King
grew impatient, and said, <hi>What heavy beast?
dost thou take these to be convenient Hose for a

a mark. The King not only allowed them

            <p>To purchase the favour of the Clergy, he

            <p>To make the Clergy the more assured,
the King renounced the right which his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestours

acknowledged the same to appertain to the

            <p>The Clergy did much favour him, by
reason of his liberall leave, either to erect,
or to enlarge, or else to enrich religious
buildings. For to these works the King
was so ready to give, not only way, but
encouragement and help, that in no Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

say it was because he scourged himself with

               <p>In the year 41 of his Raign, the King

               <p>About this time the famous Dr. <hi>Iohn
Wicklef,</hi> a man of sharp wit, profound
learning, and of great judgement, did in
the University of <hi>Oxford</hi> publickly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
sundry Propositions and dogmaticall
points against the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His followers were in the phrase of those
dark dayes, called <hi>Lollards,</hi> whereas in
truth they endeavoured to extirpate all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
weeds which through time, sloath,
and fraud, had crept into the field of Gods
Church.</p>
               <p>Such was this Kings courtesie &amp; friendly
behaviour toward the two captive Kings of
<hi>France</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> while they remained
together in <hi>England,</hi> as that hereby he won
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:61841:67"/>
their love and favour for ever after, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
by their repair hither to visit the
King and Queen, and to recreate and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
themselves in their company. Thus
it came to pass, that their captivity here,
turned more to their own advantage, and
the peaceable enjoying of their estates after
the same, then if it had never hapned unto
them.</p>

to be fierce and of wanton courage. One

a valiant courage and spirit commanded
the Prince upon his allegiance to leave the

to the place of judgement, some thinking
that he would have slain the Judge, or
have done him some hurt, but the Judge
sitting still without moving, declaring the
majesty of the Kings place of judgement,
and with an assured bold countenance,
spake thus to the Prince: <hi>Sir remember
your self, I keep here the place of the King
your soveraign Lord and Father, to whom
you owe double obeysance, wherefore in his

departed, and went to the Kings
Bench as he was commanded, whereat his
servants disdaining, came and shewed to

               <p>Also a Prince, son and heir of the King

               <p>Thirdly a noble King, and wise father,

Subject corrected.</p>

               <p>Sir <hi>Francis Bacon</hi> in his History of <hi>Henry</hi>
the seventh relates it thus, About this time
the King became suitor to Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> the

for a Saint; the rather in respect of that his
famous prediction of the Kings own as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption

the matter (as the manner is) to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Cardinals, to take the verification of
his holy acts and miracles; but it died un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the reference. The generall opinion
was, that Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> was too dear, and
that the King would not come to his rates.
But it is more probable, that the Pope
(who was extreamly jealous of the dignity
of the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> and of the Acts thereof)
knowing that King <hi>Henry</hi> the sixth was

               <p>The Tax (called Benevolence) was

therefore being raised by the Nobles, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving,

               <p>There scarce passed any Parliament in this
time, without a Law against Riot and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers,
the King having an eye to might
and multitude.</p>
               <p>The King was on a time entertained by

servant, both for war and peace) no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
and sumptuously, at his Castle at <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninghom.</hi>
At the Kings going away, the
Earls servants stood (in a seemly manner)
in their Livery Coats, with cognizances,
ranged on both sides, and made the King a
Lane. The King called the Earl to him,
and said; <hi>My Lord, I have heard much of
your hospitality, but I see it is greater then the
speech. These handsome Gentlemen and Yeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:61841:88"/>
which I see on both sides of me, are sure
your meniall servants.</hi> The Earl smiled, and
said; <hi>It may please your Grace, that were not
for mine ease. They are most of them my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers,
they are come to do me service at such
time as this, and chiefly to see your Grace.</hi> The
King started a little, and said; <hi>By my faith
(my Lord) I thanke you for my good chear,
but I may not endure to have my Lawes broken in
my sight. My Atturney must speake with you.</hi>
The Earl after compounded for a thousand
marks.</p>
               <p>His disposition to crush treasure out of
his Subjects purses, by forfeitures upon pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Lawes, proved the blot of his
time.</p>
               <p>When among many Articles exhibited
by the <hi>Irish</hi> against the Earl of <hi>Kildare,</hi> the
last was: <hi>All</hi> Ireland <hi>cannot rule this Earl.

which might prejudice the Monarchy of

               <p>There preached one before him whose
Sermon the King liked not, as there was
reason; the King willed Sir <hi>Thomas More</hi>
then being Lord Chancellor, to give the
Preacher thanks worthy such a Sermon.
He being a man of a pleasant wit, spake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud
to the Preacher, that the King might
hear, and said, <hi>The Kings Majesty thanketh
you for your notable Sermon:</hi> which when the
King heard, he called Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> to him,

               <p>Being necessitous, he was offered by the

his latter end, all the lands and houses of the
two famous Universities, to be confiscated
to his Exchequer, by a most mechanick
prostitution of the learning, the honour, and
the piety of the Nation: but he told them
not without a just scorn, that he had too
much of a Scholar in him, to destroy two
such Universities as the world had not the

him once in a good humour, and told him
that he was come to change Caps with him.
<hi>Why,</hi> said the King? <hi>Marry,</hi> sayes <hi>Archee,

               <p>This notwithstanding, another Divine of

of the Sentence passed upon the late King.</p>

taking up Arms against their Princes, but
never this way before. These Scriptures

of such a pregnant import) I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
make little for the purpose he alleadg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

               <p>When I consider with my self how many
of note this Divine hath written against,
and what paradoxall (if not heterodoxall)
tenets he hath often laboured to maintain,
sometimes against the determinations of a
Parliament rightly so called, I wonder at
that passage of his near the conclusion of his
<hi>Novice-Presbyter instructed.</hi>

knoweth, that if himself would be pleased
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:61841:118"/>
to discharge me of the service of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting
and opposing men, and dispose of
me in a way of retirement, were it never so
private and obscure, where I might only
contest with my own weakness and errors,
he should give me one of the first-born de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
of my soul in the things of this life, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
