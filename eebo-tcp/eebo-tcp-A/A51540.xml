            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the Commander in Chief is to place
himself before the Centre of the Pikes, about
six Paces from them, that he may be more

he may the better observe what is done, he is
to be on Horse-back. The Serjeants are to be
placed two on each Rank, the Right and Left;
The remainder always to be in the Rere, making
a Rank parallel to the Souldiers at three Paces
distant from the last Rank. The Drums are to be
disposed of, one half on the Right, and the other
on the Left, ranging directly with the first Rank
of the Soldiers. The H<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

stir till his Leader be at least four foot from him,

               <p>The next thing is the Chief Officer gives this
word of command, to the Officers at the Head

Artist in Arms, ought, in the first place, to
learn and practise the Postures of his Arms, a
Posture being a Mode or Garb that we are used
unto in the well-handling of our Arms. 1. Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
is an excellent Virtue, and observe for all,
That in the Exercise both of Pike and Musquet,
the Feet are to be at a moderate distance; for
if they are too wide asunder, or too near toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
it weakens<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and be sure to keep your left
heel fast, and to set your feet exactly, or else you

Barrel toward you, the Lock uppermost, and lay
your right hand, (the fingers extended) just be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
the Lock, close the but-end of your Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet
to your shoulder, that the <hi>Muzzels</hi> may be
all of a height.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Poise your Musquet.</hi> Grasp your Musquet hard,
facing to the right with a quick motion upon
your left heel, keeping your Musquet directly
before you the height of your Cravat, your right
elbow on your side, your feet neither too near
nor at too great a distance, but so, that by
turning the point of the left toe to the Front,
and that of your right as you face, your left
heel being exactly against the middle of your
right foot, you are in the posture for resting;


<pb n="8" facs="tcp:33990:16"/>
which is the reason of facing to the right, that
you may be in a readier posture to rest.</p>
                  <p>

upon the Cock, and your fingers behind the
Trigger, and with the help of closing it to your
thigh, you cock it, keeping it still rested with
your thumb upon the Cock.</p>

that the left heel be against the middle of it, rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the but-end of your Musquet to your shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
your right elbow not higher than your

                     </gap> fury of the Cavalry, and to prevent their
breaking in upon the Battalion, the first thing
that is to be done in drawing up this Battalion,
must be to form a Body of all Pikes, and it must
be the chief care of the Officer that commands
the Party, to dispose his Men in such a form, that
they may be able not only to defend the Musque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers,
but the Colours also, and the Baggage, if
there should be occasion.</p>
                  <p>Now in ordering a Battalion in this manner,
the three following Rules are to be observed.


<pb facs="tcp:33990:21"/>
                     <figure>

                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:33990:22"/>
1. The Men must be so ordered, as to stand
with their Arms presented every way, and to
make a Front on every side, to the end, that
whatever of their Fronts be assailed, or attacked,
they may be able to defend themselves.</p>
                  <p>2. The Soldiers must be so ordered, that the
Angles of the Battalion may be very obtuse; in
such a manner, that the two sides that form the
Angle, joyn together, but with one right Line
only. For the Angle is the weakest part of the
Battalion, as being least strengthened by the
Pikes. For the Soldiers which are next the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle,
present their Pikes in Front, and not being
able therefore to present, lie open to the Enemy.
So that our Fore-Fathers, with whom squ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap>
Battalions were in great use, flanked their Angles
with little Bodies of Musqueteers marked ABCD,
which are small Bodies posted in the middle of
the Fronts of the Battalion, and with which some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
they secur'd the Angles. True it is, that
these little Bodies being easily cut off by the
Horse, and beaten off from the Body of the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talion,
the farther use of them has been laid
aside.</p>
                  <p>3. You ought to leave void a space of Ground
in the Center of the Battalion, or middle of the
Pikes, sufficient to receive and secure the Musque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers,
the Colours, and Baggage.</p>
                  <div type="entry">

                     <head>The manner of ordering any number of Soldiers into
any Square Form of Battel.</head>
                     <p>1. These are to be considered either in respect
of the Form of the Ground, or of the Number of
the Men.</p>
                     <p>A Square Battel of Ground is that which hath
the Rank as long as the File, notwithstanding the
Men in Rank be more than in File.</p>
                     <p>A Square Battle of Men, is that which hath an
equal number of Men both in Rank and File,
though the Ground on which they stand be longer
on the File than on the Rank.</p>
                     <p>2. In respect of the number of the Men, it is
called either a <hi>Square Battel</hi> or a <hi>Double Battel,</hi>
or a <hi>Battel</hi> of the <hi>Grand Front,</hi> which is Quadru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
or a Battel of any proportion of the number
in Rank to the number in File.</p>
                     <p>3. So that if you are to form a Square Battle of
Men, extract the Square Root out of the whole
number of Men, and the same shall be the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Soldiers to beset in a Rank. As for Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
570 are to be formed into a Square Battel,
that there may be as many in Rank as in the File.

And as soon as the two last Ranks have fired,
they are to put their Daggers into their Firelocks,
and stand Charged; and when the first Rank of

are to deliver their Granado's; which done, they

always be two: Thus, having placed the first
Man at the Angular Point A of the Figure 1. the

number of which, the Excess, Interval, and Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
is Two in respect of one. The third Rank

                     <p>The half File D, makes a quarter Wheel about
the Soldier Z, and because that after the Wheel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
they make a Front inward toward the Center,

                     <head>Directions for Firing.</head>
                     <p>1. In keeping of Ground: This way of
Firing may be performed either by two Ranks
at a time, or three Ranks; The first Kneeling,
and the second Stooping, or the two first Stoop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
or else thus, <hi>Musketeers make ready all,</hi> at
which time the Musketeers are to be Cocked
and Guarded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and their Arms strait before them,
the Pikes Ported, and when the Musketeers Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
the Pikes are to be charged. Then</p>
                     <p>The five first Ranks Kneel, The Reer Rank Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
Fire; Fifth Rank stand up, Present, Fire;
Fourth Rank Stand up, Present, Fire. <hi>And so of the
rest.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And as they have fired, they are to charge
again, and to be in a readiness against the next
Word of Command.</p>
                     <p>2. For Fire gaining Ground, the Command


<pb n="34" facs="tcp:33990:34"/>
is, <hi>First Rank and Musketeers make ready, Halt:</hi>
Then <hi>Present</hi> and <hi>Fire.</hi> Here they are to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
their Arms without any command, and to
file off to the Right and Left into the Reer.
When the first Rank presents, the next Rank is
to make ready without any Command, and
as the first Rank files off, the next make good
the Front, and so the Battalion is to March a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
and every Rank to Fire in this order;
And when every Rank presents, the Pikes are
to charge without any command.</p>
                     <p>3. Of Firing to the Front retreating. The
best way is to Fire by single Ranks, in the same
method as in gaining Ground, only after every
Rank has fired and filed off to the Right and
Left into the Rear, instead of the next Rank ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing
to make good the Front of Pikes, the
Pikes are to retreat to the Musketeers, who stand
still till the Pikes make an even Front with
them.</p>

The Cavalry must be placed upon the Wings,
in Front and in the Reer of the Bodies. The
Infantry must march in the middle, and in a
gross Battalion. The Artillery upon one side,
guarded by some old Regiments, as you see in

                  <p>WHEN the Camp-Master General, or
Major-General hath read the Number of
the Horse and Foot that are in the Army, he
must proportion and cast up what space of
Ground will suffice to encamp them with all
their Provision, Carriages, and so that neither
for due Room the Soldiers be pestered, nor by
over large Spaces the Camp not sufficiently forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
                  <p>This being of great Importance, it will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
for him to understand well Arithmetick
and Geometry, and to have in readiness sundry
Plats and Models, and Forms of Camps where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he may suddenly resolve for any Number or
Situation, what Form and Quality is most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient,
and presently stake it out; assigning due
place for every Regiment of Horse and Foot.</p>
                  <p>Before Encamping he ought to consider, if the
Army consist much of Horse, that there be good
store of Forrage nigh the Camp, and that the
Camp be not subject to any Hill from whence the


<pb n="38" facs="tcp:33990:39"/>
Enemy may with his great Artillery incommode
it: Nor that it be so separated from Water, that
the Enemy may easily cut you from it; nor that
it be so low, as that the Enemy by cutting the
Banks of any River, may drown the Camp.
And if there be no great Rivers, but only Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
or Wells of Water, then must good Watch
be kept that they be not poysoned nor infected
by the Enemy. In a running or moveable Camp,
the readiest Fortification is to impale it round
with the Carriages chained together, bending the
Artillery that way where most suspicion is the
Enemy will approach; and if time permit, to cast
some Trench also without the Carriages.</p>

present Engagement.</head>
                  <p>A General is sometimes constrained to a Battel
when he is in an Enemies Country, upon
the false reports of his Spies; especially of such as
play fast and loose, receiving pay from both sides,
which are a sort of People very dangerous. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
through the ignorance of those that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
the Parties, who seeking to get intelligence
of the Enemy, never inform themselves throughly
of their March.

Sometimes he engages himself voluntarily, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing
to relieve some place that is Besieged. But
what way soever it be, that he is forced to come
to a Battel, he must endeavour to order his Men
after the following manner.</p>
                  <p>He shall range his Infantry in Battalions, every
one consisting of five or six hundred Men, or a
thousand Men, which are the most convenient
Numbers, with the Numbers between, to form a
just Body. For those Bodies that exceed the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of a thousand, can never be drawn up conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently
upon all sorts of Ground; and such as
are under 500 will never be strong enough to
resist at the same time the fury of the Enemies
Horse.</p>
                  <p>His Cavalry which should be always drawn
up upon the Wings of the Infantry, must be drawn
up in Squadrons, consisting of an hundred and
twenty or thereabouts. But the best and those
that are most serviceable to break the Battalions
of the Enemy, are those that consist of 150 or
200 at most; for if they exceed the number of
200, they are not easily, nor conveniently drawn
up by reason of the length of their Ranks, and
the number of Horses. And thus it was that the
late Duke <hi>de Schonberg</hi> Embattled his Forces at
the Battel of <hi>Montesclar,</hi> which he won from the
Marquess of <hi>Caracene.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>An Army which is Embattelled in small Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions
of Horse and Foot, is not so easily rout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as that Army which is Embattelled in great
Divisions. And small Divisions are much more
ready than great: For besides seconding one
another, and wheeling upon all occasions, they
will likewise outfront an Army which is Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>battled


<pb n="40" facs="tcp:33990:41"/>
in great Divisions: The which is one of
the greatest advantages that can be taken in the
Embatteling of an Army. Small Divisions of
Horse and Foot are also much readier for service,
where you cannot Embattel them according to
the Rules of Art by the nature of the place, or
with Inclosures, or where the brevity of time will
not give you leave; besides, small Divisions are
much more troublesome for an Enemy to deal
withal, than an Army that is Embatteled in
great Divisions.</p>

                  <p>IN the handling of this Part I shall be plain,
yet brief as possible.</p>
                  <p>1. General Maxim is, That all the parts of the
Place, be of <hi>Cannon</hi> Proof Flanked, <hi>i. e.</hi> defended
from another place, which place is not further
distant, than the reach of a <hi>Musket-shot</hi> from the
place to be <hi>flanked</hi> or defended.</p>
                  <p>2. That in all the Place, there may be no part
of the <hi>Wall,</hi> or outside of the <hi>Rampire,</hi> that is not
seen from the top to the bottom of the <hi>Mote</hi> or
<hi>Ditch.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. That the <hi>Bastions</hi> are large, and full of Earth,
and not empty; the bigger they are, they are
the more to be esteemed, there being the more


<pb n="42" facs="tcp:33990:42"/>
room to intrench in case of necessity: whose
<hi>Gorge</hi> let be at least 35 <hi>fathoms,</hi> and their <hi>flank</hi>
at least 18 <hi>fathoms.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. That the <hi>Angle</hi> of the <hi>Bastion</hi> or <hi>flanked
Angle,</hi> be not much above 90, nor much less than
60 <hi>Degrees,</hi> for in the former it would be too ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>Obtuse,</hi> and open, at the Point, and in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it would be too slender, and so easily to be
battered down by the Enemies <hi>Cannon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. That the <hi>Angle</hi> of the <hi>flank</hi> may be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
<hi>Obtuse;</hi> neither is there any more virtue in
a <hi>Right-Angle,</hi> than any other, for the defence of
the Fort.</p>
                  <p>6. That the length of an extended <hi>Curtain</hi> be
not above 135 <hi>Fathoms,</hi> nor the single above 80<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <hi>Fathoms,</hi> nor be less than 40 <hi>Fathoms,</hi> to be well
defended from two <hi>Flanks.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7. That the <hi>Rampier</hi> be so wide, that so a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rapet</hi>
of Earth <hi>Cannon-proof</hi> may be erected there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and a <hi>Teraplane</hi> left, full wide for the <hi>Ordnance</hi>
to be <hi>recoiled.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>8. That the <hi>Mote</hi> or <hi>Ditch</hi> be at least 20 <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms</hi>
broad, and as deep as possible. Now dry
<hi>Motes</hi> in great Cities are to be preferred before
others that are full of Water, to facilitate the <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,</hi>
the relief and retreat of the Besieged; and in
small <hi>Fortifications</hi> the <hi>Motes</hi> full of Water are
the most esteemable, because in such, Sallies are
not necessary, and Supplies are very much to be
feared.</p>
                  <p>9. That the Parts that are most remote from
the <hi>Center,</hi> be commanded by those which are
nearest to it.</p>
                  <p>10. That the Defence of a Face is much strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,

                     <p>Suppose the Bastions to be drawn out in <hi>white

the <hi>Defence</hi> of the Bastion AB, from 6 or 7 fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms
at most, from B to C, from the Point C
draw CD parallel to the flank BE, then divide
the flank BE into two equal parts, at the Point
F to draw from the Point G, which is the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
of the opposite Front AH the Line GF, to
the inside of the <hi>Bastion,</hi> observing where it cuts CD,
as in I, purposely to carry on one fathom from
I to L, afterwards draw the Line MLN paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel
to FI, the length of which from M to N,
must be 11 fathom: That done, make NO
parallel to the flank BF, the length of which
from N to O must be 4 fathom. Lastly, make
OP parallel to FI, and then all the void space
BMNOPC shall be the extent of the <hi>Caze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates,</hi>
as well of the large <hi>Cazemates,</hi> as those
which are more private.</p>
                     <p>To make the <hi>Shoulder</hi> or <hi>Ear</hi> of the <hi>Bastion,</hi>
draw upon the Line of Defence PS 6 fathom
from E to I, and upon FG 6 fathom; also from
F to V and then joining V and T together, you
have the whole <hi>Shoulder</hi> or <hi>Ear</hi> FVTE which
must be all one solid piece. For the <hi>Paropet</hi> of
the first <hi>Cazemate,</hi> you must allow within side
one <hi>Toise</hi> of <hi>heighth</hi> from 3 to 4 in thickness,
with 8 <hi>firing Places</hi> for the planting of so many

all the matter briefly, but plainly in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Heads.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> Such <hi>Figures</hi> as have not their Sides and
Angles equal to one another, are called Irregular.</p>
                  <p>Now forasmuch as the Forms of Towns are
so various and subject to so many Cases, their
<hi>Fortification</hi> cannot be comprehended under cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Rules, neither can the Principles of <hi>Regular
Fortification</hi> be exactly observed here; It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
requisite that the <hi>Engineer</hi> make a Map or
Draught of the whole, with all the <hi>Ways, Passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
Rivers, Pools, Enclosures,</hi> and all other <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
fit to be known, and then consider what
Designs and Works he shall think most fit and
proper for the place. To this end let him know,</p>
                  <p>1. That the same Laws and Maxims for Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Fortifications, stand and be in force, as for the
<hi>Irregular;</hi> and that the nearer an <hi>Irregular Figure</hi>
comes to a Regular, the <hi>stronger</hi> and <hi>better</hi> it is.</p>
                  <p>2. That none of the <hi>inward Angles</hi> of his <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure</hi>
be less than 90 degrees; if less, then they must
be <hi>changed,</hi> by making the <hi>Point,</hi> the outward
<hi>Point</hi> of a Bastion.</p>
                  <p>3. That the Angles of the Bastion be not less
than 60 degrees.</p>
                  <p>4. That the Line of Defence, or side of an <hi>Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
Figure,</hi> must not be more than <hi>Musquet-shot.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. The Sides of an Irregular Figure, which is
too long for two Bastions, and too short for three,
may be fortified with two great <hi>Bulwarks.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. When the side is above 70 Rod, there may
be a Ravelin erected between the two Bulwarks,
or a flat Bulwark built between.</p>
                  <p>7. When an Angle of the Figure is between 80
or 90 degrees, it ought to be fortified with a <hi>Horn-work.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="49" facs="tcp:33990:48"/>
8. All the differences between <hi>Regular</hi> and <hi>Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular
Fortifications,</hi> consists in the rectifying the
<hi>Sides</hi> that are too short or too long, and altering
the Angles that are too little, by cutting off from
the length, what is too much, or adding to it,
what is necessary, to make them in their <hi>just</hi> and
<hi>true proportions,</hi> as in the <hi>Regular.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>More Rules might be given, but there being
so <hi>much variety</hi> in this sort of <hi>Fortifications,</hi> the
Engineer must practise by himself, by drawing
several <hi>Plats</hi> of <hi>Irregular Places,</hi> and fortifie them.
And he should also peruse all the Books he can
get of this Subject, as <hi>Marolos, Fritach, Dogen,
Dilichius, Travax de Mars, &amp;c.</hi> where he will find
variety of <hi>Examples</hi> which will help to inform
his Fancy, and rectifie his Judgment.</p>
                  <p>For the Raising the <hi>Ramparts, Paropets</hi> and other
<hi>Works,</hi> you must observe the same <hi>Rules,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
in the same <hi>Method</hi> as in <hi>Regular,</hi> and no
otherwise.</p>
                  <p>A. Is a <hi>Regular Bastion,</hi> and here I shall give
one <hi>Rule</hi> to find the <hi>Capital Line</hi> in all irregular
Angles, <hi>viz.</hi> At the end of each <hi>Courtain,</hi> as a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> e
d, cross an Arch at c and f. and draw the line
c a, which shall be the <hi>Capital Line,</hi> which may
be about 243 Feet, a little more or less, and the
<hi>Gorges</hi> may be one hundred forty five or 150,
Feet, or thereabouts.</p>
                  <p>B. Is a <hi>double Bastion,</hi> that is, upon the Plane
of the great <hi>Bastion,</hi> another <hi>Bastion</hi> is built upon
it higher: This hath the use of a <hi>Cavalier,</hi> and
overlooks the <hi>Campagne;</hi> there may be about 12
or 18 feet left between the <hi>Paropet</hi> of the <hi>lower
Bastion,</hi> and the foot of the <hi>higher Bastion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>C. Is a <hi>Bastion composed,</hi> that is, when the two


<pb n="50" facs="tcp:33990:49"/>
                     <hi>interior Polygons</hi> are much unequal, then the <hi>Gorges</hi>
will be unequal.</p>
                  <p>D. Is a <hi>Bastion</hi> deformed, that is, if one of the
<hi>interior Polygons</hi> be so short that it can have no <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migorge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>E. Is a <hi>Plat Bastion,</hi> that is, if the distance from
the Points of the <hi>interior Polygon</hi> be double to the
usual length.</p>
                  <p>F. Is a <hi>forked Bastion,</hi> cut off with a <hi>Tenaile,</hi> that
is, if the Angle of the Figure be less than 90 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees;
and because of <hi>Water,</hi> or some other
<hi>Accident,</hi> it cannot be <hi>changed,</hi> then you may
cut off the Angle, and joyn it with a <hi>Tenaile.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>G. Is a <hi>Bastion cut off,</hi> that is, separated from the
<hi>Rampire,</hi> so that its <hi>Gorges</hi> are in a <hi>Right Line</hi> with
the two Points of the flanks HF.</p>
                  <p>H. Is a <hi>Demi-Bastion,</hi> that is, such as have their
<hi>Gorge</hi> and <hi>Capital</hi> equal, and its flank half of the
<hi>Gorge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I. Is a <hi>Platform</hi> upon an <hi>inward Angle,</hi> for the
placing of <hi>great Guns</hi> to scour the <hi>Ditch.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>L. Is a <hi>Mount upon Piles</hi> for a <hi>Corps du Guard,</hi>
with a <hi>Paropet,</hi> like that of the <hi>Outworks, Cannon-proof,</hi>
necessary to hinder the <hi>Vnder surprises</hi> when
the Mote is frozen.</p>
                  <p>M. Is an <hi>indented Line,</hi> often used upon the
Bank af the <hi>Counterscarp,</hi> or upon a <hi>River.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>N. Is a <hi>Counter-Guard,</hi> or <hi>Demi-Bastion,</hi> built in
some watry place before the main <hi>Bastion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O. Is a <hi>Scillen,</hi> or a <hi>Tenail</hi> with a <hi>Breast-work</hi>
placed in the Mote, called also a <hi>Counterguard.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>P. Is a <hi>Bonnet,</hi> that is, an advanced Work, like
a <hi>Ravelin,</hi> sometimes placed on high Ground,
sometimes on low.

Hexagon, Heptagon,</hi> &amp;c. Having no <hi>Scale</hi>
or <hi>Sector,</hi> then you may make a <hi>Scale</hi> large

dividing it into ten equal Parts, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very

that <hi>Table</hi> the <hi>Semidiameter,</hi> or <hi>Radius,</hi> of
that <hi>Polygon,</hi> which you intend to draw; (for

which the <hi>Table</hi> shews that distance, apply it

and from 4 to 5, and from 5 to 6.</p>
                  <p>4 Take off from the <hi>Scale,</hi> the <hi>Capital
Line,</hi> 18. 73. as in the Table, and set it off at
all the <hi>Angles</hi> of the <hi>Ground-plot,</hi> viz, from

                  </p>
                  <p>5. Take the length of the <hi>Gorge,</hi> 13. 79.
from the <hi>Table</hi> upon your <hi>Scale,</hi> and set it off
from 1 to 7, and from 6 to 7; and on the
two <hi>points</hi> 7 and 7, raise perpendicular <hi>Lines,</hi>
as 7, 8, and 7, 8.</p>
                  <p>6 Take off from the <hi>Table,</hi> the length of
the <hi>Flank,</hi> viz. 10. 07. upon your <hi>Scale,</hi> and
set it off from 7 to 8.</p>
                  <p>7. Draw the <hi>Face</hi> from the uppermost part
of the <hi>Capital Line</hi> d. to the uttermost part of
the <hi>Flank</hi> 8. and so for the rest of the <hi>Lines,</hi>
they are easily set off, and transferree from
these, and so the Draught is finished.</p>

Thus you may by these <hi>Tables,</hi> with a
<hi>Scale</hi> of equal parts, delineate any regular <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure,</hi>
two several ways, according to the first
or second <hi>Table,</hi> and by the <hi>Rule of Three;</hi>
these <hi>Tables</hi> may serve for any Proportions.</p>
                  <p>But these <hi>Data</hi>'s may be varied without
prejudice to the Maxims of <hi>Fortification,</hi> and
the Constitution of the <hi>Ground-lines</hi> will be
various, according to the Experience and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions
of several <hi>Engeniers:</hi> Therefore I
shall shew the Constitution, and making the
principal <hi>Ground lines</hi> of any <hi>Fortification,</hi> in
several ways, use by other more famous and
modern Authors.</p>
                  <p>And First, of the <hi>Dutch</hi> or <hi>German</hi> ways,
who, although they have filled the World
full of Books, of several ways of <hi>Fortification,</hi>
yet <hi>Maralois, Fritach, Goldman,</hi> and <hi>Dogen,</hi>
all agree, to make the <hi>Courtain</hi> 36 <hi>Perches,</hi>
or 432 <hi>Rhinland feet;</hi> the <hi>Face</hi> 24 <hi>Perches,</hi>
or 288 of the aforesaid <hi>Feet,</hi> so that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of the <hi>Curtain,</hi> to the <hi>Face,</hi> is as 3 to
2. the <hi>Angle</hi> forming the <hi>Flank,</hi> is always
40 <hi>Degrees;</hi> the <hi>Angle</hi> of the <hi>Bulwark</hi> is half
the <hi>Angle</hi> of the <hi>Figure,</hi> increased with 15
<hi>Degrees, Goldman, Marolois,</hi> and <hi>Fritach,</hi>
agree in the <hi>Angle</hi> of the <hi>Bulwark;</hi> but <hi>Dogen</hi>
makes the <hi>Angle</hi> of the <hi>Bulwark,</hi> equal to 4


<pb n="57" facs="tcp:33990:53"/>
of the <hi>Angle</hi> of the <hi>Figure;</hi> so that all the
<hi>Data</hi>'s are very near the same, with those the
Author hath laid down before.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>English</hi> Authors, I shall only mention
Mr. <hi>Norwood,</hi> who in his Maxims differs very
little from our Author; the <hi>Duich Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
being then most used. And Sir <hi>Jonas
Moor,</hi> who was an able <hi>Mathematician,</hi> and
well experienc'd in this Art; after he had
shewed the several ways of all Modern <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniers,</hi>
sayeth, That the interiour <hi>Polygon</hi> is
most agreeable to Practice, being 1000. to
take 333 <hi>Feet,</hi> for the <hi>Capital</hi> 200, for the
<hi>Gorge</hi> and <hi>Flank,</hi> and 600 for the <hi>Courtaine,</hi>
so that he agrees with <hi>Manassen Mallet,</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of <hi>Travax de Mars;</hi> and, for a general
Rule, take, saith he, 1/<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

where there is no second <hi>Flank,</hi> and where
the <hi>Flank</hi> and <hi>Capital</hi> stand at <hi>Right Angles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Emperor, <hi>Ferdinand</hi> III. sets down
(as <hi>Schotus</hi> that learned Jesuite sayth) an U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal
way to lay down the <hi>Lines</hi> of any
<hi>Fort,</hi> viz to divide the interiour <hi>Polygon</hi> into
22 parts; of these, take 5 for the <hi>Gorge,</hi> 8 for
the <hi>Capital,</hi> and 4 for the <hi>Flank;</hi> or suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the <hi>Polygon</hi> to be divided into 1000, the

But if the <hi>interior Polygon</hi> be less than a 1000,
the <hi>Proportion</hi> in this and the former <hi>Tables</hi>
may be reduced to any other <hi>Polygon</hi> requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
by multiplying the length given by any

places. <hi>Example.</hi> A <hi>Polygon</hi> given is 750,
what shall be the length of the <hi>Capital,
Gorge, Flank,</hi> and <hi>Courtain,</hi> according to
any of the aforesaid Authors. For <hi>Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>
to <hi>De la Mont.</hi> multiply 750 by 333,
gives 249 Feet for the <hi>Capital,</hi> so for the
<hi>Gorge,</hi> then multiply 750 by 200. and there
is 150, for the <hi>Gorge,</hi> then multiply 750 by
150, and there will be 112 for the <hi>Flank,</hi>
and after the same manner 450 for the <hi>Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</hi>
And thus you may proportion any

                  <p>The Fortification of any Piece of <hi>Ordnance</hi> is

                  <p>The <hi>Legitimate Pieces,</hi> or the ordinary fortified
<hi>Cannons</hi> have 7/8 at the Touch-hole, 5/8 at the <hi>Trun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,</hi>

the Bore, in thickness of the Metal. Bastard
<hi>Cannons</hi> or lessened <hi>Cannons</hi> have ¾ at their Touch-hole,
or 12/105 and 9/16 at their <hi>Trunnions,</hi> and at
their Muzzel: The <hi>Double fortified Cannons</hi> have
full one Diameter of the Bore in thickness of the
Metal at the Touch-hole, and 11/16 at the <hi>Trun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,</hi>
and 7/16 at their Muzzel. Now all double

                  <p>The Bullet must be somewhat less than the
Bore of the Gun, that so it may have vent in
the Discharge: so Authors affirm, that ¼ of an

but this vent is too much for a <hi>Falcon,</hi> &amp;c. and
too little for a Cannon; therefore I approve them
not, but commend Mr. <hi>Phillips's</hi> proportion (set
down in his <hi>Mathematical Manual,</hi> page 165) to
your Use, which is to divide the Bore of the Gun
into 20 equal parts, and let the Diameter of the

Piece of Ordnance.</head>
                  <p>1. To <hi>Tertiate</hi> a Piece, is to find whether it
hath its due thickness at the <hi>Trunnions, Touch hole</hi>
and <hi>Neck,</hi> and if the <hi>Trunnions, Touch-hole</hi> and <hi>Neck</hi>
are in its due order, and the <hi>Chase</hi> streight.</p>

it be directly placed, and equally poized in
the Carriage; which is known by finding in the
<hi>Convex Superficies</hi> of the Base and Muzzel-Ring,
the Point which is <hi>Perpendicular,</hi> over the Soul of
the Piece, which may be found by the Gunners
Instrument, called a <hi>Level;</hi> an Instrument whose
use is so vulgarly known, that it needeth not my
Explanation.</p>
                  <p>3. To <hi>Dispart</hi> a Piece, is to fix, or elevate on
the Convex-point of the Muzzel-Ring, a Mark
as far distant from the <hi>Cylinder,</hi> or Soul of the
Piece, as is the Point of the Base-Ring; to the
end, that the <hi>Visail-ray</hi> which passeth by these
Marks, may be parallel to the Chase, Soul or

the difference of the <hi>Semidiameters</hi> of the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishes,</hi>
may be by a pair of <hi>Calliper Compasses</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,

                  <head>To know how far any Piece of Ordnance will

                  <p>As to the several shootings in <hi>Artillery,</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
differ much in their Judgments and Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
but they all unanimously agree, that the
Ball being shot forth, flies through the Air, with a
Violent, Mixt and Natural Motion; describing a
<hi>Parabolical line,</hi> in whose beginning and ending,
are lines sensibly streight, and in the middle cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
In the beginuing the imprest force driving
forward by the Fire, the natural gravity of the
Ball doth describe a <hi>Right Line,</hi> called the <hi>Direct
Line,</hi> or Ranges of the Balls Circuit.</p>
                  <p>In the middle that force diminisheth, and the
<hi>Natural Gravity</hi> prevaileth, so that it describeth a
curved line, called the <hi>Balls middle Helical</hi> or
<hi>Conical Arch;</hi> In the end, the <hi>Natural Gravity</hi>
overcoming the imprest violence, (which becomes
altogether weak and faint) describes a new right
line, called <hi>the Balls declining line,</hi> in which the
Ball tends towards the Center of the Earth, as
towards a Place natural unto all heavy bodies.
See <hi>Figure</hi> 92. These motions are somewhat
longer, according as the Piece is mounted from
the Level unto the Angle of 45 <hi>deg.</hi> which is
called <hi>the Vtmost Random.</hi> The Elevation of which,
is regulated by the <hi>Gunner</hi>'s <hi>Quadrant,</hi> the use of
which Instrument is so generally known, and by
so many Authors, fully explained, that I here
crave leave to omit it. But take these for general
Rules.</p>

                     <pb n="58" facs="tcp:33990:66"/>
1. That a Shot at Right Angle, strikes more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
and furiously than at Oblique Angles; therefore
Gunners use when they are to batter down a Tower,
Wall, or Earth-work, to shoot point blank at the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
Tire by Tire; by discharging all the Pieces in
Battery against the self same object, in the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,
<hi>holding it for a Maxim,</hi> that ten Cannons
discharged together, do far more Execution, than
discharged one after another. Now at <hi>Oblique An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles</hi>
they shoot either Cross-ways, or by rebound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>2. That the speediest way to make a Breach in a
Wall, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Is by shooting at the Object from two Batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
which ruins far more speedily than by striking
the Object with one Battery at <hi>Right Angles,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
that one Battery hath as many Cannon as the
other <hi>two hath.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. That if you were to Batter a flank covered with
an <hi>Orillion,</hi> (which because you cannot possibly Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it right forward) you must therefore of necessity
batter it obliquely, by way of Rebounding, thus:
<hi>Chuse a fit place in the</hi> Courtain <hi>to be your</hi> object,
<hi>on which you may play with your Battery ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely,
so that by a rebound the shot may leap
into the</hi> flanks, <hi>holding for a</hi> Maxim, <hi>in this ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi>
That the Angles of Incidence and Reflection
are equal.</p>

                     <hi>Bombs</hi> are great hollow Balls of Iron or Brass,
in which are put fine sifted Gunpowder, which
by a Fuse, they proportion to them a due Fire,
that so they may break assoon as they fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the Enemies. These Fusees are small
Trunks of <hi>Wood, Tin</hi> or <hi>Iron,</hi> filled with a <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
Composition</hi> for that purpose. <hi>Granadoes</hi> are
of the same form with <hi>Bombs,</hi> only smaller, and
are many times cast by hand, and are made of
<hi>Iron, Brass, Glass</hi> or <hi>Earth.</hi> Now in order to the
well shooting in those kind of <hi>Machines</hi> called
<hi>Mortars,</hi> 'tis requisite to observe these following
Rules: as
<list>
                        <item>1. That before you make a Shot at any place, you
find the distance thereof from your Mortar.</item>
                        <item>2. That the Bombs or other Bodies that are
to be shot, be of equal weight, otherwise the Shots
will fail.</item>
                        <item>3. That the Carriage in breadth be always on a
Level, and without any descent, that so it may not
leap in discharging fail.</item>
                        <item>4. That the Powder with which the Mortar is
loaded be always of the same force and weight.</item>
                        <item>5. That the charge of the Mortar, as well in
Powder, as in Wadding, be always rammed in with
blows equally heavy, and of equal number.</item>
                        <item>6. That the Wadds be always either of Wood or
Tompeons, or else of Oakam, for the strongest drives
it farthest.</item>
                        <item>7. That the Fusees be newly made, in those days
that they are to be used, and that they be made of
a Composition proportionable to the Range that the
Shot shall make in the Air, so that the Bomb may
break in the very moment it falls; which Composition
must be such, that though it fall in the Water, yet


<pb n="60" facs="tcp:33990:67"/>
not to extinguish, but the Bomb there to break.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now before we proceed any farther, I think it
necessary, to shew how to compose your Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
for your Fusee.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="entry">
                  <head>To make Fuses for Bombs, &amp;c.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Composition for. Bombs must be of a
slow motion, that so time enough may be given
to throw either</hi> Bombs, Granadoes, Fire-Balls,
Thundring Barrels, &amp;c. <hi>They are compounded of
these Ingredients, thus:</hi> Take a pound of <hi>Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder,</hi>
                     <hi rend="sup">416</hi> of Sulphur, <hi rend="sup">416</hi> of Saltpeter, well beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en,
dry and sifted separately, then mix it and make
up your Fuse hereof. <hi>Or,</hi> Take Powder of <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin</hi>
and small-Coles, all well beaten and mixed
together with some <hi>Oil of Piter,</hi> and so fill the Fusee
therewith.</p>
                  <p>Now the use of <hi>Mortar-Pieces,</hi> being for the most
part to shoot up at Random, therefore the Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
of these Pieces is very necessary to be known.
