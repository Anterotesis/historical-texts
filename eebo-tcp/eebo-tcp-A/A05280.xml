         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>Now of these three kindes of life, to wit, virginity, marriage and widdowhead, the Monkes make much adoe, and such a difference in the sight of men and God too, as doth no lesse argue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> of foule impietie, then of iust hypocrisie, preferring virginity and widdow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode much before marriage, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in the sight of God: for they attribute vnto virginity the fruite and merit of a hundred fold, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to widdowhoode of sixtie fold, but vnto Matrimonie, as a state

more vile and beggerly, only thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty fold.</p>
                     <p>Yea and yet some more supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> these, who left vnto ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage no place of fruit or blessing; but that of an hundred fold they gaue vnto martyrdome, that of sixtie fold to virginity, and that of thirtie fold to widdowhoode; rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning mariage among those kindes of life, which are nothing pleasing vnto God, but onely of mercy suffred to bee, and are not farre from fornication, Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon this speech hath fallen from their filthy mouthes: <hi>Nuptiae ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am replent, virginitas Caelum,</hi> The married replenish the earth, but virgins fill heauen; as and if law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full marriage had nought to doe with heauen.

frowne at marriage, who laugh at letchery.</p>
                     <p>But leaue wee these hypocrites in their superstition, and let vs see what the Scripture saith of these three states of life.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 First, the scripture saith, of a truth, I perceiue that <hi>God is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specter of persons, but in euery nation he that feareth him, &amp; worketh righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes, is accepted of him.</hi> Acts. 10.34.</p>

                     <p n="3">3 And againe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.28. There is neither Iewe nor Grecian, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Iesus: And if ye be Christs, then are ye A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams seede, and heires by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise. Out of all which I gather
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:3768:39"/>
that God is no accepter of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, nor respecteth any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, place, state or condition of men, but as they respect him in true piety and godlinesse.</p>
                     <p>He respecteth no person, place or state of life, but in the cause: blessed cause, blessed person, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther virgin, wife or widdowe: cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed cause, cursed person, whether widdowe, wife, or virgin. Giue me a religious virgin, and I will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer her before an irreligious wife or widdowe; giue me a religious wife or widdowe, and I will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre her before an irreligious vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin.

creature.</p>
                     <p>I gather againe, that vpon the touch of Christ,<note place="margin">Reue. 7.14.</note> all states are san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, and neuer till we haue dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped our stoles in the bloud of the Lamb: If then ye be Christs,<note place="margin">Gal. 3.29.</note> yee are Abrahams seede, and heires by promise: not heires for that ye are Iewes rather then Grecians, not heires for that ye are men, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then women, virgins rather then wiues, Kings rather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sants: but ye are heires because of the promise, euen of the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed seede; which laid vp in your hearts by faith, vnfolds the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance vnto you, and maketh you heires of his heauenly kingdome.

                     <p>The text saith well, shee liued with him, which argued her pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence as well as her chastity: for if she had not beene peaceable<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> it had beene no life but a death they led, according to that of <hi>Siracides: an euill wife is a yoke of Oxen that draweth diuerse waies, hee that hath her is as though he held a Scorpion.</hi>

                        <pb n="68" facs="tcp:3768:41"/>Lastly, as the Lord guided her in her virginity, honoured her in marriage, so hee loued and prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted her in her widdowhead, an estate of life much respected of God, as may appeare by the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
                     <p>Wherein the Lord enioyneth from <hi>Horeb,</hi> (to which imperiall law all owe homage) Ye shall not trouble any widdowe nor father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse childe;<note place="margin">Ex. 22.22</note> if thou vex or trouble such, and so he crie and call vpon me, I will surely heare his crie.</p>

                     <p>Chambering and wantonnesse rotteth the bones, and shorteneth the life; but temperance euen in that, giueth length of daies.

                     <p>It was demanded of <hi>Valeria</hi> the Romane (her husband being dead) why she married not againe: she answered that of right she could not, for that her husband yet li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, though not in her house, yet in her heart; and till he were there dead, shee doubted shee neither ought, nor could marry another.</p>

                     <p>If I should marry againe (saith she) then it must needes fall out that my husband should proue ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good or bad: if good, then should I euer liue in feare to loose him; if bad, then in griefe to keepe him, and therefore none is best.</p>
                     <p>I speak this to correct the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of our daies, wherein both Virgins, wiues, and widdowes are too wantonly giuen, neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding the vaile of their virgini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the honour of their marriage, nor the holinesse of their widdow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode with gracious <hi>Anna.</hi>

                     <p>This therefore is the right vse of our prayer and fasting, to bee vnto vs as it were bellowes, by which our faith in Christ is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshed and inflamed.

                     <p>When Christ was transfigured vpon the holy mount, it is sayde that <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> talked with him, and told of his departure which he should suffer at Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.

                     <p>The Babe was crucified, <hi>Mary</hi> was purified, and the childe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented according to the law; they performed al, &amp; left out nothing: &amp; they did it according to no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of their owne: but as the line and leuell of the same lawe ledde them.</p>
                     <p>And here two sorts of people are sweetly taught, if not iustly taxed by the spirit of God, of intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble impiety. First, such as thinke they please God if they serue him by halfes, performe some things, but not all according to the lawe

of the Lord: Halfe prayer, halfe preaching, halfe Sacrament, halfe Saboath, will serue their turne in their demi-deuotion; but <hi>Ioseph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> performed all. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, such as do performe a seruice, but after their own fashion, vsing for doctrines of the Lord, mens traditions in a voluntary religion,<note place="margin">Col. 2.22.23.

                     <p>The second thing clearing the humanity and incarnation of Christ, is his persecution in this, that they <hi>Returned into Galily, to their owne city Nazareth:</hi> Imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereby, that immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he was presented in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and his mother was purified, according to the law: and hauing

                     <p>Now must they to Aegypt, ere they might returne into Galily, to their owne City Nazareth. This their flight foreseene of the Lord, and foretold to <hi>Ioseph,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 2 13.</note> is set down at large by <hi>Matthew</hi> in the second chapter of his Gospell; but omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Luke</hi> in this place.</p>

                     <p>So is the body of all the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures soulelesse and imperfect, if you stand vppon any one booke, without the supply of all; but liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

absolute, and perfect in their ioynt and iust proportion, like the vision of wings, wheeles &amp; beasts, mentioned in <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer goe but as they are chained,<note place="margin">Ezec. 1.9.</note> linked, and locked together.</p>
                     <p>The vse then is this: that if you wil vnderstand one Scripture, you must examine it by another, and if you will bee ignorant in none, you must giue your diligence to the reading of all, according to that of Christ, <hi>Search the scriptures,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ioh. 5.39.</note>

                     <p>Some are of opinion, to whom I assent not, that <hi>Ioseph</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> after they had performed the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of purgation, returned to <hi>Bethlem,</hi> that they might dwell there; but it was not to be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that <hi>Ioseph</hi> had a dwelling

place there, where hee was so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne, that he could not finde a place to remain in as a guest. And therefore I doe easily graunt, that the iourney into Egypt was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween these, that is, after the puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and presentation, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their returne backe to Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth.</p>
                     <p>So as that which <hi>Luke</hi> sayth, of their dwelling again in their own City Nazareth, was in order of time after their flight into Egypt: which <hi>Matthew</hi> reporteth. <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.19. &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>All to testifie that which was spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the Lord by the Prophet: <hi>Out of Egypt haue I called my sonne.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>First, his subiection to the law.</p>

                        <pb n="134" facs="tcp:3768:74"/>Secondly, his subiection to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution, and flight into Egypt.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, his subiection to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, in that he grew as a child in body, spirit, and grace, both with God and man. Of the two former I haue already spoken, now of the last, if God wil, wherin two things are respectiuely to be considered out of my text.</p>
                     <p>That as the child grew in our flesh, to make him a perfect man, so wee must growe in his faith,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.18</note> to make vs perfect Christians: And that as our humanity was his, to make him the son of man, so his diuinity must be ours, to make vs by prerogatiue the sons of God.<note place="margin">Iohn. 1.12.</note> And as he through our humanity had feeling of our miseries, so we through his diuinity,<note place="margin">2.

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:3768:74"/>
boale, the member from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
                     <p>This child is the boale, building and body; we must grow vp with him till wee come to bee perfect men,<note place="margin">Eph. 4.13.</note> euen vnto the age of the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of Christ: otherwise we are but blasted bowes, pible stones, rotten members, neither fit for boale, building, or body.</p>
                     <p>In that he grew, it proued him a creature of God by generation, of a locall being, subiect to alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, like vnto vs in all things, sin only excepted.</p>
                     <p>In that he grew, it ouerthoweth a creation of Christ, which some vrge without generation; like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that of <hi>Adam,</hi> who was made perfect at the first, as all other creatures were.</p>
                     <p>In that he grew in body, and waxed strong in spirit, it ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throweth the Papists monster of
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:3768:75"/>
transubstantiation, and all power of Priesthood, to make Christ of bread, or of any other matter or mettle; for if he make him, he ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther maketh him a man or a child: if a man at the first, how then did he grow from a child? if a child at the first, how then did he grow to a man? If Christ so made, was a child by generation, then the priest was his father; if by creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then the priest was his God; but he is neither of both, but their breaden Christ by vsurpation, sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the holy places.</p>
                     <p>We say, Christ was made by the powerfull working of the holy ghost, by a perfect generation.</p>
