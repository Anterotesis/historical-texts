            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of God which is tyed to no sort of men, was most commonly poured out upon such as in Scripture are called the Sons, <hi>i.e.</hi> the Disciples of the Prophets, who were trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned up in the Schools of the Prophets, and by the study of the Law, were fitted and disposed for the receiving of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit (what <note n="(h)" place="margin">1 Sam. 10. 11.</note> else is the meaning of that proverb? <hi>Is Saul also among the Prophets?</hi> but that (though it sometimes fell out otherwise <note n="(i)" place="margin">Amos 7. 14.</note> as in the case of <hi>Amos,</hi> who was no Prophet, nor Son of a Prophet, but an Herdsman, and gatherer of Sycamore fruits) it was unusual, that persons never applying themselves to such courses, should be so suddenly and strangely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested with the Spirit of Prophesie?) So I make no doubt nor question at all, but that the Divine grace and blessing, though not tyed to any, doth most usually fall in some special manner upon those Families whose Ancestors have done worthily, and who set themselves after the example of their Ancestors to do worthily in the places where they live. And when all these, Birth and Breeding, special examples be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and special blessings from above, do concur, when Heaven and Earth do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and conspire together as it were in one for their good, they must needs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell in matter of abilities, and have a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence above others in respect of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble qualities.</p>

            <p>The <hi>Natural</hi> is that which is by descent from Parents, by succession from Ancestors; to which one of the three former of those kinds mentioned by <hi>Plato</hi> may be reduced. For whether men descend from those which are good men for their piety, or great men for their rule and authority, or famous men for some special service or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, unless they be such as their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents were themselves; they have onely the matter and not the form, and are heirs onely of a naturall, and no better then a nominal Nobility.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Acquired</hi> is that which is gotten by a mans own vertue and industry, which is therefore called Personal also, because it is the purchase of his own deserts, and not his ancestors glory. And this though it cannot be matched with that, which is both natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral by succession, &amp; personal by acquisition; yet if the natural be not accompanied with vertue, which is the form of Nobility, the personal and acquired must have the prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minency. Now this personal Nobility,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:115967:65"/>
whether taken by it self, or in conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion with the natural, may be considered, either as consisting in moral vertues onely, and such like qualities as are beneficial to the Common-wealth, according to which the Nobility of the Heathen, and such like is to be reckoned: or else in supernatural graces, the fear of God, and true piety, which make for the glory of God, and the good of the Church, according to which Christians are to be accounted noble; and this we say, is the best Nobility. Though the name (there is no doubt) were first imposed upon that which is carnal or civil, and afterward translated to that which is spiritual; yet as in other things of like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, not that which is carnal or civil, but that which is spirituall is best.
