            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>TANGER</hi> (of which you command an Account) was of old ſo various in her <hi>fortunes,</hi> that Hiſtory ſcarce knows in what ſhape to draw her Picture. And whether it happen from the early and frequent change of her <hi>Inhabitants,</hi> or from the want of <hi>Records,</hi> or from her own <hi>great Antiquity,</hi> Hiſtorians ſeem at a ſtand to give a clear account of her <hi>Genealogie. Procopius Caeſarienſis</hi> derives her Pedigree from the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> aſcribing to that <hi>antient People</hi> the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of her <hi>foundation.</hi> But that inquiſitive Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quary had no ſurer ground for this Conjecture, than the two ſuſpected Pillars, found out not far from <hi>Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> which in <hi>Phoenician</hi> Characters are ſaid to have an Inſcription to this purpoſe: <hi>Nos fugimus à facie Joſuae filii Nave.</hi> Others again are of opinion that the Poſterity of <hi>Phut,</hi> the Son of <hi>Cham,</hi> were the firſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:53921:5"/>
of this City and Country, becauſe there is a River ſtill bearing that name.</p>
            <p>But not to ſpend time in Conjectures about her Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal; When <hi>Rome</hi> was famous for Conqueſts, and <hi>Mauritania</hi> was brought under her yoak, <hi>Tingis</hi> (now <hi>Tanger)</hi> was thought worthy to give the name to <hi>Mauritania Tingitana:</hi> And under the Romans was of ſo great eſteem, that <hi>Claudius</hi> made her a Colony, calling it <hi>Traduct a Julia.</hi> When this City had the happineſs to become Chriſtian, it was made a Biſhops <hi>See.</hi> And we read of one <hi>Marcellus,</hi> caſting away his military Girdle for the ſake of Religion, here ſuffer'd Martyrdom in the time of <hi>Diocleſian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the glory of this antient City began at length to decline with the Roman Greatneſs, and to languiſh like many other limbs of that over-grown Empire. For when the <hi>Vandals</hi> broke into <hi>Barbary, Tanger</hi> became their ſlave, and endured their cruel Tyranny, till that great Captain <hi>Beliſarius</hi> forc'd them thence, and reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it to <hi>Juſtinian.</hi> In which happineſs ſhe remained till <hi>Oſman</hi> the third, Caliph of the <hi>Saracens,</hi> conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <hi>Barbary,</hi> took her from the <hi>Romans,</hi> and added her to the Kingdom of <hi>Fez.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Under this ſad change both of Government and Religion, <hi>Tanger</hi> continued, until <hi>Alphonſo</hi> redeem'd her out of the hands of thoſe unjuſt Poſſeſſors, peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled her again with Chriſtians, and made her the Stage of many heroick Actions: his <hi>Incurſions</hi> into the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Country were little <hi>Conqueſts,</hi> frequently baffling the <hi>Moors,</hi> and ſo long ſpoiling their Flocks and Herds, till at laſt enraged by ſuch continual plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, they raiſed a numerous Army, and with thirty ſix Guns (as ſome report) advance to beſiege <hi>Tanger,</hi> but were violently repulſed, ſay ſome; others ſay, fairly
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53921:5"/>
               <hi>treated off</hi> by the <hi>Portuguezes:</hi> In whoſe poſſeſſion (to the envy and anger of <hi>Spain) Tanger</hi> continued, till it became <hi>Engliſh.</hi> The circumſtances of which Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration are ſo well known, that it were ſuperfluous to relate them.</p>
            <p>The Earl of <hi>Peterborough</hi> (her firſt Engliſh Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour) after ſome eaſie oppoſitions, having taken poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of <hi>Tanger,</hi> met with difficulties on all hands: The <hi>Moors</hi> grew jealous of their new Neighbours, chiefly becauſe they were more numerous than their old, and their valour more renown'd. <hi>Gayland</hi> (chief Governour of the adjacent Country) though at firſt he entertain'd the Earl with overtures of Peace, yet he took all occaſions to try the Engliſh metal. Several times he encountred, and overcame ſome of our <hi>unwary parties;</hi> which gave no leſs diſcouragement to ours, than heart to his own Souldiers. But to ſhew how things thrived under that Noble Perſonage the E. of <hi>P.</hi> is not the deſigne of this Paper. But yet the face of affairs was not of the beſt complexion, if you will believe a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at that time writ to <hi>England,</hi> telling us, That the Souldiers were eaten up of wants, cowed with their frequent misfortunes, poſſeſſed with an opinion the <hi>Moor</hi> was invincible: that nothing was ſo terrible to them as an <hi>Alheic</hi> and <hi>Cymiter:</hi> that the Gates had been for a long time lockt up, &amp;c. Victuals, Clothes, &amp;c. ſcarce, and even not to be had, &amp;c. But what relates to the firſt condition of <hi>Tanger,</hi> upon its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming Engliſh, I leave you to collect out of the Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative (you deſire) of the Earl of <hi>Tiveot;</hi> in which, if I exceed the Laws of <hi>Lettering,</hi> your command is my Apology.</p>
            <p>The Earl of <hi>Tiveot,</hi> upon the leaving of <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> where he had been Governour, was by his Majeſty
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53921:6"/>
appointed to go in the ſame Character to <hi>Tanger;</hi> where he arrived <hi>May</hi> the firſt, 1663<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and forgetting the weariſomneſs of a tedious Voyage, and waving the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of <hi>Reception,</hi> the afternoon of his arrival he ſpent in viewing the <hi>ſtores</hi> of <hi>Proviſions.</hi> How he found them, need not be mentioned; for the hungry looks of the Souldiers, and their exclamations for <hi>Pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gut-money</hi> (that was the word) declared, that <hi>Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> for a long time had kept a niggardly houſe; and that either her <hi>Plenty</hi> or <hi>Liberality</hi> had been but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.</p>
            <p>But the provident Earl (remembring how the <hi>Heduans</hi> negligence to bring in Corn for the relief of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Army, had like to have coſt <hi>Caeſar</hi> his fortunes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Helvetians)</hi> had made preventions of the like miſchief; and ſo ordered things, that <hi>Tanger</hi> ſhould ſtill be provided with ſuch conſiderable abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, as that an ordinary accident ſhould not reduce her to want. Which careful foreſight nothing could hinder from being effectual, but the negligence of the <hi>Victuallers.</hi> I examine not the ſtate of other Stores; yet however he found them, his care was to make them rich. And other Commodities which were ſcarce to be purchaſed at any rate, were within a ſhort ſpace after his arrival to be had at very conſiderable prices.</p>
            <p>Every day brought the Earl new troubles; and the more he conſider'd, the more he apprehended the hardſhips of his <hi>New Province;</hi> which made him often proteſt, That if he had foreſeen what he was to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, nothing but the <hi>Command</hi> of his <hi>Prince</hi> could have obliged him to an <hi>undertaking</hi> wherein he was to wear out the remains of his <hi>ſtrength</hi> and <hi>age</hi> in that thankleſs Office, the <hi>mending</hi> of <hi>faults.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He that has ſeen what difficulties accompany the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53921:6"/>
reſtauration of a body to ſtrength, and to ſecure it from relapſing, after ſome emacerating diſeaſe has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced it to a ſort of <hi>breathing Skeleton;</hi> how every ſtone muſt be cut and meaſured, hewn and poliſht, that goes to mend thoſe decays of Nature; and how at laſt any little miſtake may pull down what has ſo long been a patching; he may by ſome faint reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance be able to conjecture how much watchfulneſs and induſtry was neceſſary to recover the health of a <hi>body Military,</hi> whoſe <hi>belly</hi> was ſhrivel'd with hunger, <hi>hands</hi> naſty with idleneſs, and whoſe very <hi>heart</hi> was broken with ill ſucceſs. Beſides, who knows not but that after-games in <hi>Courage,</hi> are as dangerous as thoſe in <hi>Reputation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such was the condition of <hi>Tanger,</hi> that it would ſcarce admit of <hi>conſultation;</hi> ſomething was inſtantly to be done. And the Earl, who had <hi>Tack Time</hi> for his Motto, would not ſuffer a minute thereof to ſlip through his fingers, or the leaſt opportunity to be eaten up of delay. Dangers appeared on all hands; nought heard of but <hi>Anakims;</hi> and ſome, either to diſſemble their own Cowardiſe, or to diſhearten the preſent Undertaking, as likely to diſparage former pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, preach'd up the <hi>Moors</hi> Valour as uncontrou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable, and that their <hi>cunning</hi> was beyond <hi>defeat.</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who rather wiſht the Earl's <hi>ſafety</hi> than his <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> and loved <hi>Tiveot</hi> better than the General, ſtrongly diſſwaded him from going out of the <hi>Gates:</hi> And others again propheſied his coming ſhort home, if he ventured far abroad: Moſt thought the City in no ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity but under Lock and Key; and as men fallen in love with their priſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nothing by them ſeemed ſo much feared as enlargement.</p>
            <p>The Earl gave every ſtory the patience of his ear,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53921:7"/>
and without betraying the leaſt token of <hi>daring conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> or <hi>drooping deſpair,</hi> he began gently to compoſe the affairs of the Garriſon. Firſt he viewed the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his Forces, which with 400 <hi>Recruits</hi> brought with him, would not amount to the number which the <hi>Muſter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>rolls</hi> had promiſed in <hi>England.</hi> A thing that coſt the Earl no ſmall reſentment, who knew the dangers of falſe Muſters, eſpecially where there was no <hi>Fortifications</hi> but <hi>Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond day after his arrival, he reduced the Iriſh Regiments into one, and took care to tranſport the Reformed, having firſt diſcharged their Arrears: His next act of Juſtice (for the former was no leſs to his Majeſty's ſervice) he open'd the City-gates, and in perſon <hi>all alone</hi> took a view of the ground next the Walls, marking the beſt Graſs for Hay, and the fitteſt places to eſſay a Fortification: whence he return'd ſafe with this intelligence, That nothing but Sweat and Bloud was to water his Laurels; that he was to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed with the <hi>induſtry</hi> of the <hi>Ox,</hi> and not with the force of the Lion. The Horſe he commanded out to forage; ſetting others to mow and make Hay; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the want of that proviſion was quickly well ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, and alſo many places made bare, which by tall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Graſs made them more convenient for the Enemies Ambuſh.</p>
            <p>The fourth day after his arrival, having reduced the Engliſh Foot to one Regiment, he marcht them out of the Gates.</p>
            <p>Upon the fifth, being Tueſday (a day <hi>auſpicious</hi> to the Earl, and <hi>ſolemn</hi> to his entrance upon any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable affair) he began a little Redoubt in a place where the Enemy uſed to lay their Ambuſh, and from whence they might command ſome part of the City-Walls.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:53921:7"/>
This Redoubt proceeded ſo well, that within few days it was finiſhed, with Lines and Trenches. In the mean time the Earl in perſon every night laid <hi>Perdues</hi> to prevent Surpriſals; it being the <hi>Moors</hi> cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom to plant their Ambuſcade a little before day. And now began the Garriſon to expreſs their reſolution and courage in undergoing the difficulties and hardſhips of <hi>Military Diſcipline,</hi> not fainting under the tedious travels which attend great and warlike deſigns, until the Earl had finiſhed five Redoubts, and forced <hi>Gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> into a Truce.</p>
            <p>The Roman Empire (ſaith <hi>Appian)</hi> was raiſed to its greatneſs, not by fortune, or good luck, but by Valour, patience of want and hardſhip: And <hi>Tanger</hi> could not have arrived at that State in which <hi>Tiveot</hi> left it, but by Sweat and Watchfulneſs, without yielding to danger, or giving place to Eaſe. The generous di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of his <hi>Officers</hi> and <hi>others,</hi> did much alleviate the Earl's Travels: for they diſputed not his <hi>Orders,</hi> but even ſeem'd to flatter him in an emulous execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Commands, ever praiſing their happineſs to ſerve under a General, who wanted neither Wiſdom nor Juſtice, to value and reward their Merits.</p>
            <p>The firſt Redoubt being finiſhed, about the 7th of <hi>June,</hi> the Earl laid the foundation of a ſecond, more conſiderable for Size, Scituation, and Strength, than the former. In the building of this, he was dayly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted by the <hi>Moors,</hi> who meeting in Parties, gave continual Alarms. And it conduced not a little to the Earls ſucceſs in theſe firſt Eſſays, that <hi>Gayland</hi> was marcht (with the main Body of his Army) againſt <hi>Saly,</hi> which as yet was under the command of <hi>Abdalla Ebn Mahumed Ebn Abebeker,</hi> vulgarly called the <hi>Saint.</hi> But being adviſed of what was doing in the Fields of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:53921:8"/>
               <hi>Tanger, Gayland</hi> marcht back in great haſte, and with all the Forces he could raiſe, advanced toward the Earl, who upon <hi>June</hi> 15. was luckily informed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of by a Negro; who running away from <hi>Gayland,</hi> made <hi>Tanger</hi> his Sanctuary. The Negro's Tydings of <hi>Gayland</hi>'s being in the neighbouring Woods and Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies with his whole Army, was the next day confirm'd by another Moor. Whereupon the General order'd his affairs accordingly, and put himſelf in ſuch a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture as he judg'd fitteſt to receive an Enemy, whom ſucceſs had made confident and hardy.</p>
            <p>The next morning, being Sunday, the Earl (contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his cuſtom) ſtay'd from Church, in expectation of the <hi>Moors:</hi> But that ſubtle wary people would not raiſe their Ambuſhes, laid cloſe to our Lines, till they ſaw our Reſerves drawn off. Nor was this done, till a Party of <hi>Horſe</hi> had firſt diſcover'd the Ground; which returning, confidently affirm'd, <hi>No Enemy was within two miles of the City.</hi> The Earl (truſting the Report) about midday retired to the upper Caſtle; where he was no ſooner enter'd, but the <hi>Moors,</hi> ſwift and ſudden as Lightning, were fallen upon our out-Guards, and begun to ſtorm <hi>Pole-fort,</hi> then but half built; but it was ſo bravely defended with Hand-Granadoes, that the <hi>Moors</hi> were ſoon forced to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake their Attempt. The ground about the ſaid Fort, and the ſeveral Avenues, were thick ſown with Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traps; a Grain which ſeem'd the more ſtrange to the ſhooleſs Moors, in that they reapt it with their feet. The Granadoes and Galtraps ſo cool'd their impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſueſs, that they were wary for the future how they came near the <hi>Forts</hi> and <hi>Lines.</hi> In this firſt Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the Earl, the Enemy expreſs'd great Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution and Courage. One of them (a ſtout brave
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:53921:8"/>
fellow) purſued ſome of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to within forty paces of the Gate, and had not ('tis like) ſtaid there, if not ſtopt by Death. The General would very glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have taken him alive, to know of him what opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or fate made him ſo deſperate, as to throw himſelf into dangers, which in humane reaſon he could not hope to overcome.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Moors</hi> being driven from their Attacque of the Fort, poſſeſſed themſelves of the Lines: fixing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on three Colours, which according to their <hi>Military Laws,</hi> their Souldiers were bound to <hi>defend.</hi> The Earl with ſeveral Officers and Reformades preſſed them out of the Trenches, and with ſuch excellent Conduct managed the <hi>Diſpute,</hi> that in two hours not one of the Enemy could be met with. Few <hi>Engliſh</hi> were this day killed or wounded, but in <hi>running away.</hi> And the <hi>Moors</hi> being very careful to carry off their ſlain, left but ſeventeen behind them. The fight being ended, as too violent to laſt long<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Earl took this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſalute <hi>Gayland</hi> with the following Letter in <hi>Spaniſh.</hi>

            <p>But theſe Overtures of Friendſhip pauſing a while, the Earl in the interim (with ſignal diligence) purſued the Building of Forts. The time he could ſpare from being in perſon at that work, he ſpent in ſetling and compoſing things belonging to the <hi>Town</hi> and <hi>Port.</hi> All emergent differences he decided according to their freſh Circumſtances; which he did with ſuch ſpeed, that Conteſts were as ſoon ended as known; and with ſuch general ſatisfaction, that none diſguſted his <hi>Deciſions,</hi> ſave ſome humourſome Palates, which could reliſh nothing but what they cooked themſelves. But the Earl was not much moved with ſuch Carriage;
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:53921:10"/>
though he would ſoon reſent their diſ-ingenuity, whom he ſaw ready to contradict what was apparently juſt, becauſe it ſuted not with their Caprices.</p>
            <p>And ere I go further, give me leave to ſtep back to <hi>June</hi> the 5th, to acquaint you how at that time <hi>Two Meſſengers</hi> came from <hi>Saly,</hi> ſent by the <hi>Saint</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate the Earls coming to <hi>Tanger,</hi> and to ſollicite his aſſiſtance in relieving the Caſtle of <hi>Saly,</hi> reduced to a want of all ſorts of Proviſions; and to ſettle a fair Correſpondence. One of theſe Meſſengers was a <hi>French</hi> Renegado, of a facetious humour, and quick appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion; the other a ſtrict zealous <hi>Moor,</hi> of a grave and reſerved Carriage, and of a very obliging Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. The ſucceſs of the Earl againſt their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my <hi>Gayland,</hi> gave theſe Meſſengers cauſe of great joy. The ſerious <hi>Moor</hi> would often rebuke the Earl for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing his perſon to ſuch evident hazards. After ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral days friendly Entertainment; at their requeſt, he ſent them back in a Ship of his own, appointing ſeveral Gentlemen to wait upon them to the <hi>Saint;</hi> To whom he made ſuch Preſents as he judged moſt ſuitable to his want. How much the <hi>Saint</hi> was delighted with the Earls generouſneſs, both toward his Embaſſadours and himſelf, you may perceive from this enſuing Letter, Engliſhed out of <hi>Arabique.</hi>

                  <p>Your Meſſengers ſtaid with us for ſome days, till we had performed ſome of their deſires; ſo that we ſend along with them two excellent Horſes, and of the beſt ſort that hath been in our time, one whereof was for our own Riding, and the other is of the ſame breed; likewiſe forty good choice Beaſts, both Bulls and Cows, and a flock of about fourſcore Sheep, as a Preſent to your Excelleney, which out of your Grace and Favour we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire

                  <p>We gave alſo to your <hi>Legates</hi> two ſpecial Horſes, and a few Cattle as the time permitted, and they likewiſe bought ſome Horſes as the time ſerved, and then depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from us well contented.

            <p>The Earl divided himſelf between the Affairs of the <hi>Town</hi> and <hi>Camp,</hi> acting in the one a <hi>Judge,</hi> in the other a <hi>Captain.</hi> Every day brought him from <hi>Gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> a <hi>Preſent</hi> or an <hi>Ambuſh;</hi> and amidſt the little Truces, he ſtill made himſelf fitter for War. There ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared betwixt him and <hi>Gayland</hi> a ſort of <hi>Amicable Hoſtility;</hi> and it was eaſie to conjecture, that nothing but the want of a <hi>handſome reſerve</hi> of Honour, kept them from contracting a Friendſhip. And though the ſtripes both each day received, prepared them more and more for a complyance, yet that which haſtned <hi>Gayland</hi> thereunto, was the Earls ſucceſs on <hi>July</hi> the 16th, which was thus:</p>
            <p>The Earl having at the utmoſt <hi>Lines</hi> placed a (St. <hi>Malo</hi>'s) Guard of Dogs; upon Wedneſday about two
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:53921:12"/>
a clock in the morning, <hi>July</hi> 15. 1663. they diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red an Ambuſh of the <hi>Enemies Horſe.</hi> Upon notice whereof, all the Troopers were ordered to Mount: Eight of which the Earl commanded to ride directly to the place of Ambuſh; himſelf with the reſt being cloſe by to ſuccour them. But it ſo happened, that the <hi>Moors</hi> finding themſelves diſcovered, were already upon the march, and with an <hi>undaunted reſolution</hi> Charged the Earl. The Engagement was very ſharp; and had doubtleſs proved very bloody, if both ſides had not willingly parted upon the appearance of the <hi>Moreſco Foot;</hi> who alarm'd with the noiſe of this Combate, came down in great Numbers from the Neighbouring Hills. Upon this the Earl Retreated, and in all haſt Man'd the five Forts he had erected, furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing them with Proviſions; and commanded the Horſe to Embody within the <hi>Lines,</hi> and to be ready to ſuccour the Forts in caſe they ſhould be Attackt.</p>
            <p>The Enemy preſently poſted themſelves. Thoſe that came againſt the upper Caſtle, having the advantage of a Weſterly wind, ſet the graſs on fire, already ſcorcht with the Sun; the ſmoak of which, ſeconded with a Miſt from the Sea, hindred the playing of our <hi>Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guns;</hi> and gave the <hi>Moors</hi> opportunity to advance un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen, within Musket ſhot of the Walls. But the wind changing to the Eaſt, gave us the advantage it had given the <hi>Moors.</hi> The Enemy as they were wont, fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſeveral of their Colours upon our Lines, which they were ſoon forced to fetch off. About ſix at night their whole Army drew off, and after a <hi>Conſultation</hi> of the chief Officers, <hi>Gayland</hi> inſtantly ſent his Treaſurer with a White Bandrol, offering terms of Peace. The Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer having (according to their manner) in very few words delivered his <hi>Meſſage,</hi> preſently returned, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:53921:12"/>
to come again next morning; which he accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly did, and brought with him a Letter of great Courtiſhip, wherein <hi>Gayland</hi> magnified his happineſs, in that he hoped to have a friendſhip with ſo brave an Enemy.</p>
            <p>A perſonal Interview was concluded to be betwixt <hi>Gayland</hi> and the Earl; only the place was diſputed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Gayland</hi> proffer'd to come into the Town: but to out-do that bravery, the Earl reſolved to Treat with him in the Head of his Army. Which contrary to the Sentiments of his Officers, he did that afternoon. And a Tent being pitcht without the Lines, and furniſht with rich Chairs and Carpets, <hi>Gayland</hi> drew up his Army about it; and the Earl attended with Twenty of his Guards in rich Coats, rode thither to meet him. When he came to the Tent, <hi>Gaylands</hi> Brother was there ready to receive him: after came <hi>Gayland</hi> with his chief Officers. And being now met, (without any Ceremony) they inſtantly tell upon Propoſals of Peace, which <hi>Gayland</hi> promiſed ſhould be effected by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents he would ſend the next day. The Enterview was concluded with a Banquet, and all parted with great ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>The next morning according to <hi>Gaylands</hi> promiſe, Commiſſioners came with full <hi>powers</hi> to conclude a Peace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> On <hi>July</hi> 21. the Articles of Peace were ſign'd by the Earl, who ſent Commiſſionersto have the ſame done by <hi>Gayland</hi> at <hi>Arzila.</hi> The Commiſſioners re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd <hi>July</hi> 23; and on the 26th, after a general Muſter, in the Evening the ſeveral Companies took up their u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual Poſts; and with Small-ſhot and great Guns, the Earl commanded to <hi>ſalute</hi> the Peace: which was alſo done by the Frigats in the Bay. <hi>Gayland</hi> alſo the ſame night cauſed Bonfires to be made upon the more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53921:13"/>
Hills round about. And now nothing appear'd but marks of ſatisfaction and friendſhip. <hi>Gayland</hi> and the Earl continually complemented one another with Letters and Preſents; and affairs were ſo wiſely ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd, that the Engliſh and Moors ſeem'd to differ in nothing but <hi>Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Affairs being now reduced to that condition, which but a few days before could ſcarce have been hop'd for, the Earl prepared to ſee <hi>England.</hi> But by reaſon of ſome intervening buſineſs, he put off his journey until <hi>Auguſt</hi> the 27. 1663. On which day he went aboard the <hi>Foreſight,</hi> which weigh'd Anchor the next Morning. But ere I proceed in the Narrative of the Earl, I muſt not omit to tell you, that betwixt the concluſion of the Peace, and his going to <hi>England,</hi> he took all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities to careſs the Moors; giving leave alſo to ſeveral Gentlemen of the Garriſon to viſit the Country under <hi>Gaylands Seguro.</hi> By which means he became the better acquainted with many things tending to the Intereſt of his Government. He alſo in the interim ſent a Preſent to the <hi>Sheck</hi> of <hi>Anjerah,</hi> who received it with great ſatisfaction, as the following Letter demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, writ to the Earl in <hi>Arabique;</hi> and being firſt made <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> is here Engliſhed.</p>

            <p>But ere I proceed, give me leave to acquaint you with the Earls ſingular carefulneſs to carry an equal hand in all Controverſies that happened betwixt the Chriſtians and thoſe Jews that were reſiding upon the place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He was no ſtranger to the ill nature of the later, and how it was their Intereſt to favour the concerns of the Moors: as being (the moſt of them) born amongſt them, and greatly ſympathized in their Cuſtoms. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, many of them were only come to <hi>Tanger</hi> to Trade, having left their Wives and Children in the <hi>Moors</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions. But beſides that, both by Nature and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, he was inclined to an <hi>Impartial Juſtice;</hi> he knew that to do otherwiſe, would ſoon open the Mouth of a clamarous Jew, loudly to traduce him to the Moors. And thereby inſtil an ill opinion both of his <hi>Perſon</hi> and <hi>Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His ſecond care was to remove from the Moors all <hi>ſuſpicion</hi> of any intended Invaſion of their Country, with which they ſeem'd ſturdily poſſeſſed. To this
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:53921:14"/>
end, he let them <hi>plainly</hi> and <hi>ſincerely</hi> know, That the <hi>King</hi> his <hi>Maſter</hi> had not ſent him to <hi>Conquer,</hi> but to <hi>Rent</hi> their <hi>Land:</hi> That the chief deſign of his being ſent thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, was not to make War, but to ſettle a <hi>Peace:</hi> and to promote ſuch a friendly and ſafe <hi>Traffique,</hi> as might conduce to the advantage of both. By which Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, ſeconded with Practice, the Earl attain'd to ſuch an eſteem with the Moors, that they would name him with a ſort of Veneration. And underſtanding that he was one grown old in Military Attempts, they concluded that he was a perſon <hi>deſtined</hi> for great At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements; and that his very Reputation fought in his Souldiers. Upon his going for <hi>England,</hi> I heard the Illuſtriſſimo's of <hi>Tetuan</hi> paſſionately wiſh his ſpeedy and ſafe return to <hi>Barbary.</hi> Which was alſo deſired by <hi>Gayland,</hi> as you may collect from the following <hi>Letter</hi> ſent by him to the King.</p>

            <p>The Earl being arrived in <hi>England,</hi> he was by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant concerns of his own, invited to take a Journey into <hi>Scotland,</hi> his Native Soil; which journey, as eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing elſe, he performed with ſo great celerity, that he return'd to <hi>Tanger</hi> on the 14th of the following Month, which was preciſely eight days before the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration of the Peace. The ſame Evening that he Landed, he removed not from the Water-ſide at <hi>Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> till the Horſes brought for <hi>Recruits</hi> were boated aſhore.</p>
            <p>The next day he ſaluted <hi>Gayland</hi> by Letter, who up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the receipt thereof, ſent a <hi>Propio</hi> to congratulate the Earls ſafe arrival, and to let him know, how that out of <hi>Civility</hi> and favour to <hi>him,</hi> he had granted the Lieutenant-Governour a continuation of the Peace for two Months, without any variation of the firſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles.</p>
            <p>The Earl return'd <hi>Gayland</hi> thanks; but withal aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured him, That it was not in his power to prolong the Peace beyond the firſt concluſion, unleſs he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to <hi>Fortifie,</hi> as he was ordered by his Maſter. But that in honour to the Lieutenant-Governours A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement, and to ſhow his reſpect to <hi>Gayland,</hi> he would make good every particular of the Articles that were for the Moors advantage.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:53921:15"/>
               <hi>Gayland</hi> here upon askt (and was granted) fifteen days ſpace to conſult with his Grandees, and gave the Earl to underſtand, that during that time he might fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his <hi>Fortifications</hi> without <hi>interruption.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jan.</hi> 23. <hi>Gayland</hi> ſent in his Secretary to let the Earl know, that if he would have the Peace prolong'd, they were to come to New Articles. The Secretary was a Spaniſh Renegado, of a bold, not to ſay inſolent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. He ſpoke highly in his Maſters behalf, and in a braving Language Hector'd the Earl ſo loudly with <hi>Gaylands</hi> Greatneſs and Puiſſance, that he was forced at laſt to bid him tell his Mighty Maſter, that if he came within his Lines, he would ſend him to beg par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for his Treſpaſs of the King of <hi>Great Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fifteen days granted <hi>Gayland</hi> for <hi>Conſultation</hi> being ended, he ſent a Son of the <hi>Sheck</hi> of <hi>Anjera</hi> to confer with the Earl, who told him, the <hi>Mahumedan</hi> Law forbad them to ſuffer the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> to erect Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications in their Country; and that if the Earl would not deſiſt from that work, he was not to expect any longer continuance of the Peace. To which Meſſage the Earl made no other reply, but that the Sword ſhould decide whether <hi>Mahumeds</hi> Law or his Maſters Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders were more powerful: That he would neither take nor give Quarter: That he would obſerve every tittle of the Articles, and ſo lay the breach of Peace at <hi>Gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi> door. And ſo the War was declared by beat of drum through the ſtreets.</p>
            <p>The next day the Earl ſet upon Building of Fort-<hi>Charles,</hi> on the Hill next the Upper-Caſtle; whoſe ſcituation was advantageous, not only to ſecure a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable quantity of ground for the ſervice of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, but alſo to diſcover the Enemy at a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. And if he had lived to compleat what he there
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:53921:16"/>
deſigned, I believe no Force would have overcome it, but that of a Famine. He had ſcarce finiſhed one half Baſtion, when on the laſt of <hi>February</hi> 1663, <hi>Gayland</hi> with his whole Army came againſt it: the Fight laſted two days, in all which time the Trenches were ſo well contrived, that we loſt but one man. On the ſecond days Combat, <hi>Gayland</hi> commanded his Standard to be fixed in the very Mouth of the Fort, and even dared the Earl to touch it. And the greateſt part of the day being ſpent in pelting at one another, in the Evening the Earl commanded a Squadron of Horſe to fetch off the flanting Standard; who having bravely done it, it was ſet up upon the half-Baſtion: which was no ſooner perceived by the Moors, but they immediately marcht off, ſeeming much perplexed at this diſgrace.</p>
            <p>After this the Moors appeared no more, but in ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler Parties<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> On <hi>March</hi> 13, the Earl with his Troops had a ſevere Encounter with ſome of their beſt Cavalry, and was hard put to it to come off with Honour. On <hi>March</hi> 27, 1664. he counter-ambuſht a ſtrong Party of <hi>Horſe,</hi> which was ſeconded with a Reſerve of Foot. After a ſhort diſpute the Moors <hi>ran,</hi> and were purſued by the Earl, until the Woods and Rocks compelled him to deſiſt. Two of their ſlain were brought off, one of which had ſeveral things about him that ſpake him to be a <hi>Perſon</hi> of <hi>Condition.</hi> This happened upon a Sunday: <hi>L. A.</hi> Chaplain to the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon having read Prayers, and preacht in the Generals Tent, (which was never omitted) the Earl commanded the two dead Bodies of the Moors to be decently waſht, and ſhrouded; and ſo laying them on two Biers, ſent them with a White Flag to their Friends. The Earl on Horſeback, and the Troopers in Military Order, atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the ſaid Corps to the very Margent of the ground
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:53921:16"/>
that was granted him by <hi>Gayland</hi> in the time of the Peace, where the Moors with a White Band-roll recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them. They expreſſed great tokens of their thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs for this <hi>Humanity;</hi> by which the Earl (as he deſigned) greatly upbraided that barbarous Butchery exerciſed by the Moors upon the Bodies of thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy <hi>Engliſh</hi> that fell into their hands.</p>
            <p>Theſe Succeſſes of the Earl much abated the Moors <hi>frequency</hi> and <hi>Reſoluteneſs</hi> in Ambuſcades; but had no other influence upon him, ſave the encouraging of his <hi>Cares,</hi> which yet for all this were very much daſht, by a want of Materials to carry on the intended Horn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work, &amp;c. The ſnarling old Duke of <hi>Medina Celi,</hi> angry at, and envying the Earls proceedings, denyed him Pratique in <hi>Spain,</hi> as to the things he moſt need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; which conſtrained him to ſend to <hi>Portugal</hi> for Lime, &amp;c. and though it was there to be had, yet the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance was ſo great and hazardous, that it was very difficult to fetch it. But if he had been ſufficiently furniſhed with Materials to carry on the Fortifications, in a few Months he would have made <hi>Tanger</hi> ſtrong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to defie the <hi>Force</hi> and <hi>Cunning</hi> of the Moors. And beſides that this lack of Lime, &amp;c. hindered the work, it alſo gave occaſion to the Earl to venture too much abroad, and put him upon that fatal Action of <hi>May</hi> the fourth, 1664, the thoughts of which are ſo unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, that you muſt pardon me, if I totally paſs it over in ſilence.</p>
            <p>Thus you receive what you have ſo often requeſted; and what I have writ, is only an innocent Narrative of the more remarkable paſſages betwixt <hi>Gayland</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Tiveot.</hi> They all hapned in the ſpace of ſix Months, the Earl being little longer Reſident in <hi>Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</hi> And if we may divine by what he did in ſo ſhort
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:53921:17"/>
a ſpace, what he would have done had he lived; we may ſafely conclude, he would have made <hi>Tanger</hi> as famous an Engliſh Colony, as it was once a <hi>Roman.</hi> But all was cruſht in his <hi>unfortunate death.</hi> And while I reflect upon that <hi>ſignal cautiouſneſs</hi> he uſed in all other Adventures, I cannot but wonder by what Star he was led to <hi>that</hi> which was his laſt.</p>
            <p>Having now given you a ſhort Account of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of <hi>Tanger,</hi> and of what hapned there upon its firſt becoming <hi>Engliſh,</hi> I leave you to your own <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions.</hi> And ſhall trouble you no further, than with an <hi>intimation</hi> of the Earl of <hi>Tiveots</hi> Opinion of the Town, Fortiſication, and Mole.</p>
            <p>As to the firſt, he thought its Scituation ſo healthy and pleaſant to live in, and ſo advantagious either to annoy or protect all Traffique into the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> that he wondered it had ſo long continued in the lazy poſſeſſion of the <hi>Portuguezes,</hi> and that neither <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> nor <hi>Africk</hi> ſhould attempt its Conqueſt.</p>
            <p>But though he much admired the Scituation of the place, yet he greatly diſliked its Strength: and in the condition he found it, he thought it altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defenſible. For notwithſtanding that the Mole, when come to perfection, would ſecure it on that ſide next the Sea; yet that ſide of the Town next the Land, he ſaw to ſtand in bleeding need of Fortification; on which he was ſo intent, that he ſeemed deaf to all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides. That we call <hi>Charles</hi>-Fort, he intended, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, to make impregnable; and to erect another Fort over againſt it, to agree with it in <hi>Strength,</hi> and to <hi>Communicate. Pole</hi>-Fort he alſo deſigned to be made as ſtrong as the other; becauſe it looks into and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the Town. He likewiſe had begun a Bulwark on that part of the Town next the Sand-hills, which
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:53921:17"/>
if finiſht, would have commanded both them and the Strand towards old <hi>Tingis,</hi> and have alſo guarded the <hi>watering place</hi> for the <hi>Ships.</hi> As to ſmaller Forts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Out-lines,</hi> (of which he had built ſome, and intended more) though he never thought they would be able long to withſtand an Enemy, yet he fore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>ſaw they would ſerve a while to divert him.</p>
            <p>As to the Great and Magnificent Enterprize of the Mole, he judiciouſly approved it: yet ſaw it would be loaden with difficulties, continually ſubject to <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſters,</hi> and that it would exhauſt a vaſt Exchequer. He was not very forward to have the Mole begun, till the Town was ſo well Fortified, as that it might bid defiance not only to the Moor, but every other Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. For he knew the world would grow very jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of ſo great and important a <hi>work.</hi> And what Prince (ſave our own, whom God preſerve) would not labour to have it diſappointed, to prevent that powerful <hi>Influence</hi> which it was like to have upon the moſt advantageous <hi>Trade</hi> in the World? &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Forgive me, Sir, if ſenſe of growing tedious renders me abrupt; And that my love to <hi>Tanger</hi> makes me ſhut up all in this humble requeſt, <hi>viz.</hi> That you would improve your <hi>Poſt</hi> for the preſervation thereof. Which I ſhall not deſpair of, when I ſee a ſecond <hi>Tiveot</hi> ſent to remove all the Scruples of that naturally jealous people, the Moors; by aſſuring them how His Majeſty intends nothing but a juſt, friendly, and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Commerce: and that he is ſo far from taking from them any parcel of their Fields by violence, that he is ready to give them ſatisfaction for ſo many Acres as may ſuffice the Conveniencies of his <hi>City</hi> and <hi>Garriſon</hi> of <hi>Tanger,</hi> and inable him to compleat the <hi>Mole,</hi> and ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Fortifications, &amp;c.</p>
