The evil of their petition for subjecting the libertie of the press to the arbitrariness and will of a few men. III. The Christian equity, that satisfaction be given to the person so notoriously and publickly wronged. Together with the responsatory epistle of the said beacon firers, to the said Mr Goodwin, fraught with further revilings, falsifications, scurrilous language, &amp;c. insteed of a Christian acknowledgment of their errour.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>OOD Reader, I ſhal not impoſe upon ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thy Time, or thy Patience, at preſent: the brief of the Story is this. Six <hi>London</hi> Book-ſellers, whoſe Names thou wilt finde mentioned in the ſuperſcription of the next enſuing Letter, and ſubſcribed to the ſecond, all (as it ſhould ſeem) devout homagers to the Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an fraternity of <hi>Sion</hi> Colledg, not long after the firſt ſitting of the preſent Parliament, preſented to the Lord Protector, and the Parliament, a ſmall Pamphlet, inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled, <hi>A Second Beacon Fired.</hi> In this Pamphlet amongst Errors and Blaſphemies (by them ſo called, and ſome of them, in my judgment, too truly ſuch) they cite ſome words of mine, which, and as, they pleaſe, out of a paſsage of my Book of <hi>Redemption,</hi> leaving out others, which give the ſence and import of the paſſage: Theſe words, thus Sycophantly and traducingly ſevered from their fellows in the ſame Sentence, they preſent to the Lord Protector and Parliament, as containing in them Blaſphemie and Error. It was ſome while after
<pb facs="tcp:114808:3"/>
the preſentment of the ſaid Pamphlet, before I came to the ſight, or knowledg of it. At laſt hearing that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what publiſhed by me was listed in their Muſter-Role of <hi>Hereſies and Errors,</hi> to ſerve the deſign of their Petition for the Reſtraint of the Preſs, as alſo of their no-Chriſtian intendments againſt me otherwiſe, I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed a ſight of the Pamphlet; and comparing the tranſcription, as they had mangled and misfigured it, with my words related unto by themſelves, I found my ſelf moſt notoriouſly wronged and abuſed. Hereupon I wrote and ſent a Letter to the ſaid Gentlemen Book-Sellers, deſiring Christian and equitable reparations (expreſſed in the ſaid Letter) of my Name and Repute, which they had not a little damniſied by that egregious falſification of my words, ſence, and meaning. Theſe Gentlemen, in ſtead of giving me that ſatisfaction, which Christianity and Conſcience required at their hands, return me ſuch an Anſwer in Writing to my Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as if they had taken unto themſelves ſeven ſpirits worſe then that, by which they or whoſoever for them, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited the ſaid Pamphlet, &amp; the falſifications thereof, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drunkenneſs to thirſt, multiplying reproaches, ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, &amp; revilings (as the ten Tribes ſomtimes did their Idolatrous Altars) like the furrows in the Field: and are ſo far from acknowledging any wrong done unto me by miſ-uſing me, and my words, that they juſtifie themſelvs in that high miſdemeanour, and ſeem to think that they do God ſervice in ſtraining the peg of that iniquity yet higher. Notwithſtanding I may (I ſuppoſe) cleerly and fully acquit the ſaid Gentlemen Book-ſellers from the guilt and crime of inditeing, or drawing up, the ſaid reſponſatorie writing: this I judg to be the froath and
<pb facs="tcp:114808:3"/>
foam of another Spirit, which ſome yeers ſince leapt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, and attempted to rend and tear me:</p>
            <p>Sic oculos, ſic ille manus, ſic ora ferebat:</p>
            <p>Such eyes, ſuch hands, ſuch mouth that ſpirit had. Only the ſaid Gentlemen have involved themſelves in the guilt of the un-Chriſtian Contents of the ſaid writing, by conſent, and ſubſcription, and poſſibly by ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitation alſo; although I rather incline to think, that the Penman was choſen and requeſted to the work, not by men that uſe to ſell, but by ſome who are more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently wont to buy, Books. That Motto in their title Page, <hi>For Sions ſake we cannot hold our peace,</hi> whoſe device ſo ever it was, ſeems, by the Contents of the Book, not to be meant of <hi>Sion,</hi> in the common ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation of the word, <hi>viz.</hi> as it ſignifies the Church of God, but rather of <hi>Sion</hi> Colledg in <hi>London.</hi> For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is that the Book or Pamphlet is not calculated with any relation at all, except it be that of oppoſition, to the Intereſt of the Church of God; but moſt exactly for the Intereſt of <hi>Sion</hi> Colledg and her children. Doubtleſs whoſoever was the Epistler, or Enditer of the ſaid Anſwer to my Letter, might have ſtood in the High Priests Hall without danger: his ſpeech would never have bewrayed him to have been of <hi>Galilee.</hi> I have, in the days of my Pilgrimage, both ſeen, and heard of many Writings fraught with much more then enough of that which is vile, and ſinfully extravagant in men: but to this day never did mine eye ſee, nor mine ear hear of, nor will it eaſily enter into my heart to beleeve, that ever there was any Piece (for the inches of it) fuller of that which is un-Chriſtian, yea, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-like, as of moſt notorious and broad-fac'd untruths
<pb facs="tcp:114808:4"/>
(of ſuch obvious and eaſie an eviction) ſuch bold ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, ſuch childiſh cavils, wreſtings, and perverting of words, ſuch ſcurrilous and unſeemly language, ſuch ridiculous quarrelings and exceptings againſt manifeſt truths, ſuch revengeful ſuggestions and inſinuations (with many other unworthineſſes) then that letter of theirs, here preſented unto the world. It may be justly ſaid unto them, Many Writers have done fooliſhly, but you ſurpaſs them all. Their letter is for a writing, what he was for a man, whoſe character was, <hi>Monſtrum nulla virtute Redemptum A vitiis.</hi> There is nothing ſavorie or Chriſtian in it, to balance in the leaſt the high demerit of it.</p>
            <p>Therefore as <hi>Paul,</hi> having received reproachfull meaſure from men, and thoſe faling in their duty, who ought to have vindicated him, complaines that he was <hi>compelled</hi> himſelf to appear in his own vindication, which otherwiſe he had rather ſhould have been the work of others; in like manner am I compelled once again to take hold of ſhield and Buckler in mine own defence, and either to make, or to keep, thoſe things concerning my ſelf, streight in the minds and thoughts of men, (if it may be) which men of moſt untrue ſuggeſtions have endeavoured to pervert, and make crooked.</p>
            <p>For thine accommodation about the Animadverſions made upon the Book-ſellers Epiſtle, and for the ready application of them in their reſpective branches, to the particular paſſages in this Letter, unto which they (reſpectively) relate, I have distinguiſhed their Letter into twenty two Sections; and again diſtinguiſhed theſe by letters of the Alphabet, where any Animadverſion is particularly made upon them, which readily lead thee to
<pb facs="tcp:114808:4"/>
their appropriate paſſages in the ſubjoyned Animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, characterized by the ſame Letter alſo.</p>
            <p>And becauſe the Gentlemen Book-ſellers, or rather, the ſon of their right hand (their <hi>Amanuenſis</hi>) chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge me to print <hi>Mr Caryls</hi> Letter about the paſſage of their falſification, ſent unto me ſome years ſince, and threaten me that they may do it for me, if I will not, glorying over this Letter, as if the publiſhing of it would confound me, and that the reaſons therein againſt the ſaid paſſage in my book, were ſo ſatisfactory, that they did effectually ſilence me; I have therefore publiſhed both this Letter of his to me, and mine alſo to him, which occaſioned it. The truth is, I had Printed both theſe Letters preſently upon their writing and ſending, but only for a clauſe in <hi>Mr Caryls</hi> Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (towards the cloſe of it) wherein he inſinuates his unwillingneſs to have paſsages of that nature made pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique. So that it was cleerly, and as in the preſence of God, only out of my reſpects to <hi>Mr Caryl,</hi> that I then forbare the printing of them, and ſhould have done ſo ſtill, had not theſe importune Sons of high Presbitery thus reproachfully and triumphingly clamour'd upon me to do it. But as for any reaſons against the ſaid paſſage, either ſatisfactory, or unſatisfastory, that Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter mentioneth none, unleſs it be the aſſerting of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors own judgement and ſome other mens, in the point, in oppoſition unto mine, notwithſtanding any thing offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by me in my book. If either the Book-ſellers, or Book-buyers, judg this a reaſon ſo <hi>ſatisfactory, as ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually to ſilence me for ever,</hi> I cannot but juag them to be of the race and lineage of thoſe, who are owereaſie of ſatisfaction for their own carnal advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
<pb facs="tcp:114808:5"/>
Beſides, of ſuch a reaſon as this, I was not, nor lightly could be ignorant, before <hi>Mr Caryls</hi> Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter came to me.</p>
            <p>Concerning this Letter; with that of the Book-ſell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, I have delivered the Autographons themſelves unto the Printer, that there may be no miſtake in the printing of theſe, unleſs (haply) Typographical, which notwithſtanding, I ſhall endcavour to prevent. For my own two Letters, not having by me the Copies them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which were ſent, but being neceſsitated to make uſe of the rough draughts, poſſibly there may be ſome variation in words, although my deſire ſtandeth, as neer as may be, to varie in nothing, eſpecially with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving notice of the variation, where I have any knowledg of it. This I ſpeak becauſe of the capriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous weakneſs of my Antagoniſts, who on the one hand, are wont to make a long arme to reach pretexts and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of cavilling, and on the other, to complain of the graſhopper as a burthen.</p>
            <p>Such perſonal conteſts as theſe have always been the regret of my <hi>Genius:</hi> and if I thought not that my repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation were, or may be of more concernment unto others, then I judge it to be to my ſelf, I ſhould not move, heart, hand, or foot, to purſue the reſcue; but abandon it to the luſt and folly of thoſe, who have attempted to make a prey and ſpoil of it: But I remember a good ſaying of <hi>Auſtine; For our ſelves</hi> (Brethren) <hi>our conſcience ſufficeth, but for you, our name alſo had need be excellent</hi>

But they ſhall proceed no further; for their folly ſhall be manifeſt unto all men, as theirs alſo was <hi rend="sup">c</hi>.</hi> It is always folly, if not madneſs, which ingageth men in a reſistance of the truth; yea it is one of theſe which cauſeth men to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in this practiſe. By means hereof, it cannot but in time utter and diſcover it ſelf. For that which is active, eſpecially in matters and caſes of publique and weighty conſideration, muſt needs ere long bewray it's <hi>Genius,</hi> nature, and property, at leaſt unto thoſe, who are intelligent and apprehenſive; who being lovers of Truth, and of the peace and comforts of men, cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear the communication of their viſion; and in caſe that which they ſee in this kind, be of any evil or dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous import unto men, they cannot but give the moſt publique notice of it accordingly unto the world. And when the generallity of perſons ſhall he brought to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand and ſee the folly or madneſs of men in any courſe or way of acting, wherein they have been deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and injured by them, they will for the future, abhor their practiſes, and buy their merchandiſe no more.

            <p>GEntlemen; A few dayes ſince, an ill-conditioned Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet, entituled, A <hi>ſecond Beacon fired,</hi> preſented to the Lord Protector and Parliament, fell into my hands. I find all your names ſub-printed to it; but know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your hearts be to it, and were conſenting to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing and preſentment of it; or whether ſome Son of <hi>Belial,</hi> one, or more, taking the advantage (it may be) of ſome of your known weakneſſes, and deſirous to diſport themſelves (and poſſibly others alſo) with your diſparagement, did not, without your privity or conſent, borrow your Names to father ſo hard-favoured a Birth of their own. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why I cannot but a little (at leaſt) demur, whether the piece be yours, or no<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are. 1. Becauſe I find in it moſt un-Chriſtian falſification, even that which ſome would call Forgerie. 2. Becauſe I find in it likewiſe, ſuch counſels offered Petition-wiſe to the Lord Protector and Parliament, under a pretext of Godlineſs, and zeal for <hi>Sion,</hi> which are obſtructive, if not deſtructive, to the proſperity and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign intereſt of both. 3. And laſtly, there is a ſent or ſmell of ſuch a ſpirit, in the ſaid Pamphlet, which teacheth men to ſuppoſe that gain is Godlineſs. I confeſs, that notwithſtanding any perſonal knowledg I have of you, or any of you, the Pamphlet may be yours under all the three characters of unworthineſs now ſpecified: for I know none of you beyond the face, and only one of you, ſo far; yet report hath ſo far befriended ſome of you in my thoughts, that I am hardly able to conclude you all under the guilt of the ſhameful and un<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Chriſtian enormities, which dare look the Parliament and the world in the face, out of thoſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers. For (to touch the firſt in one inſtance only, not
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:114808:7"/>
having opportunity of making proof of more at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.)</p>
            <p>Page 4. (of the ſaid Pamphlet) this abſurd paſſage is charged upon me in my Book of Redemption, pag. 33<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5. <hi>That in caſe any aſſureance of the unchaugeableneſs of Gods Love, were to be found in, or regularly deduced from, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, it were a juſt ground to any intelligent man to queſtion their Authority, and whether they were from God, or no.</hi> Surely they who lay this ſaying to my charge, may with as much honeſty and conſcience, yea, and with as much appearance of truth, impeach <hi>David</hi> as guilty of ſaying, <hi>There is no God, Pſal.</hi> 14. 1. or make the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> to ſay, <hi>Rom. 10. 9. If thou ſhalt confeſs with thy mouth the Lord Jeſus, thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi> For though theſe words are to be found in theſe ſacred<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Authors (reſpectively) yet the ſence they make, otherwiſe then in conſort of the other words re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating in their reſpective periods unto them, was as far from their Authors meaning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the Heavens are from the Earth. <hi>David</hi> was far enough from affirming, that <hi>There is no God:</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> from ſaying, that <hi>If a man ſhall with his mouth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the Lord Jeſus, he ſhall be ſaved;</hi> yet the words, of which both ſayings conſiſt, are extant in their writings. In like manner the Beacon-Firers, whoever they be, you, or others (for I ſhall not charge you with the folly, but upon better evidence) commit the foul ſin of Forgery, in making me ſay, in their<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pretended Tranſcription out of my Book, that <hi>In caſe any aſſureance of the unchangeableneſs of Gods<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Love were to be found, or could regularly be deduced from the Seriptures, &amp;c.</hi> Whereas (beſides ſeveral other words in the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence) they leave out the characteriſtical word, <hi>Such, [any Such aſſureance of the unchangeableneſs &amp;c.]</hi> the word, that is the Heart, Spirit and Soul of the ſentence, that gives a moſt rational and Orthodox taſte and reliſh to the whole Period, and without which, the paſſage contains no more my ſenſe or judgment, then theirs who forged the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription. For my ſence and opinion, which I argue and aſſert in ſeveral places (upon occaſion) in my ſaid Book of Redemption (as <hi>viz. p.</hi> 63. 64. and again, <hi>p. 278. &amp;c.</hi>) cleerly and expreſly is, that <hi>The Love of God, as all his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:114808:7"/>
and Decrees, is unchangeable;</hi> and conſequently, that an aſſureance of this unchangeableneſs is regularly enough deduceible from the Scriptures, and this without any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to their divine Authority; yea rather to the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment and confirmation hereof. So far am I, either from thinking, or ſaying, that if in caſe <hi>any aſſureance</hi> of the <hi>unchangeableneſs</hi> of Gods Love, were to be found in, or could regularly be deduced from the Scriptures, it were a juſt ground to any intelligent man to queſtion their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore they who have accuſed me, eſpecially unto a Parliament, of ſuch a ſaying, have the greater ſin. That kind of unchangeableneſs of Gods Love, the aſſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of which, I affirm, were it to be found in, or regular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be deduced from, the Scriptures, would be a juſt ground to an intelligent and conſidering man to queſtion their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I had imediately before deſcribed, and beſides, ſufficiently explained in the reaſon of the ſaid aſſertion, which I imediately ſubjoyn in theſe words. <hi>Forthat a God, infinitely righteous and Holy, ſhould irreverſibly aſſure the immortal and undefiled inheritance of his Grace and ſavour unto any creature whatſoever, ſo that though this Craeture ſhould prove never ſo abominable in his ſight, never ſo out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiouſly and deſperately wicked and prophance, he ſhould not be at liberty to withhold this Inheritance from him, is a ſaying (doubtleſs) too hard for any man, who rightly underſtands and conſiders the Nature of God, to bear.</hi> From theſe words it plainly enough appears, that it is not <hi>any aſſureance</hi> of the unchangeableneſs of Gods Love, as the Beacon-firers moſt un-Chriſtianly and unconſcionably ſuggeſt to the Parliament, and (indeed) to the world, which I conceive to be a juſt ground to any intelligent and conſidering man to queſtion the Authority of the Scriptures, in caſe it could either be found in, or drawn from them; but <hi>ſuch</hi> an aſſureance hereof, by vertue of which, men turning aſide from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> after <hi>Satan,</hi> from ways of righteouſneſs and of truth, to walk in ways of all manner of looſneſs and profaneneſs, may notwithſtanding with a ſecure confidence, promiſe ſalvation unto themſelves, and that God will never take away his love from them. And whether ſuch an aſſureance of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeableneſs
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:114808:8"/>
of Gods Love, as this, were the Scriptures any ways confederate with it, (which far be it from every Chriſtian Soul to imagine) would not be derogatory or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial in the Higheſt to their Authority, let the Beacon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firers themſelves, or any other perſons, who make any conſcience of putting a difference between God and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, judg and determine.</p>
            <p>If I were a perſon prone to jealouſie, or deſired to make any further breach upon mens reputations, then only for the neceſſary reparations of the truth injured by them, I could ſuggeſt this Query to the thoughts of men; Whether it be not likely, that they, who thus palpably and notoriouſly have falſified the writings of one, have not committed the ſame folly in the reſt of their Tranſcriptions from the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of others? conſidering that it is a ſaying in the civil Law: <hi>He that hath injured one, hath threatened many.</hi> and our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour himſelf; <hi>He that is faithful in that which is leaſt, is faithful in much: and he that is unjuſt in the leaſt, is unjuſt alſo in much, Luke</hi> 16. 10. But no more of this at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
            <p>2. That pernicious Counſel againſt the liberty of Printing and for the ſubjecting of all the learning, gifts, parts and abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of all the worthy men in the Nation, unto the humor and conceit of a few men, who for their comporting with the Religion of the times, ſhall be ſirnamed, Orthodox, which the ſaid Beacon-firers do (in effect) very paſſionately ſuggeſt aud commend unto the Parliament, (<hi>p.</hi> 11.) and which, were it put in execution according to the terms of the ſuggeſtion, would certainly fire both Citie, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, as well as <hi>Beacons,</hi> ſhould (me think) argue the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Beacon</hi> not to be of your <hi>firing.</hi> For you are reputed friends unto <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and to the truth: and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently who can imagine that you ſhould give any ſuch ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, eſpecially unto a Parliament, which is of an obſtructive, at leaſt of a threatening import, to the advancement, and further diſcovery of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> unto the world, yea and which, were it purſued by thoſe, to whom it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is given, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not (in greateſt likelyhood) but ſort to an iſſue or conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, quite contrary to that, whereunto it pretends; I
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:114808:8"/>
mean, to a further propagating and ſpreading of errors and unſound Doctrines and Opinions in the Land; and for the juſtification whereof, there is neither footing nor foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation in the Scriptures. For,</p>
            <p>1. Where doth the Lord Chriſt, authorize any perſon, or perſons, of what capacity ſoever, to authorize or appoint a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny number of men, whom they ſhall pleaſe to call Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox (whether they be ſuch, or no) yea or thoſe, which are ſuch indeed, to ſay unto the Holy Ghoſt; nothing which thou revealeſt unto other men, be it never ſo much for the glorifying of the name of God, of never ſuch worthy and ſacred concernment unto the world, ſhall publickly go forth into the world, unleſſe thou wilt reveal the ſame unto us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, and make us partakers of the Viſion, as well as others? Or doth not the <hi>Beacon-firers,</hi> very paſſionately and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunely tempt men in authority to aſſume unto themſelves ſuch an exorbitant and prodigious power, as this; I mean, to authorize a certain number of men, who ſhall, in their ſence, be Orthodox; though according to the ſence of as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding men, and (probably according) to the truth it ſelf, be as erroneous in their judgement as other men, to word it is (in effect) at ſuch a rate with the Holy Ghoſt?</p>
            <p>2. What ground is there in the Word of God for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſting of <hi>Edmund</hi> (for example) <hi>Arthur,</hi> and <hi>William,</hi> with a <hi>Nebuchadnezzarean</hi> power over the Preſs, to ſtifle or ſlay what books they pleaſe, and what they pleaſe, to keep alive; more then there is for the inveſting of <hi>Joſhuah, Peter,</hi> and <hi>Tobiah,</hi> with the ſame? Or if the three latter be altogether as religious, as judicious, as learned, as the three former, by what rule of equity, reaſon, or conſcience, ſhould they be more obnoxious in their writings, and publication of them, to the cenſure and diſapprobation of theſe, then theſe in their writings unto them? Or by what rule delivered in the Word of God ſhall any man judge the three former, either more religious, learned, or judicious, and ſo more meet for the intruſtment under conſideration, then the latter?</p>
            <p>3. Whether hath the Holy Ghoſt any where characteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, or declared what qualifications are requiſite and meet, to be found in ſuch perſons, who ſhall bee ſet over the Preſs
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:114808:9"/>
and be intruſted with ſuch a ſoveraignty of power, as by which they ſhall be inabled to fill the world with books and writings, for the advancement of their own faction, or for the propogation of their own erroneous, (and perhaps dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous) conceits, and on the other hand, to ſuppreſſe whatſoever ſhall bee prepared by men of ſolid and ſound judgements for the detection, and eviction of their folly in ſuch caſes?</p>
            <p>4. Is not the granting of ſuch a power over the preſſe, as the Beacon firers in the great heat of their devotion and zeal, ſollicite the Parliament to veſt in a certain number of men, ill conſiſtent with the intereſt and benefit of a free Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and of like nature and conſideration with the grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Monopolies? Or may not the Commonwealth deeply ſuffer by the exerciſe of ſuch a power, in being thereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the uſe and benefit of the gifts, parts, experiments, diligence and labours of many her worthy members?</p>
            <p>5. Who are in a regular capacity of power, to nominate and appoint ſuch perſons, to whom the ſaid power over the Preſs ought to be committed? If it be ſaid, the civil Magiſtrate. 1. I would gladly know of the <hi>Beacen-firers,</hi> who hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legated ſuch a power or authority unto him, or in what part of the Word of God, any ſuch power is aſſerted unto him. 2. Whether the ſaid power over the Preſs bee an Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtick, or civil power? If it be the latter, how are men ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part for the miniſtery of the Word of God, and prayer, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of the inveſtiture? If it be the former, how is the civil Magiſtrate in a capacity of conferring it, or inveſting any man with it?</p>
            <p>6. If the Supream Magiſtrate in a State or Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, be allowed a power to inveſt what perſons he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth with ſuch a power over the Preſs, as the <hi>Beacon-firers</hi> demand, is it not to be expected that onely ſuch perſons ſhall be deputed to this truſt by him, which are of his own ſence and judgement in matters of Religion, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently who ſhall comply with a State Religion? And are men of this character competent Arbitrators, between per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of their own party and perſwaſion, and thoſe who are contrary minded to them, in their conteſts about truth and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:114808:9"/>
errour? And in caſe the Magiſtrate himſelf ſhall be unſound in the faith (as men of this Order have no priviledge of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption from errour, more then other men; nay, they are under more and greater temptations, then other men, to be carried aſide in their judgements from the truth) if then (I ſay) the Magiſtrate be of an unſound judgement in things appertaining unto God, ſhall not our Preſs-Maſters be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound alſo; and conſequently, ſhall we not have errour countenanced and ſet at liberty, and truth impriſoned, and condemned to ſilence and obſcurity?</p>
            <p>7. Shall not ſuch men who ſhall undertake the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of ſuch a power, by which the Preſs ſhall bee ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſpeak when they pleaſe, and be compelled to keep ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence when they pleaſe likewiſe, run an extream hazard of fighting againſt God? Or to reject and repel the Holy Ghoſt, when he ſhall at any time be deſirous to come forth by the way of the Preſs, into the world with any new Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of Truth, is this any thing leſſe (being interpreted) then a fighting againſt God? Or do they, who know but in part, univerſally or infallibly know, when the ſpirit of truth, and when the ſpirit of errour is deſirous to come abroad into the world?</p>
            <p>8. Doth not a power of gagging the Preſs, when men pleaſe, carry a dangerous Antipathy in it to that Evangelical charge, or precept, impoſed upon all men, whereby they are commanded by God to try all things, and particularly to try the ſpirits, whether they be of God or no? For if ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things, or many ſpirits of Doctrines be not ſuffered to come to the knowledge of men, how ſhall they be able to try them? Do not then the Beacon-firers, by their counſel given to the Lord Protector and Parliament, for the reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Preſſe, render that great commandement of God for the trial of all things, of none effect?</p>
            <p>9. And laſtly, That great evill of the infectious ſpreading of errours and hereſies in the Nation, the prevention where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the ſaid advice given touching the Preſs, pretendeth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, is not likely to be at all prevented, but promoted ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by it, ſhould it he followed and put in execution. For,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:114808:10"/>1. (As the ſaying is) <hi>Quod licet ingratum eſt, quod non licet, acrius urit.</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>What Laws permit to do, to do</l>
                  <l>Men do not much deſire:</l>
                  <l>But what reſtrained is, to do</l>
                  <l>They burn as hot as Fire.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf ſaith; That <hi>Sin taking occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion by the commandement, wrought in him all manner of concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence. For without the Law, Sin is dead.</hi> Rom, 7. 8. And little queſtion there is, but that in caſe the liberty of the Preſs ſhall bee by any law reſtreined, they who otherwiſe would be but indifferent whether they publiſhed in Print their weak, it may be their erroneous and wicked concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or no, will be hereby admoniſhed and provoked to do it, though more ſecretly. Stollen Waters are ſweet.</p>
            <p>2. In caſe they ſhall by any ſuch law of reſtraint, be kept from venting their fond and uncouth notions by the Preſs, or ſhall by the Maſters of the Preſs bee prohibited the Printing of them, they will by way of indignation and revenge be ſo much the more zealouſly diligent and intent to propagate them underhand, and privately; and probably gain many more diſciples this way, then by the other. <hi>The prophane and vain babling of</hi> Hymeneus <hi>and</hi> Philetus <hi>fretted like a Canker,</hi> although they wanted the opportunity of a Preſs for their propagation.</p>
            <p>3. When the generality of people ſhal underſtand that the publiſhing of ſuch or ſuch notions, or Tenents, hath been reſtrained and obſtructed by thoſe, who ſhall exerciſe an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary dominion over the Preſſe, it will (in reaſon) both occaſion them to think the better of them, or at leaſt to think that there is ſomewhat more then ordinary in them, in one kind, or other; and conſequently, they will be awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and ſtirred in their ſpirits to inquire more narrowly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them, and to acquaint themſelves with them. So that in this reſpect alſo there is little like to be gained towards the ſuppreſſion of errors and hereſies, by ſubjecting the Preſſe unto a Teſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:114808:10"/>4. The ſetting of Watchmen with authority at the door of the Preſſe to keep errors and hereſies out of the world, is as weak a project and deſign, as it would be to ſet a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of armed men about an houſe to keep darkneſſe out of it in the night ſeaſon. For as the natural darkneſſe cannot be prevented, or diſpelled, but by the preſence of light, nor nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth there to be any thing, either for the preventing or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling it, but light onely: So neither is it poſſible either to prevent, or to remove, errors and hereſies, which are ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual darkneſſe, but onely by ſhining ſpiritual light in the hea<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

            <p>5. Errors and Hereſies, the leſſe they play in ſight, are like to defend themſelves upon terms of more advantage, and to lengthen out the daies of their continuance amongſt men for the longer time. For by this means they are kept from the clear and diſtinct knowledge of judicious and learned men, who otherwiſe, being both able and willing to perform ſo worthy a ſervice both unto God and men, would publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly detect and confute them. And I verily beleeve that the printing of <hi>J. Biddles</hi> moſt enormous and hideous notions, and conceits about the nature of God, and ſome other very weighty points in religion, will bring the judgement of <hi>bloody and deceitfull men upon them,</hi> which (according to <hi>Davids</hi> Award) is, <hi>not to live cut half their daies.

Nor do the <hi>Beacon-firers</hi> argue like worthy men, when from the numbers of unworthy books printed, they infer the number of buyers, and from hence conclude the number of perſons, either infected with, or inclined to, the errors contained and pleaded for, in thoſe books. For who
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:114808:11"/>
noweth not that many men, eſpecially Miniſters, Schollars, and learned men, buy many books, not with any intent to ſay as they ſay, or to ſide in opinion with their Authors, but partly to inform themſelves concerning the ſpirits that come abroad into the world, partly to rebuke and confute them upon occaſion, in caſe they ſee cauſe for it?</p>
            <p>6. (And laſtly for this) The Goſpel, and the truth never flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed, proſpered, &amp; triumphed at an higher rate in the world, then when errors and hereſies were no otherwiſe reſtreined, puniſhed, or oppoſed, then by thoſe ſpiritual means, which God himſelf hath ſanctified and preſcribed in this behalf, as <hi>viz.</hi> by the effectual preaching of the Goſpel, the ſtopping of the mouths of the gain-ſayers of truth by arguments of convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſolid demonſtration; by caſting out of their reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive Churches, and delivering up unto Sathan, all ſuch, who after admonition and conviction, ſhall perſiſt in their errors, and in the teaching and ſpreading of them. But certainly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all the means, Offices, and Officers, which the Lord Chriſt hath directed or eſtabliſhed, <hi>for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Miniſtery, for the edifying of the body of Chriſt, till we all come in the unity of the faith, and acknowledgement of the ſon of God, unto a perfect man, &amp;c.</hi> neither reſtraint of printing, nor Licenſers of the Preſſe, are to be found; theſe are Apocryphal, both Names and Things.

               <head>Mr. <hi>Goodwins</hi> Animadverſion, <hi>I.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>(a) Your weakneſſe may be as readily acknowledged by you, as it is ſcornfully derided by me, and yet never be acknowledged by you at all, (yea as far as by the Contents of your Letter can be reaſonably judged, you are too far hardned in a conceit of your ſtrength, ever to acknowledge your weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.) For your charge here is but an unchriſtian calumniating of my Chriſtian intentions towards you, in remembring you privately of your weakneſſes: nor do my words import any ſcornfull deriding, either of them, or of your perſons for them. Your Prophet and <hi>Amanuenſis</hi> (the Compiler of your
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:114808:13"/>
Letter) hath drawn you into a ſinfull ſnare in the very begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, (as he hath done unto twenty more in the ſequel) by occaſioning you to ſubſcribe ſuch an inſinuation of untruth.</p>
               <p>(b) The word, <hi>Sophiſter,</hi> in the canting dialect of high Presbytery, commonly ſignifies, a perſon who levies ſuch Arguments, whether from the Scriptures, or otherwiſe, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any of their Tenents, which their Prophets cannot tell how to anſwer. In this ſence of the word, the <hi>Libertines, Cyrenians, Alexandrians,</hi> &amp;c. might have termed <hi>Stephen,</hi> a <hi>Sophiſter,</hi> becauſe <hi>they were not able to reſiſt the wiſdome and ſpirit by which he ſpake, Act.</hi> 6. 9. 10. In like manner the <hi>Jews</hi> at <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> might have called <hi>Paul</hi> a <hi>Sophiſter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>he confounded them, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> argumentatively pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,</hi> or inforcing by argument, <hi>that this (Jeſus) is very Chriſt, Act.</hi> 9. 22. The Prophets of the ſaid ſchool of high Presbytery have attempted to impoſe a like exotique ſence upon ſeveral other words of frequent uſe amongſt us. They make the word, <hi>Orthodox,</hi> to ſignifie, <hi>a man of their judgement,</hi> whether rotten, or ſound: the word <hi>Heteredox,</hi> or <hi>erroneous,</hi> a perſon differing in judgement from them, though in the truth: the word <hi>Blaſphemy;</hi> that which contradicts any of their notions or conceits about the Nature, or Attributes of God: this complex, the <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> with them ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, that Syſteme or body of Doctrine, which they teach: the word, <hi>Arminian,</hi> or <hi>Pelagian,</hi> ſignifies ſuch a perſon, who holds that <hi>Chriſt</hi> taſted death for every man, in the Scripture ſence: and again who holdeth in the Scripture ſence, that God would have all men to be ſaved, and none to periſh. By <hi>Socinian,</hi> they frequently underſtand a perſon that will not bruit it in matters of Religion: by <hi>proud,</hi> they ſometimes mean, him that will not ſtoop to the high Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian yoke, or to their judgement in other things. My mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is not, that they intend or deſire; that the words or terms ſpecified, ſhould in their writings, or teachings, be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the ſences reſpectively mentioned; but that truth cannot ordinarily be made of what they write or teach, when any of the ſaid words are uſed by them, unleſſe they be taken and underſtood in the ſaid reſpective ſignifications. And by their uſage of theſe, and ſeveral other words, upon the terms expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:114808:13"/>
they have wretchedly abuſed the ſimple and over-cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous world. But I confeſſe, that if I be <hi>learned,</hi> (as you pleaſe to ſtile me in the ſuperſcripcion of your Letter) and yet a <hi>Sophiſter</hi> (in the true and known ſignification of the word) my condemnation is the greater, and equal to a rich mans, who is a common theef. But it may be, that was your complement, and this your heart.</p>
               <p>(c) Thoſe <hi>Babes</hi> unto whom <hi>God graciouſly revealeth himſelf,</hi> are not perſons full of malice and revenge, or who will juſtifie themſelves in ſcandalous and publick miſdemean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, nor who are alwaies learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth; but ſuch who are <hi>babes</hi> or children, in malice, who are tractable, and teachable, and eaſie to be intreated by the truth, though otherwiſe they be men in underſtanding.</p>
               <p>(d) This is an untrue charge, like unto many others in your Epiſtle. I do not affirm or ſay, that <hi>your Book was written by a Son of</hi> Belial; but onely ſuggeſted that ſuch a thing might poſſibly be, and that you might be abuſed in it, as well as my ſelf.</p>
               <p>(e) Whereas you ſeem to extenuate the crime of your fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſification, by ſaying, becauſe <hi>there was one little word S<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>CH, omitted, &amp;c.</hi> I confeſſe the word, <hi>Such,</hi> is no word great of bulk, or body: but it was the ſpirit and life of that ſentence, of which you make a dead corps, by ſeparating it from it, and without which, as ſpecificating that aſſurance of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeableneſs of Gods love, of which I there ſpeak deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minately, you repreſent me as ſpeaking that, which is further from my thoughts, or ſence, then poſſibly from your own. And for you to pretend that it is <hi>one little word omitted,</hi> as if it were the leſſe in conſequence, becauſe it is <hi>little</hi> in bulk, or quantity, doth it not bewray your great inconſiderateneſs? The words, <hi>no</hi> and <hi>not,</hi> are each of them ſomewhat leſſe then <hi>Such,</hi> yet he that ſhall leave them out of nine of the ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God, ſhall of ſo many holy and juſt Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, make alike number of horrid ſuggeſtions of the Divel. Beſides the difference between <hi>Sibboleth</hi> and <hi>Shibboleth,</hi> conſiſting onely in an aſpiration, which as <hi>Grammarians</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us, is leſſe then a letter, is farre leſſe then that between,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:114808:14"/>
                  <hi>any aſſurance,</hi> and <hi>any ſuch aſſurance;</hi> yet did it coſt many thouſand men their lives <hi>a:</hi> But beſides the <hi>little word S<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>CH,</hi> you <hi>omit</hi> many others in your ſaid Tranſcription,<note place="margin">Judg. 12. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>viz.</hi> all theſe (in the beginning of the period) <hi>yea (that which is yet more) I verily beleeve;</hi> which words have ſome conſiderable influence upon the ſentence. Yea the truth is, had you put in all theſe, and the <hi>little word, S<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>CH,</hi> too, unleſſe you had moreover interpreted my meaning in this word, which you might and ought to have done, from what I had ſaid before, and from what follows after, you had not dealt Chriſtianly or fairly in the tranſcription. For to take a ſentence out of the midſt of a diſcourſe, the meaning and right underſtanding whereof depends upon what goeth before, and what comes after, is not to repreſent the mind or judgement of the Author in ſuch a ſentence, but with ambiguity, and with the greateſt probability of miſtake. Therefore whereas in your words immediately following, you go about to juſtifie your ſelves from the crime of falſifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in any degree, the very certain truth is that you are falſifiers in a very high degree.</p>
               <p>(f. g) It is indeed a <hi>righteous Providence,</hi> that I ſhould accuſe you of <hi>falſification:</hi> I beleeve that God put it into my heart to do it, for the manifeſting of your unworthineſs, firſt privately unto your ſelves; and then, upon your obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and impenitency, unto the world. But that I ſhould do it upon the terms aſſerted by you, is no <hi>Providence</hi> at all, but a broad-faced untruth affirmed by you, and ſuch an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation from you is indeed to be <hi>admired.</hi> For whether I be a falſifier or no, (which ſhall be put to the trial anon) it is as certain as certainty it ſelf, and hath been already proved in the ſight of the Sun, and above all contradiction, that you are falſifiers, according to your charge: Therefore not <hi>Joſeph</hi> with his chaſtity, but <hi>Joſephs</hi> Miſtreſſe with her <hi>wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſſe,</hi> is your parallel. You lay claim to innocency, as <hi>Saul</hi> did to obedience, when the Prophet <hi>Samuel</hi> charged him notwithſtanding with <hi>rebellion. 1 Sam.</hi> 15. 20, 23. And he that taught you to talk of <hi>admiring</hi> that which you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe, as <hi>a righteous Providence,</hi> taught you to ſpeak pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanely, and not as men awfully ſenſible of the Majeſtique Holineſs and power of God.</p>

However it had been requiſite for you, upon ſuch a charge as this, to have directed me where I ſhall find the judgement of the reformed Churches in the point, related in conformity to your ſence and deſire (for I am far to ſeek in this) that ſo I might have compared my report hereof, with the ſaid judgement declared and laid down by theſe Churches themſelves.

               <p>We have heard of ſome <hi>Arminians,</hi> who never did read <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> himſelf, but were wont to read <hi>Calvins</hi> opinion in a Jeſuite, and take it for granted that their brother Jeſuite was to be truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: We fear that you may be baptized into the ſame ſpirit of gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe (<hi>a</hi>) You put the poor Proteſtant in a Bear-skin, and then ſet the dogs upon him, that you may diſport your ſelf and your Confederates with that Tragick Comedy.

               <p>(a) I can deliver you, or, if you pleaſe, you may (I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) with ſome pains deliver your ſelves, from this fear con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning me. For in my reading I never met with any of thoſe citations from <hi>Calvin,</hi> on which I inſiſt in any of my writings, in any Jeſuit whatſoever: and I beleeve that you may travel a long journey in reading theſe Authors, before you meet with any of them. You ſpeak ſo many untruths, and theſe fully known unto me for ſuch, in this letter, that I know not how to beleeve you, when you ſay, <hi>We have heard of ſome Arminians, who &amp;c.</hi> I much doubt whether ever
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:114808:16"/>
you heard of any ſuch or no; eſpecially from any Informer worthy credit. I fear you pin your Faith upon the ſleeves of many, who (after the manner of the falſe Prophets of old) <hi>make</hi> you <hi>glad with lies.</hi> You make the <hi>Arminian,</hi> brother to the <hi>Jeſuite;</hi> but the kindred is much neerer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Jeſuite,</hi> and the <hi>Black-Friars.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(b) Here again, you only vary the phraſe; but pour out your High-Presbeterian ſpirits in the ſame ſhameleſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths, with which you ſtained both your credits and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences at once in the former Section. You and your <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies</hi> to uſe a word of your own) are they, who put not <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> only, but many the dear children of God them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into the <hi>Bears-skins</hi> you ſpeak of, and then do as you ſay. As for me, I do not remember that I any where make uſe of any <hi>Bears Skin,</hi> but what I have pluck'd off from the backs of thoſe, whom I put into them. Nor do I <hi>ſet the dogs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any poor Proteſtant,</hi> unleſs it be upon my ſelf, and thoſe few friends (by you termed <hi>Confederates</hi>) which God hath given me: againſt theſe I have exaſperated and enraged, you know who, and how. But neither I, nor any of my <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates</hi> (as far as they are known to me) are wont to <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port</hi> our ſelves with any mans weakneſs, or ſhame. The truth in this point, as in twenty others in your Letter, is not at all beholding to you for your courteſie in ſparing her.</p>
               <p>You need neither crave <hi>leave,</hi> nor take <hi>leave,</hi> to <hi>tell my Friends,</hi> that <hi>they, who are falſe accuſers of the Brethren, are Sons of Belial:</hi> they are inſtructed in this truth to your hand: and by the light of it they are able fully to diſcern, who, and what manner of perſons you are. If your meaning be to reflect upon me as <hi>a falſe accuſer of the Brethren.</hi> you act like him, who compaſſeth the Earth to and fro, to draw men into the ſame condemnation with himſelf: You will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be able to prove that I ever <hi>accuſed</hi> any man <hi>falſely,</hi> much leſs a <hi>Brother.</hi> Therefore conſider in the fear of God whoſe Sons you make your ſelves by this charge.</p>
               <p>Thoſe <hi>who beleeve as the Church</hi> with me <hi>beleeveth,</hi> beleeve as the Scriptures teacheth you, and all other men to beleeve: and this you may, through the long ſuffering and bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of God, come to know in time; although the truth
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:114808:16"/>
is that you deſperately obſtruct your way to the knowledge of the truth, by entreating thoſe ſo unworthily, who deſire to make you partakers of this happineſs with themſelves. But me thinks you of all men ſhould not diſparage men for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving as their Church beleeveth, who ſuffer your Claſſique and Synodical Paſtors to exerciſe what dominion over your Faith, they pleaſe.</p>
               <p>(c) If by my <hi>Libels,</hi> you mean my little Books (for other <hi>Libels</hi> of mine, neither you, nor I, know any) you commit the ſin of <hi>Falſification, in adjuncto,</hi> in calling them, <hi>blaſphemous.</hi> Nor need I at all be troubled for being charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> by the ſons of High Presbitery; for was not the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> himſelf, <hi>Bleſſed for ever,</hi> charged with the ſame crime by men of a ſympathizing ſpirit? <hi>Then the High Prieſt rent his clothes, ſaying, he hath ſpoken blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy: What further need have we of witneſſes? Behold, now ye have heard his Blaſphemy. Mat.</hi> 26. 65. Be you more confident, if you can, or more zealous in the expreſſions of your confidence, that there is <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> in my Books, then the High Prieſt with his Aſſociates were, that that Lamb of God <hi>blaſphemed.</hi> Nor doth Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> in any of his Books <hi>maintain the Apoſtafie of the Saints;</hi> but condemneth it, as a moſt hideous ſin. Or if your meaning be, that in ſome of his Books he evinceth by the Scriptures, by arguments im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable, by Authorities numerous (and theſe of the beſt) by frequent experiments, a poſſibility of the Saints Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing, I ſubſcribe the charge, and ſhall not put you to prove it. In the mean time, whether <hi>Calvin</hi> doth not <hi>maintain the Apoſtaſie of the Saints,</hi> as well as Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> let him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf be conſulted in thoſe few places and paſſages in his writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which are tranſcribed by me, <hi>Page</hi> 387. 388. 389. of Redemption Redeemed. Therefore here again you are out of the way of ſpeaking truth.</p>
               <p>(d) Who you mean by <hi>S<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>CH Apoſtate Saints,</hi> (You <hi>remember the word S<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>CH,</hi> to very little purpoſe here, for you had ſpoken of none before) and <hi>who,</hi> you ſay <hi>it is no wonder if they be enſlaved in journey-work to Apoſtate Angels,</hi> when you tell us, it is like we may conſider of the ſaying: mean while it ſhall paſs for a <hi>nihil ſignificat,</hi> and ſo eſcape
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:114808:17"/>
upon better tearms then all your Letter beſides. Onely I cannot but <hi>wonder</hi> a little, that <hi>YO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                  </hi> ſhould talke: of <hi>S<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>CH Apoſtate Saints,</hi> who deny all poſſibility that <hi>Saints</hi> ſhould turn <hi>Apoſtates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(e) I have more need to put on bowels of pitty, then <hi>arme my ſelf with patience,</hi> to hear you tell a ſtory, with a conceit of lifting up your cauſe to Heaven by it, of which firſt you have no knowledge whether a word of it be true, or no: Secondly, which, if it were true from firſt to laſt; would rather be a blot and prejudice to your cauſe, then any matter of honour. For firſt, If you remember who made King <hi>James,</hi> the Defender of your Faith, you have ſmall cauſe to like your Faith the better for his Defending it. Secondly, <hi>Nero's</hi> hatred and enmity to the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion, turned rather to a Teſtimony unto it, then to any matter of diſparagement, or diſrepute. But you are (I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) of that generation of men, who love to be of the Kings Religion, be He, or it, what they will. I wiſh for your ſakes, that your <hi>honeſty</hi> may turn to as good an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count unto you before God another day, as that in my <hi>Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Bertius</hi> (as you call him) which your ſtory calls kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very. And as for the <hi>Hanging</hi> you ſpeak of, I beleeve that ſome of your Arch-Teachers (I will not ſay the Architect of your Epiſtle-Fabrique) for <hi>Carolizing,</hi> and <hi>Scotizing,</hi> and playing yea and nay with the Parliament, was far deeper in the merit of ſuch a penance, call it by the name of <hi>knave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> or what you pleaſe, then <hi>Bertius<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

With ſuch Proteſtants, who thus conceive of Gods <hi>Election unto Faith and Godlineſſe, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance in them,</hi> I fully concur in judgement ſo far. If your Prophets tell you, that there are no Proteſtants of this judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they either bewray their ignorance herein, or a much worſe principle.</p>

Whereas you menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another promiſe in theſe words, <hi>I will not depart from you,</hi> I find it not, at leaſt in your terms, in all the Scripture.

               <p>(d e) Your <hi>Edmund, Arthur,</hi> and <hi>William,</hi> may very probably maintain ſuch an <hi>unchangeableneſſe,</hi> as you have deſcribed; for I think that in many points they maintain they know not well what.

For according to the beſt conſtruction, among many, that can be made of your words, I aſſert it, as well as you. The men you ſpeak of may be <hi>Proteſtants</hi> at large, but this is no character of their Orthodoxiſme. Beſides concerning that unchangableneſs, which, I ſuppoſe, you would deſcribe, if you knew how, the publick confeſſions, of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Proteſtant Churches do manifeſtly contradict it, as you may inform your ſelves, if you pleaſe, by a peruſal of <hi>pag.</hi> 394 of my <hi>Redempt.

               <p>I am both able, and ready thorough the grace of God, to make good the <hi>Aſſertion</hi> you ſpeak of, not onely againſt you, who I fear had rather truſt men with your Religion, then with your books, but againſt him alſo in whom you ſo much glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, yea let him take unto him Dr. <hi>Kendal,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> the one for his right hand man, and the other for his left, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with a <hi>Totquot</hi> of as many as you count pillars of your cauſe.

to the plain, and beſt known, ſignification of the words and phraſes therein, amounts to nothing more, or leſſe, or worſe, then this, <hi>viz.</hi> that if there were any thing to be found in the Scripture, which rightly underſtood, ſhould repreſent God as unholy, unjuſt, a lover of wickedneſſe, a reſpecter of perſons, or ſhould charge him with any thing contumelious or reproachfull, to the moſt tranſcendent excellency and perfection of his being, it were a juſt ground to any intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent man to demur about their authority, and to bethink himſelf again and again, whether they proceeded from God himſelf, or no.

Whereas you imperiouſly demand of me, <hi>Why I do not anſwer his challenge:</hi> Why do you not ask your great Champion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Doctor <hi>Owen,</hi> why he hath not all this while <hi>anſwered</hi> Mr. <hi>Horn?</hi> As Charity, ſo Diſcipline, ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin at whome.

                     </gap>, Open doore,</hi> is too hard for Doctor <hi>Owen</hi> to ſhut, and his moſt ſatisfactory anſwer would be, to acknowledge as much. If he would make this Anſwer, he ſhould deſerve the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of a, <hi>recte reſpondes.</hi> But my <hi>Anſwer</hi> to you upon this queſtion, is, that I have publiquely engaged my ſelf, (death, ſickneſs or other occaſional intruſions not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting me) to anſwer more conſiderable men, and more conſiderable Arguments, then he, or his, are <note n="a" place="margin">See the 26. and laſt Chapter of my Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note>. It is meet that his betters ſhould be ſerved before him. Beſides ſome of his own judgement in the controverſies, have no ſuch opinion of what he hath written, as to think that it needs much anſwer. The reaſon hereof I conceive to be, becauſe his Anſwers (more generally) ſtand upon ſuch odd, uncouth, wild, and reaſonleſs principles and notions, in which the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:114808:27"/>
generality of his own Party, can neither find ſap, nor ſavor, nor well tell what to make of them. Yea (if all hearſays be Orthodox) Mr. Vice-Chancellor himſelf, his Co-adjunctor againſt the Truth, hath notwithſtanding pull'd in his Horns again, which he put out to ſuch a length in his Quaint En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comiaſtique of him, prefixed before his former Book, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, reſerving (as it ſeems) upon better ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, his high thoughts, for his own writings. But the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration now mentioned, in reference to Doctor <hi>Kendal,</hi> is another reaſon, why an anſwer to his Book may be ſpared without any great detriment or loſs to the cauſe. Yea upon the ſame account, an anſwer given to it, though never ſo ſatisfactory and full, would yet amount to no more, then onely to an Anſwer <hi>Ad hominem:</hi> Others of his judgement would be little ſatisfied, or convinced by it, becauſe it would not reach their apprehenſions.</p>
               <p>One thing further is, that could I but entertain the one half of that opinion concerning his Theological abilities, which by ſeveral ſtrains in his writings, I perceive he admits of himſelf, I could not but conſequentially ſuppoſe, that he were able to Anſwer all his own Anſwers, and upon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent ſtudie, to diſcover the nakedneſs of all he hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the controverſies depending between him and me. Yea my preſent apprehenſions of the learning, parts, and worth of Docter <hi>Owen,</hi> are ſuch and ſo high, that I really beleeve, would be ingeniouſly, and with the beſt of his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding apply himſelf to the work, he could pluck up by the roots all he hath planted, and make Hey and Stubble of thoſe anſwers and diſcuſſions which now (I queſtion not) but he deſires ſhould bee eſteemed Silver and Gold by his Friends and Party.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding, as to Doctor <hi>Kendal,</hi> if what he hath written in anſwer to me, be too hard for himſelf to anſwer, I ſhall at my firſt leaſure, be willing to help him, upon this condition, that he Re-print his Books, and cauſe all his <hi>Fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques</hi> (as himſelf termeth them) all his unſeemly jears, all his childiſh and frivolous cavils, all his windy and importue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultations and triumphs, with abundance of other rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidge
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:114808:28"/>
not fit for any man to be troubled with, but himſelf, to be left out.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, what Doctor <hi>Kendal</hi> hath written needs the leſs Anſwer, becauſe in the eye of an intelligent and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant Reader, he hath rather confirmed, then infirmed, or confuted the arguments of his Adverſary, by giving the ſtreſs and ſtrength of them the go-by (well nigh all along) ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Attillery upon Phantaſms of his own conception, and maters very irrelative to his cauſe. As for Doctor <hi>Owens blameing</hi> me, it is like his act in <hi>blaming</hi> me, is more <hi>blame</hi>-worthy, then that for which I am <hi>blamed</hi> by him. They who have had time to looke into his Book, find more then a few <hi>blame</hi>-worthies in it. Yea theſe <hi>two</hi> great Hyperaſpiſts and Champions of your cauſe, have by <hi>one Horn</hi> both been puſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Earth, and overthrown both Horſe and man.</p>
               <p>(d) It is (I confeſs) very probable, that neither my ſelf, nor any other in my behalf, will <hi>ever be able to return an Anſwer ſatisfactory</hi> either to you, who are not capable of an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer (truly ſo called) or to ſuch of your party, who judge it more honorable to perſiſt in an error, and this unto death, then to ſeem to have erred: but I ſuppoſe an Anſwer hath been lately given, though brief, yet <hi>ſatisfactory to the life</hi> (your own phraſe) to all conſidering and un-prejudiced men.</p>

               <p>(a) What you mean by a <hi>Chriſtian Commonwealth,</hi> what, by this Commonwealths <hi>allowing men a liberty to blaſpheme Jeſus Chriſt, or corrupt his Goſpel,</hi> (I profeſſe ingeniouſly) I underſtand not. If by the former, you mean a Nation or State, wherein <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> at large is more generally profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that which you ſpeak here of a <hi>Chriſtian Commonwealth,</hi> you might as well have ſpoken of an <hi>Anti-Chriſtian.</hi> But I pray tell me, did you ever know, or hear of a <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> which was either <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> or <hi>Anti-Chriſtian,</hi> that did <hi>allow
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:114808:32"/>
men a liberty to blaſpheme Jeſus Chriſt, or to corrupt his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel?</hi> Or doth it follow, that unleſſe a Committee of Preſſe-Maſters be eſtabliſhed in a <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> this <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth</hi> muſt needs <hi>allow men a liberty to blaſpheme or corrupt,</hi> as you ſay? Or have the Lord Protector and the Parliament all this while, wherein they have eſtabliſhed no ſuch <hi>Committee, allowed men a liberty to blaſpheme Jeſus Chriſt, or to corrupt his Goſpel?</hi> Therefore (doubtleſſe) you do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand your ſelves. Nor can any man make ſence and truth of your words with the leaſt pertinency to your cauſe. Nor do I well underſtand what you mean by <hi>Blaſpheming Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and yet leſſe, what you mean by <hi>corrupting his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</hi> You and your Prophets have odd notions and conceits about <hi>Blaſphemy.</hi> Scarce any truth can be held forth, which thwarteth, or falleth foul on any of your tenents<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, but this Antipathy by you is turned into <hi>Blaſphemy.</hi> And whether by <hi>corrupting the Goſpel,</hi> you mean the ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of any errour, though never ſo light or ſmall, with goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel truths, or whether ſuch a <hi>corrupting</hi> it, which wholly deſtroies the nature and bleſſing intended unto men by it; or whether, a <hi>corrupting</hi> it to ſuch or ſuch a degree, between theſe two extreams, who can ſo much as ſteadily conjecture? The truth is, that I know very few, who are greater <hi>corrupters of the Goſpel,</hi> then your greateſt Champions.</p>
               <p>When you ſay that <hi>all things are not free, in a free Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,</hi> do you ſpeak to any purpoſe? Or doth it follow from hence, ſo much as by a dream of a conſequence, that therefore the Preſs ought not to be <hi>free,</hi> becauſe all things are not <hi>free?</hi> Behold the natural face of your arguing in a glaſſe: All things are not lawfull for men to do: therefore eating when they are an hungry, or drinking when they are thirſty, are not lawfull.</p>
               <p>(b) The three thirteenths you here point me unto, I have already <hi>read</hi> at leaſt thrice over (reſpectively) and <hi>have drawn concluſions</hi> from them <hi>to my</hi> full <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> againſt yours. And if you pleaſe to ſee what concluſions I have drawn from them, and what grounds I have laid, upon which you alſo may draw the like, I ſhall direct you to my reſpective arguings and explications of them. The firſt of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:114808:32"/>
your three places you ſhall find examined by me at large, in my treatiſe intituled, <hi>Hagiomaſtix,</hi> from §. 34. to the end of §. 41. Your ſecond, in a ſmall diſcourſe, written upon that text of Scripture onely, intituled, a <hi>Poſtſcript,</hi> or <hi>Appendix</hi> to the former diſcourſe. Your third and laſt in the ſaid diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, from the beginning of §. 45. to the end of §. 50. Between theſe Scriptures taken <hi>conjunctim</hi> and <hi>diviſim,</hi> and between your cauſe, you will find a very cold Communion.</p>
               <p>(c) Your Anſwer to my ſixt reaſon, is very little, and yet to leſs purpoſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For 1. What do you mean by <hi>The Religion, which the State owneth?</hi> 2. What do you mean, by the <hi>Chriſtian Religion?</hi> For this latter, firſt: The <hi>Religion owned</hi> and profeſſed by <hi>Anti-Chriſtian States,</hi> is (at leaſt in a ſence) the <hi>Chriſtian Religion.</hi> Yea they have as much confidence, if not more, of the truth and ſoundneſſe of their <hi>Religion,</hi> as any Proteſtant <hi>State</hi> can have of the <hi>Religion owned</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed by them. Secondly, I would know what you mean by the <hi>Religion which the State owneth;</hi> that ſo it may be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, not ſo much whether it be, but how, and how far, and in what ſence, it may be called the <hi>Chriſtian Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, if by <hi>the State,</hi> you mean, either all thoſe onely that have part in the Rule and Government of the Nation, or elſe the great Body it ſelf, and Bulk of the Nation, who can diſtinctly, and in particular, tell, what <hi>Religion it</hi> is, that is <hi>owned,</hi> or that ever will be <hi>owned</hi> by either? That <hi>Religion,</hi> or that Syſtem of Tenents, or confeſſion of Faith, which was compoſed and drawn up by the late Aſſembly of Divines and others at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> is not (it ſeems) <hi>owned,</hi> or is not like long to be <hi>owned,</hi> by the <hi>State,</hi> (in either acception of the word.) For the <hi>State</hi> (in the former ſence) is in Travail with another <hi>Religion,</hi> I mean, another Confeſſion, or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Faith; which, when they ſhall have aſſented un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and Authorized, there is little queſtion but the <hi>State</hi> (in the latter ſence) will (more generally) <hi>own</hi> alſo. If a man ſhould repair to every particular member of the <hi>State</hi> (in the former ſence, and much more in the latter) and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire his ſence and judgement, diſtinctly touching his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and what he particularly holdeth in ſuch and ſuch points, there is little queſtion to be made, but that in many things at leaſt, he ſhould meet with the exemplification of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:114808:33"/>
the Proverb, <hi>quot capita, tot ſenſus: quot homines, tot ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiae: as many men, ſo many minds.</hi> Yea in caſe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective members of the State (in the former ſence) ſhall joyntly and unanimouſly ſubſcribe and Authorize any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the Faith, which ſhall be formed, either by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or by any number of Miniſters, or others, this will amount to no proof, that therefore the ſame <hi>Religion,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in all points, is <hi>owned</hi> by them. For it is a moſt true ſaying, that <hi>Fides eſt in ſenſu, non in verbis;</hi> a mans faith conſiſts in that which he meaneth, not in the words which he ſpeaketh. And who knows not but the ſame words may have different interpretations and ſenſes put upon them? Therefore in caſe a <hi>State</hi> ſhall publiquely <hi>own</hi> and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize a model of Religion, or Confeſſion of Faith, that ſhall be preſented unto them, I ſhall be very little the neerer hereby to know of what Religion this <hi>State</hi> is, unleſs each particular member of this State ſhall further, diſtinctly and particularly explain his ſence touching every Article, or head of Doctrine therein. The truth is, that to a <hi>State Religion</hi> it may be aptly ſaid;
<q>
                     <l>Belluae multorum es capitum: nam quid ſequar, aut quem?</l>

You have forgotten your <hi>Motto</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.</p>
               <p>(b) <hi>Curſe you with Bell, Book, and Candle?</hi> Surely ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I was aſleep when I did it, or you, when you ſaid it.

I ſhall be a gainer, not a loſer, by <hi>detection.</hi> But ſo far have you been from <hi>detecting me to the world,</hi> that you have concealed and hid me from <hi>the world,</hi> as <hi>Tertullus</hi> did <hi>Paul,</hi> when he termed him a <hi>peſtilent fellow, Act.</hi> 24. 5. and the malicious <hi>Jews</hi> did our Saviour, when they put the veil of this reproach over his face, that he was <hi>a Samaritan and had a Devil<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Joh.</hi> 8. you have not <hi>detected me to the world,</hi> but your ſelves, and have given the world an opportunity, yea a kind of invitation, to ſee your naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <p>(c) Concerning the <hi>reſtitution</hi> of which you vainly here boaſt, it was before proved unto you, that you are debtors unto me of far greater Sums, then of the word <hi>Such:</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, you ſpeak at an extream low rate of underſtanding,

when you have traduced a man openly, and in print, to call a broken kind of acknowledgement in hugger mugger, and ſealed up in a paper, a <hi>reſtitution.</hi> If you pay your debts after this manner, they are wiſeſt that truſt you leaſt.</p>
               <p>(d) Yes; you have ſeen that <hi>by the help</hi> of the word <hi>h, I am able to return an anſwer</hi> (as you term it) <hi>to your three reverend Divines</hi>) in caſe any of them ſhould levy an Argument, or ground of exception, againſt the paſſage you wot of; which yet none of them have done (nor can do, with any colour of reaſon) but only clamour'd and cavill'd, as you have done.</p>

               <p>(a) I ſhall not put you to ſo much trouble or charge, as to <hi>print</hi> either <hi>my Letter,</hi> or your <hi>Anſwer:</hi> you ſee I have done both to your hand. I doubt whether you will return me your thanks for it, or no.

               <p>Remember how you have ſet this City on fire (for that's your only glory) by preaching. (<hi>a</hi>)</p>
               <p>1. That there was no neceſſity of Humiliation before Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion: you bid men go boldly (did you not mean, proudly) to Jeſus Chriſt, and he would humble them. Sir they that know you well, think you ſo proud, that they fear you have not as yet been with Jeſus Chriſt to humble you. (<hi>b</hi>)</p>
               <p>2. Secondly, You taught that a General Faith or aſſent was ſufficient, without any particular application of Chriſt to the Soul (<hi>c</hi>)</p>
               <p>3. Thirdly, You taught men to renounce all in ereſt in Christs active obedience, and you have likewiſe affirmed that Chriſt need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to have ſhed one drop of blood for us, <hi>Red<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Red. p. 16. (d)</hi>

               <p>5. You taught men to truſt to their own truſting, to a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, <hi>Tò credere,</hi> or an Act of general faith, which we look upon as very imperfect and unſatisfactory (<hi>f</hi>)</p>

               <p>(a) If I have <hi>ſet this City on fire,</hi> by my preaching, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain I am that it hath been with that <hi>Fire,</hi> which <hi>Jeſus Chriſt came from Heaven, to put on the Earth,</hi> and which he ſo long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſee <hi>kindled, Luk.</hi> 12, 49.

               </p>
               <p>(b) If I did exhort or incourage men <hi>to go boldly unto Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> doth not the great Apoſtle the ſame? When he incourageth, <hi>Therefore let us come BOLDLY unto the Throne of Grace, Heb.</hi> 4. 16. will you ask him, <hi>did you not mean PRO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>DLY?</hi> And if I did teach that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt will humble thoſe that come to him,</hi> I judge I have a very ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Voucher for my Doctrine. Yea, or what do you your ſelves think? will Jeſus <hi>Chriſt</hi> make <hi>proud</hi> or <hi>humble,</hi> thoſe that come unto him? Or do not they rather teach men <hi>to go proudly unto Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who teach them to bring <hi>humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> along with them, and to expect entertainment and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> upon the account of their <hi>humility,</hi> then they, who perſwade them to go unto him notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding any ſence of the greateſt unworthineſſe in themſelves, and not to be afraid of being rejected by him for any want or weakneſſe, that may accompany them in their way? But it may be, that he that penned your letter, out of ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſſe to himſelf is afraid of this Doctrine.</p>
               <p>You are much miſtaken when you ſay, <hi>They that know me well, think me ſo proud, &amp;c.</hi> there are none but thoſe that are ſtrangers, or enemies to me, that think thus of me: <hi>they that know me well,</hi> are otherwiſe minded. Yea and confidently, and upon good grounds beleeve, that I would be willing and free, notwithſtanding all your evil intreaties, and fiery provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of me, to carry your books after you; yea to ſtoop to looſe the latchet of the Shoe of the meaneſt of you, had I any competent ground to judge that ſuch a ſervice from me would turn to any ſpiritual, yea or temporal advantage un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you. But your tongues, it ſeems, are your own, and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:114808:38"/>
you think you are at liberty, to ſay with them, even what you liſt.</p>
               <p>By the way, the <hi>City</hi> was ſo far from being <hi>ſet on fire</hi> (in your ſence) by the Doctrine you here challenge me for, that it was rather cooled and compoſed by it, the Miniſters about the City in thoſe daies, when it was preached by me, more generally, if not univerſally, conſenting to it, and imbracing it. How the latter generation relliſheth the ſaid Doctrine, I know not ſo well. Notwithſtanding for ſeveral years laſt paſt, I have not heard of any mouth opened againſt it, but yours.</p>
               <p>(c) I confeſſe I have taught (and teach ſtill upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) that a firm and cordial belief of the Goſpel, as it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth from God, and as it is delivered in the Scriptures, and more eſpecially in the new Teſtament, is juſtifying Faith; and that a particular application, is properly an act of hope, and not of Faith, but onely by the mediation of hope. For the juſtifying of this Doctrine, I have not onely Scripture, upon Scripture, Scripture upon Scripture, and theſe moſt ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant and expreſſe, but the joint teſtimony alſo of ſeveral Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines of the Proteſtant party, as conſiderable as well for pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and parts of learning and ſound judgement, as any of their fellows. You may ſee ſomewhat more then a little up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this account in my <hi>Redempt. Redeemed. pag.</hi> 397, 398, 399 400.</p>
               <p>(d) This is a moſt notorious ſlander: I never <hi>taught</hi> any man to <hi>renounce all interest in the active obedience of Chriſt.</hi> Yea I have conſtantly taught and aſſerted the abſolute neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of it to render him a juſtifier of the ungodly, and Savior of men. My ſence in this point is plainly laid down in ſeveral places of my Treatiſe of Juſtification. (<note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Part. 2. p.</hi> 50. 54<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> Nor are you <hi>Christian</hi> in the latter part of your charge, I no where affirm, <hi>that Chriſt needed not to have ſhed one drop of his bloud for us:</hi> theſe are words of your falſification. My words in <hi>pag.</hi> 16. of my <hi>Redemption Redeemed,</hi> to which you refer me, are theſe. <hi>The Salvation of the world, doubtleſſe, did not depend upon the actualor literal dying or cruoifying of Christ, but partly upon the Councel and good pleaſure of God to deliver him up unto death in order to this end; partly upon the readineſſe and perfect
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:114808:38"/>
ſubmiſſion of will in Chriſt to ſuffer death, in caſe any man or men ſhould be found, that would inflict it upon him.</hi> Of this my Aſſertion I give a ſober and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> account at large in the ſequel of the diſcourſe. How wide the difference is between the notion and import of theſe words, and that affirmation which you unworthily charge upon me, an intelligent perſon may readily apprehend.</p>
               <p>(e) This alſo is a moſt wretched and daring calumny. Never in my daies did <hi>I deny the imputation of Chriſts all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ſatisfaction.</hi> I onely denied that moſt ſenceleſſe and Anti-Scriptural ſence of this imputation, which was taught by ſome Miniſters about the City: but in a regular and true ſence I alwaies affirmed it, and accordingly declare my ſelf in the ſecond part of my book of Juſtification, <hi>pag.</hi> 53. 57.</p>
               <p>(f) If you had prayed <hi>Davids</hi> prayer, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 29. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your drawing up of this Article, I judge that God would have heard you, and <hi>removed from you the way of lying.</hi> For certainly never did any word paſſe from my lips, of any ſuch tendency, or ſound, as here you are not afraid to faſten on me.

It may be you think to aſcend up into Heaven in a vapour, and to carry all before you with ſwelling words of vanity. This I confeſs is the lofty method of ſome of your Don-Teachers; who if they can but ſpeak gloriouſly and confidently of their cauſe, and then waſh it over with ſome ſlight colour of an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which it may be terminates the ſight of a partial or formal Reader, though it be as tranſparent as the air, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudic'd and intelligent men, think their atchievement to be greater then all applauſe; above all admiration.</p>

               <p>(d) I know no <hi>advice</hi> or <hi>councel</hi> at all, that you have given me, unleſſe it be implicitely, and by conſequence: and thus you have adviſed me to beware of men of your principles and ſpirit.

            </opener>
            <p>I Came ſome few dayes ſince caſually to underſtand, that there is one paſſage in my late Book, intituled <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption Redeemed,</hi> (poſſibly among many others of leſs of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence) of ſo hard a reſentment with you, that you judged it of very dangerous conſequence, and have cautioned ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral perſons (as ſome of themſelves have reported, I know not how publickly, or unto how many) againſt the danger of it. Whether your intent was hereby to blaſt the credit of that one paſſage onely, or to render the Book it ſelf as unſafe, or how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever of no good conſequence for them to read; I ſhal not too narrowly enquire into, much leſſe determine. I acknowledg it to be far above my line, in the compoſure of a Book to be able to pre-apprehend or fore-ſee, what notions or expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions may poſſibly diſtaſte, or provoke a ſpirit of prejudice and pre-occupation; or to deliver my ſence at every turn up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch tearms, as to leave no place or poſſibility for ſiniſter conſtructions: But this I am able to avouch, as in the ſight of God, who will ſhortly bring every ſecret thing unto judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that in the penning of that Book I was conſcientiouſly ſtudious and careful, to decline, as well in matter, as in words, whatſoever I apprehended likely to offend any man, further or otherwiſe then as the truth, even with the faireſt and cleareſt delivery of it, is apt to offend thoſe who are not diſpoſed, or prepared in their judgements, to receive it. And I now am, and I truſt alwayes ſhall be willing, and ready to do the beſt I can, to heal every mans offence taken at any ſaying or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion in that Book, when I come particularly to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the ground or occaſion of it. I hear that within theſe few weeks there was another (whoſe Name I ſhall ſpare at preſent) who very reaſonleſly, and without the leaſt cauſe gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſtumbled in the Univerſity Pulpit at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother paſſage in the ſaid book, where I give an account of my judgment concerning the fulneſſe, freeneſs, &amp; effectualneſs
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:114808:43"/>
of the Grace of God. Notwithſtanding, I had in ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular &amp; diſtinct explications of my ſelf immediatly before, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to remove the ſtumbling-ſtone (ſuch as it was) out of his way; and had ſhewed him before this, how he might with a very good conſcience, &amp; with more honour to himſelf, have paſſed by that paſſage without lifting up his heel againſt it, but that I want ſuch particularity of information about the carriage of the diſcourſe, as I deſire, &amp; hope in due time to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. As for him, who Arch-Rabbi-like, concluded at once, &amp; without premiſes, al thoſe without exception that hold the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of general Attonement by Chriſt, and of a poſſibility of a final declining in ſuch who ever believed, to be men <hi>Godleſſe, Chriſtleſſe, Spiritleſſe, Graceleſſe,</hi> I ſhall at preſent onely adviſe him to lay his heart cloſe to thoſe two ſayings of a wiſe man, <hi>Prov.</hi> 26. 12. and <hi>Prov.</hi> 29. 20. When I ſhall hear that he is throughly baptized into the Spirit of theſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, I ſhall judge him a perſon worthy a reproof, when he offends. In the mean time, I judge, that He, who told it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt news from Heaven unto the City, that <hi>Arminius</hi> his rotten poſts were lately new painted, together with him, who not long after (diurnal-wiſe) told the ſame ſtory over again to the ſame Audience, only in a more diſmal Metaphor, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming them, that <hi>Arminius</hi> his Ghoſt was lately ſtarted out of his Grave, and walked; neither of them medling any further with the controverſies. I judge, (I ſay) that theſe are men wiſe in their generation, and did well conſider that the name of <hi>Arminius</hi> is the moſt forcible Engine (though made of nothing but air and wind) to batter the walls of thoſe opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which they ſo cordially wiſh in the duſt; and that ſhould they have engaged any Scripture or Argument upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne, they had run an hazard of loſing all that ground, or more, which they had reaſon to hope they had won, by draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the pedigree of the ſaid opinions, though moſt untruely, from <hi>Arminius,</hi> it faring with their credulous hearers ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Proverb; <hi>The blind ſwallow many a fly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Sir, Concerning that paſſage in my late Book, upon the horn whereof you were pleaſed to tye a lock or bunch of hey, by way of ſignal unto your friends and others, to take heed of it, and to keep at diſtance from it; if my intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:114808:44"/>
leadeth me to the right place: (as I ſuppoſe upon competent grounds it doth) as far as I am able with the moſt impartial eye I have, to ſee into it, it is ſo far from merit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the brand of ignominy, wherewith you have ſtigmatized it, that rightly underſtood and conſidered, it is as innocent and offenceleſs, as any ſaying that ever fell from your own mouth, in any of your Sermons. The paſſage (I preſume) is this, <hi>page</hi> 335. of the ſaid Book, I ſhall recite it <hi>verbatim. Yea (that which is yet more) I verily believe, that in caſe any ſuch aſſurance of the unchangeableneſs of Gods love, were to be found in, or could regularly be deduced from the Scriptures, it were a juſt ground to any intelligent and conſidering man, to queſtion their Authority, and whether they were from God, or no.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The reaſon of this ſaying I immediately ſubjoyne in theſe words, <hi>For that a God infinitely righteous and holy, ſhould ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reverſibly aſſure the immortal and undefiled inheritance of his Grace and favour unto any creature whatſoever, ſo that though this Creature ſhould prove never ſo abominable in his ſight, never ſo outragiouſly and deſperately wicked and prophane, he ſhould not be at liberty to withhold this inheritance from him, is a ſaying, doubtleſs, too hard for any man, who rightly underſtands and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders the Nature of God, to hear.</hi> What there ſhould be in either of theſe ſayings, ſo much as lyable to any ſuſpicion of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comportance, either with reaſon, or with truth, cannot enter into my thoughts to imagine, or conceive. The pile of the diſcourſe is built and <hi>I</hi> cannot but preſume regularly enough upon this foundation; that if any thing were found in thoſe writings or books, known by the Name of, Scriptures, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the letter of them, or in any expreſneſs of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence from them, (here juſtified or approved) of any blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous importance againſt God, or any his Attributes, it were a juſt ground, at leaſt to queſtion, whether the ſaid wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings were from God, or no. I ſuppoſe I ſhal not need to argue this principle, being ſo full of light in it ſelf. The Holy Ghoſt himſelf teacheth us, that <hi>God cannot deny himſelfe</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">2 Tim. 2.</note>: and as certain it is, that he cannot blaſpheme himſelf, nor yet au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize, inſpire, or teach any perſon, or creature whatſoever, to blaſpheme him; the blaſpheming of himſelfe being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but a conſtructive <hi>denying</hi> of himſelf, as is evident.
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:114808:44"/>
Therefore what book or writing ſoever contains any thing blaſphemous againſt God, I do not mean as ſimply report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but as aſſerted and maintained in either, is not onely a juſt ground to queſtion (which yet is all I affirm in the point) whether ſuch a writing or book be of divine inſpiration, or from God, or no: but even poſitively to conclude againſt them, that they are not. So then if there be any thing dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, or of ſuſpicious conſequence in either of the ſaid paſſages, it muſt be this; that in the former of them, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and in the latter (conſtructively) affirm, that ſuch an unchangeableneſſe of the Love of God, as is mentioned in the former, and deſcribed (in part) in the latter, is of a blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous import, and repugnant to thoſe great Attributes of righteouſneſs and holineſs in God. Though the latter of the ſaid paſſages recited, carrieth a ſufficient light in it to ſatisfie any man (impartially conſiderate) concerning the truth of this aſſertion; yet the matter being of an high and ſacred importance, I am willing and ſhall endeavour to give both unto your ſelf, and others, ſomewhat a more full and diſtinct account hereof.</p>
            <p>Firſt then evident it is, that that unchangeableneſſe of the love of God, which theſe paſſages ſpeak of, and without a ſuppoſal whereof the common Doctrine of Perſeverance, againſt which I here argue, cannot be maintained, in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal and proper notion of it ſuppoſeth, that if ever God once truly loveth a perſon, it is unpoſſible, that upon any occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or interveniences whatſoever, he ſhould hate him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Every whit as evident it is, that ſuch a ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or notion as this, ſuppoſeth, that in caſe a perſon hath once, or at any time, truly believed, ſuppoſe in his youth, (under which condition he muſt needs be beloved by God) though the very next hour or day after ſuch his believing, he ſhould fall into wayes of ſin, wickedneſſe, diſobedience, rebellion againſt God, and ſhould without repentance or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe continue in theſe abominations, adding drunkenneſs to thirſt from time to time, for 10. 20. it may be 40. 50. years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and to his laſt breath, yet God all this while truly lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth him, and remaineth unchanged in this his affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:114808:45"/>
him; and conſequently loveth him with the ſame love; as great, as rich, as dear, under all theſe horrible pollutions, and moſt accurſed abominations, as he either would, or could have loved him with, in caſe he had all this while walked in the greateſt innocency, and uprightneſſe of heart and life before him. Now then this is that which I affirm; that to attribute ſuch an unchangeableneſs of love unto God, as this, which maketh him to love an obſtinate and obdurate ſinner, a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of all manner of abominations, with the ſame affection wherewith he loveth a juſt, holy, and good man, a worker of all righteouſneſſe, is of a blaſphemous import to thoſe glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Attributes of his, his Righteouſneſs and Holineſs. For if the caſe were thus with God, ſhould not the world have cauſe to demand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with thoſe in <hi>Malachy, Where is the God of judgement?</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Mal. 2. 17.</note> Or what is there, or can there be, of a more diametrical oppoſition unto righteouſneſſe, then equally to reſpect and love the moſt unrighteous with thoſe that are moſt righteous? or unto Holineſs, then to honour thoſe that are moſt polluted and abominable, as much as thoſe that are holy?</p>
            <p>Nor can you here pretend, that I wrong your Doctrine of Perſeverance to the value of the leaſt hair on your head, by making it a Patroneſſe and Protectrix of ſuch an unchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geableneſſe of love in God, as that now repreſented: becauſe evident it is, that without ſuch an unchangeableneſs ſuppoſed, the ſaid Doctrine will neither have footing nor foundation to ſupport it. For though you and others, Patrons of this Doctrine, underſtand your ſelves, and be-friend your Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine better, then to expreſs or repreſent it unto the world, in thoſe black and diſmal colours, wherewith I have now drawn the pourtraicture of it, or to deſcribe the unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of love in God, which muſt be the Baſis and Pillar of it, in ſuch tearms as it hath been deſcribed by me: yet there is nothing more pregnant and notorious, then that your ſoft and ſilken, and moſt tender expreſſions of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing regularly, and according to the exigencie of truth, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted, and drawn out of theſe colluſive involutions, amount every whit to as much, or more in deformity and A theologicalneſs of notion, as any expreſſions uſed by me
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:114808:45"/>
do import. For certain it is (nor do I remember that I ever met with a denial of it, amongſt the greateſt Defenders of your Faith, in the point of Perſeverance) that he that truly believeth, may poſſibly fall, and that within a very ſhort time after this his believing, into the greateſt and fouleſt ſins that the nature of man is lightly incident into, as drunkenneſs, adultery, murther, envy, malice, covetouſneſs, oppreſſion, idolatry, &amp;c. yea, and from the time of his firſt falling into them, may continue and hold on in the practiſe of them for many years together, yea poſſibly to the very approaches of death, without repentance. Onely you teach indeed, but by humane, not divine inſpiration neither, that ſuch perſons (I mean, once believers) in caſe they fall into ſuch ſins, as thoſe now mentioned, or the like, yet never miſcarry in the great buſineſſe of Salvation, but by an high hand of Grace from God are always brought back unto repentance before their death: However, upon the former ſuppoſition, it clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follows, that your Doctrine of Perſeverance cannot ſtand, without the rotten prop of a Suppoſal of ſuch an unchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geableneſs of love in God, which is palpably, and in the eye of a very ordinary underſtanding, of an highly diſparaging, and blaſphemous import to his Righteouſneſs and Holineſs. In what ſence the Scriptures hold forth an unchangeableneſs in God, and ſo in all his Attributes, and particularly in his Love, I declare once and again (upon occaſion) in my late Book of Redemption, <hi>page</hi> 63, 64. And again, <hi>page</hi> 278, 279. and <hi>page 205, 206. &amp;c.</hi> Elſewhere (as <hi>viz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> page</hi> 318, 319. and <hi>p.</hi> 330. &amp;c.) I demonſtratively prove your Doctrine of Perſeverance to be at open and manifeſt defiance alſo with another great Attribute of God, his Wiſdom. Yea, when I look narrowly into the purport and tendencies of this your Doctrine, I cannot over-rule my thoughts, but that they will be very jealous, that it is acceſſary to far the greateſt part of thoſe abominations at this day raging amongſt us, <hi>Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mianiſm, Enthuſiaſm, Familiſm,</hi> of the dangerous and vile opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and practiſes of thoſe called <hi>Seekers,</hi> and of thoſe bred of the dregs and retriment of all theſe, the <hi>Ranters,</hi> and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally of all the coolings, declinings, backſlidings, and of all other foul and ſad miſcarriages amongſt Profeſſors.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:114808:46"/>Sir, I have looked upon you as the glory of the <hi>London</hi> Miniſtery, and do ſo ſtill, notwithſtanding the conteſt of your judgment againſt mine, about the Doctrine of Redemption, and the queſtions relating hereunto. Yet give him leave, who is poſſibly looked upon by you, as by many others, as the reproach and ſhame of this Miniſtry, to ſay this unto you, that thoſe two opinions, the one of a peremptory perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Election from Eternity, the other of a peremptory and neceſſitated perſeverance of the Saints, genuinely interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, do (upon the matter) wholly diſſolve the uſefulneſs and neceſſity of your Miniſtry; the former in relation to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons yet unconverted; the latter, in reſpect of Beleevers. For firſt, if there be a certain number of men peremptorily deſigned by God to Salvation, all others as peremptorily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, what need either the one, or the other, regard ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your Miniſtry, or any other mans? The former, ſhall be infallibly and irreſiſtibly converted, and ſo ſaved, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you or any man elſe, preach the Goſpel unto them or no. If ſo, <hi>Fortis ubi eſt Ajax?</hi> where, or what is the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of the greateſt Preacher under Heaven, in reſpect of them? The latter, notwithſtanding all the poſſible relief that you by your Miniſtry can afford them, will, and muſt inevitably periſh. Yea all the good that you are capable of doing unto theſe by your Miniſtry, is onely to help them deeper into Hell. Secondly, if thoſe who already beleeve, ſhall certainly, and againſt all poſſible interveniences perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere in faith unto the end, what if the Miniſtry of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and they, were quite parted; They ſhould run no haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard of loſing their Crown hereby. This great Truth, <hi>viz.</hi> that your Doctrine of Perſeverance fruſtrates the Miniſtry in reference unto the Saints, I prove at large (and I ſuppoſe beyond all reaſonable contradiction) Page 301. 302. 339. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the book formerly mentioned: Where alſo I tear in pieces the Fig-leaf of that pretence, that the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, notwithſtanding the perſeverance of the Saints be ſuppoſed abſolute and unfruſtrable, is yet a means for the effecting or procuring of it.</p>
            <p>But Sir, concerning the paſſage recited, wherein you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to finde ſo much danger, that you judge it neceſſary to
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:114808:46"/>
arm your Friends with a Religious caveat againſt it, I veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beleeve, that there is ſcarce any Page in any of thoſe books which either you have publiſhed in your own name, or Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed for others, but I could quarrel with ſomewhat there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, at as good a rate of ingenuity, if I judged the ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment worthy of me, as you have done at that paſſage of mine. Yea and wring every whit as bad blood out of the noſe of it, as you have forced out of mine. But for over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſights, hard expreſſions, or doubtful paſſages in other mens writings, otherwiſe then for the neceſſary defence of thoſe Truths which God hath ſtir'd up my Spirit to plead and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect, I have neither time, nor mind, to take any ſuch cogniſance of them. Concerning my own writings, ſo far as I find them juſtifiable for matter of truth, and defenſible, I ſhall (God willing) <hi>pro virili,</hi> ſtand up to maintain them againſt all Oppoſition and Detraction, as faſt as I ſhall come to underſtand what exceptions are taken againſt them. What ſhall reaſonably and in a Chriſtian manner, be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted againſt any thing, I ſhall make no Apology for, but with a ſpirit of meekneſs own the overſight, and onely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor the rectifying. In caſe unjuſt Oppoſers ſhall riſe up too faſt, or prove too many in number for me, I muſt then be content to edecimate, and turne my ſelf onely to thoſe, that are counted Pillars, and leave Punies-either to ſhare with them in ſuch anſwers and ſatisfactions which ſhall be given unto them, or otherwiſe to take their pleaſure in fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the wings of their own wind. Sir, I cannot ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a want of ſo much civility in you, as to deny water un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe for the waſhing of their faces, who are bemired, though caſually, and by their friends: or that the publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe few harmleſs lines in order to my purgation, will be matter of offence in the leaſt unto you. Thus deſiring, that the Father of Lights will give both to you and me, and all others that deſire to ſerve him faithfully in the Goſpel of his dear Son, light and not darkneſs, for our viſion; I take my leave, and reſt</p>

            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Suppoſe you Printed and Publiſhed your Book with a willingneſſe that it ſhould be read and conſidered by all men, and knew alſo, that your opinion therein aſſerted concerning Univerſal Redemption, and falling from Grace, hath been (as ſtill it is) oppoſed by very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. For my own part I plainly profeſse to you, that I have (according to my meaſure) held forth and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the contrary Doctrines, not onely before I ſaw your Book, but before ever I ſaw your face; and ſo I judge my ſelf bound to do, (as I have oppertunity) till I ſee ground to change my opinion, which as yet I do not, no not by what I have found in your book.</p>
            <p>As for that particular Paſſage of it, which you ſay I have ſtigmatiz'd with a Brand of Ignominy, as alſo caution'd my friends about it; what you mean by ſtig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matizing I apprehend not: All that I have ſaid of it, hath been but a manifestation of my diſlike of it, or that it is an argument of your higheſt confidence, that the truth, in that point to which it relates, is on your ſide. Now truly Sir, if you call this ſtigmatizing it with a Brand of Ignominy, I know not how to take it off, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all that you have written in vindication of it, in the Letter you were pleaſed to ſend me.</p>
            <p>And whereas you intimate your purpoſe to Print that Letter, it ſhall (I hope) be no trouble to me (unleſſe for your ſake) if you do ſo. Onely give me leave to caution you as a friend, to conſider well both with your

ſelf, and with your friends. Whether it be ſo comely or you to diſcover ſuch an eagerneſſe in this cauſe, that you cannot contain your ſelf from publiſhing in Print, what is ſpoken in private diſcourſe among Friends, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, or other Paſſages of your Book.
