         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THIS Book is divided into two
Parts; the firſt contains the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
and witty Sayings of the
Eaſtern Nations, and the ſecond their
Maxims. The Reader, who is in any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
acquainted with the Works of the
Antients, will eaſily obſerve, that the firſt
Title is the Interpretation of that of <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thegms,</hi>
which <hi>Plutarch</hi> gave to his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
of the Remarkable Sayings of the
Antient Kings, and Captains, both <hi>Greeks</hi>
and <hi>Romans:</hi> and <hi>Valerius Maximus</hi>
intitles his <hi>Dicta memoratu digna,</hi> which
doubtleſs is almoſt the ſame.</p>
            <p>The Deſign of <hi>Plutarch,</hi> as he ſays
himſelf in his Dedication to the Emperor
<hi>Trajan,</hi> was to ſhow what was the <hi>Genius</hi>
               <pb n="iv" facs="tcp:61726:3"/>
of thoſe Great Men he ſpeaks of; and
mine is to ſet forth both the <hi>Genius</hi> and
Character of the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Nations: For as
the <hi>Apothegms</hi> diſcover the Solidity of
Judgment and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>prightneſs of Heart, and
the witty Sayings and <hi>Repartees,</hi> the Viva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
and Subtilty of Wit, the Reader may
perhaps be convinced by the peruſing of this
Book, that the Eaſtern Nations come no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſhort of the Weſtern in Wit and
Judgment.</p>
            <p>
               <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder the Name of Eaſtern People, I
include not only the <hi>Arabians</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi>
but alſo the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Tartars,</hi> and almoſt
all the other Nations of <hi>Aſia,</hi> to the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of <hi>China,</hi> both <hi>Mahometans</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans.</hi>
The Sayings of <hi>Ginghiz-khan,</hi> and
<hi>Oghtaï-khan,</hi> which I have related, prove
that the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Tartars,</hi> who are the
ſame with the <hi>Scythians,</hi> have ſtill to this
day almoſt the ſame <hi>Genius</hi> and Cuſtoms
mentioned by <hi>Quintus Curtius,</hi> and other
antient Writers. I attribute the Maxims,
which make the ſecond Part of this Work,
to all thoſe Nations, becauſe they are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted
not only from the Books of the
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:61726:3"/>
               <hi>Arabians,</hi> but alſo from thoſe of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi>
and <hi>Turks,</hi> tho there may be ſome
difference amongst them, the Authors fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
the particular <hi>Genius</hi> of their own
Country.</p>
            <p>I do not deſign to collect all the remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
or witty Sayings of the Eaſtern Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
no more than <hi>Plutarch</hi> or <hi>Valerius
Maximus</hi> did thoſe of the <hi>Greek</hi> and
<hi>Roman;</hi> that <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaking would be too
great: but if this Collection be kindly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
I ſhall publiſh a ſecond Volume,
having ſeveral other Original Pieces to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Arabian, Perſian</hi> and <hi>Turkiſh</hi>
Books which I have read, or the Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
that I made my ſelf while I travelled
into thoſe Countries, have furniſhed me with
the Remarks that I thought neceſſary for the
underſtanding of this Work. I have made
uſe of them ſpecially to denote the Times
wherein the <hi>Caliphs, Sultans,</hi> and other
Princes whom I mention, liv'd; and to
make it the more eaſy and plain, have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
the Years of the <hi>Hegira</hi> to the Years
of the Nativity of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vi" facs="tcp:61726:4"/>
I have abſtracted this Work, partly from
printed Books, and partly from Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts:
the Books are the Hiſtory of the
<hi>Caliphs</hi> by <hi>Elmacinus,</hi> the Hiſtory of the
<hi>Dynaſties</hi> by <hi>Alvu-lfarage,</hi> both in <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bic;</hi>
and the <hi>Guliſtan,</hi> which is a Work
of <hi>Saadi</hi> in <hi>Perſian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Manuſcripts are the <hi>Bahariſtan</hi> of
<hi>Giami</hi> in <hi>Perſian,</hi> writ after the Model
of the <hi>Guliſtan;</hi> the Inſtruction of a
King of <hi>Mazanderan</hi> to his Son in <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian,</hi>
of which I give a pretty large Account
in my Remarks; the Abridgment of the
Mahometan Hiſtory written in <hi>Perſian,</hi>

I have choſen thoſe that ſeemed to me really
witty, and that were not againſt Morals or

            <p>The Maxims are extracted out of thoſe
that <hi>Orpenius</hi> and <hi>Golius</hi> have promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuouſly

            <p>
               <hi>Obſervation.</hi> According to the Mahometan Hiſtories,
<hi>Mahomet</hi> had fourteen Wives, amongſt whom was this
<hi>Aïſcheh,</hi> Daughter to <hi>Aboubekir,</hi> the firſt Succeſſor of
<hi>Mahomet.</hi> She liv'd nine Years with him, and died a
long time after under the Reign of <hi>Caliph Maavia,</hi> ſhe
being then 65 Years old.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Hormouzan,</hi> whom the King of <hi>Perſia</hi>
had intruſted with the Government of
<hi>Schouſchter,</hi> the Capital City of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
of <hi>Khouſiſtan,</hi> fought the <hi>Arabs</hi> ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
times, when they conquer'd the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61726:6"/>
of <hi>Perſia.</hi> But at laſt the <hi>Arabs</hi> took
him Priſoner, and brought him to <hi>Omar,</hi> the
ſecond Succeſſor of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who order'd
him to be put to death. Before his Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
<hi>Hormouzan</hi> call'd for Drink, but
the Terror of Death had ſo much ſeiz'd
upon him, that he had not the Strength
to drink the Water that was brought him.
Whereupon <hi>Omar</hi> bid him take Heart, for
he had nothing to fear till he had drank;
but ſeeing he drunk not, he commanded
him to be beheaded. How, cry'd <hi>Hormouzan,</hi>
you have given me my Pardon, and don't
you keep your word? <hi>Omar</hi> being ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd,
and asking how he underſtood it?
You have ſaid, anſwer'd the Priſoner, I had
nothing to fear till I had drank, and I have
not drank yet. The Company confeſs'd
<hi>Hormouzan</hi> was in the right, and <hi>Omar</hi>
granted him his Life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſervations.</hi> It has been obſerved before me, that
<hi>Schouſchter</hi> is the antient <hi>Suza,</hi> where the Kings of <hi>Perſia</hi>
uſed to winter, it being ſituated in a very warm Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,

becauſe of his Profeſſion: and from that
Name <hi>Saffar, Jacoub,</hi> together with his Brother <hi>Amrou,</hi>
and <hi>Mehemmed</hi> Son to <hi>Taher,</hi> who ran after him, were
ſirnamed <hi>Saffarans. Jacoub,</hi> from his Youth, had ſuch
a ſtrong Inclination to bear Arms, that his Father en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
in vain to bind him to his Trade, and was
forced to leave him to himſelf. When he was Maſter
of his own Actions, he turn'd Highway-Man; but was
ſtill ſo honeſt, as to leave ſomething to thoſe he rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed.
Upon a time he broke into the Treaſury of <hi>Dir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem,</hi>
Governour of <hi>Siſtan</hi> for the <hi>Calife;</hi> and in the
Dark, laying his Hand upon ſomething that glitter'd,
he put what he laid hold of into his Mouth, believing it
was precious Stones: but finding it was <hi>Salt,</hi> he went
out without carrying any thing away. The next day
the Governor hearing that his Treaſury had been
broken up, and nothing diminiſhed, made a Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
that the Robber might ſafely diſcover himſelf,
and that he ſhould not only not be puniſhed, but that
he would do all he could to oblige him. Upon this,
<hi>Jacoub</hi> appear'd, and the Governor asking him, why
he carry'd nothing away? <hi>Jacoub</hi> told him this Story:
and added, I thought I was become your Friend by
eating of your <hi>Salt;</hi> and that by the Laws of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
I was not allow'd to diminiſh any thing belonging
to you. <hi>Dirhem</hi> gave him ſome Employment; which
he diſcharged with ſo much Valour and Conduct, that
at laſt by degrees, he made him General of his Army.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61726:8"/>
But after the Death of <hi>Dirhem, Jacoub</hi> laying hold of
his Power, expell'd the Sons of <hi>Dirhem,</hi> ſeized upon
<hi>Siſtan;</hi> and after that conquer'd <hi>Khoraſſan, Perſia,</hi> and
ſeveral other States; of which he made a vaſt and
powerful Empire. He died in the Year of the <hi>Hegyra

            <p>5. <hi>Amrou Leits</hi> conſiderably inlarg'd the
Kingdom left to him by his Brother <hi>Jacoub;</hi>
and to do it yet more, he reſolved to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
the <hi>Calife,</hi> and proclaim'd War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

<hi>Iſmail,</hi> the firſt King of the Family of the
<hi>Samanians;</hi> and <hi>Iſmail</hi> taking him Priſoner,
ſent him to the <hi>Calife. Amrou</hi> was a very
magnificent and liberal Prince; ſo that no
leſs than 300 Camels were employ'd in car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
his Kitchin Utenſils when he was in
the Field. The Day he was overcome and
taken Priſoner by <hi>Iſmail,</hi> he ſaw near him
his chief Cook, who had ſtuck to him; and
he ask'd him whether he had any thing to
eat? The Cook, that had yet ſome Fleſh
left, put it preſently on the Fire in a Pot,
and went to look for ſomething to treat his
Maſter in his Misfortune the beſt way he
could. In the mean while, a Dog came by
chance, and put his Head in the Pot to take
away the Meat; but by reaſon of the Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of the Fire, he could not do it; but
lifting up his Head, the Pot-hook fell on his
Neck, and being not able to diſintangle
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61726:8"/>
himſelf, ran away with Pot and all. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rou</hi>
could not forbear laughing: and as one

This Morning 300 Camels were ſcarce e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough

               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> The <hi>Calife</hi> mention'd here, was <hi>Mutadad;</hi>
who kept <hi>Amrou</hi> Priſoner two Years: But after the
Death of the <hi>Calife, Amrou</hi> was ſlighted, and ſtarved in
his Priſon. <hi>Mutadad</hi> died in the Year of the <hi>Hegyra
289. of our Lord</hi> 901.</p>
            <p>6. A Slave of <hi>Amrou Leits</hi> ran away,
but being purſu'd was brought back; and
that King's Grand <hi>Vizier,</hi> who hated the
Slave, ſolicited <hi>Amrou</hi> to put him to
Death, ſuggeſting to him, it would be an
Inſtance to deter others. Hereupon the
Slave caſting himſelf on the Ground before
the King, ſaid; <q>Whatever your Majeſty
will be pleaſed to order as to my Deſtiny,
it muſt be done; for a Slave cannot find
fault with the Judgment of his Lord and
Maſter: but becauſe I have been brought
up in your Palace, as a Mark of my Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
I could wiſh you might not anſwer
for my Blood at the Day of Judgment:
And therefore if you deſire I ſhould be
kill'd, let it be under a Pretence of Juſtice.</q>
               <hi>Amrou</hi> ask'd him what he meant by that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61726:9"/>
Pretence? <q>Suffer me, anſwer'd the Slave,
to kill the <hi>Vizier,</hi> and then you will be in
the Right in taking away my Life to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
his Death.</q> 
               <hi>Amrou</hi> laugh'd at the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt,
and ask'd the <hi>Vizier</hi> what he thought
of it? The <hi>Vizier</hi> anſwer'd, I deſire your
Majeſty to forgive the Wretch; he might
draw ſome Misfortune upon me: I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
that Anſwer; not conſidering that
when we deſign to kill another, we expoſe
our ſelves to be kill'd as much as him whom
we intend to murder.</p>

are you not afraid of the like Treatment?
O, anſwered he, they did well to put him

            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> As to that falſe Prophet put to Death, 'tis
obſervable that the Mahometans hold <hi>Mahomet</hi> for

his Lunacy, and ſaid, that a good Diet

Days: After which time, the <hi>Calife</hi> cauſed

Whether he was yet a Prophet, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

            <p>The Mahometans hold, that God ſends the Angel

a Sin in a Mahometan Wife, to ſhow her ſelf to
any other Mahometan beſides her Husband. However,
I have read in one of their Books, that it is not a Sin

Puniſhment, as ſtoning and drowning, to which thoſe

Moreover, they conceive that a great Good may from
thence accrue to their Religion; becauſe Chriſtians or
Jews being hindred from attempting the Chaſtity of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61726:11"/>
Mahometan Women, by the Fear of Fire, may by thoſe
means fall in love with them, and be brought to forſake

I have been but ſix Months a <hi>Muſſulman,</hi>
pray tell me whether you oblige Children
ſix Months old to ſay their Prayers?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſervation.</hi> This ſhows that amongſt the Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,
Eccleſiaſtical Cauſes are judged by the <hi>Cadies</hi> as

            <p>16. Another Mahometan, that did not
ſay his Prayers, was likewiſe cited to the
Court. Now the <hi>Cadi</hi> asking him the Cauſe
of his Neglect: My Lord, ſays he, I have a
Wife and Children to keep; I am poor, and
can earn our Livelihood only by a continual
Labour. Well ſaid the <hi>Cadi,</hi> you ſhall have
two <hi>Aſpers</hi> every day, ſay your Prayers as the
others. Sometime after, he was brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
to the <hi>Cadi,</hi> and the Judg was told
that the Accuſed went indeed to Prayers,
but that he did not waſh himſelf before.
The <hi>Cadi</hi> checkt him extreamly, and asked
him, why he did not waſh himſelf? My
Lord, ſays he, if you deſire I ſhould waſh
my ſelf before Prayers, pray let me have
four <hi>Aſpers</hi> inſtead of two; for I forbear
waſhing for want of time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſervation.</hi> Though every one of the Mahometan
Prayers be very ſhort, yet including the time they
ſpend in waſhing themſelves, which they do very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
and leaſurely, they cannot perform both within
leſs than half an hour. The five times preſcribed for
that Exerciſe are, The Break of Day, Noon, two Hours
and a half before Sun-ſet, Sun-ſet, and an Hour and half
after Sun-ſet. So that in all the Mahometan Countries,
they are generally up very early in any Seaſon whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever;
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61726:12"/>
for no body is exempted from that Law: Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,

The Phyſician finding the <hi>Calender</hi> was
troubled with no other Diſtemper but Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
led him to his Houſe, and cauſed a
great Diſh of <hi>Pilau</hi> to be brought him. When
the <hi>Calender</hi> had ſufficiently eaten, he ſaid to

            <p>18. A Learned Man that ſeemed to be a
little crack-brain'd, and walked always
with his Head lifted up, was commended in
a Company, eſpecially for his Skill in Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy.
<hi>Baſſiri,</hi> who was preſent, ſaid, I
don't wonder at it, for he is always looking
upon the Stars.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſervation. Baſſiri</hi> was a Turkiſh Poet born on the
Borders of <hi>Perſia,</hi> who came to the Court of <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi>
under the Reign of Sultan <hi>Bajazid,</hi> Son and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor
to Sultan <hi>Mehemmed</hi> the Second; where he made
himſelf known by his Poetry in Turkiſh and Perſian.
<hi>Letifi</hi> ſpeaks of him in his Book concerning the Turkiſh
Poets; obſerving that he was pleaſant in Converſation,
and had always a Jeſt at hand. <hi>Baſſiri</hi> is an Arabian
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61726:13"/>
word, that ſignifies <hi>the Clear-ſighted or <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding.</hi>
We may perhaps have occaſion elſewhere to ſpeak of
the Names of the Eaſtern Poets.</p>
            <p>19. A Covetous <hi>Calife</hi> received the Verſes
made in his Praiſe; but for a Reward,
gave no more than the Weight of the Book
or Writing. A Poet that knew his Way,
cauſed a piece of Poetry he had made for
him, to be engraven upon a great Marble
Stone; and when the Engraving was fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd,
he loaded a Camel with it, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
it to be carried to the <hi>Calife</hi>'s Gate,
and to wait for him. In the mean while, he
went to attend the <hi>Calife,</hi> and to ſpeak with
him about his Work, to know whether he
would be pleaſed to have the Marble Stone
brought him: No, anſwered the <hi>Calife,</hi>
I won't have it brought, but let's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſervations.</hi> The Agreement was, that he ſhould
have 5000 <hi>Aſpers,</hi> that is about 125 Livres, or about
10 <hi>l.</hi> which the <hi>Calife</hi> cauſed to be given to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.
But as this Reward was by no means propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable
both to his Pains and Expences, 'tis probable it
was rather Drachms, a ſmall Silver Money of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>life</hi>'s
Coin: ſo that the Sum was a little more conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable.</p>
            <p>This Piece of Poetry was one of thoſe that are called
by the Eaſtern Nations <hi>Cacideh;</hi> the ſhorteſt of which
is 50 Diſtichs, and the longeſt 100, more or leſs. The
two firſt Verſes rhime together, and the others but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternately,
all upon the ſame Rhime: ſo that the longeſt
are upon ſuch Terminations as afford more Rhimes
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61726:13"/>
than others. This ſort of Poetry is chiefly conſecrated
to the Praiſe of Princes and Great Men.</p>
            <p>20. <hi>Schahrah,</hi> Son to <hi>Timour,</hi> that is <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlan,</hi>
was a Prince naturally covetous and
ſparing. A Potter came to him, and asked
him, whether he held for true that Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
Doctrine, which teaches that all the
<hi>Muſſulmans</hi> are Brothers? <hi>Schahrah</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
He held it for true. Whereupon the
Potter reply'd, Since we are all Brothers, is
it not an Injuſtice you ſhould have ſo great a
Treaſure, and I ſhould ſtand in need of a
Farthing? Pray give me at leaſt a Brother's
Portion. <hi>Schahrah</hi> ordered a Silver Three-pence
to be given him: but not being ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with it, he ſaid, How is that? Shall I
have but ſo ſmall a Share in ſo great a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure?
<hi>Schahrah</hi> ſent him back, ſaying, Go
your way, and hold your Tongue; for your
Portion would not be ſo conſiderable, ſhould
all our Brothers know of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſervation.</hi> It is a Turkiſh Writer who here taxes
<hi>Schahrah</hi> with Covetouſneſs and Niggardlineſs: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
he was a potent Monarch; as will be ſeen by his
Hiſtory, which is tranſlated out of the Perſian into the
French Tongue by Mr. <hi>Galand.</hi> One thing only can make
him ſuſpected of the Vice he is charged with here, <hi>viz.</hi>
that the Learned ſtuck rather to the Princes his Sons,
than to him: but to excuſe him, it may be ſaid, that
he gave up himſelf wholly to the Government of his
Dominions, that reached from <hi>Perſia</hi> to <hi>China;</hi> ſo that
he had not ſo much Leaſure as particularly to examine
thoſe that deſerved to be rewarded.</p>

            <p>

            <p>22. In a Company before Sultan <hi>Mehem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
the 2d,</hi> Emperor of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> ſome
ſaid that <hi>Mirza Khan</hi> had promiſed 1000

ſaid, I ſhould quickly exhauſt my

            <p>

and though he had ſo mean an Opinion of
the Poets of his Court, yet there were already good
Turkiſh Poets in his time, as <hi>Letifi</hi> teſtifies.</p>
            <p>The word <hi>Mirza</hi> in <hi>Perſia,</hi> and <hi>India,</hi> ſignifies
<hi>the Son or Relation of a Soveraign,</hi> and is ſaid by

Name of the Prince here mentioned, and that he was
of <hi>Tamerlan</hi>'s Family, and had yet another Name beſides
thoſe of <hi>Mirza</hi> and <hi>Khan.</hi> The word <hi>Khan</hi> amongſt the
Tartars, ſignifies a great Monarch. Thoſe Turkiſh Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors
that are originally from <hi>Turkeſtan,</hi> that is part

23. The Houſe of an <hi>Imam</hi> was very far
from the <hi>Moſque</hi> in which he officiated.
The Mahometans that reſorted to it, told
him once; Your Houſe is too far, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
come every Night to the <hi>Moſque</hi> to ſay
Prayers an Hour and half after Sun-ſet, and
therefore we'll exempt you from it: We

            <p>24. A Mahometan that was frightfully
ugly, met with a Looking-glaſs in his way;
which he took up, and ſaw himſelf in it:
but perceiving himſelf ſo miſ-ſhapen, he
ſlung it down in a Rage, ſaying, Had'ſt

his Table. The Arabian did ſo, and began
to eat with an extraordinary Greedineſs.
The <hi>Calife</hi> being diſpleaſed at his Clown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhneſs,
ſaid, You are very cruel to cut that

The Jews ſhake alſo their Heads in the Synagogues,

What he would chooſe rather; either that

from time to time cauſed Faintings and
Tremblings, and all the Hair of his Body to

ask'd him, Whether he had not wrote Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,

then the Doctor ſaid, Now go home, thoſe

            <p>49. A Perſian Scribler read to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Poet <hi>Giami,</hi> a wretched <hi>Gazel</hi> of his
compoſure, and made him obſerve, how

               <hi>Obſervations.</hi> A <hi>Gazel</hi> is a Piece of Poetry much in
faſhion amongſt the Perſians and Turks: The two firſt
Verſes rhime together, and the firſt Verſe of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Diſtichs terminate on the Rhime of the firſt
Diſtich; but the ſecond Verſe does not rhime at all.
This Piece conſiſts at leaſt of 5 Diſtichs, and I have
ſeen ſome of 11, 12 and 13. Commonly the Poet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts
his Name in the laſt Diſtich or the laſt but one,
when the <hi>Gazel</hi> is ſomewhat long. All the Poets of
any note amongſt them, make a Series of <hi>Gazels</hi> rhimed
by Alphabetical Order; which when brought to a
Body, is call'd <hi>Divan.</hi> The very ſame word ſignifies
likewiſe a Body of People that make up a Council,
and withal the Place where they aſſemble. Thus at
<hi>the Port,</hi> they ſay, <hi>the Grand Vizier preſides at the</hi> Divan:
the Grand Vizier, the other Viziers, the two <hi>Cadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leskers,</hi>
the <hi>Reis Kitteb,</hi> and the <hi>Niſchanga</hi> meet thrice
a Week in the <hi>Divan,</hi> where they have each his Place.
Love is the ordinary Subject of <hi>Gazels:</hi> However, <hi>Haſis,
Giami,</hi> and other Perſian Poets, treat of the moſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime
Matters of myſtical Divinity, in their <hi>Gazels,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

            <p>
               <hi>Giami</hi> is one of the greateſt Perſian Poets. It appears
by his <hi>Bahariſtan,</hi> that he was moſt famous in the
Reign of <hi>Mirza Sultan Huſſein,</hi> the laſt of <hi>Tamerlan</hi>'s Race
who poſſeſs'd the Kingdoms of <hi>Khoraſſan</hi> and <hi>Perſia:</hi>
He died in the Year 898 of the <hi>Hegyra, of our Lord</hi>
1483. being 81 Years of Age, according to the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
of the Perſian Poets, written by <hi>Sami,</hi> a Prince of
the Family of the preſent <hi>Sophies</hi> of <hi>Perſia.</hi> He has
compoſed a great Number of Works in Verſe and
Proſe; and there are amongſt his Pieces of Poetry five
<hi>Divans,</hi> that is, five perfect Collections of <hi>Gazels</hi> by
Alphabetical Order. He is commonly call'd <hi>Mevlana
Giami: Mevlana</hi> being an Arabian Word that ſignifies
<hi>our Maſter,</hi> is a Title given to the Learned either in
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:61726:20"/>
Divinity, Law, or other Sciences; and is as a Sirname

            </p>
            <p>That <hi>Gazel</hi> in which there was no <hi>Elif,</hi> gives me oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion

as from <hi>Paris</hi> we make <hi>Pariſian.</hi> Thus <hi>Razis</hi> was
not an Arabian, but a Perſian; and if he be call'd an

a Horſe: A Jockey brought one that ſeem'd
fine and ſtrong, and the <hi>Chiaoux</hi> bought him.
Now ſometime after, he look'd into his
Mouth, and found 'twas an old Horſe: ſo
he ſold him off to another out of hand. I
ask'd him, Why he parted with the Horſe,
and why the other bought him? He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd;
He who bought it of me, is a young

could not uſe it. All the Unctions and Fomentations
the Phyſicians could think of, were applied in vain.
At laſt <hi>Gabriel</hi> was call'd; and being told, after what
Manner the Rigidity had ſeiz'd her, aſſur'd the <hi>Calife</hi>
he knew an infallible Means to cure her; only he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
he would not take amiſs what he was to do before
him and the whole Company, when the Lady ſhould
come. She came by the <hi>Calife</hi>'s Order; and aſſoon as
ſhe appear'd, <hi>Gabriel</hi> ran to her, and ſtooping took
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:61726:25"/>
hold of the lower end of her Coat, as though he would
have taken it up. The Lady ſurpriz'd at it, her Colour
chang'd, and ſhe ſtretch'd down that Arm, which was
ſtiff before, to the very bottom of her Coat, leſt the
Phyſician ſhould take it up. Preſently he cried out to
the <hi>Calife,</hi> that ſhe was cur'd. And indeed from that
Moment, the Lady mov'd her Arm as freely as if it
had never been hurt. The <hi>Calife</hi> was ſo pleaſed with it,
that he order'd 500000 <hi>Drachms</hi> to the Phyſician.
Thoſe <hi>Drachms</hi> were a Silver Coin of the Value of about
a <hi>Shilling;</hi> ſo that the whole Sum amounted to 350000
Livers; that is, 26923 Pounds one Shilling and ſix

            <p>62. The <hi>Calife Vathek Billa</hi> angled upon

Wretch be gone, thou marreſt my

Uſage, ſaid to the <hi>Calife;</hi> Emperor of the

diſcourſing with him, inſenſibly rip'd it up

bold to challenge him: The Maſter accepted
the Challenge, and they both appeared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Sultan,</hi> and a great Crowd of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
The Maſter, who knew very well
that his Scholar was ſtronger than he, gave
him no time to make an Advantage of it,
but preſently lifted him up very artfully from
the Ground with both Hands, and threw him
over his Head upon the Ground, which caus'd
the Spectators to give a joyful Shout. The
<hi>Sultan</hi> rewarded the Maſter and blam'd the
Scholar, who yet ſaid he had not been over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
by Force, but meerly by a Trick of
the Art, that had been concealed from him.
The Maſter replied; I grant it, I had kept
it for ſuch a day as this, according to the
Maxim of the Wiſe: That how great
ſoever our Affections be for a Man, we muſt
never give him ſuch an Advantage over us,
as might cauſe him to prevail if he became

            <p>80. A King paſſed by a <hi>Derviche,</hi> who
did not ſo much as lift up his Head to look
upon him. The King being one of thoſe
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:61726:31"/>
who are offended at the leaſt thing, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed
at this want of Reſpect, and ſaid:
This ſort of dirty Fellows in Rags are meer
Brutes. The Vizier alſo ſaid to the <hi>Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viche,</hi>
Why do you not pay to the King the
Reſpect that is due to him? The <hi>Derviche</hi>
anſwer'd; Let the King expect Veneration
from thoſe that expect his Favour: but
know that Kings are eſtabliſhed for the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of their Subjects; but that the ſame
Obligation lies not upon Subjects to pay
Reſpect to Kings. The King having heard
his bold Diſcourſe, deſired the <hi>Derviche</hi> to

<hi>Derviche,</hi> that you may let me alone.</p>

            <p>81. <hi>Nouſchirvan</hi> in his Council was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating

it, and being asked, Why he had
preferr'd the King's Opinion to thoſe of the

Affair in Hand is uncertain, and therefore
I thought it was better to follow the King's
Advice, that we might be free from his

Anger if the thing proved unſucceſsful.</p>
            <p>82. A wandring Raſcal who had aſſum'd

that he came from that Pilgrimage.
Having intruded into the Court, he read to
the King a piece of Poetry, of which he
pretended to be the Author. One of the

thoſe Nations ſeem the more excuſable for having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd

my Father, near whom I was; See, Father,

him, That the King was in Paradiſe for

            <p>93. A certain <hi>Derviche</hi> who eat 10 Pound

            <p>96. One having ask'd a certain Learned
Man, what he thought of the Diſtribution
of Bread ſettled upon the <hi>Derviches?</hi> He
was anſwer'd, that if the <hi>Derviches</hi> did eat
with a Deſign to make themſelves ſtronger
for the Service of God, they might lawfully
eat thereof; but if they become <hi>Derviches</hi>
only that they may eat, they eat their own
Damnation.</p>
            <p>97. A <hi>Derviche</hi> having left his Convent,
and betaken himſelf to hear the Lectures of
a Profeſſor in a certain College; I ask'd
him, (ſays the Author of <hi>Guliſtan</hi>) ſeeing he
had chang'd his Profeſſion, What Difference
he found betwixt a Learned Man and a
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:61726:36"/>
               <hi>Derviche?</hi> He anſwer'd, That a <hi>Derviche</hi>

Tempeſts of the World, but a Learned Man
did alſo withdraw others.</p>

               <hi>Obſervation.</hi> The <hi>Derviches</hi> amongſt the Mahometans
don't enter into ſuch ſtrict Vows as the Religious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the Papiſts; but do freely quit their Habit,
Rule and Cloiſter, to embrace what other Profeſſion
they pleaſe. The Mahometans have a great Number
of Colleges founded by Sultans, and private Perſons;
where there are Penſions ſettled upon Profeſſors to
teach thoſe things which are neceſſary for acquiring
the Title of <hi>Learned,</hi> at which they arrive by degrees,
as our Doctors do in the Univerſities of <hi>Europe;</hi> and the
Sciences which they learn, are all of them concerning
Religion and the Laws, which amongſt them are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable.</p>
            <p>98. A Mahometan who had given many
Proofs of his extraordinary Strength, being
in ſuch a Paſſion that he was ſtark mad, and
foam'd at the Mouth, a certain Sage who
knew him, ſeeing him in that Condition,
enquir'd what was the Matter; and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
that ſome Body had ſpoke ill of

            <p>99. An old Man of <hi>Bagdat</hi> having mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
his Daughter to a Shoe-maker, he
kiſs'd her ſo hard, that he bit her Lip till

it bled again: whereupon the old Man told
him, that his Daughter's Lips were not of

            <p>101. A <hi>Derviche</hi> ſpeaking to a King who
had no great Eſteem for thoſe of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
ſays to him, We have neither the
Might nor Power which you have in this
World, yet we live more contentedly than
you; Death will at laſt make us equal, and
at the Day of Judgment we ſhall have the
Advantage to be above you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſervation.</hi> The Mahometans do expect a Day of
univerſal Judgment as well as we, for the Puniſhment
of the Wicked, and the Reward of the Juſt.</p>
            <p>102. In the City of <hi>Halep</hi> a poor African
ſaid to ſome rich Merchants, who were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled
together; Gentlemen, if you who
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:61726:37"/>
are rich, would do what in Equity you are
obliged to do; and if we poor Men could be
therewith contented, there would be no
more Beggars in the World.</p>
            <p>103. There were two Princes, Sons to a
King of <hi>Egypt;</hi> the one of which applied
himſelf to the Study of Sciences, and the
other to heap up Riches: The latter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
King, and upbraided his Brother as
having but little of the World for his ſhare.
But the Prince replied, Brother, I bleſs God
that I have the Inheritance of the Prophets,
that is, Wiſdom, for my Share; whereas
your's is only the Lot of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and <hi>Haman,
viz.</hi> the Kingdom of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſervation.</hi> This <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> according to the Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan
Traditions, is he who was drowned in the <hi>Red-Sea;</hi>
and <hi>Haman</hi> was his Chief Miniſter, who put his
wicked Deſigns in Execution. He was alſo, according
to them, the firſt of the Egyptian Kings named <hi>Pharaoh,</hi>
and of a very low Extract. His Hiſtory they give
thus; That his Father was one <hi>Maſſib</hi> a Cow-keeper,
who dying, and leaving him an Infant, his Mother
bred him a Joiner; but not liking that Trade, he put
himſelf Prentice to a Coſter-monger, but did not conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
long at that Imployment neither. Then he fell a
Merchandizing; but was alſo diſguſted with that way
of Living, becauſe at a certain Paſs they exacted a Toll
of him equal in value to his Merchandiſe; ſo that out
of Spite, he turn'd Highway-man. At laſt he found
Means to poſt himſelf at one of the Gates of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis
of <hi>Egypt,</hi> todemand a Toll in the King's Name
of every thing that came in or went out, tho without
any Warrant; but being diſcovered, by exacting the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:61726:38"/>
ſame Toll on the Corps of one of the King's Daughters
who was going to be interred, he redeem'd himſelf
from Death by the great Sums which he had amaſs'd.
Fortune however did not abandon him, he found a
Way ſtill to be made Captain of the Watch; and
when advanced to that Charge, had an expreſs Order
from the King of <hi>Egppt</hi> to put to Death all thoſe whom
he found abroad in the Night. The King himſelf going
abroad one Night to communicate ſome ſecret Affair to
one of his Miniſters, without giving notice thereof to
<hi>Pharaoh,</hi> was ſeiz'd by the Watch; who would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
him to be the King, and brought him before <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,</hi>
who would not believe him neither, but forc'd
him to a-light from his Horſe, and cut off his Head:
And after the Action, having diſcovered that it was
really the King, finding himſelf ſtrong enough he went
and forc'd the Palace, and declar'd himſelf King. He
introduc'd Idol-worſhip, and would be own'd as God
himſelf. In fine, he purſued the Iſraelites, and was
drown'd in the <hi>Red-Sea.</hi> All theſe Particulars are to be
found in the Hiſtory of the Prophets of <hi>Keſani.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>104. A King of <hi>Perſia</hi> ſent a Phyſician to
<hi>Mahomet,</hi> who ſtaid ſome Years in <hi>Arabia</hi>
without any Practice; whereat being ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grieved,
he preſented himſelf to <hi>Mahomet,</hi>
and, complaining, told him, that thoſe who
had a Right to command him, had ſent him
thither to profeſs Phyſick, but that no Body
had made uſe of him; ſo that he had never
ſound any Occaſion to let them ſee what he
could do. <hi>Mahomet</hi> anſwer'd, It is the
Cuſtom of our Country not to eat but when
we are hungry, and to leave off with an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite.
The Phyſician replied, That's the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:61726:38"/>
Way to preſerve Health, and have no need
of a Doctor; and taking his Leave, return'd
to <hi>Perſia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>105. <hi>Ardeſchir Babekan</hi> King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> ask'd
of an Arabian Phyſician, how much Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was needful <hi>per diem?</hi> who anſwer'd,
One hundred Drachms: the King ſaid, that
was not enough to furniſh Strength. The
Phyſician replied, that's enough to carry
you; but if you take more, you muſt car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſervation. Ardeſchir Babekan</hi> was the firſt of that
Race of the Kings of <hi>Perſia,</hi> who reign'd until ſuch
time as they were expell'd by the Mahometans. His
Father's Name was <hi>Saſan;</hi> whence it came to paſs,
that he and the following Kings were call'd <hi>Saſanians,</hi>
according to the Antient Hiſtory of the Perſians, or
what remains of it in the Arabian Writings.</p>
            <p>106. Two <hi>Sophies</hi> of the City of <hi>Vaſete</hi> took
Meat of a Butcher upon Credit, and did not
pay him; whereupon he dunn'd them every
Day with ill Language, which put 'em to
mighty Shame; but they bore it patiently,
becauſe they had no Money. A certain witty
Man who perceiv'd how it was with them,
told that it was much eaſier to entertain
their Appetites with the hopes of good
Cheer, than to entertain the Butcher with
the hopes of his Pay.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſervations.</hi> The <hi>Sophies</hi> are the moſt eminent and

            <p>107. An officious Mahometan entertain'd
a <hi>Derviche</hi> belonging to a very rich Man, and
told him he was perſwaded that that Man
would be very bountiful to him if he were
well inform'd of his Poverty; nay, he was at

To which he anſwer'd, I did not like his

            <p>108. <hi>Hatemtai</hi> was in his time the moſt

            <p>109. A certain King having need of a Sum
of Money to give the Tartars to prevent
their Incurſions ino his Country, underſtood
that a Beggar had a very conſiderable Sum
by him; and ſending for him, demanded
part of it in loan, promiſing that it ſhould
be repaid as ſoon as the Revenues came in.
The Beggar anſwered, That it would be
very unworthy in his Majeſty to defile his
Hands with that Money which he had ſcrap'd
together by Begging. To which the King
replied, That he needed not trouble him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
about that; it was to be given to the

            <p>110. The Author of <hi>Guliſtan,</hi> from whom
we have had ſome of the preceding Articles,
ſpeaks of himſelf in the following Terms:
I knew, ſays he, a Merchant who travelled
with a hundred Camels loaden with Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize,
and had forty Slaves and Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks
to wait upon him. One Day he got me
along with him into his Ware-houſe, and
entertain'd me the whole Night with a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
which had no end: He told me that
he had ſuch a Man for his Partner at <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtan,</hi>
ſuch and ſuch Funds in the <hi>Indies.</hi>
Then he ſhew'd me a Bond due to him for
ſo much Money in ſuch a Province, and told
me that he had ſuch a Man bound for ſuch
another Sum; and then changing his Note,
he ſaid that he deſign'd to ſettle himſelf in
<hi>Alexandria,</hi> becauſe there they had a good
Air: but correcting himſelf forthwith, No,
ſays he, I will not go thither, the African
Sea is too dangerous; I have a Mind to
take one Journey more, and after that will
retire to a Corner of the World, and leave
off Trading. I ask'd him what Journey that
was? He anſwered, that he would carry
Sulphur from <hi>Perſia</hi> into <hi>China,</hi> where it is
ſold at a great Price; from thence I will
bring <hi>China</hi>-Ware to ſell in <hi>Greece;</hi> and

and when I have done this, I will bid
farewel to Trade, which is carried on by
ſo many toilſom Journies, and ſpend the
reſt of my days in a Shop. He ſpoke ſo much
upon this Subject, that at laſt he made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
weary, and concluded with an Addreſs
to me to tell him ſomething of what I had
ſeen and learn'd in my Travels: To which I
anſwered, by asking him if he had ever
heard what a certain Traveller ſaid when
he fell from his Camel in the Deſart of
<hi>Gour, viz.</hi> That there were only two things
which were capable of filling the covetous
Man's Eye, <hi>viz.</hi> Sobriety, or the Earth
which is thrown upon him after his Death.</p>

               <hi>Obſervations.</hi> This Narrative is not only excellent
for the Character which it gives of a Merchant who ſets
no Bounds to his Avarice, but is alſo curious in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting

What he thought of the Brocard with which

112. An Highway-Man ask'd a Beggar if
he were not aſhamed to hold out his Hand
to every Body that he met, and beg Money?
The Beggar anſwered, It is better to hold

have it cut off for robbing a Penny.</p>
            <p>113. A Merchant having had a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

            <p>118. A Poet going to ſee a Captain of Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
repeated ſome Verſes which he had
made in his Commendation; but inſtead of
being pleas'd with his Verſes, he ordered
him to be ſtrip'd and chas'd out of the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage,
and ſet the Dogs after him. The Poet
ſtoop'd to take up a Stone to defend himſelf
againſt the Dogs; but it was frozen ſo hard
that he could not pull it up: whereupon the
Poet ſaid, Theſe Highway-Men are wicked
People, they let looſe the Dogs, and faſten

witty Saying made the Captain of the Highway-Men
laugh, who heard it from a Window; ſo that he call'd
to the Poet to ask what he pleas'd, and he ſhould have
it. The Poet anſwered him, If you have a mind to do
me a Kindneſs, I demand no more but the Garment
that you have robb'd me of: The Captain of the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way-Men
taking Compaſſion on him, did not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore

me, that God had often heard his Prayers in
a Valley not far from the Town, where
great Devotion uſed to be perform'd near a

Words, ſaid, with a low Voice, to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rades,

            <p>124. A certain Sage ſaid to an Indian who

            <p>

Farrier for a Cure, who applied the ſame
Plaiſter to him that he us'd to do to the

and made his Complaints to the Courts of

            <p>126. A Son being ſat in a Church-yard
on the Tomb of his Father, who had left him
a great Eſtate, diſcours'd thus to the Son of

his Epitaph writ in Characters of Gold,

            <p>
               <hi>Obſervation.</hi> It is the Cuſtom of the Mahometans to
put one Stone at the Foot, and another at the Head of
the Tombs of their Deceaſed; and according to the
Perſon's Eſtate, thoſe Stones are the more or leſs po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
or adorn'd: and often-times they put fine white
Marble inſtead of the Stones; and then the Marble or
Stone is in form of a Column, and very often with a
Turban cut out upon the Head thereof, conformable
to the Profeſſion of the Deceaſed; or with a Woman's
Head-dreſs if it be that of a Woman: and upon the
Column there is uſually an Epitaph in Sculpture, or
in Characters engraven in Relief; for I do not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that I have ſeen any engraven hollow, as we do u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually
in <hi>Europe.</hi> The Epitaph does for the moſt part
contain the Profeſſion of the Mahometan Religion, the
Name and Quality of the Deceaſed, with an Invitation
to thoſe that paſs by to repeat the firſt Chapter of the
<hi>Alcoran</hi> for the repoſe of his Soul. And ſome of them
are in Characters of Gold. The richer Sort are at great
Expence in Repreſentations, and in the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Buildings; as Moſques, Hoſpitals, Fountains and
Schools, with Revenues for their Maintenance. The
publick Burying places are always without the Gates of
the Cities; and none are interred in the Cities but
Princes, and Perſons of great Note, who are buried
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:61726:45"/>
with their Families near the Moſques which they found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
This ſame Method is obſerved in Villages and
Country Towns, where the Burying-places are always
a-part from the reſt of the Houſes, and along by the
High-way, that thoſe who paſs by may be thereby ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
to pray for the Souls of thoſe who are interred
there: And beſides the Stones and Marble, there are
Places where the Friends of the Deceaſed plant Roſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary,
or ſome other Plant, at the Head and Feet of the
Deceaſed: And in ſome Places, Women go on Fridays
and lament over the Sepulchres of their Husbands, or
other Relations and Friends.</p>
            <p>127. The <hi>Great Iskender,</hi> or <hi>Alexander the
Great,</hi> having taken a certain Town, he
was inform'd that there was a Philoſopher
of great Note in the ſame; and ordering
him to be brought before him, he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maz'd
to ſee him ſuch a deformed Fellow,
and could not forbear to utter ſome words,
which ſignified as much: The Philoſopher
underſtood him, and although he was in
great diſorder, becauſe of the Sacking of his
Country; yet anſwered, ſmiling, It is true
that I am deformed; but you muſt conſider
my Body as the Scabbard, whereof my Soul
is the Sword, and that it is the Sword which
cuts and not the Scabbard.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſervation.</hi> I don't remember this Paſſage of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Great</hi> in any Greek or Latin Author, nor never
heard that any of 'em did mention it; neither do I find
that any of the Philoſophers, whoſe Names are come to
our Knowledg, did ever mention it; and in effect, it ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
more of the Sagacity of the Eaſtern People, than
of the Greeks. But however that is, it deſerves to be
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:61726:45"/>
remark'd; and the Eaſterlings not knowing the true
Author, may be allow'd to aſcribe it to <hi>Alexander the
Great,</hi> whom they have rank'd amongſt the Heroes of
their Country.</p>
            <p>128. A Philoſopher ſaid, I have writ 50
Volumes of Philoſophy, but they did not
pleaſe me; I extracted 60 Maxims out of
them, neither did they give me Satisfaction:
In ſine, I pick'd out 4 from amongſt thoſe
60, wherein I found what I ſought for,
which are as follow, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Never eſteem Women ſo much as you do
Men; for a Woman is always a Woman,
let her Birth and Quality be never ſo
good.</p>
            <p>Let your Riches be as great as poſſible,
ſet not your Heart upon them, becauſe the
Revolutions of Time ſcatter them.</p>
            <p>Diſcover your Secrets to no Body, no not
to your moſt intimate Friends; becauſe it
happens oft-times that Friends fall out, and
then become Enemies to one another.</p>
            <p>Set your Heart upon nothing in the World
but Knowledg, accompanied with good
Works, for you will be found criminal at
the Hour of Death if you deſpiſe that.</p>
            <p>129. The Philoſophers of the <hi>Indies</hi> had a
Library ſo large, that no fewer than 1000
Camels were ſufficient to tranſport it. Their
King wiſh'd that they would make an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgment
of it; and then they reduced it
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:61726:46"/>
to 100 Camels Load; and after many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Retrenchments, this Abridgment was
brought into four Maxims: The Firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
Kings, ſaying that they ought to be
juſt. The Second reſpected the People, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that they ought to be pliable and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.
The Third regarded Health, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
that we ſhould not eat but when we
are hungry: And the Fourth recommended
it to Women to turn away their Eyes from
Strangers, and to hide their Countenance
from thoſe to whom they were not allowed
to ſhow it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſervation.</hi> As to that of the Library carried by Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels,
<hi>Saheb</hi> Son to <hi>Ibad,</hi> who was Grand Vizier to two
Kings of <hi>Perſia</hi> of the Boian Race, a great Lover of
Learning, and who died in the 385 of the <hi>Hegyra,</hi> and
the 995 of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> had a Library which was always car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
after him by 400 Camels, even in thoſe Campagns
which he was obliged to make. The Grand Vizier
<hi>Kupruli,</hi> who was killed at the Battel of <hi>Salankement,</hi>
had a well furniſh'd Library, and never went to any
Place without ſeveral Coffers full of Books; for he
ſpent all the Time that he could ſpare from his Buſineſs
in Reading or Teaching, which he practiſed particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
at the beginning of this laſt War with the Emperor,
when he had no Imployment till after the Death of
the Grand Vizier <hi>Cara Muſtapha Pacha,</hi> who procured
his Diſgrace becauſe he was the only Man in Council
who oppoſed him as to the Declaring of that War:
and during that Interval, he gave a Leſſon every Day to
60 Scholars, whom he did alſo maintain and clothe.
There are many perhaps who will not believe this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they have not been accuſtomed to ſee ſuch things;
but this was tranſacted upon a Theatre publick enough,

130. Four potent Monarchs, in different
Places of the Earth, did each of them utter a
Remarkable Saying much to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.
One of them, a King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> ſaid,
That he never repented of having held his
Peace; but that he had repented full ſore of
ſeveral things that he had ſpoken. Another,
being Emperor of <hi>Greece,</hi> ſaid, My Power
over that which I have not ſpoken, is far
greater than over that which I have ſpoken,
for I can no more conceal that which I have
once uttered. The third, being an Emperor
of <hi>China,</hi> ſaid, It is much more vexatious to
ſpeak thoſe things which we ought not to
ſpeak, than eaſy to conceal our Repentance
for having ſaid it. The laſt was an Indian
King, who expreſſed himſelf thus; I am not
Maſter of that which I have once ſpoken, but
I diſpoſe of what I have not ſpoken as I
pleaſe; and can ſay it, or not ſay it, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as I liſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſervation.</hi> Inſtead of the Emperor of <hi>Greece,</hi> the
Text of <hi>Guliſtan</hi> ſays, Emperor of <hi>Roum;</hi> which is the
ſame thing, becauſe in general under the Name of <hi>Roum,</hi>
the Eaſterlings underſtood all thoſe Countries which
were poſſeſſed by the Romans: and though from the
Romans thoſe Countries paſſed to the Greeks, yet they
always retain'd the Name of <hi>Rome</hi> becauſe of their firſt
Original; at which we have no reaſon to wonder: For
ever ſince the Time of the Romans, the Greeks have
been called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and call themſelves ſo to this

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:61726:47"/>
in <hi>Anatolia,</hi> whoſe Capital was <hi>Iconium;</hi> and this did
occaſion their aſſuming to themſelves the Title of
Kings of <hi>Roum.</hi> The Reaſon of this was, becauſe the
Emperor of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> having defended that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
a long time againſt the Mahometans, who called
them by the Name of the Emperors of <hi>Roum,</hi> the
firſt who ſeis'd that Country, and rendred themſelves
Maſters thereof, afterward affected to be call'd by that
ſame Name.</p>
            <p>131. Three Sages, one of them a Greek,
another an Indian, and the third <hi>Bouzour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gemhir,</hi>
diſcours'd together in preſence of
the King of <hi>Perſia;</hi> and the Subject of their
Converſation was upon that Queſtion, <hi>viz.</hi>
Which of all things was the moſt grievous?
The Grecian Sage anſwer'd, Old Age over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed
with Infirmities, Poverty and
Want. The Indian Sage anſwer'd, Sickneſs,
and to be impatient under it. But <hi>Bouzour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gemhir</hi>
replied; The Approach of Death
under want of good Works: to whom all
the Company agreed.</p>
            <p>132. A Phyſician being ask'd, What was
the beſt Time to eat; replied, It's beſt for
the rich Man to eat when he is hungry, and
for the poor Man to eat when he can get it.</p>
            <p>133. A Philoſopher forbid his Son ever to
go out in a Morning without eating; for in
that Caſe he would be of a better Temper
of Mind; and if affronted by any Body,
would ſuffer it more patiently: for Hunger,
ſays he, dries and turns the Brains up-ſide
down.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:61726:47"/>
               <hi>Obſervation.</hi> I know not whether the Eaſterlings do
it becauſe of this Maxim, which is very true and full
of good Senſe; but generally they eat betimes, and
ordinarily before their Morning-Prayers, which they
ſay before Sun-riſing: and what they eat then is Milk,
Liquid Confections, and other cool things, but no Meat;
after which they drink Coffee. It is certain that the
ſerious, cloudy, and melancholy Air which one may
perceive in thoſe that are faſting in a Morning, does
but too much prove the Neceſſity of putting this
Maxim in practice.</p>
            <p>134. <hi>Bouzourgemhir</hi> being ask'd, Who was
the juſteſt King? anſwered, It is he under
whoſe Reign good Men are moſt at eaſe,
and ill Men are moſt afraid.</p>
            <p>135. The Arabians ſaid to <hi>Hagiage</hi> their
Governour, who treated them roughly;
Fear God, and don't torment the <hi>Muſſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
with your vexatious Doings. <hi>Hagiage</hi>
who was eloquent, went up to the Seat of
Juſtice: and haranging them, ſaid, God
hath ſet me over you to be your Governour;
and though I ſhould die, you would be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
the happier, for God hath many Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
ſuch as I am; and when I am dead,
perhaps I ſhall be ſucceeded by a Governour
more wicked than I.</p>
            <p>136. <hi>Alexander the Great</hi> depriv'd an
Officer of his Imployment, and gave him
another of leſs Value; with which the Officer
was contented: Some-time after <hi>Alexander
the Great</hi> ſaw the ſaid Officer, and ask'd
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:61726:48"/>
him, How he took with his New Office?
He anſwered reſpectfully, It is not the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
which makes him who exerciſes the
ſame, any thing the more noble or conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable;
but the Office becomes noble and
conſiderable by the good Conduct of him
who is in it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſervation. Alexander the Great</hi> was very well ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with this Anſwer, and reſtored the Officer to his
firſt Employment. In the Eaſtern Courts which are
very ſtormy, the Courtiers have need of theſe ſorts of
Examples, to prevent their falling into deſpair if they
happen to be obliged to go back, after having been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced

            <p>137. A certain <hi>Derviche</hi> us'd to viſit a Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
very familiarly; but he obſerv'd one
Day that the Sultan did not look ſo kindly
upon him as he had uſually done, and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what might be the Cauſe, conjectured
that it might be becauſe he came to him too
often: whereupon he forbore to viſit, and
make his court to him as he was wont to do.
Some time after the Sultan met him, and
ask'd, Why he forbore to viſit him? The
<hi>Derviche</hi> anſwered, I thought it better to
have your Majeſty ask me that Queſtion,
than to witneſs your Diſpleaſure at my ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

            <p>138. A Favourite . . . . . . to

taking notice of it, demanded of him what
Regard Subjects ought to have for their

Night before they are to have the Honour

Barley there.</p>
            <p>139. <hi>Nouſchirvan,</hi> King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> having
treated all his Court with a magnificent
Feaſt on the Day of <hi>Nevrouz,</hi> obſerv'd du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Treat, that a Prince, one of his
Kinſmen, hid one of the Golden Cups under
his Arm, but took no notice of it. When
the Gueſts roſe from Table, the Officer who
had the Charge of the Golden Veſſels, cried,
Let no Man go out, for he miſs'd one of his
Golden Cups, and muſt have it again. <hi>Nouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chirvan</hi>
anſwered, Don't trouble your ſelf
about that, he that took it will not reſtore
it, and he who ſaw him take it will not tell
who is the Thief.</p>

               <hi>Obſervation. Nevrouz</hi> is the Day when the Sun en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into <hi>Aries,</hi> and ſignifies the New Day, becauſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Perſians it is the firſt Day of the Solar Year;
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:61726:49"/>
which was obſerv'd in the Reigns of the antient Perſian
Kings, but the Mahometans obſerve the Lunar Year.
Yet the Perſians continue ever ſince to celebrate that
Solemn Feſtival upon the Day of <hi>Nevrouz,</hi> by a great
Treat to their Court; and at that time they drink all
their Wine in Golden Cups, as may be ſeen by the
Relations of the Travellers of our Time.</p>
            <p>140. <hi>Hormouz</hi> King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> Son of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>por,</hi>
bought a Bargain of Pearls, which coſt
him 100000 Pieces of Gold, but he was not
pleas'd with them. One Day his Grand Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier
told him that a Merchant offered 200000
for them, and that the Gain being ſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable,
he would do well to ſell them, ſeeing
his Majeſty did not like them. <hi>Hormouz</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
100000 Pieces of Gold which we
have disburs'd, is a ſmall thing for us; and
the other 100000 which you propoſe, is a
Gain too inconſiderable for a King: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
if we play the Merchant, who muſt
act the King's Part, and what will become
of the Merchants?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſervation.</hi> There were four Kings of <hi>Perſia</hi> named
<hi>Hormouz,</hi> according to the Catalogue that we have in
the Eaſtern Hiſtories; and he who is mentioned here,
was the firſt of the Name, and third of the fourth,
and laſt Race of the Antient Kings of <hi>Perſia;</hi> which the
ſame Hiſtorians call <hi>Saſanians,</hi> from <hi>Saſan</hi> Father of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſchir
Babecan</hi> the firſt King of that Race. <hi>Sapor</hi> his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
caus'd <hi>Tchendi Sapor</hi> in the <hi>Khouziſtan</hi> to be built,

we ſpoke before. There was another <hi>Sapor</hi> King of
<hi>Perſia</hi> before this; but he was of the Aſcanian Race, as
the Eaſterlings call it, and are the ſame whom we call
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:61726:49"/>
Arſacides. He was Succeſſor to <hi>Ask,</hi> who gave the
Name to all the Race, and rendred himſelf ſo formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
to the Romans. Of <hi>Ask</hi> the Greeks and Romans
made <hi>Aſak,</hi> and from <hi>Aſack, Arſack;</hi> whence came

            <p>141. During the Minority of <hi>Sapor,</hi> Son to
<hi>Hormouz</hi> King of <hi>Perſia, Tair</hi> Prince of the
Arabians made a cruel War upon the Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;
wherein he pillaged the Capital of the
Kingdom, and made <hi>Sapor</hi>'s Siſter a Slave.
But when <hi>Sapor</hi> came of Age to govern him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
he attacked <hi>Tair,</hi> and took him in a
Fortreſs by the Treachery of <hi>Metaca</hi> his
own Daughter, who opened the Gate of the
Fortreſs; and having rid himſelf of <hi>Tair,</hi>
he made a great Slaughter of the Arabians:
and being at laſt wearied of his Butchery,
that he might render his Cruelty ſo much
the greater by a lingring Death, he ordered
that they ſhould only break the Shoulder-Bones
of ſuch as they met. <hi>Melik,</hi> one of
<hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Anceſtors, ask'd him, What Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſity
it was that inſpir'd him with ſo much
Cruelty againſt the Arabians? <hi>Sapor</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
The Aſtrologers have told me, that
the Deſtroyer of the Kings of <hi>Perſia</hi> was to
be born amongſt the Arabians; and it is in
hatred of him, that I exerciſe this Cruelty
whereof you complain. <hi>Melik</hi> replied, It
may be that the Aſtrologers are miſtaken;
and if it ſhould happen as they ſay, it were
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:61726:50"/>
better for you to cauſe this Butchery to
ceaſe, that ſo he may entertain leſs Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice

of the Name of the Race of the <hi>Saſanians,</hi> as his Father
<hi>Hormouz</hi> was in like manner the <hi>2d</hi> of that Name of that

brought before a <hi>Calife;</hi> who commanded
that his Right-hand ſhould be cut off, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that ſo the <hi>Muſſulmans</hi> might not be

Highway-Man begg'd the <hi>Calife</hi>'s Mercy,
ſaying, God made me with both Hands,
I pray you don't ſuffer me to be made Left-handed.
The <hi>Calife</hi> commanded ſtill to cut
off his Hand, for it was againſt the Will of
God that Robbers ſhould be ſuffered. The

O Emperor of the Faithful, he is my Son,

            <p>143. A Criminal being brought to a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>life,</hi>
he condemned him to the Puniſhment
which he deſerved. The Criminal ſays to
the <hi>Calife,</hi> O Emperor of the Faithful, it is
Juſtice to take Vengeance for a Crime, but
it is a Vertue not to revenge one's ſelf; and
if it be ſo, it is not ſutable to the Dignity
of a <hi>Calife</hi> to prefer Vengeance to Vertue.
The <hi>Calife</hi> being pleas'd with the ingenious
Saying, pardon'd him.</p>

By the good Treatment which I always

Amity which they had for me.</p>
            <p>147. <hi>Alexander the Great</hi> being with his
Generals, one of them ſaid, Sir, God hath
given us a great and potent Empire; take
many Wives, that ſo having divers Sons,
your Name may be preſerv'd to Poſterity.
<hi>Alexander</hi> anſwered, It is not the Sons who

Neither ſhould it become ſuch a great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror

When he came of Age to reign himſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <hi>Obſervation.</hi> The Eaſtern People have a Collection
of Tables under the Name of <hi>Locman,</hi> whom they call
<hi>the Wiſe,</hi> and give much the ſame Account of him that
the Greeks do of <hi>Aeſop;</hi> but they do neither agree as
to the Time when he flouriſh'd, nor his Country:
ſome hold that he was one of the Patriarchs, and <hi>Job</hi>'s
Siſter's Son; others write, that he was contemporary
with <hi>David,</hi> and was 30 Years at his Court; but moſt
ſay, that he was an Abyſſine, and by Conſequence a
Black, and Slave to a Merchant. And all agree, that
he was a Man of conſummate Prudence and Wiſdom,
and endued with an extraordinary Quickneſs of Wit.
His Tomb is according to them at <hi>Remlah,</hi> the ſame
that we call <hi>Ramah</hi> in the Holy Land, betwixt <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>
and <hi>Joppa. Mahomet</hi> ſpeaks of him in the <hi>31ſt</hi> Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

which is called the Sourate of <hi>Locman.</hi>

Sword; return then to the Battel, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
that you fall a Martyr if you be ſlain.
<hi>Abdullah</hi> anſwered, Mother, I am not afraid
of Death, but hate to have my Head cut off
after I am dead. His Mother replied, Son,
the Sheep after its Throat is cut, feels no Pain

            <p>The Mahometans never make War but ſome way or
other Religion is concern'd in it, and therefore they
look upon all thoſe who are killed as Martyrs.</p>
            <p>161. The <hi>Caliph Mehdi,</hi> Father of <hi>Caliph

            <p>
               <hi>Obſervation.</hi> According to the Mahometan Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the Temple of <hi>Mecca</hi> was the firſt Temple conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated

            <p>162. The <hi>Caliph Haroun Erreſchid</hi> having

him of an Apoplexy, made him his Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,

The latter guards my Body, but <hi>Bakht Jeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choua</hi>

Pardons, and ſaid, If it were known what

would make Application to me to feel the

            <p>
               <hi>Obſervation. Mamoun</hi> was not only a ſweet-natur'd,
mild and merciful Prince, as appears by this Piece of
his Hiſtory, but alſo very liberal and skilful in the Art

all the <hi>Caliphs;</hi> and being an Admirer of Philoſophy
and the Mathematicks, caus'd ſeveral Books of thoſe
Sciences to be tranſlated from the Greek and Syriack
into Arabick. He was alſo well verſed in Aſtronomy,
and ordered ſeveral Aſtronomical Tables to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
which were called <hi>Mamoun</hi>'s Tables.</p>
            <p>164. The <hi>Caliph Vathik Billah</hi> being at

His Father to whom he ſucceeded was called <hi>Mutaſſem
Billah.</hi> He was valiant and bountiful, and being a
Lover of Poeſie, he always made Poets welcome to his

Years and ſome Months, and died in the Year of the
<hi>Hegira</hi> 231. and of Jeſus Chriſt 845.</p>
            <p>165. The <hi>Caliph Muterid Billah</hi> ſtood in

Upon this Frankneſs the <hi>Caliph</hi> ask'd

at the Tomb of <hi>Ali Riza,</hi> when one of his
Brothers rebelled againſt him: as he came
from Prayers, he ask'd of his Grand Vizier,
if he could gueſs what he had prayed to
God for? The Grand Vizier anſwered,
You have prayed that he would grant you
the Victory againſt your Brother. The
Sultan replied, I did not pray ſo, but thus,
<q>Lord, if my Brother be more ſit to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
the <hi>Muſſulmans</hi> than I, give him the

               <hi>Obſervation.</hi> Thoſe Sultans or Kings called <hi>Selgiucides</hi>

a mighty Inundation of Turks who paſſed the <hi>Oxus</hi> into
the <hi>Khoraſſan</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Mahmoud Sebecteghin,</hi> who
is mentioned before. <hi>Dogrulbeg,</hi> Grandſon to <hi>Selgiouc,</hi>
began their Empire, which was divided into divers
Branches, in the <hi>429th</hi> of the <hi>Hegira,</hi> and <hi>1037th</hi> of
Jeſus Chriſt. Some Authors have very corruptly
called him <hi>Tangrolipix,</hi> and Monſieur <hi>Beſpier</hi> in his Notes
upon <hi>Ricaut</hi>'s State of the Ottoman Empire hath taken
a great deal of Pains to find out the Correction of it;
that of <hi>Togrulberg</hi> is the beſt, and he might have alſo
found out <hi>Dogrulbeg,</hi> if he had known that the Turks
pronounce the Arabick <hi>Ti</hi> as <hi>D:</hi> but this he could not
know, for the little Turkiſh Language which he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:61726:59"/>
he learn'd in <hi>Normandy.</hi> Nor does that Word
come from <hi>Tangri,</hi> which ſignifies God in Turkiſh, as
he pretends, but from <hi>Drogu,</hi> which ſignifies Right;
and <hi>Dogrulbeg</hi> ſignifies the right Lord. <hi>Gelal-Eddevlett
Melek-Schach,</hi> which another Author calls <hi>Gelal-Eddin,</hi>

Years of Age; who being brought before
him, the Sultan knowing that there was
Care taken of his Education, ask'd of him,
what part of the Alcoran he was reading:
To the Surprize of all that were about him,

he became Emperor of <hi>Great Tartary, China,</hi>
the <hi>Indies, Perſia,</hi> and all thoſe Countries which lie on
the South of <hi>Muſcovy</hi> upon the Caſpian and Black Seas.
He died in the Year of the <hi>Hegira</hi> 624. and of Jeſus

            <p>The Victory above-mentioned he gain'd from <hi>Taiank

            <p>173. <hi>Ginghizkan</hi> having rendred himſelf
Maſter of the City of <hi>Bokhara,</hi> aſſembled
the Inhabitans, and making an Harangue to
them, ſaid, amongſt other things; People,
your Crimes muſt needs be very enormous,

            <p>
               <hi>Obſervation. Bokhara</hi> is a City of <hi>Maveranahan</hi> or
<hi>Tranſoxiana,</hi> which was very large, rich, and well peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled;
but <hi>Ginghizkan</hi> after he rendred himſelf Maſter
of it, ordered Fire to be ſet thereunto; and being for
the moſt part built of Wood, it was burnt down in

            <p>174. After the Deſtruction of the City of
<hi>Bokhara</hi> by <hi>Ginghizkan,</hi> the People of <hi>Kho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſan</hi>
demanded of one of the Inhabitants
who had ſled thither, if the Deſolation made
there by the <hi>Moguls</hi> was ſo great as report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?
he anſwered in Perſian, which was his
Language, in theſe few Words, They came,
they deſtroy'd, they burnt, they kill'd, and
carried away.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſervation.</hi> Having ſpoken of the burning of <hi>Bokha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi>
in the foregoing Obſervation, I ſhall ſpeak one
Word of the Blood ſhed there by the Army of <hi>Ginghiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kan:</hi>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:61726:62"/>
That ſame Day on which they came before it
20000 Men ſallied in the Evening to ſurprize them,
but the Moguls perceiving it, made ſo great a Slaughter
amongſt them, that there were but a very few who
return'd into the City; and next Morning at Sun-riſing
the Inhabitants having obſerv'd from the Ramparts
that the Fields look'd like a great Lake of Blood (as
<hi>Mirkhond</hi> expreſſes it) they capitulated and opened
their Gates.</p>
            <p>175. A Scheich of great Reputation and
Learning dwelling in the City of <hi>Kharezem,</hi>
the Capital of the Kingdom of that ſame
Name, when <hi>Ginghizkan</hi> came out of <hi>Great
Tartary</hi> to extend his Conqueſts towards
the Weſt. The Mahometans about him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
that he deſign'd to lay Siege to
that Town, by the three Princes his Sons,
pray'd him to be ſo kind as to give the Scheich
notice to retire elſewhere. <hi>Ginghizkan</hi>
granted them that Favour, and notice was
given to the Scheich from him, that he
would do wiſely to go out of the Town to
prevent his being Partaker of the Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
of his Fellow-Citizens if the Town
ſhould happen to be taken by Storm, as it
was, for in that Caſe the Inhabitants would
all be deſtroyed. The Scheich refuſed to go
out of the Town, anſwering, that he had
Kinsfolks, Allies, Friends and Diſciples in
the Town, ſo that he ſhould be criminal
not only before God, but alſo before Men,
if he did abandon them.</p>

               <hi>Obſervations.</hi> This <hi>Scheich,</hi> whoſe Name was <hi>Negem-eddin
Kebri,</hi> was kill'd in the ſacking of <hi>Kharezem<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
but though he was of a great Age, he kill'd divers of
the <hi>Moguls</hi> who forced his Houſe, before he fell him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>Without ſpeaking of the <hi>Kharezemians,</hi> who were
killed in the laſt Aſſault, by which they were forced
after having held out ſix Months Siege, <hi>Mirkhond</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports,
that the <hi>Moguls,</hi> when they became Maſters of
the Town, made all the Inhabitants go out, according
to their Cuſtom when they took a Place, and made
them Slaves, <hi>viz.</hi> the Merchants and Tradeſmen, with
the Women and Children that were above 14 Years
of Age, and diſtributed the reſt amongſt the Souldiers
to be killed. He adds, That the Souldiers were above
100000; and that Hiſtorians affirm, that each Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
had 24 to kill for his Share; which if true, there
were above two Millions and 400000 Souls cut off in
that Slaughter alone. It may well be doubted whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
one Town could contain ſo many People; but we
muſt conſider that the City was very large, as being a
Capital, and that the Inhabitants of the Neighbouring
City, and the adjacent Country, fled thither before
the Siege.</p>
            <p>176. <hi>Ginghizkan</hi> being at <hi>Bokhara</hi> after
his great Conqueſts on this Side the <hi>Oxus,</hi>
and about to return into his own Country,
the <hi>Great Tartary,</hi> where he died ſometime
after his Arrival, had a Conference with
two Mahometan Doctors concerning their
Religion, which he was very deſirous to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand;
and having ſaid divers remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and ſenſible things on this Occaſion, they
deſerve to have a Place here.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:61726:63"/>
The Mahometan Doctor, who took the
Speech upon him, ſays to him; <q>The <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulmans</hi>
acknowledg one only God, the
Creator of all things, who hath none like
him.</q> To this <hi>Ginghizkan</hi> replied; <q>That
he had no Reluctancy to believe the ſame
thing.</q> The Doctor added; <q>The Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
and moſt Holy God, hath ſent an
Ambaſſador to his Servants, by whoſe
Means he teaches them what they are to
do, ſo as they may do Good and avoid
Evil:</q> Which was no way diſ-reliſhing to
<hi>Ginghizkan,</hi> no more than the other; ſo that
he anſwered in theſe Terms: <q>I who am
the Servant of God, diſpatch Meſſengers
every Day to acquaint my Subjects with
what I would have them to do, or not to
do; and I make Ordinances for the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
of my Armies.</q> The Doctor went
on, and ſaid; <q>This Ambaſſador hath
fix'd certain Times for Prayer; during
which, he hath commanded us to give over
all Labour and Occupation to worſhip
God.</q> Perceiving that <hi>Ginghizkan</hi> agreed
alſo to this, he added; <q>That he hath alſo
commanded us to faſt one entire Month in
the Year.</q> 
               <hi>Ginghizkan</hi> replied; <q>It is but
juſt to eat according to Rule one Month,
to acknowledg the Favours of the Lord,
after having ſpent eleven in eating with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Rule or Management.</q> The Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:61726:64"/>
went on, and ſaid; <q>The Ambaſſador
hath alſo commanded the Rich to give half
of what Money they have each Year to the
Poor.</q> 
               <hi>Ginghizkan</hi> commended that Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
exceedingly, and ſaid; <q>The Eternal
God hath created all things indifferently
for all Men; and therefore it's reaſonable
that thoſe who have an advantagious
Share, ſhould impart to thoſe who have
not.</q> The Doctor added, <q>That the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans
have further an expreſs Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
to go in Pilgrimage to the
Temple of God at <hi>Mecca,</hi> there to adore
him. To which <hi>Ginghizkan</hi> anſwered;
All the World is God's Houſe; we may
meet with him from all Parts of the
World: God can hear from the Place
where I am now, as well as from the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
which you ſpeak of.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſervations.</hi> The Doctor who maintain'd this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
concluded from <hi>Ginghizkan</hi>'s Anſwers, that he
was a Mahometan; but his Colleague maintain'd the
contrary, becauſe <hi>Ginghizkan</hi> did not acknowledg the
Neceſſity of a Pilgrimage to <hi>Mecca:</hi> which was very
remarkable; for as <hi>Mirkhond</hi> hath obſerved, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that <hi>Ginghizkan</hi> was not addicted to any particular
Religion of the People that he had ſubdued, but left
every one to the Liberty of profeſſing what they would,
and conſtrained no Body to embrace that which he
profeſſed himſelf. On the contrary, he had an Eſteem
for all Perſons of Learning and Merit, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to their Religion, as appears by his Hiſtory; and
as <hi>Mirkhond</hi> obſerves, it was one of the great Qualities
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:61726:64"/>
that recommended him. And if we conſider his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
by the particular Entertainment with theſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,
the Circumſtances of his own Hiſtory, and that
of his Predeceſſors, it would ſeem that we may affirm,
that their Religion had not degenerated very much
from that which <hi>Japhet,</hi> or his Poſterity, brought into
<hi>Tartary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether that Opinion was imbib'd by the Arabians
in the Time of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> that <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſhmael</hi> built
a Temple to God at <hi>Mecca,</hi> or that <hi>Mahomet</hi> invented it
himſelf, it is that which gave him occaſion to make it
an Article of his Religion, that every one of his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
ſhould go thither in Pilgrimage at leaſt once in
their Life-time. And they obſerve it to this Day, there
being few of them who are able that do it not, believe
that they ought to do it, or at leaſt deſign to do it.</p>
            <p>177. It was told to <hi>Ogtaikhan,</hi> the Son of
<hi>Ginghizkan,</hi> and his Succeſſor in thoſe great
and powerful Dominions which he left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
him, that it was found in a certain
Book, that the Treaſury of <hi>Afraſiab,</hi> an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
King of <hi>Turqueſtan,</hi> was in ſuch a Place
not far from his Capital, which they thought
would be very welcome News to <hi>Ogtaikhan;</hi>
but he would not hear of it, and ſaid, We
have no need of other Mens Treaſures, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
we diſtribute that which we have to the
Servants of God, and our Subjects.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſervations. Ogtai</hi> was <hi>3d</hi> Son to <hi>Ginghizkan,</hi> who
declared him his Succeſſor by his Teſtament in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to <hi>Giagatai</hi> his <hi>2d</hi> Son, who ſubmitted to his

ſo much Time was at leaſt requiſite for thoſe who
compos'd it to come to the Place of meeting, from the
remoteſt Parts of <hi>Ginghizkan</hi>'s Empire. <hi>Ogtaikhan</hi> died
in the Year of the <hi>Hegyra</hi> 639, and of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> 1241.
He was a merciful and peaceable Prince, and above all
very liberal; as appears by the following Articles.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ogtai</hi> was particularly called <hi>Kaan</hi> inſtead of <hi>Khan,</hi>
according to the corrupt and coarſe Way of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation

            </p>
            <p>178. A Merchant preſented <hi>Ogtaikhan</hi> a
Bonnet of the Faſhion of <hi>Khoraſſan,</hi> at ſuch
time as he was a little in Wine. The Bonnet
pleaſed him, and he ordered the Merchant
a Bill of 200 <hi>Baliſches.</hi> The Bill was drawn
and delivered; but the Officers who were to
pay it, did not, as thinking it an exceſſive
Reward for a Bonnet, and that the <hi>Khan</hi>
had not conſidered it in the Condition that
he was then in. The Merchant appeared
next Day, and the Officers preſented the
Bill to the <hi>Khan,</hi> who remembred very well
that he had ordered it; but inſtead of that,
ordered the Merchant a Bill of 300. The
Officers deferred the Paiment of that, as
they had done of the former. The Merchant
complained of it, and the <hi>Khan</hi> ordered him
a Third of 600 Baliſches; and the Officers
were forced to pay it. <hi>Ogtai</hi> being the moſt
moderate Prince of the World, did not fall
in a Paſſion with them for retarding the
Execution of his Will; but ask'd at them,
if there was any thing in the World that
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:61726:66"/>
was eternal? The Officers anſwered, There
was nothing. He replied, That was not
true; for a good Name, and the Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of good Actions are to endure for
ever: In the mean time, by your Delays
in diſtributing my Bounty, becauſe you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
that I do it in Wine, makes it appear
that you are my Enemies, ſeeing you would
not have me ſpoken of in the World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſervation.</hi> That a <hi>Mogul Baliſche</hi> is worth about
500 French Livres, or 41 <hi>l. 13 s. 4 d.</hi> Engliſh: ſo that
by the Sum which <hi>Ogtaikhan</hi> ordered the Merchant for
his Bonnet, we may judg of his Liberality. But here
follows another Inſtance thereof, which is no leſs
ſurprizing.</p>
            <p>179. A Perſian of the City <hi>Schiraz</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
himſelf before <hi>Ogtaikhan,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
him, that upon the Fame of his
Bounty he was come from the Middle of
<hi>Perſia,</hi> to implore his Aſſiſtance, to acquit
himſelf of a Debt of 500 Baliſches. <hi>Ogtai</hi>
received him very kindly, and ordered him
1000 Baliſches. His Miniſters remonſtrated,
and told him, That that was not Bounty,
but Prodigality to give more than was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.
<hi>Ogtai</hi> replied; The poor Man
hath travelled through the Deſarts, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Mountains, upon the Fame of our
Liberality; and that which he asks is not
ſufficient to pay his Debts, nor for the
Charges of his Journey which he hath

            <p>
               <hi>Obſervation. Schiraz</hi> is the Capital of that Part of the
Kingdom of <hi>Perſia,</hi> which is properly called by that
Name. <hi>Dela</hi> the Perſian, who is here ſpoken of, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled
almoſt from the fartheſt Part of the <hi>Great Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary</hi>
to <hi>China,</hi> to the Court of <hi>Ogtaikhan;</hi> who had there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

upon which he had undertaken ſo great a Journey.</p>
            <p>180. <hi>Ogtaikhan</hi> paſſing by the Market of
<hi>Caracoroum</hi> his Capital, ſaw Jujubes, and
commanded one of his Officers to buy him
ſome. The Officer obeyed, and return'd
loaden with Jujubes. <hi>Ogtai</hi> ſays to him,
Surely ſuch a great Quantity as you have
there, have coſt above a Baliſche. The
Officer thinking to make his Court, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd,
That they did not coſt above the
<hi>4th</hi> Part, and that was alſo twice as much
as they were worth. <hi>Ogtai</hi> anſwered him
angrily; There was never a Chapman of
my Quality that went by that Merchant's
Door till now; and therefore commanded
him to carry him ten Baliſches.</p>

               <hi>Obſervation. Caracaroum</hi> in <hi>Great Tartary,</hi> was the
Birth-place of <hi>Ginghizkan,</hi> and the Patrimony which
fell to him by his Anceſtors; ſo that he made it the
Capital of his Empire. Under the Reigns of his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors,
it became a very Great City by the Confluence
of People, who came thither from all Parts of the
World.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:61726:67"/>
181. A Merchant having loſt a Purſe
with a conſiderable Sum, and a great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Jewels, publiſh'd that he would give
one half to him who ſhould bring it back.
A Mahometan, who found it, carried it to
him; but he would not give him any thing,
alledging that the whole was not there.
The Affair came to <hi>Ogtaikhan</hi>'s Ears, who
would take Cognizance thereof himſelf.
The Mahometan ſwore, That the Bag was
entire, and that he had taken nothing out
of it: and the Merchant did alſo make
Oath, That it had both more Silver and
Jewels. <hi>Ogtaikhan</hi> gave Sentence, and bid
the Mahometan take the Purſe, and keep
it until he to whom it b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Defeat of <hi>Sultan Bajazet Ildirim,</hi> had a
Mind to ſee the <hi>Scheich Koutbeddin</hi> of <hi>Nice</hi>
upon the Reputation of his Doctrine, and
the Retired Life which he profeſſed. The
<hi>Scheich</hi> took the Liberty to tell him, that it
was a Thing unworthy of a Conqueror to
maſſacre the Servants of God, and ſack the
Countries as he did: Thoſe who aſpire to
Glory, ought to refrain from ſhedding in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
Blood. The Muſſulman Religion
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:61726:68"/>
which you profeſs, requires you to protect
the Country where it is flouriſhing. <hi>Timour</hi>
anſwered; <hi>Scheich,</hi> each Encampment that
I make, the Entrance of my Pavilion is
opened in the Evening towards the Eaſt,
and in the Morning I find it opened to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Weſt: Moreover, when I mount
on Horſe-backs, 50 Horſe-men who are viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
only to my ſelf, march before me, and
ſerve me inſtead of Guides. The <hi>Scheich</hi>
replied, I thought you to be a wiſe Prince;
but that which you now ſay, lets me ſee that
I am deceived. <hi>Timour</hi> replied, How? The
<hi>Scheich</hi> anſwered, becauſe you glory in
turning all things topſy-turvy, like a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſervations. Timour</hi> is the true Name of <hi>Tamer Lan,</hi>

by thoſe who had Reaſon not to love him; but it ought
not to be us'd amongſt us, who never had any Cauſe to
be angry with him.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Timour</hi> came from <hi>Perſia</hi> to <hi>Anatolia,</hi> he entred
his Pavilion by an Entrance which look'd toward the
Eaſt; but came out of the ſame on the Weſt-ſide, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he advanced towards the Weſt. He had no better
Anſwer to give to <hi>Scheich,</hi> and therefore he anſwered
him thus by way of Railery.</p>
            <p>183. <hi>Timour</hi> being one day in a Bath with
ſeveral of his Emirs, and the Turkiſh Poet
<hi>Ahmedi,</hi> whom he entertained as a Man of

               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:61726:68"/>
If my Emirs whom you ſee there, were to be

him, And what do ye value me at? He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
at 24 Aſpers. <hi>Timour</hi> replied; Your
Eſtimation is not juſt; the Linen-cloth
with which I am girded is worth ſo much

            <p>
               <hi>Timour</hi> was not angry at the Poet's Boldneſs; on the

laugh at the Pleaſantneſs of his Diſcourſe, but preſented
him with all the things which he made uſe of on that

            <p>The Mahometans both Men and Women, do for
Decency's ſake cover themſelves from the Shoulders
downward in the Bath with a blue Linen Cloth,
which hides all behind and before down to their very
Feet; that ſo there is nothing ſeen which may offend
Modeſty: And this Cloth they call <hi>Fota,</hi> which is the
Word made uſe of by <hi>Eſſendi</hi> in relating this Story.
They bathe alſo in cold Water with the ſame Modeſty,
but make uſe rather of Calico than Linen. If the ſame
Precautions were us'd in <hi>France,</hi> the Ladies would not be
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:61726:69"/>
reproach'd with their Walk in the Summer-time
along the River, without St. <hi>Bernard</hi>'s Gate.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ahmedi</hi> was of <hi>Sultan Bajazet Ildirim</hi>'s Court, and
after that <hi>Timour</hi> withdrew from <hi>Anatolia;</hi> he yielded
himſelf to <hi>Emir Soliman</hi> Son to the ſame <hi>Bajazet,</hi> and
dedicated the Hiſtory of <hi>Alexander the Great</hi> to him in
Verſe, which he had compos'd under the Title of
<hi>Iskender Nameh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>184. <hi>Timour</hi> having one Day diſpatch'd
a Courier for an Affair of Conſequence;
that he might make the more haſte, gave
him Power when he ſhould ſtand in need to
take all the Horſes which he found in his
way, without regard to thoſe that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
to, be their Quality what it would.
As he paſs'd by a Meadow, he ſaw ſome
fine Horſes, and would have taken one of
them inſtead of that which he rode on: But
the Horſe-keepers oppos'd his Deſign, and
broke his Head when they found that he
would uſe Violence: So that being forc'd
to withdraw in this Condition, he ſhew'd
his bloody Head to <hi>Timour,</hi> and complain'd
of the ill Treatment which he had met with.
<hi>Timour</hi> being in a Rage, commanded the
Maſter of the Horſes and his Servants, to
be enquir'd after, and put to Death. But
thoſe who had received that Commiſſion,
underſtanding that they belonged to <hi>Mouph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti
Saadeddin,</hi> would not put the ſame in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
becauſe of the Dignity of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
until they had given <hi>Timour</hi> notice of
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:61726:69"/>
it, and knew his Mind further. When <hi>Timour</hi>
underſtood whoſe the Horſes were, his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
was appeas'd; and ſending for the
Courier, ſays to him, If my Son <hi>Schahroh</hi>
had done any ſuch thing, nothing could
have prevented my putting him to Death:
but how can I revenge my ſelf upon a Man
who hath not his Equal in the World, a
Man whoſe Pen commands not only in the
Countries ſubject to me, but alſo Abroad,
and in ſuch Climates as my Sword can never
reach?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſervation.</hi> This <hi>Mouphti</hi> was Native of a Place in
the Neighbourhood of <hi>Herat,</hi> which was called <hi>Taſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zan:</hi>
And becauſe of his Abilities, he was conſulted by
all thoſe Countries that profeſſed <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Religion;
and therefore <hi>Timour</hi> was willing to preſerve that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
for him which he had acquir'd by his great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
            <p>185. <hi>Mirza Omer,</hi> Grandſon to <hi>Timour,</hi>
being baniſh'd from the Countries which
his Grandfather had left him in Conjunction
with <hi>Mirza Miranſchach</hi> his Father, and
<hi>Mirza Ababckir</hi> his eldeſt Brother, he fled
to <hi>Khoraſſan</hi> to <hi>Schahroh</hi> his Uncle; who
did not only receive him kindly, but made
him alſo Soveraign of <hi>Mazanderan,</hi> which
he conquered a little time after his Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val.
But <hi>Mirza Omer</hi> was no ſooner ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled
in his Kingdom, than he revolted and
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:61726:70"/>
declared War againſt <hi>Schahroh</hi> his Uncle
and Benefactor. When <hi>Schahroh</hi> heard the
News of this Rebellion, one of his Officers,
in whom he had abundance of Confidence,
and who had given him Advice not to treat
that Prince ſo kindly as he had done,
put him in mind of what he had the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to ſay to him upon this Subject, <hi>viz.</hi>
That there was no Likelihood of his living
in a better Underſtanding with an Uncle,
than he had done with his Father and Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and now the Event had made it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
that he was not miſtaken. <hi>Schahroh</hi>
anſwered; We have done him no Evil, and
the Kingdom which we gave him, did not
belong to us: Know that Kingdoms belong
to God, and he gives and takes them away
as he pleaſes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſervation. Mirza Omer</hi> did not proſper long in
his Ingratitude; for <hi>Schahroh</hi> overcame him in Battel
almoſt without ſtroke of Sword: And as he fled through
<hi>Schahroh</hi>'s Dominions, he was ſeis'd and carried be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Conqueror, having a great Wound which he
had received in defending himſelf. <hi>Schahroh</hi> was ſtill
ſo kind as to give him a Phyſician and Chirurgion, and
ſend him to his Capital to be cur'd, but he died by
the Way.</p>
            <p>186. <hi>Schahroh</hi> gave the Kingdoms which
depended on him to his Sons, his Kindred,
or Emirs; but ordinarily on Condition of
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:61726:70"/>
a Tribute, and that they ſhould coin Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
with his Stamp. He did moreover
give each of them ſuch Advice as he thought
needful for their governing well; and moſt
part of his Counſels are collected by <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dunrizzac
Efendi</hi> his Hiſtoriographer. He
ſaid to his Son <hi>Mirza <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lug-Beg,</hi> when he
made him King of <hi>Maverannahar</hi> or <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoxiana,</hi>
and <hi>Turqueſtan;</hi> The Almighty
made us this high Preſent which we now
enjoy, and hath gratified us with that ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
Authority that I do at this time poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs,
without any regard to my Weakneſs
and Faults: A Soveraign who is convinced
of the Worth of an Empire, ought in the
firſt place to return Thanks for his Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes:
He ought to be tender and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate
towards all thoſe who are in Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity;
and to remember what God ſaid to
the Prophet <hi>David,</hi> whom he eſtabliſh'd as
his Vice-gerent upon the Earth, <hi>To render
Juſtice to Men.</hi> Entertain Learned Men
with Veneration and Reſpect, and don't
go aſtray from the Precepts of the Law,
nor of thoſe who have explained it: Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
thoſe who are the Interpreters thereof
in their Honours and Dignities; and do
your utmoſt to make the Judges do their
Duty according to the Laws. Take the
people of the Country under your particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:61726:71"/>
Protection, ſo that none may vex them;
but that on the contrary, they may have
all manner of Juſtice done them, for it's
they who contribute to the Support and
Encreaſe of the Revenues of the State.
Govern your Souldiery with pleaſant Looks
and good Words, for they are the Strength
and Stay of your Kingdom. Take care alſo
that they be duly paid; and augment the
Salaries of ſuch as ſignalize themſelves,
and expoſe their Lives for the Preſervation
of the Publick; but chaſtiſe thoſe who
come ſhort of their Duty. In fine, take
care that you never depart from Juſtice
upon any Occaſion; and entruſt your Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers
to none but Governors of great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
who will take care to keep the

and <hi>Turqueſtan</hi> during his Father's time. After his
Death he had ſome Wars to maintain his Right of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
to the Country which his Father left him at
his Death, but he was quickly diſturb'd in his Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by Factions which were form'd againſt him, and
particularly by the Revolt of his own Son <hi>Mirza-Abd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulletif:</hi>
for that unnatural Wretch made War upon him,
overcame him, and committed a Patricide on his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
ſo much the more deteſtable, that he had not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
acquitted himſelf well as to his Valour, but was alſo
bountiful, wiſe and learned; by which, and his Love
for learned Men, he obtain'd a Reputation which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh'd
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:61726:71"/>
him from all the Princes of his time. In
effect the Obſervator which he built at <hi>Samareand</hi> will
perpetuate his Fame; for thither he drew Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
and Aſtronomers, who from their Obſervations
publiſh'd Aſtronomical Tables.</p>
            <p>The Alcoran being the Foundation of the Religion
and Civil Laws of the Mahometans, the Interpreters
of that Book have acquired great Authority amongſt
them; and therefore <hi>Schahroh,</hi> who underſtood it very
well, and obſerv'd religiouſly what it contain'd, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
it to his Son to have a Veneration for
them, and to maintain them in their Honours and
Dignities, as one of the principal Means to get the
Love of the People, who cannot bear it with Patience
to ſee the Chiefs of their Religion, and thoſe who have
the Adminiſtration of the ſame, deſpiſed and ill-treated.</p>
            <p>187. That ſame <hi>Schahroh</hi> ſaid to <hi>Mirza
Mehemmed Gehangir,</hi> one of his Nephews,
when he gave him a conſiderable Principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
on the Condition before mentioned; To
the end that you may carry your ſelf as you
ought, conſider that God never deprives
thoſe who do Good, of the Reward which
they deſerve: Be merciful and good to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
thoſe who depend upon you, becauſe
they are God's Creatures. Command your
Officers not to treat them harſhly, but to
cheriſh the Poor, and to obſerve the Laws
and Statutes. And as to your own parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Concern, do nothing but with Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and Wiſdom; and ſet the good Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:61726:72"/>
which I give always before you.</p>
            <p>188. He ſaid alſo to <hi>Mirzakidon,</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of his Nephews, to whom he gave the
Kingdom of <hi>Candahar</hi> with its Dependan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies;
Exerciſe Juſtice, and be not guilty of
Vexation, Injuſtice nor Tyranny, for that
is the way to ruine your ſelf: Forget not
that Kingdoms which are govern'd by juſt
and equitable Princes, altho Infidels, continue
a long time, but that the Reigns of Tyrants
is never of long Duration. Behave your
ſelf with Moderation and Wiſdom in every
thing. Take Care of your Reputation,
and to draw the Bleſſing of your Subjects
upon you by your Liberality and Bounty;
and thus you may reign a long time.</p>

               <hi>Obſervations. Mirza Kidon</hi> was the Son of <hi>Mirza Pir
Mehemmed,</hi> Son of <hi>Mirza Gehangir,</hi> the eldeſt Son of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour:</hi>
and <hi>Mirza Gehangir</hi> died while his Father was
alive. After his Death <hi>Timour</hi> gave the Kingdom of
<hi>Candahar</hi> to <hi>Mirza Pir Mehemmed,</hi> who made the Town
of <hi>Balkh</hi> his Capital; but his Reign continued not long
after <hi>Timour</hi>'s Death, for he was aſſaſſinated by <hi>Pir Ali
Taz,</hi> whom he entruſted with the Adminiſtration of
his Government. <hi>Schahroh</hi> chaſtiſed this Rebel, and in
the firſt place gave <hi>Balkh</hi> and its Dependances to <hi>Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za
Kidon;</hi> and ſome time after the Kingdom of <hi>Canda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>har.</hi>
But this Prince did not follow <hi>Schahroh</hi>'s Advice
as he ought to have done: He rebelled ſome Years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

            <p>
               <hi>Obſervations. Mirza Baikra</hi> took no more care to
improve <hi>Schahroh</hi>'s Inſtructions than <hi>Mirza Kidon</hi> did,

            <p>In calling the Merchants the Birds of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth

Sultan</hi> his Son, when he eſtabliſh'd him
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:61726:73"/>
King of <hi>Perſia</hi> in the City of <hi>Schiraz,</hi> The

numerous Troops, a great Train, Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
and Equipage; but its chief Strength
conſiſts in having a good Counſel, keeping
their Frontiers well fortified, the Paſſes well
guarded, in preſerving their Subjects from
Oppreſſion, and maintaining Religion:
Thanks be to God, my Son, I know that you
have no need of Advice, yet my fatherly
Affection obliges me to tell you, that you
ought to carry your ſelf ſo as your Subjects
may bleſs you when they ſit under the Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
of your Clemency and Bounty, and
have a true Reliſh of the Pleaſures of a qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et

In order to this take care that your
Officers exact nothing from them but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Juſtice, and that they don't ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
the Limits of the Law in levying the

you and I ſhall both of us be eſteem'd,

powerful Motives will prevent our falling

in the <hi>827th</hi> of the <hi>Hegira,</hi> and <hi>1414th</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt.
His Seat was in the City of <hi>Schiraz,</hi> where he died in

Nephews, before he gave it to <hi>Mirza Ibrahim
Sultan,</hi> but <hi>Mirza Iskender</hi>'s Loyalty was not
long-liv'd. <hi>Schahroh</hi> would not believe the
firſt News which he had of his Revolt;
and upon the Repreſentation made to him
by his Miniſters, that his Empire would
never be in Peace while that Prince liv'd:
He anſwered, that they ſpake like wiſe Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticians;
but if through Ignorance or Heat
of Youth my Son <hi>Mirza Iskender</hi> is hurried
on to this fooliſh Enterprize, it may be that

his Obſtinacy, he march'd and took the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

               <hi>Tchelebi</hi> is a Title of Honour given to Perſons of good

Word <hi>Geleb</hi> or <hi>Tcheleb;</hi> which ſignifies the firſt
Flowers, or firſt Fruits, and every thing that comes to
Maturity before its ordinary time. This Original
pleaſes me much, becauſe the Turks give this Name
particularly to handſom young People of good Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
who are pleaſant, well-bred, and of greater
Wit than is uſual for their Years. Others will have it,
that it comes from <hi>Tcheleb</hi> an old Turkiſh Word, which
ſignifies God; but this Etymology ſeems to me to be

your Opinion is ſo, where do you think
then that we ſhall be placed? The Jews, not
daring to be ſo bold as to ſay that the Turks
ſhould be wholly excluded, anſwered only;
That they ſhould be without the Walls, and
look upon them. This Diſpute coming to
the Ears of the Grand Vizier, he ſaid, That
ſeeing the Jews place us without the Walls
of Paradiſe, it is but juſt that they ſhould

            <p>The thoughts of Evil proceed from Idleneſs.</p>
            <p>Value your ſelf upon your Vertue, and not

not give a dead Creature for a living one.</p>

the good you do may live in the memory of

on the aſſiſtance we receive from abroad, but on
Prudence and good Conduct.</p>
            <p>Wiſdom is preferrable to Force, becauſe it
executes things which Force cannot perform.</p>
            <p>A Wiſe Man, by his words, does things which

            <p>Happy is he who corrects his faults by the

            <p>When a Miniſter who is Inveſted with an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute

'tis a Miracle if he does not aſpire to Sovereign

            <p>The repoſe of the Soul conſiſts in not hoping

            <p>Men need not fear on that ſide which they

            <p>A Learned Imprudent Man is a burthen to

            <p>He who does not ſucceed in the Execution of

            <p>Be kind to the Wicked and you will make

            <p>True Wealth conſiſts in Virtue, and not in
the Poſſeſſion of a great Eſtate, and Wiſdom is
found in the Underſtanding, and not in Years.</p>
            <p>A Servant who is inclin'd to Evil, never leaves

            <p>Kings are only Kings becauſe they have Men,

            <p>Why do you who have great Imployments

            <p>Little Quarrels now and then among Friends
reſult in the endearing of Friendſhip between
them.</p>
            <p>To go about to inſtruct a wicked Man, it is
to put a drawn Sword into the hands of a Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer.</p>
            <p>A diſſolute Wretch is capable of doing all the
miſchief imaginable.</p>
            <p>The reaſon wherefore Courtiers make their
Court to Kings with ſo much Zeal and Paſſion,
is, becauſe they know this to be the moſt ready
way to elevate them to the Honours and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities

            <p>A Monarch that only indulges himſelf in his

ſhining of the Sun ſucceeds to a dark and diſmal

            <p>When an Ignorant Perſon is advanced to an
honourable Station, his extravagance is ſo great,
that he won't ſuffer a Learned Man to come near
him.</p>
            <p>Let Beauty be never ſo miſerable, yet this is
always peculiar to her, that ſhe attracts the Eyes
of all the World.</p>
            <p>A Man of Wit, if he pleaſes, will make you
believe the Moon is made of a Green Cheeſe.</p>
            <p>Learning has this advantage, that it makes
thoſe who are great Maſters of it command
thoſe to whom they are Inferiour.</p>

We ought never to glory either in our great
Eſtates or Friends; but, if in any thing, that
we are Learned, Virtuous, and of good Morals.</p>
            <p>'Tis a mighty Diſgrace for a Learned Man to
be Vitious; but an Ignorant <hi>Dervis</hi> is a thing
that is much worſe, and both of them do teach
a Religion they know little of, and at the ſame
time deſpiſe.</p>
            <p>A Man that has Wit, and yet in every thing
conſults others, is but half a Man; and he that
has none, and yet will take no Advice, is not
a Man.</p>
            <p>Don't deſire to be informed of him whom you
intend to make your Friend, but enquire of him
who is his Friend; becauſe every body does na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
encline to tread in the ſame ſteps as his
Friend does. If he be Wicked, do not pretend
to keep at diſtance from him, but do it in
earneſt; but if he be good, keep cloſe to him,
and you'll become good too.</p>
            <p>Have no familiarity with the Sluggard, the
Wicked do eaſily corrupt the Good. Don't you
ſee that Fire turns to Aſhes, by being ſo near
them?</p>
            <p>The greateſt Debt we owe is that to our
Maſter who teaches us, and it is the firſt which
ought to be paid, and that largely too; not ſo
much to be quit of our Obligations to him, as
out of a Reſpect to his Perſon.</p>
            <p>Learning, with relation to proud Men, is
much what like Water, with reference to Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
and eminent Places; for in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as it is contrary to the nature of Water
to riſe of it ſelf, ſo alſo is it contrary to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Learning to make Men become Proud.</p>

his damnable Idleneſs!</p>
            <p>He who Teaches, and does not practiſe what
he Teaches, is like a Hen that has Wings, but
does not fly with them.</p>
            <p>The Wealth after which you run with ſo
much eagerneſs, is like your Shadow; which,

            <p>You who are Learned, be content with your
Fortune, leſt an over-affluence oppreſſes and
troubles your Mind. A Brook derives pure
Waters from its ſource, but it grows muddy
as ſoon as ever it overflows its Banks.</p>
            <p>What is Time, but a precipitate courſe, that
is continually hurrying us on to Death in ſpight
of our Teeths? And what ſurpriſes Wiſe Men
is, that the Traveller is jogging on in that way,
even then when he is taking his reſt.</p>
            <p>You that Weep when you are Born, whilſt
the Goſſips are rejoycing and Merry-making,
endeavour ſo to live, that you may be able to
rejoyce and triumph at the time when your
Friends are lamenting, I mean, at the hour of
your Death.</p>
            <p>Patiently endure all the Attacks of thoſe that
Envy you, you will by that means conquer
them all. Thus Fire it ſelf is put out, when it
