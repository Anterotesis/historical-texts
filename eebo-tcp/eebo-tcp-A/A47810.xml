            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

(in regard of the present cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
of Plots and Popery) has
been,<note place="margin">The Dukes Succession the Common sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the Press.</note> of late, sufficiently agitated,
<hi>Pro,</hi> and <hi>Con;</hi> while the <hi>Advocates</hi> of

[Et Pila minantia Pilis]</hi> Now as it is
utterly impossible for a <hi>Contradiction,</hi> to be <hi>Both
ways</hi> in the <hi>Right;</hi> so the Difficulty will not be much
less, for a Common man, in a Proposition of this
Nicety, to distinguish betwixt the <hi>Truth,</hi> and the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:107089:3"/>
               <hi>Paradox;</hi> and to determine, upon which side the
<hi>Reason</hi> lies. Or what if the Contendents themselves
should yet, in some degree, have left the very Pinch
of the Point betwixt them? For it is not the bare
Citing of a piece of <hi>Scripture,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Texts, and Presidents may be mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>applyed.</note> or a <hi>Record,</hi> that
does the business; but the fair <hi>Expounding,</hi> and <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying</hi>
of it, with a due Regard to the Context of
<hi>Times, Persons, Interests, Occasions,</hi> and other Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances.
There is a great difference betwixt the
<hi>Counsels</hi> of <hi>Factious Times,</hi> and of <hi>Peaceable;</hi> of
<hi>Vsurpers,</hi> and of <hi>Lawful Princes;</hi> the <hi>Concessions</hi> of
<hi>Kings</hi> in a Moral State of <hi>Liberty,</hi> and of <hi>Kings</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a kind of <hi>Duresse.</hi> We should, in fine, distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
betwixt the <hi>Sacred,</hi> and <hi>Inviolable Resolutions,</hi>
that are founded upon <hi>Equity,</hi> and the <hi>Common Good,</hi>
and those <hi>Temporary shifts,</hi> which are only Invented
to serve a <hi>present Turn</hi> of <hi>State.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heresie, and Sedition, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend Texts, and Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents.</note> Was there ever any
<hi>Sedition</hi> that did not recommend, and support it
self upon some pretext of <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>President?</hi> Was
there ever any <hi>Heresie,</hi> or <hi>Schism,</hi> that did not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
it self under the Countenance of some <hi>Text?</hi>
And yet Heaven forbid, that we should think ever
the worse, either of <hi>the word of God,</hi> or of <hi>the Law
of the Land,</hi> for being made use of as a Cloak to so
much wickedness. He that has a mind to destroy
the <hi>Discipline,</hi> the <hi>Order,</hi> or the very <hi>Doctrine</hi> of
the <hi>Church of England,</hi> shall Quote ye <hi>twenty Texts</hi>
for't; and as many <hi>Presidents,</hi> (if there shall be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion)
for <hi>Diverting,</hi> or <hi>Cutting off</hi> the <hi>Succession;</hi>
nay for <hi>Deposing</hi> the <hi>King Himself,</hi> and <hi>Changing</hi> the
very <hi>Form</hi> of the <hi>Government.</hi> This is no more
then what has been actually done in the Memory of
Man.<note place="margin">Texts and Presidents to all purposes.</note> 'Tis a hard matter to imagine a <hi>New Case:</hi>
So that let the Instance be what it will, it is but look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
back into Former Ages, to match it; where you
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:107089:3"/>
shall be sure to find Choice of <hi>Presidents ready made</hi>
to your hand (like <hi>Cloaths</hi> in a <hi>wholesale Shop)</hi> of <hi>all
Sizes,</hi> and <hi>Colours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore we should have a care,<note place="margin">Have a Care of perverted Authorities.</note> methinks, of
dealing in <hi>perverted Texts,</hi> and <hi>Presidents.</hi> The
Devil himself fishes with these Baits; and (as some
body says) the Rabble swallow them whole, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
either examining, or dreaming of the Danger,
till they feel the Hook in their Guts. Or, if I may
change my <hi>Metaphor;</hi> the <hi>Common people</hi> are caught
just as we catch <hi>Larks;</hi> 'Tis but setting up a <hi>fiue
Thing</hi> for a <hi>Wonderment,</hi> they all flock to't as far as
they can see it, and never leave <hi>Flickering</hi> about it,
till the Fowler has them in the <hi>Net.</hi> A Pomp of
<hi>words,</hi> and <hi>Colours,</hi> to the <hi>Multitude;</hi> is but the
Casting of the <hi>Sun</hi> in their Eyes from a <hi>Looking-Glass;</hi>
the more they <hi>look</hi> at it, the less able are they
to <hi>discern</hi> what the matter is: and the great mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
is this; they never take themselves to be so
<hi>Clear-sighted,</hi> as in those cases wherein they are <hi>Stark-blind.</hi>
They are akin to what d'ye call him's <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters;</hi>
their <hi>Eyes</hi> are in their <hi>Breasts,</hi> and their <hi>Brains</hi>
in their <hi>Bellies:</hi> And therefore whoever would
make an Interest with the <hi>Vulgar,</hi> applies himself
not to their <hi>Vnderstandings,</hi> but to their Passions,
and <hi>Appetites.</hi> He comes with <hi>Absolons Exclamation</hi>
in his mouth, <hi>Oh! that I were made a Iudg in the
Land!</hi> which seldom fails of being the Prologue to
some approching Tragedy. But let me try now, if
I can find my way back again.<note place="margin">The Dispute, <hi>Pro,</hi> and <hi>Con.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>There is an <hi>Assertion</hi> laid down, <hi>That all the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Acts, and Powers in the world, cannot hinder
the Descent of the Crown upon the Next Heir of the
Bloud. This Position,</hi> the <hi>Assertor</hi> undertakes to
make <hi>Good</hi> by <hi>Scripture, Law, History,</hi> and <hi>Reason.</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:107089:4"/>
And his <hi>Opponents,</hi> on the other side, undertake, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the very same <hi>Authorities,</hi> to <hi>Overthrow it;</hi> and I
find a very Extraordinary Pen engag'd in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie:
We shall enquire, first, <hi>How this Question
came at this time, to be set a Foot;</hi> and then, <hi>into
the Quality of the Question it self.</hi>
               <note place="margin">How the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion came to be set a Foot.</note>
            </p>
            <p>There was a <hi>Bill</hi> brought into the House of
<hi>Commons,</hi> in <hi>May last;</hi> (which was <hi>Twice read) for
disabling His Royal Highness to Inherit this Imperial
Crown,</hi> because of his <hi>Departure</hi> from <hi>Vs</hi> to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
Communion.</hi> The matter going no further, and
That Parliament being soon after <hi>Dissolv'd;</hi> there
came forth, in Print, <hi>a Pretended Copy</hi> of that <hi>Bill;</hi>
which was publish'd by a Person (if a mans Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
may be judg'd by his Practices) that has as
little kindness for His Majesty, as for his <hi>Royal Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi>
and not one jot more for the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
then for That of <hi>Rome:</hi> Of both which Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
there are Instances more then enow: Beside
that in the very <hi>same Pamphlet,</hi> he carries an <hi>Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi>
from the Case of <hi>Foreclosing</hi> the <hi>Duke,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The King Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved by Consequence.</note> to the
<hi>same Right</hi> of <hi>Removing the King himself; in case of
disability</hi> (as he says) <hi>to do the Kingdom any Good.</hi>
So that instead of pursuing the <hi>seeming ends</hi> of the
said <hi>Bill;</hi> that is to say, the <hi>Preservation</hi> of His <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,</hi>
and the <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> by <hi>This Act of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion;</hi>
he very fairly, and for brevity sake, <hi>Sweeps
all together.</hi> By the <hi>Character</hi> of the <hi>First Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sher,</hi>
we may Imagine the <hi>Intent</hi> of <hi>That Publication:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Who were the Aggressours.</note>
And it is further to be noted, that the <hi>Anti-Ducal
Party</hi> were the <hi>Aggressors;</hi> and it would have lookt
like a yielding of the Cause, to have let the Subject
fall without a Reply. So that the Blame (if any shall
arise from this Matter) must be laid at his door that
mov'd the Question: which Question is briefly This.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:107089:4"/>
               <hi>Whether the Parliament of</hi> England,<note place="margin">The Case Put.</note> 
               <hi>may by the
Laws of</hi> England, <hi>Exclude the next Heir of the Bloud
from Succession to the Crown.</hi> Some are of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>for</hi> it, others <hi>against</hi> it. But the <hi>Legality,</hi> or
<hi>Illegality</hi> of such an <hi>Act,</hi> is a Point that I am not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to meddle with, either one way, or other. For
whether the thing may <hi>Lawfully</hi> be done, or <hi>not,</hi>
there may be <hi>Danger yet,</hi> and <hi>Inconvenience,</hi> in the
putting of the <hi>Question,</hi> So that, in the Order of
Reasoning,<note place="margin">A preposte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> it should be first agreed, that this is a
<hi>fit Question</hi> to be <hi>put,</hi> before we joyn Issue upon the
<hi>Merits</hi> of the <hi>Main Cause.</hi> For my own part, I think
it had been much better let alone; and that out of
divers respects, in their due places to be consider'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Reasons why the Question ought not to have been Put.</note> as to the <hi>Question it self;</hi> it is a Ticklish
Point, to say, what <hi>a King of Great Britain,</hi> with
his <hi>Two Houses of Parliament,</hi> either <hi>Can,</hi> or <hi>Cannot
Lawfully do:</hi> when perhaps it would puzzle the
<hi>Three Inns of Court,</hi> to <hi>State,</hi> and <hi>Determine</hi> the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>Priviledges</hi> of the <hi>Single House of Commons. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi>
I do not know how far <hi>Private men</hi> may be
allow'd to pronounce upon the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
to which they are Born <hi>Subject. Thirdly, This
Particular Case</hi> renders the Undertaking more <hi>Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious,</hi>
and <hi>Dangerous:</hi> The King, 'tis true, calls the
House of Commons to Consult, and Advise <hi>de Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duis
Regui;</hi> (Of which <hi>Ardua</hi> That now in hand is
undoubtedly the <hi>Chief)</hi> but I cannot yet learn that
the <hi>Soluta Multitudo</hi> were ever joyn'd with their <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentatives</hi>
in the <hi>Commission. Fourthly,</hi> what can
be more <hi>Hazardous,</hi> then the Probable <hi>Effects</hi> of
<hi>this Dispute?</hi> It Splits the People directly into <hi>Two
Parties; One</hi> of which is certainly in the <hi>wrong:</hi> and
the <hi>Publick Peace</hi> endanger'd upon the <hi>Division.</hi>

One Probable</hi> is set up against <hi>Another;</hi> and
the <hi>Learned Themselves</hi> are <hi>Divided</hi> upon't. There
are <hi>Presidents</hi> produced on <hi>Both sides;</hi> and <hi>Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
also on <hi>Both sides</hi> to Those <hi>Presidents.</hi> And in
short, it must be the work of a <hi>Casuist,</hi> as well as of
a <hi>Common Lawyer,</hi> to decide this <hi>Controversie.</hi> How
shall the <hi>Common people</hi> come to <hi>distinguish</hi> between
the <hi>Right,</hi> and the <hi>Wrong;</hi> where the <hi>Doctors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
Differ?</hi> Or how is it possible, to make any
thing <hi>Clear,</hi> to Those that want <hi>Capacities</hi> to <hi>Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand</hi>
it? How shall They come to <hi>separate</hi> matter of
<hi>Fact,</hi> from <hi>Right?</hi> To know <hi>what Presidents</hi> are
<hi>Warrantable,</hi> or <hi>what Cases Parallel,</hi> and <hi>what not;</hi>
without any sort of acquaintance, either with <hi>Law,</hi>
or <hi>History;</hi> with the <hi>Intrigues</hi> of <hi>Parties</hi> and <hi>Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi>
or the <hi>secret Ressorts</hi> of <hi>State?</hi> If it be said
that <hi>These Books are written only for such as are</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
Judges <hi>of the Subject they Treat of;</hi> my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
is, that it were well enough, if they could be
kept from falling into Other hands. But lying open,
indifferently, to All, it is to be fear'd that the <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
does more <hi>hurt</hi> where it is <hi>not throughly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood;</hi>
then <hi>Good,</hi> where it <hi>is.</hi> And there is This
further to be said; that in all Cases of <hi>Appeal</hi> to the
<hi>People,</hi> whether they <hi>Vnderstand</hi> them, <hi>or not,</hi>
they never fall of siding with those Propositions,
that Promise <hi>Liberty,</hi> to the <hi>Subject,</hi> and <hi>Fetter</hi> the
<hi>Government.</hi> So that their <hi>Partiality,</hi> in <hi>One Case,</hi>
is as bad as their <hi>Ignorance,</hi> in <hi>Another.</hi>

If it be agreed,<note place="margin">Not one of a Thousand un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands the Point.</note> that a man cannot be the <hi>better</hi>
for any thing that he does <hi>not Vnderstand;</hi> (or at

            </p>
            <p>But now on the <hi>Other side;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Or what if the People did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand it?</note> let us suppose the

<hi>What? In the Critical Explication of a Riddle of State:</hi>

<hi>more Learnedly,</hi> and <hi>Vnprofitably Troublesom.</hi> It

of <hi>Parts:</hi> So is every <hi>Political Society</hi> also

And is not all This, the <hi>Work</hi> and <hi>Dictate</hi>
of the same Almighty <hi>Providence?</hi> He that made

            </p>
            <p>But to proceed now, upon the admittance of a
Supposition, that the Subject matter of this Dispute
is competently <hi>Vnderstood.</hi>
               <note place="margin">An Unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Question.</note> 
               <hi>'Tis as Broad as 'tis
Long,</hi> take it which way ye please: And the very
<hi>same thing,</hi> to the <hi>People,</hi> whether it goes <hi>For</hi> the
Duke, or <hi>Against</hi> him. If they find that a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:107089:6"/>
               <hi>Cannot</hi> Disinherit him, they are but where
they were before; unless they should Impose it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Government by <hi>Force.</hi> And what, on the
<hi>Other side,</hi> if the Parliament may <hi>Legally Do</hi> it?
May they not as <hi>Legally</hi> yet <hi>Refuse</hi> it? So that the
<hi>People</hi> are ty'd up <hi>This</hi> way, as well as the <hi>Other;</hi>
without any manner of Benefit, beyond the <hi>bare
knowledg</hi> whether the thing <hi>may</hi> be done, or <hi>not.</hi>
If the Parliament <hi>will,</hi> they <hi>May;</hi> and if they will
<hi>not,</hi> they may let it <hi>alone.</hi> But it many times falls
out, that Overtures of this Nature serve rather as a
<hi>Temptation</hi> to the doing of some thing at a <hi>Venture,</hi>
then a simple, and candid <hi>Deliberation,</hi> whether a
thing may be <hi>Lawfully</hi> done, or <hi>no.</hi> Or what if
This thing may <hi>Lawfully</hi> be done? we are never the
nearer yet: if His Majesty has not as well the <hi>Will</hi>
to do it, as the <hi>Power:</hi> And it seems more reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to believe that he has <hi>not,</hi> then <hi>Otherwise;</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
so expresly declared his mind to the <hi>Two
Houses of Parliament</hi> against it, in His most Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
speech of <hi>May</hi> last, in the words follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>I am as ready to join with you in all the ways,<note place="margin">His Majesties Speech.</note> and
means, that may Establish as Firm a security of the
Protestant Religion, as your own hearts can wish; and
This not only during My time, (of which I am sure
you have no fear) but in all future Ages, even to the
end of the world: And therefore am come to assure
you, that what Reasonable Bills you shall present, to be
pass'd into Laws, to make you safe in the Reign of any
Successor (so as they tend not to Impeach the <hi>Right</hi> of
<hi>Succession,</hi> nor the <hi>Descent of the Crown in the
True Line;</hi> and so as they Restrain not the Iust Right
of any <hi>Protestant Successour:)</hi> shall find from Me a
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:107089:7"/>
ready Concurrence. And I desire you to think of some
more effectual means for the Conviction of Popish Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusants,
and to expedite your Counsels as fast as you
can, that the world may see Our Vnanimity; and that
I may have the Opportunity of shewing you how ready I
am to do any thing, that may give Content and Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
to such Loyal, and Dutiful Subjects.</p>
            <p>Now if so it be that the very Question it self,
(thô handled with all the <hi>Simplicity</hi> of Thought Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable)
carries along with it so many <hi>Difficulties,</hi>
and <hi>Inconveniences;</hi> and without any <hi>Benefit</hi> at all
to the <hi>Publick;</hi> as is already set forth: what shall
we say if upon a Fair, and Temperate Examination
of the Arguments employ'd for the support of this
Disinheriting Proposition,<note place="margin">It is a Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences.</note> it shall appear, upon E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident
<hi>Reason,</hi> and a Natural Deduction of <hi>Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences,</hi>
that, whether the Duke <hi>Stands,</hi> or <hi>Falls,</hi>
the meer Ventilation of the <hi>Question</hi> opens a Gap to
let in all those Calamities upon us, by unavoidable
<hi>Inferences,</hi> which we propound to avoid by a <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventional
Exclusion?</hi> To say nothing either of the
<hi>Boldness</hi> of the <hi>Argument,</hi> from a <hi>Private Pen,</hi> or
of the <hi>Opposition</hi> of a <hi>Subject</hi> to the <hi>Solemn,</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
Will</hi> of his <hi>Sovereign:</hi> And That Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
too, recommended to Us by a Previous Grant
of the Thing in the whole World which we would
be thought to set the highest value upon, the Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the <hi>Protestant Religion</hi> by all ways Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
to This, and to Future Ages. Truly the Trumping
up of This Question, has an Ill Visage any way;
but the doing of it directly against His Majesties
Will, made known with his own Lips to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary;
This makes it look a great deal more Suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
For to what End is it to put our selves in a
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:107089:7"/>
Sweat, upon a Question, whether or no the King
may <hi>Lawfully</hi> do such a Particular thing; when he
has told us before-hand, that he <hi>Will not do it;</hi>
and the thing <hi>cannot</hi> be done, <hi>Without</hi> him? And
the <hi>Other</hi> way, it looks Worse; and carries such an
<hi>Innuendo</hi> along with it, as who should say: <hi>Look
ye, my Masters; Heres a thing the Government</hi> May
<hi>do if they please; and it is absolutely necessary to be</hi>
done: <hi>But if They Will not;</hi>—and so forth.</p>
            <p>There's no managing of this Discourse, without
making frequent mention of his <hi>Royal Highnesses
Quality,</hi> and <hi>Title;</hi> and yet (saving my Duty to

Papers, upon a Punctual <hi>Noutrality,</hi> as to <hi>His Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensions:</hi>
My bus'ness being only to Acquit my self,

His Majesty himself becomes a sufferer, through the
Indignities that are cast upon his Brother. Or where
the <hi>Same Argument,</hi> that is levell'd at the <hi>Duke,</hi>

               <note place="margin">The Extent of This Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.</note> we
may take a Computation of it, partly from the
<hi>Frame</hi> of This <hi>pretended Bill,</hi> and partly from a
view of the <hi>Consequences</hi> that Attend it: For upon
the Naked sight of the <hi>Bill,</hi> one would think that
the <hi>Dukes Case</hi> were the <hi>single point in Question.</hi> But
whosoever looks a little further, will find <hi>a Snake
in the Grass;</hi> and that more <hi>Inconveniences</hi> may be
grafted upon <hi>This President;</hi> then the very <hi>Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi>
of the Project themselves were <hi>aware of,</hi> of
which, by and by.</p>
            <p>For admitting the <hi>disinherison</hi> contended for,<note place="margin">Suppose the <hi>Disinherison.</hi> Lawful.</note> to

it be <hi>Lawful</hi> the <hi>former way;</hi> it is <hi>Lawful,</hi> without
any respect to <hi>Crimes</hi> of <hi>State; Opinions</hi> in <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;

will be mad?</hi> We have heard of <hi>Parliamentum

it is not Impossible, but Posterity may come
to have More of them. Wherefore it should be

<hi>Cabalistical Notions</hi> of <hi>Salus Populi,</hi> and <hi>Instinct.</hi>
This is it, that preserves a Nation in a due Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rament
of <hi>Dominion,</hi> and <hi>Subjection;</hi> where every
man knows his Post in the Government, and stands
Firm upon his Own bottom. The Foundations of
<hi>Government</hi> should be like Those of the <hi>Earth; not
to be moved:</hi> For Otherwise, our <hi>Lives, Liberties,</hi>
and <hi>Estates,</hi> are but <hi>Precarious,</hi> and at <hi>Mercy.</hi> In a
<hi>Popular Parliament,</hi> the <hi>Crown</hi> goes to wrack, in a
<hi>Prerogative Parliament,</hi> the <hi>People.</hi> We have <hi>seen,</hi>
and <hi>felt,</hi> the <hi>One;</hi> and there are those yet in Being,
that have <hi>Heard</hi> of the <hi>Other.</hi> And from the

And from what Root is it that all these Disorders

and Resolving the <hi>Plain</hi> and <hi>Practical</hi> Duties of
<hi>Government,</hi> and <hi>Obedience,</hi> into <hi>Mystery,</hi> and <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>

               <hi>an Act of Parliament, to Prohibit the Making or
Importing of any sort of Arms, or Ammunition;</hi> the
<hi>Authority</hi> would not at all Excuse the <hi>Consequence.</hi>
And the <hi>Consequence,</hi> in This matter, is the Main
Import of the <hi>Question,</hi> what <hi>Good,</hi> or what <hi>Ill,</hi>
will probably ensue upon it, either the <hi>One</hi> way,
or the <hi>Other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in our way to That Disquisition,<note place="margin">Four Obsta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, before the King pass the Bill.</note> We should
take Notice that there are <hi>Four Points</hi> to be all
clear'd, before we can reasonably expect His Majesty
should come to a Resolution: That is to say; 1. The
<hi>Lawfulness</hi> of the Thing. 2. <hi>Natural Affection.</hi>
3. Matter of <hi>Conscience.</hi> And 4. <hi>Reason of State.</hi>
In the <hi>First Case</hi> of the <hi>Four</hi> the Learned in the
<hi>Law</hi> may be Consulted; but in the <hi>Other Three</hi>
the <hi>King himself</hi> is the only Competent <hi>Iudg.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What if we should, for Quiet-sake now, let the
<hi>First point</hi> pass for <hi>Granted,</hi> and suppose his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
convinc'd of the <hi>Legality</hi> of the Act? There is
yet a <hi>Brother;</hi> a <hi>Prince;</hi> and a <hi>Friend</hi> in the Case:
A Person that has as frankly ventur'd his <hi>Bloud,</hi> for
his <hi>King,</hi> and his <hi>Country,</hi> as the meanest Subject
in His Majesties Dominions. And there may be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Stimulations of <hi>Honour,</hi> as well as Impulses of
<hi>Natural Affection.</hi> Let but any <hi>Generous Subject</hi> make
it his Own Case, and ask his Own heart, <hi>what he
himself would do under these Circumstances?</hi> And who
knows further, but a Scruple of <hi>Conscience</hi> may fall
in too with this Tenderness of <hi>Nature,</hi> upon the
thought of depriving a <hi>Legal Heir,</hi> by so extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
a way, of his <hi>Vndoubted Birth-Right?</hi>
If This should be the Rub, there's no getting Over
it. Or if the way were Clear thus far; yet if His
Majesty should see any thing in the <hi>Tendency</hi> of the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:107089:11"/>
Proposition, either Inconsistent with the <hi>Dignity</hi> of
His <hi>Office,</hi> or with the <hi>Peace,</hi> and <hi>Security</hi> of His
<hi>Government,</hi> and <hi>People;</hi> such <hi>Reason of State</hi> would
undoubtedly put a Stop to any such <hi>Bill.</hi> How far
These Reasons, or any of them, may prevail toward
the Preventing, or Obstructing of This Project; we
shall not presume to enquire. But as to the <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi>
of Promoting it, on the Other side; the <hi>Quality,</hi>
the <hi>Force,</hi> and the <hi>Consequences</hi> of their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
there are many things to be noted in them
that seem worthy of Consideration.</p>
            <p>It is a strange thing,<note place="margin">No Notice taken of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels against His Majesty, and His Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</note> in the Menage of This
Cause, where the <hi>Honour,</hi> and <hi>Safety</hi> of the <hi>King</hi>
appears to be the <hi>Main Point</hi> in <hi>Question: First,</hi>
that men should be so <hi>Quick-sighted,</hi> as to see things
in their <hi>Consequences</hi> So <hi>Remote;</hi> and yet, at the
same time, So Blind, as not to discern the <hi>Affronts;</hi>
and <hi>Indignities</hi> that are dayly offer'd to His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
<hi>Authority, nearer hand;</hi> and the <hi>hazzards</hi> that
more directly strike at His Sacred <hi>Person.</hi> My Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
persuades me, that if some of them had taken
notice of the <hi>dangerous Practices</hi> hereby intended;
their Loyalty would have render'd them as Zealous,
and Officious the Other way: For if a Prince be
destroy'd; 'tis the same Case to every good Subject,
whether it be done by a <hi>Phanatick</hi> or a <hi>Iesuite.</hi> And
then the <hi>Honour</hi> they have for the King, in His <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,</hi>
as well as in <hi>Himself,</hi> would have Interpos'd,
in the Vindication of our <hi>Sovereigns Brother</hi> from
the Malice, and Contempt that has been past by Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Pamphleteers upon the very <hi>Person</hi> of his <hi>Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Highness.</hi> 'Tis like they would have had the <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
too, not to have markt out unto the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
all the Dissenters to this Bill, as <hi>Conspiraters,</hi> and
the <hi>Betrayors</hi> of their <hi>Country,</hi> till they should have
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:107089:11"/>
seen the Result of this next Parliament; for fear
they should find <hi>Kings, Lords,</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>That Character.</hi> This is not <hi>Reasoning</hi> of the
Case, but downright <hi>Setting the Dogs at a man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is no doubt in the world but many an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
man,<note place="margin">A well mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Mistake as Dangerous as a Malicious one.</note> and a welwisher to his Prince and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
stands well enough Affected to this Bill; (as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
did in 1641. to the Pretensions then a Foot)
But when they found that Other people made Ill
Use of Their Good meaning, and improv'd the
Countenance of <hi>Reforming</hi> the Government to a
<hi>Violent Dissolution</hi> of it; How many thousand In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
might a body produce of an unprofitable,
and late Repentance, among those Credulous and
well-minded Gentlemen? And it is to be consider'd
also, that Their <hi>Mistakes</hi> contributed no less to the
Ruin of the <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> then the <hi>Malice</hi> of
the most potent <hi>Conspirators:</hi> Nay More perhaps;
for the Error of an Honest man misleads other Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
men by Example, and gives a kind of Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to the wickedness. Now thô this Parallel does
not run upon all four; yet the Cases jump exactly in
This;<note place="margin">The Old Cause Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viv'd.</note> 
               <hi>the same Anti-Monarchical Principles</hi> which
were the Ground-work of <hi>That Sedition,</hi> are now
set a foot again in Concurrence with the <hi>present
Proposition;</hi> and supported also by some of the
Active Promoters of it. So that let the Design be
never so Innocent, or Lawful in it self; if it be yet
made use of to Introduce the Old Disloyal, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publican
<hi>Leaven;</hi> it is much the Case as if a man
should set Fire to his House, for fear of Thieves.
Now whether the Liberties of the Press be so <hi>great,</hi>
so <hi>foul,</hi> and so <hi>dangerous,</hi> or not, as I have repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
them, it shall be seen in a few words, and
left to the Reader to judg of the Intention of such
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:107089:12"/>
desperate Positions, and what may be the Event of
such Bold Beginnings, if not seasonably Prevented.
Upon the Publication of these Papers I should be
glad to find some of the Fierce Sticklers for the
<hi>Kings safety</hi> by <hi>the Exclusion of the Duke,</hi> as Nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
on the Other side, for the <hi>Honour,</hi> and <hi>Safety</hi>
of His Majesty, in Punishing the <hi>Authors,</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moters</hi>
of these <hi>Libels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are some Irreverences toward the person of
His Royal Highness which are not with Decency to
be recited,<note place="margin">Scandalous Reflections upon His Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Highness.</note> and which for Other Reasons I am wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to pass over; contenting my self only with the
modestest of a great many in the Author of <hi>the Plea
to the Dukes Answers. Consider his Humours,</hi> (says he)
<hi>So Fierce, Revengeful, and Resolute: But I'le say no
more: who knows not how Improper it is to make a
Woolf a</hi> Shepherd? Nay he goes further yet: <hi>If the
Duke be a Papist,</hi> (as none deny him Now) <hi>he's an
Heretick, as To, or From Vs: And what shall we
do? Not do by the Papists, as They would by Vs?</hi>
But what's That? He tells us Three or four lines be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
That it is a Maxim <hi>among Papists, not only that
the Pope may at his Pleasure Depose Kings, and dispose
of Crowns:</hi> but further, <hi>That the People may ever chuse a
King,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Seditious Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions.</note> 
               <hi>when he should else be an Heretick,</hi> So that
after the <hi>Popes Example of Deposing Protestant
Kings, We</hi> may <hi>Depose Popish.</hi> This is a Nail Home
driven; and yet for fear it should not hold, he has
be bestow'd a <hi>Rivet</hi> upon it. I hope he will allow
a <hi>Popish</hi> King to be an <hi>Ill</hi> one; and for <hi>That,</hi> he tells
ye that <hi>when Kings themselves be</hi> Ill <hi>ones, God not
only approves of their Removal, but even Himself does
it.</hi> Which is a most Emphatical way of Expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Meaning: For not only ILL DUKES but
KINGS (I perceive) THEMSELVES are as
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:107089:12"/>
well to be remov'd, if they be ILL ones. There's
Another Libel that takes the very same Byass
too; he begins with the <hi>Duke,</hi> and <hi>Ends</hi> with the
<hi>King:</hi> Laying it down for a <hi>Maxim,</hi> that <hi>the King
May be remov'd for Inhability to Govern:</hi> And then
for an <hi>Vse of Application,</hi> he gives us the Late
Instance of <hi>Portugal</hi> for a <hi>President.</hi> Nay I have
not found any man yet, so Cautious upon This Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
but he has let fall somthing, <hi>Tantamount;</hi> And
in truth the Question does Naturally lean That
way. Some tell us that the <hi>People</hi> are the Source of
<hi>Government;</hi> and that the <hi>Last Resort</hi> in All Cases
of Principal Import must be to <hi>Them.</hi> Whereas,
<hi>First,</hi> there was a <hi>Providential Power,</hi> before any
Subject <hi>Actually</hi> in <hi>Being,</hi> for That Power to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
it self Upon: <hi>Secondly;</hi> there is nothing more
Common, then for a People to convey away what
Right they have, beyond a Power of <hi>Revocation.</hi>
And if a man desires to see the <hi>Covenants;</hi> the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
is, that the <hi>Conditions</hi> are either <hi>Exprest,</hi> or
<hi>Imply'd:</hi> Which word IMPLY'D serves to all
Turns and Purposes Imaginable. By a Power
IMPLY'd, a <hi>Protestant,</hi> as well as a <hi>Popish Successour</hi>
may be <hi>Disinherited:</hi> A <hi>King</hi> in <hi>Possession, Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,</hi>
whether <hi>Good,</hi> or <hi>Bad.</hi> For who can set
forth the Terms and Condition of an Unknown, and
an Unbounded Power. A Government, we are
told, cannot be suppos'd Destitute of a Power to
preserve it self, in Cases of Manifest, and Publick
Dangers. If we enquire where That Power of
preserving the Government is plac'd; the Reply
is This: That <hi>Governours are set up for the Good of
the People; and when They fail of doing their Duty,
the People may provide for themselves:</hi> That is to say,
the <hi>People,</hi> by their <hi>Representatives</hi> in Parliament.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:107089:13"/>
But what if <hi>That Representative,</hi> should prove
<hi>False</hi> too? The <hi>King</hi> was not pleas'd with the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi>
of 1641. nor the <hi>People</hi> with the <hi>Late Long
Parliament:</hi> what's to be done Next; but only to
go together by the Ears about it, and when they
have their Bellies full, only <hi>Shuffle the Cards, and
deal again.</hi> From these dark Reserves of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the point Rises by Degrees into Cases of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
and Illustration. As in the Case of <hi>Lunacy,</hi>
or <hi>Vnfitness to Govern;</hi> of <hi>if a Prince be really bent
to</hi> Alienate <hi>his Kingdom.</hi> In These Cases it is taken
up for granted, that the people may <hi>Depose</hi> and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
Another Sovereign. But who shall judg
now when such a Case arrives? If the <hi>People;</hi> they
judg for <hi>Themselves;</hi> and only take the Government
out of <hi>Other</hi> hands, to put it into their <hi>Own:</hi> what
if they should say that This <hi>is</hi> the Case where it is
<hi>not;</hi> Or that it is <hi>not,</hi> where it <hi>is?</hi> If the King do but
keep a <hi>Guard</hi> to preserve His <hi>Person</hi> from an <hi>Assas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sin;</hi>
or make a <hi>Foreign Alliance,</hi> upon the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Terms of Priviledg that all other Crowned
Heads proceed upon; he lies at the Mercy of the
People, if they shall think fit to Interpret This to be
a Design upon an <hi>Arbitrary Power,</hi> or the <hi>Aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of His <hi>Dominions;</hi> and that he is consequently
<hi>Deposable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It carries a very Ill face with it,<note place="margin">The Kings Case, and the Dukes are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckily Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled.</note> that the <hi>Two Cases</hi>
of <hi>Disinheriting</hi> the <hi>Duke,</hi> and <hi>Deposing</hi> the <hi>King</hi>
should be so Unluckily <hi>Coupled,</hi> that you shall very
rarely find the <hi>One</hi> without the <hi>Other:</hi> And little
more then This Difference betwixt <hi>them:</hi> that the
<hi>One</hi> IS to be done <hi>Forthwith,</hi> and the <hi>Other</hi> MAY
be done (when the people please) at <hi>Leisure.</hi> If
ever this Question should come to be taken up again;
I do verily believe that the House of Commons
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:107089:13"/>
will not thank the Refiners upon the <hi>Former Bill,</hi>
for charging the Proposition with so many <hi>Suspicious
Aggravations;</hi> as for ought any body knows, may
endanger the whole Bus'ness. For These Venerable
Patriots did only, out of an Excess of <hi>Zeal,</hi> Intend
the <hi>Exclusion</hi> of the <hi>Duke,</hi> without Clogging the
Bill with any subsequent <hi>Incumbrances,</hi> upon the
<hi>Crown.</hi> There are some Qualifications, I know, that
look as if they would be thought to stick to the
single Matter of the <hi>Bill;</hi> and distinguish betwixt
an <hi>Heir Presumptive,</hi> and <hi>Apparent,</hi> a <hi>King</hi> in <hi>Posse,</hi>
and in <hi>Esse;</hi> and fortifie themselves with <hi>Authorities</hi>
to warrant the <hi>Proceeding.</hi> The <hi>Duke</hi> is a <hi>Subject,</hi>
they say: and not properly an <hi>Heir</hi> of the <hi>Crown;</hi>
but only in <hi>Possibility</hi> so to <hi>be.</hi> The Unwary Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
will Imagine now, that the <hi>Duke,</hi> being a SUB<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>JECT,
may be <hi>put By;</hi> but that if the KING were
of the <hi>Romish Communion,</hi> they could not <hi>meddle</hi>
with <hi>Him.</hi> And yet, according to the Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
above-mentioned, His <hi>Majesties</hi> Case would be
found no better than His <hi>Brothers.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The King no safer, then the Duke.</note> And not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
so neither, but the very saying that <hi>he is so,</hi> in
Construction, <hi>makes</hi> him so, even thô he should give
up His Life, as His Father did, for the Reformed
Profession.</p>
            <p>It is not to say that This is either <hi>Impossible</hi> or
<hi>Vnlikely:</hi> For, <hi>First,</hi> the Thing has been done al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.
That is to say, This <hi>Popular Power</hi> has been
already laid down as a <hi>Fundamental Right</hi> in the
<hi>People.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of placing the Power in the People.</note> 
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That pretended Power has been
exerted in a Formal <hi>Charge,</hi> of <hi>Popish,</hi> and <hi>Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical
Designs,</hi> upon a Prince, the most Innocent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure,
in those Two Particulars, that ever

               <hi>Name,</hi> and by the Assumed <hi>Authorities</hi> of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons

<hi>Chimaera,</hi> but a <hi>True,</hi> and <hi>Tragical History</hi> of a
<hi>Prince murther'd,</hi> even in Our days, upon This
Foundation. And then for the <hi>Probability</hi> of the

               <hi>The Libel Here Reflected upon, is called</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands
Safety: <hi>and said in the Title Page to be</hi> Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
for Information of all True Protestants, that
they may not be affraid, nor ashamed openly in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:107089:14"/>
to Act, and oppose any Popish Successour and his
Adherents from Inheriting the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> in
Case <hi>His Majesties Life</hi> (which God forbid) be taken
from him.</p>
            <p>This Preface was worded by somebody that knew
well enough what he said; and without Dispute
intended to be as good as his word. We shall not
need to look any further for his Meaning than to
<hi>Grammar,</hi> and <hi>Common Construction.</hi> The Question
was put,<note place="margin">The Question Changed, from <hi>Heir,</hi> to <hi>Successour.</hi>
               </note> in Case of the <hi>Presumptive <hi>Heir:</hi>
               </hi> And He
has streyn'd the Point already, and remov'd it to the
<hi>Successor</hi> and his <hi>Adherents;</hi> From the <hi>Expectant</hi> to
the <hi>Occupant,</hi> from the <hi>Duke,</hi> to the <hi>King;</hi> and so
premeditates, and Encourages a Rebellion, in the
very Body of his Proposition: For His Majesty
that now is, must be Dead, before the Libellers De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
against the Successour can take Effect; and
<hi>King,</hi> and <hi>Successour,</hi> in This Case are <hi>all one.</hi> Now
upon This Principle, there needs no more than to
say,<note place="margin">A desperate Consequence.</note> that <hi>any King is a Papist,</hi> to <hi>Depose</hi> him. Nay
admitting This Power to be in the People; <hi>Acts of
Parliament</hi> are but Matter of <hi>Course;</hi> and they may do
the thing even as well, without giving any Reason
for't; Upon the Ground of their <hi>Vnaccountable
Prerogative.</hi> It would be known too, what his
meaning is by the <hi>Parliament</hi> he speaks of, that is
<hi>Openly to oppose the Successour.</hi> It cannot be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
of <hi>King, Lords,</hi> and <hi>Commons;</hi> for the <hi>King</hi>
is the <hi>Party Opposed,</hi> and <hi>Excluded.</hi> And then I
would as willingly learn what kind of <hi>Opposition</hi> it
is, that he intends. It must be an <hi>Opposition,</hi> either
of <hi>Force,</hi> and <hi>Violence,</hi> or an <hi>Opposition</hi> in the way
of <hi>Argument, Counsels,</hi> and <hi>Debate.</hi> It cannot be the
<hi>Latter</hi> sure; for what could be more ridiculous,
then to expect that a <hi>Prince</hi> should pass a <hi>Bill</hi> for the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:107089:15"/>
               <hi>Deposal</hi> of <hi>Himself.</hi> And if it be the <hi>Other,</hi> we
are e'en <hi>Half-Seas-Over</hi> already, into a New Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion.
There is not such a Monster in Nature
as a <hi>Headless Parliament:</hi> We have had the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of it; and without Rubbing the Old
Sore, or Reciting the Calamities it brought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
This Nation; I shall only say This; I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
bethink my self of any sort of Oppression, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in <hi>Religion, Property,</hi> or <hi>Freedom;</hi> or of any
One <hi>Crying sin,</hi> in that Impious, and Seditious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval,
that scap'd us. I could add several other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
of the same Complexion with those above
Recited; which I shall forbear, partly out of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
and in part to keep my self within Compass.
For I must not Quit This Subject without giving fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Evidence of a <hi>Confederacy</hi> against the <hi>King</hi> and
<hi>Government;</hi> like those that Rob the House, under
colour of Helping to Quench the Fire; and in the
very Instant of Pretending to save the Kingdom,
they are laying their Heads together how to Destroy
it: Witness the most Audacious Libel (perhaps)
that ever flew in the Face of any Government.</p>
            <p>It bears the Title of <hi>A Political Catechism,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Political Catechism.</note>
               <hi>concerning the Power, and Privileges of Parliament;
taken,</hi> (as pretended) <hi>out of His Majesties</hi> Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Propositions <hi>of</hi> June 2. 1642. with a Constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and Application, much at the rate of the
Devils Gloss upon the Text to our Saviour upon
the Pinacle of the Temple. The Compiler of This
Libel, makes His Majesties Answer to be, Effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
an <hi>Admittance</hi> of the <hi>Right,</hi> and <hi>Reason</hi> of the
<hi>Propositions:</hi> and the Publisher of it recommends
the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of 1642. to the <hi>Practice</hi> of 1679.
We'l take a short View, <hi>First,</hi> of the <hi>Quality</hi> of the
<hi>Propositions; Secondly,</hi> of the <hi>Kings Sense</hi> upon
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:107089:15"/>
them: And <hi>after</hi> That of our <hi>Catechists New model</hi>
of <hi>Government.</hi> The main Scope of the <hi>Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
is This.</p>
            <p>All Privy-Councellors and Ministers of State to be
discharg'd;<note place="margin">The Scope of the Ninteen Propositions.</note> and their places Supply'd by direction,
and Approbation of Both Houses: And all to be Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
such an Oath, as They shall agree upon. The Great
Affairs of the Nation to be Transacted in Parliament,
and no Publick Act of the Kings to be Valid, unless
Subscribed by the Major part of the Councel. (Chosen
<hi>ut supra.)</hi> The Number of the Councel to be Limited;
and all Vacancies fill'd, by direction of Parliament.
All the Great Officers, and Iudges to be so Chosen:
The <hi>Militia</hi> acknowledg'd to be in the Two Houses; and
They likewise to have the Approbation of the Tutors and
Governors of the Kings Children; and of Those that
Attend them. All Forts, and Castles to be put into
the hands of Persons approv'd of by the Two Houses.
The Kings Guards, and Military Forces to be Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd
<hi>(thô the Rebellion was Now begun.)</hi> No
Peers Created in time to come to Sit and Vote in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
without the Consent of Both Houses, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There will need no Other Descant upon These
<hi>Propositions,</hi> (being so Gross in themselves) but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Citing of some Passages out of His late Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
<hi>Answer,</hi> in Reflection upon them.</p>
            <p>These Demands <hi>(says the Late King)</hi> are of That
Nature,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Husbands</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections Pag. 316.</note> that to Grant them were in Effect, at Once, to
Depose both Our self, and Our Posterity. These things
being past; we may be waited upon bare-headed; We
may have Our hand kist; the Stile of Majesty Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd
to Vs; and the Kings Authority declared by
Both Houses of Parliament, may be still the Stile
of your Commands; We may have Swords and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:107089:16"/>
Maces carry'd before Vs; and please Our self
with the sight of a Crown, and Scepter. (And yet
even these Twigs would not Long flourish when the
Stock upon which they grew are Dead) But as to
<hi>True,</hi> and <hi>Real Power;</hi> We should remain but the
<hi>Outside;</hi> but the <hi>Picture;</hi> but the <hi>Sign</hi> of a <hi>King,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And Again,</hi> Thô we shall always weigh the Advices
both of Our Great, and Privy-Councel, with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable
Consideration due to them; yet we shall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
look upon their <hi>Advices,</hi> as <hi>Advices,</hi> not as <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,</hi>
or <hi>Impositions;</hi> Vpon <hi>Them,</hi> as Our <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellors,</hi>
not as Our <hi>Tutors,</hi> and <hi>Guardians;</hi> and upon
<hi>Our Self</hi> as their <hi>King,</hi> not as their <hi>Pupil,</hi> or <hi>Ward.
Pag. 318. And Further Pag.</hi> 320. We call God to
Witness, that as for Our Subjects sake these Rights are
vested in Vs; So for Their sakes as well as for Our
Own we are resolved not to quit them; nor to subvert
<hi>(thô in a Parliamentary way)</hi> the Antient, Equal,
Happy, Well-poised, and never enough Commended
Constitution of This Kingdom; Nor to make Our self of
a King of <hi>England,</hi> a <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> and This
of a Kingdom a <hi>Republick. Moreover Pag.</hi> 322.
The Common people, when they find that all was done
<hi>By</hi> them, but not <hi>For</hi> them, will at last grow weary of
<hi>Journey-work,</hi> and set up for themselves; call <hi>Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
and <hi>Independence, Liberty;</hi> devouring the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
which had devoured the Rest; Destroy all Rights,
and Proprieties, all Distinctions of Families, and
Merit; And by This means the splendid, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently-distinguish'd
Form of Government, end in a
Dark, Equal <hi>Chaos</hi> of Confusion, and the Long Line
of Our many Noble Ancestors, in a <hi>Jack Cade,</hi> or a

After the Mockery of the Abovemention'd Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions,
and the Kings Just and Prophetical Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
made upon them; we shall only Add, that the
<hi>Ruin</hi> of <hi>the Late King,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Kings Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in was and is design'd.</note> was as Certainly the <hi>Intent</hi>
of Those <hi>Vndutiful Demands,</hi> as it was the <hi>Effect</hi>
of them in the <hi>Execution</hi> of the <hi>Powers</hi> claim'd
<hi>Thereby:</hi> and we may as reasonably conclude, that
the same Pretensions, now over again, are publish'd
with the same Ends; and that the Sufferance of This
Licence will Naturally run into the same Consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
For the whole work of moving a Rebellion is
but, <hi>First,</hi> to possess the people with Ill Thoughts of
the present Administration; (which is done Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
already in Swarms of Defamatory Libels,
which we meet with every day in the street) <hi>Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
to possess the People with False Opinions, in the
Matter of Government and Duty; which is the bus'<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of our <hi>Political Catechism: Thirdly,</hi> to Put
those Principles and Thoughts in Execution; which
is Express'd by the Drift of Another Pamphlet new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
come out of the Press; Entitled, <hi>An Appeal from
the Country, to the City,</hi> of which we shall say som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in Course, taking only a Taste by the way of
our <hi>Catechistical Positions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the King be <hi>Regulated</hi> by the <hi>Law (say they)</hi> then is
the King <hi>Accountable</hi> to the Law,<note place="margin">Seditious Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions.</note> and not to <hi>God. Only.
Pag.</hi> 1. The Immediate <hi>Original</hi> of the Kings <hi>Power</hi> was from
the <hi>People:</hi> and if so; then in questioned Cases the <hi>King</hi> is to
produce his <hi>Grant,</hi> (for he hath no more then what was <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted)</hi>
and not the <hi>People</hi> to shew a <hi>Reservation;</hi> For <hi>All is
presumed to be Reserv'd, which cannot be prov'd to be Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Vpon the Late Kings saying in his Answer to the Nineteen
Propositions, <hi>Pag.</hi> 321. That the Power Legally placed in Both
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:107089:17"/>
Houses is more then sufficient to prevent, and restrain the Power
of <hi>Tyranny; our Politick Catechizer Infers,</hi> the Two Houses
to be the Legal Iudges, when there is danger of <hi>Tyranny:</hi> And
to have Legal Power to Command their Iudgment to be Obey'd, for
Prevention, as well as Restraint of Tyranny. And not only when
Arms are Actually rais'd against them; but when they discern, and
accordingly declare a Preparation made Towards it. And that
they have Legal Power in such times of Danger, to put into safe
hands, such Forts, Ports, Magazines, Ships, and Power of the
<hi>Militia,</hi> as are intended, or likely to be intended to Introduce a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny.
And a Legal Power also to Levy Mony, Arms, Horse, and
Ammunitions upon the Subjects, in such Cases of Danger even
without, or against the Kings Consent.</p>
            <p>These are his <hi>Positions</hi> in the very Terms; and
the passing over of such Indignities upon <hi>His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
Royal Office,</hi> and the Honour of the <hi>Monarchy
it self,</hi> without either <hi>Punishment,</hi> or <hi>Reproof;</hi> looks
like a <hi>Tacite Legitimation</hi> of the Utmost <hi>Violences</hi>
upon his Sacred <hi>Person.</hi> And now Consider the
Matchless Malice,<note place="margin">A Malitious Inference.</note> and Absurdity of his Inference.
The King having thus expounded himself in the
<hi>same Page; The House of Commons (an Excellent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>server
of Liberty, but never intended for any share in
Government, or for the Chusing of them that should
Govern) is solely intrusted with the First Propositions
of raising Monies,</hi> &amp;c. And again <hi>the Lords being
trusted with a Iudicatory Power, are an Excellent
Skreen, and Bank between the Prince and People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After This open, and Audacious way of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizing
a Commotion; it is but Natural for an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendiary
to blow the Coal, and to apply his Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
to the People, to bid them <hi>Vp and be doing.</hi>
And that's the part our <hi>Boute-feu-Appellant</hi> has to
play.<note place="margin">A Scandalous Address to the City.</note> But how does this Scandalous Pamphlet ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress
it self to the City; after so Fresh, so Loyal
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:107089:17"/>
and so Generous an Instance from the whole Body
of it, of their Scorn, and Detestation of a Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

which brought so great a Reproch, and
Mischief upon the City. Beside that it is as much
their Interest as their Duty, and as much their Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
as either, to support the Government. For
by a War they must of Necessity suffer doubly;
and not only in the Loss, or Abatement of their
Trade; but in the deep Proportion of their Taxes

by the name of <hi>Heretick Dogs.</hi> Then represent to your selves

Imagine you see your Father, or your Mother, and some of your

nearest and dearest Relations ty'd to a Stake, in the Midst of
Flames; when with Hands and Eyes lifted up to Heaven they
Skream, and Cry out to That God for whose Cause they Die;
which was a frequent Spectacle the last time Popery reign'd among
us. Phansie you behold those beautiful Churches erected for the

Frightful Apprehensions, with a Brief Summary of

taken;<note place="margin">The Old Story.</note> and Information given that Great Multitudes,
at least a Hundred, had that day resorted to visit a

purpose to give that notice: Vpon Inquiry, but <hi>four per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi>
were then found to be There, and but eight all that
day, who had visited the Priest. Another day a <hi>Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor</hi>
in a Ditch over-hears two passengers to Plot the
Death of Mr. <hi>Pym,</hi> and of many <hi>other Members</hi> of
<hi>Both Houses.</hi> Then Libellous Letters found in the

Discourses to be Published, and Infusions to be made of
Incredible Dangers to the City and Kingdom, by that
our coming to the House: <hi>(in the case of the five Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers)</hi>
An Alarum was given to the City in the Dead
time of the Night, that we were coming with Horse and
Foot thither, and thereupon the whole City put in Arms:
And howsoever the Envy seem'd to be cast upon the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
of the <hi>Papists,</hi> mention was only made of Actions
of our <hi>own.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon a fair understanding of the whole, this sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of his is no more then the Counterpart of
the old Story: And the Declamatory dangers that
he foresees in Vision, were outdone by those sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Cruelties and Oppressions that this poor King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
suffered in very deed. And now to bear him
Company in his <hi>Phansy,</hi> we shall give you a <hi>Truth</hi>
for his <hi>Imagination.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First Imagine the whole Nation in a Flame,<note place="margin">Truth for his Vision.</note> and brought to the
Extremities of Fire and Sword by the Malice of the same Faction
that embroyl'd us before; and <hi>at the same Instant, Phansy</hi> whole
Droues of Coblers, Draymen, Ostlers, Quartering upon your <hi>Wives</hi>
and <hi>Daughters,</hi> till ye want bread to put in your Childrens Mouths;
(which was the very Case) your Apprentices discharg'd of their
Indentures by Ordinances; your Houses Rifled; your Accompt-Books
Examin'd; Servants corrupted to betray their Masters; your Persons
sent on Ship-board, transported, or thrown into nasty Dungeons; or
in mercy, perhaps your Throats cut, by the Name of <hi>Popish Dogs,</hi> and
<hi>Cavaliers.</hi> And all this only for refusing to Renounce God and your
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:107089:19"/>
Soveraign. <hi>Then represent to your selves</hi> the <hi>Thimble-maker,</hi>
once again Lieutenant of the <hi>Tower;</hi> your Citizens clap up, orders
for the Demolishing of your Gates and Chains; and nothing less than
<hi>Military Execution</hi> threatned ye, unless you will Redeem your
selves with 100000 l. a Mouth Contribution, toward the perpetua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of your Slavery. Then <hi>cast your Eye toward Cheapside,
Corn-hill, Charing-Cross, Pallace-yard, Tower-hill,</hi> nay,
<hi>White-hall</hi> it self; and there Imagine your Father, your Brother,
your Citizens, the Nobility, Gentry; nay, the King himself, and
his best Friends and Ministers under the hand of the Common
Executioner; <hi>Appealing to God, for whose Cause they dy'd.
Which was a frequent spectacle,</hi> when the King reign'd no longer
among you. Phansie again that <hi>you behold those Beautiful Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
erected for the true Worship of God, abused and turned
into</hi> Stables, and the Pulpits into Iugling Boxes, to <hi>Hocus</hi> your
Wives and your Daughters, out of their Bodkins and Thimbles:
and there to hear nothing but Heresie and Sedition, <hi>to the Dishonour
of Christ, and Scandal of Religion.</hi> Phansie the <hi>Ministers of
Gods Holy Word</hi> cast out of their Livings by Hundreds, and with
their Wives and Children expos'd to the wide World to beg their
Bread. Your <hi>Women running with their Hair about their Ears,</hi>
One half to the <hi>Works</hi> like <hi>Pioneers,</hi> the other dancing attendance
at some Merciless <hi>Committee</hi> to put in Bayl for a Malignant Child,
or Husband; <hi>men cover'd with Blood,</hi> lost Limbs, and mangled
Bodies, with Horrors of Conscience over and above.</p>
            <p>If it be true,<note place="margin">We should do well to look about us.</note> that these and forty times more Cruelties were
committed: And that the People were frighted into these Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipices
only by shadows: If it be true again, that those Glorious
Pretenders when they had the King and his <hi>Papists</hi> (as they
call'd his most Orthodox Friends) under foot; that these Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
I say, never lookt further after Religion; but fell presently
to the sharing of the Church and Crown Revenues among
themselves, It will concern every sober man to look well about
him, and to make use of his Reason, as well as of his Faith,
for these <hi>Fore-boders</hi> seldom <hi>Croak</hi> but before a <hi>Storm.</hi> This
Subject has carry'd me too far already, but I shall be shorter in
what follows.</p>
            <p>After his affected Image of the Tyranny and Desolation that
is breaking in upon us, he does as good as nothing, without

working up the Peoples <hi>Horror</hi> and <hi>Astonishment</hi> upon those ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions,
into a Direct <hi>Rage</hi> and <hi>Desperation.</hi> And this he
endeavours to bring about by undertaking so positively for his
Majesties Murther, as if he himself were of the Conspiracy:
Very Peremptorily Issuing out his Orders to the City to be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
with their Arms at an hours warning.</p>
            <p>The first Hour (says he) wherein ye hear of the Kings untime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
End,<note place="margin">He gives the Kings Murther for granted.</note> let no other Noise be heard among you, but that of ARM,
ARM; to revenge your Soveraigns Death, both upon his Murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and their whole Party; For that there's no such thing as an <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
Papist,</hi> who is not in the Plot, at least in his good wishes. Let
not fear of losing Part by your <hi>Action</hi> make you lose the whole by
your <hi>Patience.</hi> Pag. 4. And then, <hi>Pag.</hi> 25. he points them out the
very <hi>General</hi> to lead them; a respect which neither the <hi>City,</hi> nor
the <hi>Illustrious Person himself,</hi> will thank him for, upon so disorderly
an occasion: Enforcing his Proposition with this Inducement, That
<hi>he who hath the</hi> worst Title <hi>ever makes the</hi> best King. Which is no
<hi>Complement</hi> at all to his <hi>Majesty</hi> himself; for an <hi>Usurper,</hi> it seems,
would be better for <hi>His</hi> turn. So that without any <hi>If's</hi> or <hi>And's</hi> the
thing is given for Granted; and upon this <hi>Instigation,</hi> the least
Rumour in the World, that way, puts the people upon a General Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacre;
as the bare Report lately of the <hi>French</hi> appearing before the
Isle of <hi>Purbeck,</hi> had like to have done in several places. And then
to the same Purpose, <hi>Pag. 23. They will vigorously, and speedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
attempt the Kings Ruine, unless he suddenly prevent it, by
adhering to his Parliament, and ruining Them First.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this be the way to <hi>Expose</hi> the Life of his most Sacred Majesty, or
to <hi>Preserve</hi> it, let the World judg: And of the Irreverence of hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
so tender a Point at this Course rate. Nay, he does not only
pronounce upon the <hi>Thoughts</hi> and <hi>Purposes</hi> of <hi>Men,</hi> but upon the
most <hi>secret appointment</hi> of <hi>God himself. When God designs
the Destruction of a King, or People,</hi> (says he) <hi>Pag. 11.
he makes them deaf to all Discoveries.</hi> This Observation of his,
I'm affraid is more to the purpose then he was aware of: For there
are Discoveries of several sorts, that are Evident Enough, and yet
not much taken notice of. To say nothing of the Censures he passes
upon the Kings Actions, and Publick Resolutions of State: Only I
wonder who made this Man a <hi>Judg</hi> in <hi>Israel.</hi> He quarrels his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
<hi>Pag.</hi> 3. For <hi>Prorogations,</hi> and <hi>Dissolutions</hi> of <hi>Parliaments.</hi>
And <hi>Pag.</hi> 4. upon another Point. <hi>Pag.</hi> 23. He Pre-judges the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:107089:20"/>
               <hi>as if they would give his Majesty no Supplies, unless
he takes off the Heads of the Popish Faction, exclude the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesslon,
and consent to such Laws, as must of necessity ruin
them.</hi> In his 6<hi>th Page,</hi> he shews himself so good an <hi>English-man,</hi>
that he Professes, he would rather be under a <hi>French Conqueror</hi>
then under the <hi>Duke,</hi> as <hi>Successor.</hi> And he goes so far too toward
the Dislike of the Government it self, that he says, <hi>no Government
but Monarchy can in</hi> England, <hi>ever support, or favour</hi> Popery, <hi>P.</hi> 7.
He tells the City, <hi>Pag.</hi> 5. that <hi>their Enemies</hi> are young beggerly
Officers, Courtiers, Over-hot Church-men <hi>and</hi> Papists, and charges
the <hi>three First</hi> with lessening the <hi>Plot;</hi> and resembling the <hi>times</hi> to
1641. Now how is it possible, but the <hi>Positions</hi> of 1641. should
put us in mind of the <hi>Rebellion</hi> of 1641? He begins his 10<hi>th
Page</hi> thus. <hi>After the</hi> Catholicks <hi>had thus brought the</hi> Fathers
Head <hi>to the</hi> Block, <hi>and sent the</hi> young Princes <hi>into</hi> Exile, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Now to give the Devil his due, I cannot find so much as <hi>one Papist</hi>
in the whole List of <hi>Regicides.</hi> He has, I confess, one admirable
<hi>Fetch</hi> to prove His <hi>R. H.</hi> dangerous to his Majesty, because he is both
a <hi>Friend,</hi> and a <hi>Brother,</hi> Pag. 17. as if the King were safer in the
hands of his <hi>Enemies,</hi> then of his <hi>Friends.</hi> If his meaning be,
that they are more dangerous in regard of <hi>Confidence,</hi> and <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities;</hi>
there is no Fence against that Danger, but utterly to
cast off all the <hi>Bonds,</hi> and <hi>Dictates,</hi> of <hi>Society,</hi> and <hi>good Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
We must contract no Friendships, and trust no Relations for
fear they should out our Throats. How much more wretched then
Beasts has our Appealer made us at this rate, by poysoning the very
Fountain of Human Comforts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>Though I have drawn out this Pamphlet already further then
I intended<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I must not close it yet without one General Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
upon the People we have to deal with in this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Calumny</hi> and <hi>Imposture</hi> have ever been the two main Pillars
of their Cause; and if they can but wheedle the Vulgar, on the
one hand, and defame the Friends of the Government, on the
other, their business is done. There scarce passes a day without
a Libel against both <hi>Church and State;</hi> without either <hi>Provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
or <hi>Punishment:</hi> which both shews their <hi>Malice,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms
them in their <hi>Insolence.</hi> There is nothing so Odious, and
so Ridiculous together, as betwixt <hi>Droll,</hi> and <hi>Sophisme,</hi> these
People represent the Publick Management of Affairs. And who
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:107089:20"/>
can blame the <hi>Multitude</hi> now, under these Circumstances of
<hi>Licence,</hi> and <hi>Delusion,</hi> if they either Forget, or Depart from their
Duties? Is there not <hi>Law,</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> sufficient for the <hi>Preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,</hi>
or <hi>Suppressing</hi> these Indignities? Or is it a thing not worth
the taking Notice of? for his Majesty to be told every day, in a
Pamphlet, at his Palace-gate, that <hi>His Ministers are Traytors and
Conspirators; His Courtiers a Pack of Knaves, and He himself
but upon his Good Behaviour to his own Subjects?</hi> WILL it end
Here? DID it end Here? But whence is it that all this <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom</hi>
and <hi>Confidence</hi> proceeds? The <hi>Former</hi> is only a Fermentation
of the <hi>Old Leaven</hi> (for we have our <hi>Iesuits</hi> too) The <hi>Papal
Iesuite</hi> is an Enemy to <hi>Heretical Kings,</hi> and the <hi>Protestant Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suite</hi>
will have <hi>no Kings at all,</hi> and then for their Confidence, they
have both <hi>Impunity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and <hi>Encouragement:</hi> the former proves it
self; and I shall now conclude with a word or two concerning
the other.</p>
            <p>The bringing of this Devilish <hi>Plot</hi> upon the Stage, has struck
all men of Piety, Loyalty, and Love to their Country, with
<hi>Amazement,</hi> and <hi>Horror.</hi> The <hi>Murther</hi> of a <hi>Prince,</hi> the <hi>Subversion</hi>
of our <hi>Government,</hi> and <hi>Religion;</hi> What can be more Exercrable?
The thought of so Diabolical a Practice has justly transported
the People to the highest degree of Rage against it, imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
And it is a <hi>Meritorious,</hi> and a <hi>Laudable Zeal</hi> too, so long as
it contains it self within the Bounds of <hi>Law,</hi> and <hi>Duty:</hi> While
the King, Council and Parliament are, in the mean time, sif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
and Examining the Design, and doing Justice upon the
Offenders.</p>
            <p>Now there are a sort of men,<note place="margin">One Plot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der another.</note> that under the Countenance
of <hi>This Plot</hi> advance <hi>another</hi> of their <hi>own,</hi> and 'tis but the Rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
of a Libel with a little Anti-Popery, to give it the Popular
smack; and any thing else against the Government goes down
Current. If a man Writes, or Speaks, or Reasons against them,
he is presently <hi>a favourer of the Papists, a Lessener of the Plot,</hi> and
run down with <hi>Nonsence,</hi> and <hi>Clamor.</hi> A Person of Untainted
Honour and Integrity, puts in for a <hi>Parliament-man;</hi> 'tis but
any Little Fellows taking advantage of the Humour of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and <hi>Billing</hi> of him for having some <hi>Papist</hi> to his <hi>Kinsman,</hi>
perhaps, or Visiting some <hi>Lord</hi> in the <hi>Tower;</hi> or under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Scandal of a <hi>Courtier,</hi> or a <hi>Pensioner,</hi> and he's gone to all
Intents and Purposes. This is the Character they give to every
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:107089:21"/>
man that loves the <hi>King,</hi> the <hi>Church,</hi> or the <hi>Law.</hi> They serve
them as <hi>Nero</hi> did the <hi>Christians;</hi> they put them into <hi>Bears-skins;</hi>
that is to say, they call them <hi>Papists, Pensioners, Conspirators,</hi> and
then deliver them up to be <hi>worry'd</hi> by the <hi>Rabble.</hi> Shall we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
distinguish between <hi>Indubitable Truths,</hi> and <hi>Transparent Fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods?</hi>
betwixt <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Deeds,</hi> that stand in a direct <hi>Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,</hi>
the <hi>One</hi> to the <hi>Other?</hi> What Priviledg has a <hi>Phanatick</hi> to
blow up a Government, more than a <hi>Iesuite?</hi> It must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest,
however, that he is the <hi>Braver Enemy of the two,</hi> for he
scorns to sneak to the Execution of his Exploit with a <hi>Dark
Lanthorn;</hi> and to take advantage of <hi>Authority</hi> by <hi>Surprize;</hi> but
<hi>Arraigns Princes, and puts them to death in the face of the Sun;</hi>
and at <hi>this Instant,</hi> charges the <hi>Church openly</hi> with <hi>Idolatry, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition
and Oppression;</hi> the <hi>State</hi> with <hi>Tyranny;</hi> and the <hi>Law</hi>
it self, with <hi>Error</hi> and <hi>Insufficiency.</hi> His first work is to Accuse
his <hi>Superiors</hi> of <hi>Mis-government:</hi> And then he tells the <hi>People;</hi>
next, that in Case of <hi>Mis-government</hi> they may resume their
<hi>Power.</hi> And <hi>what's all this to the</hi> PLOT?</p>
            <trailer>THE END.</trailer>
