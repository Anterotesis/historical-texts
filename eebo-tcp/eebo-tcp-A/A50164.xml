            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

tainted with it. The first sin of <hi>Adam</hi>

It was propounded unto him, in <hi>Gen.
3. 5. Ye shall be as Gods,</hi> Honour and
Grandeur was the Bait which he was

Hence we are advised in 1 Tim 36. he
that is <hi>lifted up with pride, falls into the
condemnation of the Divel.</hi> It is thought
that his Dissatisfaction at some Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,

which prompted him to the Rebellion

                  <p>[<hi>Take away mine Iniquity</hi>] The word,
<hi>Take away,</hi> signifies a Causing to <hi>pass
away,</hi> and indeed therein, a <hi>passing by.</hi>
Whence we have this Conclusion.</p>
                  <p>In Iustification the Great God causes
the Sin of Men, to pass away, without
Notice of it.</p>
                  <p>Sin is <hi>passed by,</hi> and made to <hi>pass
away,</hi> when it is <hi>Forgiven</hi> to us. Our
God therein says unto us, as in 2
Sam. 12. 13. <hi>The Lord hath put away
thy Sin.</hi> As we do by Gods <hi>Law,</hi>
in <hi>Sinning,</hi> so God does by our <hi>Sin</hi>
in <hi>Forgiving.</hi> Hence the same word,
is used for both. In <hi>Sinning</hi> we pass
by His <hi>Law,</hi> as a thing not worthy
of our Notice; thus in <hi>Forgiving,</hi> He
passes by our <hi>Sin,</hi> without any such
Notice of it, as to Damn us, or to
Judge us, for the same. Our sin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
now, in some sort as tho' it
had <hi>never been</hi> at all; but as 'tis said,
in Jer. 50. 20. <hi>Iniquity shall be sought
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:46466:13"/>
for, and there shall be None; and Sins,
and they shall not be found.</hi> And Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks,
a poor <hi>Murderer,</hi> such an One
as is within Hearing of what we are
now speaking, should have his very
Heart leap within him at the mention
of such a thing. What? For <hi>such</hi> an
One, when He stands at the Bar of
the Lord Jesus, to have such a Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
brought in for him, as, <hi>Not Guilty,</hi>
there! But thus it is in <hi>Iustification;</hi>

'tis said in Mic. 7. 19 <hi>Thou wilt cast

                  <p>It is observed, that the same words
[<hi>Transgression,</hi> and <hi>Iniquity</hi>] are used
both for <hi>Sin</hi> it self, and for the <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment</hi>
of Sin.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore I shall here tender you
this one Conclusion more.</p>
                  <p>In Iustification the severe punishment
of Sin, is Remitted, with the Fault it
self.</p>
                  <p>There has been a vain Distinction

Culpae] Guilt,</hi> as <hi>Deserving</hi> of
punishment; and [<hi>Rectus Paenae]
Guilt,</hi> as <hi>Obliging to</hi> punishment. But
these are so inseparable, that when
<hi>Guilt</hi> is Remitted, the <hi>punishment</hi> goes
along with it. In <hi>Iustification,</hi> our
<hi>Bonds</hi> are taken off, and nothing is
demanded of us, as a <hi>price</hi> to A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Righteous God. It was said in
in Isa. 33. 24. <hi>The Inhabitant shall not
say, I am sick; the people shall be for|
given their Iniquity.</hi> Thus, when men
are <hi>Forgiven their Iniquity,</hi> they shall
not by <hi>vindictive</hi> Justice be made to
say, <hi>I am sick,</hi> or <hi>I am poor,</hi> or, <hi>I am
pained,</hi> and the like. There are no
proper <hi>Paenalties</hi> remaining for a jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify'd
man. Whatever <hi>Troubles</hi> he
may afterwards meet withal, there
shall not be the <hi>Wrath</hi> and the <hi>Curse</hi> of
God spicing of them; and in regard
of the <hi>Second Death,</hi> it is very peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily
declar'd unto him, <hi>Thou shalt not
Dy.</hi> It was the cry of the Psalmist,
in Psal. 143. 2. <hi>Enter not into Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with thy Servant.</hi> The God of
Heaven, acts not so much like a <hi>Iudg,</hi>
as like a <hi>Father,</hi> to a justify'd man;
and He not only secures him from
the <hi>vengeance of Eternal Fire,</hi> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
puts a New and a Knd Respect
upon all the Temporal <hi>Afflictions,</hi>
which do befal such a Man. The

                     <hi>Afflictions</hi> which happen to him, are
not so much <hi>Punishments</hi> as <hi>Chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;</hi>
and a Reconciled God therein
proceeds according to that Rule in
<hi>Rev 3. 19. Whom I Love, I Rebuke
and Chasten.</hi> Yea, if a <hi>Correction</hi> be at
any time employ'd upon him, it is
at the same time a <hi>Benefit,</hi> in that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

<hi>A</hi> Prayer for a pardon <hi>is never out of

a FOR is that? How strange an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument

will become no less than a plea for the
<hi>Pardon</hi> of them. For <hi>Great Sinners</hi> will
give <hi>Great praises,</hi> if they may tast of

Here, to speak as <hi>Ierome</hi> of
old, <hi>All Hands are Dissolved, because
nothing done by our Hands will be found
to answer the Righteousness of God.</hi> It
was a thing prescribed in Ancient Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectiores
for the <hi>Visitation of the Sick,</hi>
that the Sick Man should be taught to
say, <hi>O my God, I now place the Death of
the Lord Iesus Christ, between me and
my Sins.</hi> Behold, words fitted for
every Sin-sick Soul! What else can
we say, seeing we are told in Acts 26.
18. <hi>Men receive the Forgiveness of
Sins, and are Sanctify'd by Faith in
Christ Iesus.</hi> And hence even one of
the greatest Giants among the Romish
<hi>Philistines,</hi> having argued a great
while, for the Interest of our own
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:46466:29"/>
Merits, in the pardon of our Sins, at
last he comes to that memorable issue
of all <hi>[Tutissimum est] By Reason of
the uncertainty of our own Righteousness,
and the Danger of vain Glory, 'tis the
safest course to Repose our whole Trust,
in the Mercy and Grace of God alone.</hi>
Indeed! I pray, why then did you,
<hi>Bellarmine,</hi> Dispute with so long and
strong a Sophistry, against the <hi>safest
course</hi> in the World? <hi>I</hi> beseech you,
Let none of us take any <hi>other course</hi>
for the pardon of our Sins.</p>

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:46466:29"/>
would have the pardon of them. It
was said upon a devout <hi>purpose</hi> of
Confession, in Psal. 32. 5. <hi>I said, I
will Confess my Transgressions unto the

                  <p>In some Cases our Sins must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
unto <hi>Men.</hi> Indeed, our <hi>secret</hi>
Sins must not be divulged, until God
Himself have in a manner brought
them out; but then we are by our
own ingenuous <hi>Confessions</hi> to perfect
the Discovery, So <hi>David,</hi> so <hi>Ionah</hi>
thought, tho' they could say unto
God, <hi>Against thee, thee only have I
sinned;</hi> scarce any but God being pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy

<hi>Achan,</hi> when others were made <hi>Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi>
by his being a <hi>Sinner,</hi> and God
was pointing at <hi>him</hi> as the Troubler
of all the Neighbourhood, his Duty
then was that, <hi>My Son, Confess and
Give Glory to God.</hi> But be sure, Sins
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:46466:30"/>

&amp; such people, that had <hi>sinned pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly</hi>
of old, came to a better sense,
they <hi>Confessed their sins,</hi> no doubt a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to our selves for what sin they have
seen us overtaken with, and like the
Convicted <hi>Leper</hi> crying out, <hi>Vnclean,
Vnclean!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But in all Cases, our sins must be
confessed unto <hi>God;</hi> who knows them
all; and whom they have <hi>all</hi> affronted
and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

<hi>If we Confess our Sins, He is Faithful
and Iust to forgive us our Sins.</hi> We
are to confess our sins before the God
of Heaven, both very <hi>particularly,</hi> and
very <hi>sincerely.</hi> We may do well to
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:46466:30"/>
take a Catalogue of <hi>Duties Required,</hi>
and <hi>Sins Forbidden,</hi> in all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments
of God; and Examining
by that <hi>Glass,</hi> what <hi>Spots</hi> we have had
in our Hearts and Lives, we should
<hi>Bewayl</hi> them all before God. And
<hi>Bewayl</hi> them, without any <hi>Excuses</hi> or
<hi>Defences</hi> to Extenuate them, in our
Lamentations. An <hi>Vpright</hi> man, <hi>lies</hi>
in the Dust; Let us lay our selves
there, and so Enlarge upon our own
<hi>Vileness,</hi> as becomes, <hi>A Spirit without
Guile.</hi> Such a <hi>Confession</hi> as this, must
be made if we would have any <hi>marks</hi>
of a <hi>pardoned</hi> Soul upon us.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Forsake</hi> all your Sins, if you
would make Genuine your <hi>Confession</hi>
of them. When you have once <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited</hi>
up your Sins by Confessing of
them, O do not return to them, as,
<hi>A Dog to his Vomit.</hi> Come to say,
as in Job 34. 31. <hi>I will not offend any
more;</hi> and study to <hi>Do</hi> what you <hi>say.</hi>
As, <hi>The Burnt Child will dread the Fire,</hi>
So let us <hi>Dread</hi> all the Sins which our
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:46466:31"/>
Souls have been scorched with; and
let us not espouse any <hi>Way of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>
If any of us will <hi>go on still</hi> in
our Sins, let us not forget what will
come of it; no less truly than that in
Psal. 68 21. <hi>God shall wound the Head
of such an one, as goeth on still in his
Trespasses.</hi> But O what horrible <hi>wounds</hi>
are those which the Omnipotent Hand
of the Great God shall be the Inflicter
of! Do not venture to <hi>go on</hi> in any
course of Sin; but be able to say, <hi>I
hate every false way;</hi> and especially, be
able to say, <hi>I kept my self from mine
Iniquitie.</hi> Albeit any Sin may have
been as dear as a <hi>Right-eye,</hi> or a <hi>Right-hand</hi>
unto you, nevertheless, <hi>Away
with it!</hi> Whatever bad course you
have heretofore been us'd unto, abhor
it now, with a very hearty and zealous
Detestation; and say, <hi>What have I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
more to do with Idols?</hi> 'Tis a <hi>New
Life</hi> that we are now to be studious
of; and we may not promise a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
to our selves, while we <hi>continue
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:46466:31"/>
in Sin.</hi> Tho' God at first <hi>Iustify the
Vngodly,</hi> yet he will not let a <hi>Iustified
man</hi> remain <hi>ungodly</hi> any more; no he
teaches him to <hi>Deny all ungodliness,</hi>
and Live <hi>Godlily, Soberly, and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
in this present Evil World.</hi>

USE of these things, to be Regarded by
<hi>one</hi> among us, who is never to see the

therefore let <hi>him,</hi> as a man just come
unto the very side of the black <hi>River</hi>

and if we seek you next Friday Morning,
you shall not be among us.</hi> Tis a great
Favour of God unto you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that you
have liberty to hear a <hi>Sermon</hi> or two;
before the Execution which you are
Sentenced unto; your Monstrous
Hands hurried your poor <hi>Wife</hi> out of

it with an inexpressible Bitterness, that
you have no better <hi>improved</hi> those hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds
of <hi>Sermons</hi> which you have <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed</hi>

you, let not one more be lost. You are

Nothing but the <hi>Blood</hi> of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,

                  <p>I am to tell you, <hi>First,</hi> That your
Slit is very <hi>Great.</hi> The <hi>Sin,</hi> for which
you now stand Condemned, is, a sin
of a deep <hi>&amp;</hi> bloody <hi>Dye<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Murder</hi> is
the most Barbarous and Divelish, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
all the Crimes that are <hi>Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
to be punished by the Iudge.</hi> Will
a Wolf kill a Wolf? no, and the very
<hi>Bears agree among themselves.</hi> But
shall a <hi>Man</hi> than be worse than a
<hi>Wolf</hi> unto a <hi>Man?</hi> If, <hi>He that loves
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:46466:33"/>
another fulfils the Law,</hi> 'tis easy to
tell what he does, that Murders ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
The most Wretched Pagans
have observed of the Murderer, That
<hi>Vengeance will not suffer him to Live.</hi>
But <hi>your <hi>Murder</hi>
                     </hi> is one hardly to be
parallel'd in an Age! 'Tis said, <hi>No
Man</hi> (if he have but the Heart of a
MAN in him) <hi>ever hated his own
Flesh.</hi> What then are <hi>you,</hi> that have
<hi>Murdered</hi> yours? Find a Name for
yourself, if you think it possible!
You have Murdered <hi>Her</hi> whom you
should have Loved above all the
world; <hi>Her</hi> whom you should have
Cherished with all the Kindness and
Goodness of an Holy Conversation;
<hi>Her</hi> whom you should have been wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
even your self to have Dy'd for
the preservation of. And with <hi>Her</hi>
'tis said, you have <hi>Murdered</hi> an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant,
which never saw the Light.
This is your Sin. And Doubtless,
they were not few or small Sins, for
which God left you unto <hi>This.</hi> You
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:46466:33"/>
had long before, been guilty of those
Impious both <hi>Omissions</hi> and <hi>Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
which gave the Divel at last a

Consider of them all; a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Trouble your own Soul, for your Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief

You have sat long under the Gospel;
but you have <hi>Refused,</hi> yea you have
<hi>Crucify'd</hi> the blessed Redeemer, who
therein besought you to be Reconciled
unto God. How should the <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance</hi>
of this be to you, as the <hi>Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood

                  <p>

there is a little more pain reserved for

has Eternal Life.</hi> It says, <hi>The
Murderer shall not Inherit the Kingdom
of God.</hi> It says, <hi>The Murderer shall
have his portion in the Lake that burns
with fire and Brimstone.</hi> Surely, Thy

which indeed will never have an <hi>End</hi>
What think you of Changing your

Sin, <hi>in the furthest efforts of it, fill'd

put in, saying,</hi> Thou hast been my Vassal
