            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>IT was for your Direction, as well as for the Advantage and Benefit of</hi> Children, <hi>that this small Treatise was at first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ended to be wrote and publish'd: 'Tis to you therefore that it is address'd, hoping that it may be found serviceable to you in the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of your Duty in many Respects. For,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, <hi>It will constantly remind you of the Necessity and Obligation you lye under, in reference to the particular Management and Education of either your own or others</hi> Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren <hi>you have taken the Charge of. Nature puts upon you a Necessity of taking Care of the One, and your own voluntary Act obliges you to the Other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>It will furnish you with Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, that shall be much easier to you, and more advantageous to the</hi> Children <hi>you are to instruct. I need not undertake to shew the Inconveniencies of the common Method of</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:102586:3"/>
               <hi>Education. The ill Success that generally at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it, sufficiently detects it to be guilty of some grand Mistakes and Errors: It is not able to answer the end it proposes. For after abundance of useless Pains, Turmoil, and Endeavours, Whipping, Exercising and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing, when a Child arrives at the years of Maturity and Discretion, (as they call it) he is not one</hi> Jot <hi>mere</hi> Vertuous, <hi>and scarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (if at all) more</hi> Learned <hi>than he was when he first set out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I have seen in</hi> Holland, <hi>and other parts of the World, Children entred upon Businest, and very capable also of managing it, at those Years, it may be, ours here in</hi> England <hi>are learning to</hi> Spell <hi>and</hi> Pronounce.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Is it not a scandalous thing, to see a great Boy; of Fifteen or Sixteen Years old, trudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to School, with a great Bundle of Books under his Arm, to learn to decline a</hi> Noun <hi>and</hi> Conjugate Verb, <hi>and yet after all, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains uncertain, whether the</hi> Genders <hi>of</hi> Nouns <hi>be</hi> Three <hi>or</hi> Seven? <hi>But by this time he is it seems a hopeful Youth, and his Master thinks fit that he be sent to the</hi> Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity. <hi>Now there's no help for it, he must be a Schollar: And yet perhaps, when he comes to commence</hi> Batchelour of Arts, <hi>shall</hi>

               <hi>hardly be capable of determining whether the</hi> Conclusion <hi>be part of a</hi> Syllogism.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This indeed is the Craft of your common</hi> School Masters, <hi>to keep Children (like Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in a Circle) a long time under the Terror of their Iurisdiction and Discipline, in order only to promote their own Profit and Interest. A mischievous way this, and ought to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Nooice by the Government. Why sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>We hope a great-deal of this may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by the Rules and Methods we here propose: For what we here offer to your Consideration, is neither so difficult, nor so chargeable: There is little but what is in the Power, even of the Poorest, to compass and accomplish, at least so far as concerns the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their Children</hi> Vertuous, <hi>and teaching them to write and read, which will mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly qualifie, and enable them to get an honest Livelyhood in the World.

               <hi>such like Methods,</hi> Fathers <hi>and</hi> Mothers <hi>may in a Twelve-months time teach their Children more of true and useful Learning at home in their Houses, than they learn at the common Schools in five Years.</hi> Decem annos trivit legendo <hi>Cicerone, To go ten Years to School to learn to construe a</hi> Latin <hi>Author, and yet perhaps after all, not understand him to purpose.

The like is to be understood of the Humane Ground, if that be not dress'd and cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated by good Order and Temperance, you must not look for a healthy and vigorous Off-spring. In a word, the whole Education, Improvement and Accomplishment of Mankind, in a great measure, depends on the Management and good Conduct of Women. For Proof of which, let us a little consider what a powerful Influence, from our very Infancy, they have over us, and what a mighty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Interest and Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they have in those very things that conduce most to our well-being, and have the greatest Effect upon our Constitutions and Dispositions.</p>

All the Nonsence of our Conceptions, and Irregularity of our Morals, is deriv'd from them, whilst through an over-fond Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness they confirm and encourage those Seminal Principles of Vice that they ought to discountenance and subdue. How many Souls are ruin'd by Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Nurses scaring their Children with horrid and frightful Names, when they would bring them to comply with their own Humour? Hereby the Seeds of Fear are planted, which continually subject the Soul to constant and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable Bondage. Besides, the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of their Passions, and irregular Actions, have a mighty Influence upon our tender Souls, insomuch that those first Impressions can never be obliterated

or removed. They also prepare Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens Food, and order and appoint their Diet and Exercises. From hence it appears how much we are under their Conduct and Management, as to Bed, Board, and all things conducing to the Preservation of Life and manner of Living.

When you ask Children why they do This, or That? They will answer, Their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers taught them, and they saw their Mothers do it.

Instruct and Teach their Off-spring. No Tutors can Teach Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to that Degree nor with that Ease, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

If the Mother or Nurse be a Linguist, and can well understand and speak three or four Languages, the Child will quickly learn them all with as great facility and readiness as the Mother-Tongue. The same is to be understood as to all Arts and Sciences.</p>
               <p>It is a great Truth, though very little believed, That the Females are naturally
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:102586:13"/>
as fit for, and capable of all excellent Learning, as Men, even the Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks it self; and if there be any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, the Advantage is on the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens-side. They are of curious and apt Capacities, to apprehend all things that depend upon the Power of the Fancy and Imagination, being of a more delicate Contexture, and wrought with a finer Thread than Man. Pray tell me, why were they thought fit, by the wise Antients, to Prepare, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound and Dress our Food, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is true Physick? On the due Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position and Proportion of that, all the Health, Strength, nay, the Life it self of Men, depends. The Art of Preparation is not only Deep and Mysterious, but Curious and Ingenious: For, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand Preparation and Composition, with the proper Quantity and Quality of the Ingredients, is none of the least Points in Philosophy. I am sure, what the Women fall short of in this My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, is not for want of Capacity; for what they are once taught, and have made a Custom, they will hold fast. Therefore, that City or Countrey is

How preposterous is it! You will trust Women with the most material Things, even the Government of Life, and Health, and yet deny them to be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of understanding meaner Services. We affirm, they are as able to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend all Arts and Sciences to as high a degree as Men, if not higher, provided their Education be equal. Indeed, we do not approve of their being employ'd in Robust and Masculine Offices. Is i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

These are unseemly Employments, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Women Rude, Bold, Surly, and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaste. They are to be apply'd to soft and gentle Exercises, more agreeable to their Complexions. They are to be Tutor'd in Arts more suitable and proper for them, as in good Writing and Arithmetick; to understand Accompts, and the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:102586:14"/>
of Books, and all other things that may be done within the compass of the House; for if they have timely Instruction, they will soon demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate themselves to be very Apt, Sharp and Ready in all curious Arts, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times exceed even the Men themselves.</p>
               <p>By these means, Daughters would become altogether as helpful and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable both to themselves and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, as Sons; and many times more, because they are not so apt and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to Travel and Ramble abroad into Foreign Parts, nor List themselves in the Armies of Princes. Besides, the true Learning of all useful things, will render them fit and capable to answer the End of their Creation, <hi>viz.</hi> to be Helps-meet to their Husbands. For timely Education, and the teaching Children the Doing and Active Part, is, to sow in them the Seeds of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, Frugality, and Good Order. This wou'd make them Thoughtful and Serious, and teach them to have a Value for those Principles of Vertue that are so timely implanted in them; the Practice whereof will be so far
<pb facs="tcp:102586:14"/>
from being difficult and hard, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> will be familiar and connatural to them: They will take care to cherish, preserve and improve these noble Seeds, esteeming them the Foundations of Peace, Comfort, and everlasting Sere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Mind. Like frugal Men, that get Money by their own Industry, they will know the true Worth of it, and how they part with it: while others are like a wanton and inconsiderate Spend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrift, who squanders away all he has, without any regard to the Labour of those who got it for him, or consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it might have much better been employ'd in the charitable Relief of poor and better deserving People.</p>
               <p>For this Reason, most rich Persons Children are Foolish, Idle, Prodigal, and very Expensive; and their Parents can never expect better Fruit from them, till they give them better Precepts, and better Precedents. For, for the most part, they teach them Wantonness and Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance from their very Cradles, till they are Seven, Eight, or Ten Years of Age: Which ill Habits grow so very strong in them, that they become <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

vincible, and no Art or Care possible can root out or expunge them. Some few there are, indeed, that are born with more propitious and favourable Natures,—<hi>Queis ex meliore luto finxit praecordia Titan,</hi>—whom <hi>Phoebus</hi> has form'd of better Clay, that by the help of Instruction, surmount the Difficulties of an ill and prejudicate Education. But these are very little beholden to their Parents and Tutors for Good Manners and Sobriety, but chiefly to the Portion of good Nature, and God's Gifts, that are born in them.</p>
               <p>The Fear of God, Temperance, Cleanness and Frugality, are taught by Precept and Example, even as Arts and Sciences are; as also are Disobedience, Intemperance and Disorder.</p>
               <p>The principal Time of Teaching and Confirming Vertue and Vice, Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Intemperance, Arts and Sciences, Industry and Wantonness, is from Three Years of Age to Ten: whatever is fastened to them within that time, will continue for ever, and will naturally grow strong, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, with the least Industry imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.</p>

Do not many Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents at least permit, if not force their Children to Eat and Drink not only beyond the Necessity and Exactions of Nature, but also more than they are willing to receive? And Persons of all Ages have an Inclination to eat and drink more than the Stomach can with ease digest, especially if their Meats and Drinks are well compounded and delicious; which is often purposedly done, to entice Nature out of her own plain Way.</p>
               <p>Now, if Persons of mature Age and Experience are apt to exceed in this particular, and over-load the digestive Power of the Stomach, to the extreme prejudice of their Body and Mind; what must Children suffer, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any restraint, eat and drink to the end of their Appetites?

many Degrees beyond the Necessity of the Stomach, and the Requirements of the Digestive Faculty. Is not this teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Children, even in the very Cradle, to be Gluttons? Which being strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and improved by repeated Practice, is at last so deeply radicated, that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a Second Nature. So that it is no wonder to see so many Men and Women Intemperate and Debauched; nay, it is very hard to conceive it should be otherwise, when there has been so much Pains taken, and so many Years spent to confirm and corroborate the Habit; and that even in their Youthful Age, when Impressions are soonest and deepest made.</p>
               <p>For the Soul of Man is endued (as I said before) with an Universal Spirit both of Good and Evil. There is no Property or Quality in the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Things, that does not find in Man somewhat wherewith to assimilate and affix it self. Upon this account it is, that he is capable of learning all things Humane and Divine; and those Precept and Examples that are first presented have the strongest Effect, and take the deepest Root.</p>

               <p>Again, Since Children, at first, do all that they do by Example and Imitation, it must of necessity be the indispensible Duty of all Parents, or Others with whom the Charge of their Education is intrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to be industriously careful that they neither hear nor see any Unseemly Action.

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Great Master said unto <hi>Peter, Put up thy Sword: My Kingdom is not of this World.</hi> Nothing but Peace, Love, and Concord, can open the Gates into those blessed Realms of Light and Love. Except therefore the first Sallies and Motions of the Soul towards these Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities be corrected and reformed, nothing but the most fatal and irreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diable Mischief will ensne. It is, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:102586:25"/>
a Work of great Difficulty; yet that shou'd not discourage our Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours: nay, 'tis in the Infancy of our Children, if ever, that we can rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably hope for Success. Besides, the Practise of these Vices, rencounters the <hi>Oeconomy</hi> of the whole Creation: For all things both in the Animal, Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable and Mineral Kingdoms, do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from one Ground; and though the Multitude and Variety of them be beyond any humane Number, yet Each and Every of them do, in one degree or another, contain the true Nature and Property of the Whole; and in Man they have their <hi>Central</hi> Being and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence, though not in all alike, but in some one Quality is strong, in others another; from whence proceeds Mens Difference in Dispositions, Inclinations, Love, and Hatred; but the Property which is strongest in the <hi>Radix,</hi> ever sways and governs the whole Life.</p>
               <p>There is another base and depraved Custom too frequently used, <hi>viz.</hi> To scare and affright Children with horrid and terrible Names; thinking thereby to bring them to their <hi>Lure,</hi> and make
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:102586:25"/>
them quietly comply with what they wou'd have them, not considering of what mischievous Consequence it is to the <hi>Child</hi> to have its tender <hi>Soul</hi> so alarm'd and prepossess'd with such monstrous Images of Things as keep Nature in a perpetual Agitation and Trembling. If the Child's Soul be of a strong and vigorous Complexion, you thereby awaken the Seeds of Envy, Hatred, Malice, and many other surly Disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and so by mistakenly endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to lay One <hi>Devil,</hi> you raise a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand in his room. But if the Soul be of a soft, meek, and gentle Temper, you utterly confound and ruine it. It shall never be Master of one Regular Thought, and by consequence never produce an Handsom and Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable Action. It shall be eternally sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to doubt: Irresolute in its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs, and Wavering in its Attempts. For those Terrors and Amazements awaken the Internal or <hi>Central</hi> Spirits and Powers of Nature; which incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porating and joyning with their <hi>Similes,</hi> become, as it were, Consubstantiate with the Soul; insomuch, that those dreadful
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:102586:26"/>
Conceptions which they form'd in their Childhood, will never wholly depart; but though, for a time, by a vigorous Exercise, and use of Reason, they may seem to be conquer'd, yet upon any sudden Accident of Danger or Disaster, their Fears shall start out a-fresh, and they shall soon be discern'd to be yet under the Dominion of their Youthful Terrors. Which timorous sort of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, how Unfit it is for the Business of the World, and how Fatal it has prov'd to many that have been subjected to it, need not be insisted on; what we have already said, may be sufficient to convict this abominable Practice of Ignorance, Cruelty and Madness.</p>
               <p>Another very great Evil and Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to Children, is, To suffer them to play up and down promiscuously at all all sorts of Sports, and with all sorts of Play-fellows. Is it not lamentable, for Parents to let their Children throw away that part of their Time in idle, fruitless and dangerous Exercises, that is the only proper Season for them to learn the Rudiments of Vertue and Knowledge in? For One Hour well
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:102586:26"/>
employ'd, from Three Years of Age to Seven, is of more avail towards the true learning of any one Art or Science, than Ten, when they come to a maturer Age, (as they call it.) If they are not well and thoroughly grounded then, it will be very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to improve and accomplish them, when they come to riper Years. It is then the Seeds of True Knowledge and <hi>Philosophy</hi> ought to be sown, if ever they expect to reap any Fruit from them hereafter. Besides, the foolish and juvenile Pastimes fill the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with strange Images and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of Things, that like so many rank and useless Weeds interrupt and divert the growth of Real Knowledge, and True Literature; corrupting the Ground so much, that it will hardly be able to nourish and bring forth any thing of Esteem and Value. Wou'd it not raise a Man's Spleen with Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to hear an old doating Sot of a Father, cry out of his Son, <hi>This Block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head will never come to any thing: There is not such a Dunce again upon the Face of the whole Earth: It has cost me the</hi>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:102586:27"/>
                  <hi>Lord knows what, and yet I can make him learn nothing: I can make him understand nothing that is said to him. Alas! Old Fool, why did not you begin sooner with him? Why did you suffer him to squander away the best part of his Time in Idleness and Folly? Oh, then he was an arch Young Rogue, a Witty, Forward Child, and you'd warrant he'd be no Fool, if he liv'd; but now he's a mere Booby, a Dunce, and a Block-head.</hi> Take him for your Pains, <hi>Old Gray-bearded Dotard!</hi> You may thank your self for all this, and your Child is bound to Curse you.</p>
               <p>Moreover, there are other ill Effects that attend this Custom. Their Sports are often-times, especially if from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Eye of their Parents and Tutors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> so rude and boisterous, that they over-doe their own Strength, and in a violent pursuit after their Play, strain it to a pitch many Degrees a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove their Ability, to the extreme Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, and often the irrecoverable Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of their Limbs and Body; which perhaps, though not presently disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd, yet if they live, succeeding Years will give them many sharp and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesom
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:102586:27"/>
Remembrances of it. Like the Effects of Hardships, and Youthful Colds, that will not be forgot in the Winter of Old Age. Thus it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, what a disastrous and Calamitous Influence these irregular Methods have both upon Mind and Body.</p>
               <p>Now, those that would really pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote their Childrens Welfare, and their own Peace, must consult the <hi>Degrees</hi> and Abilities of Nature, else they will soon run themselves into great Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences. The Bodies and Spirits of Children are young and tender, so that they cannot endure hard and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious Exercises, without the Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of manifest Folly and Damage to their Health. For all Labour, or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise, ought to be measured in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the Strength of the Body and Mind: so that those appointed for Children, ought to be gentle and easie, such as will not strain the Body, nor dull the Spirit, together with a simple Temperate Diet, rather partaking of Moisture than Dryness; because their Growth requires more liquid Matter, by reason of their implanted Heat and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:102586:28"/>
Fire, than maturer Age. Besides, those rustick and laborious Exercises do mightily offend and retard the Growth of Childrens Limbs, far more than most People do imagine.</p>
               <p>Hence appears the Necessity of Teaching Children, from Three Years old, and upwards, some easie and useful Things, instead of their idle and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent Games and Sports, such as Musick, Painting, Housewifery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Also, to instruct them to Read and Speak Properly and Distinctly, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant in them the Seeds of Vertue and Good Manners; likewise to Walk Streight and Upright, to Run hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somly, and to make True and Proper Steps. This wou'd be a great Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and of good Service to them, when they arrive to a more mature and adult Age: It would cut off a great deal of their superfluous Time, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy it much better, and more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageously than is generally practised. Moreover, it wou'd soon discourage and discountenance the ill Custom of sending Children to be instructed at publick <hi>Dancing-Schools;</hi> where they
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:102586:28"/>
many times receive more Prejudice in a Month, than they can repair or remove, perhaps, all their Lives after. For it shou'd be the Care of Mothers and Nurses, to order the Gaite, and direct the Steps of the Children; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in if they are well instructed at first, they will observe the same for ever. For by neglect of this it is, That so many Men and Women make such an Odd and Clownish Figure in their Walking and Moving; sometimes their Steps are too thick, sometimes too short, and sometimes too long; with some extraordinary and irregular Motions of their Backs and Hips, as if their Legs were too weak to support the weight of their Body; with many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unseemly Postures; which might more easily and less chargeably be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, were the Directions we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe but follow'd and observ'd. For it is to be noted, That ill Postures, and other Habits, if they are taken up betimes, become so strong and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully grafted in the Disposition, that it is almost impossible to root them out, or unteach them again. This is an
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:102586:29"/>
undeniable Truth; and it is a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand times better, if possible, that Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren should remain in an intire and and absolute Indifference and <hi>Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trality,</hi> without learning or doing any thing at all, than to be taught or suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to imitate preposterous Methods. For if the Child be born with Streight, Sound, and Proportionable Limbs, there is but one True, Proper, and Handsom way of Going; which they may be as easily taught and brought to, as they are to Speak, provided a little Care and Pains be taken with them in the due time: For in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning every thing is alike to the Child, and one thing as soon learned as another.</p>
               <p>Neither should Children, by any means, be permitted to <hi>Ieer</hi> or <hi>Laugh</hi> at any Person's Deformity either in Mind or Body. It is a vain and lewd Practise, and generally tolerated; nay, you shall see a parcel of <hi>Old Fools</hi> stand by, and please themselves ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely, to hear Children Revile and Reproach one another. These are things that of all others, ought to be
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:102586:29"/>
severely corrected and punish'd. If once they are encourag'd to Back-bite, Envy, Defame, or Belye one another, there is no hopes of them; they will be Devils in spite of your Teeth. For these are the Seeds of all Abomination, and will, upon Occasion, as they grow up, break out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the most unlawful and criminal Enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities: <hi>Theft, Murther, Blasphemy, Treachery, Dissimulation, Lying, Perjury,</hi> and all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of accursed <hi>Villany,</hi> are the <hi>Off-spring</hi> of such an <hi>unatural</hi> and <hi>unchristian Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivance</hi> and <hi>Tolleration.</hi> 'Tis for want of Parents and Nurses taking care timely to reform and destroy these <hi>mischievous Seeds</hi> of <hi>Vice</hi> that so many, every Month, ride <hi>backwards</hi> up <hi>Holbourn-hill,</hi> to <hi>Tyburn.</hi>
               </p>

them to stuff their little <hi>Paunches</hi> with all sorts of <hi>Dainties,</hi> and richly compounded <hi>Meats</hi> and <hi>Drinks,</hi> over-charging them both in Quantity and Quality; which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermines the very <hi>Basis</hi> of Health, there being very few of so sturdy and strong Constitutions, that are not wounded by it in one degree or another. What is this, but laying a <hi>sure and lasting Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> for Gluttony and Idleness? <hi>Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> They give them all sorts of Liberty, Commanding their Servants to Humour and Obey them in all their foolish and extravagant Whimsies; by which means they never or seldom arrive at any true Discernment of Things, being indulged in every thing that their extravagant Imaginations can conceive, or their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disciplin'd Appetites desire. They very rarely put them to any kind of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove-mention'd <hi>Exercises</hi> or <hi>Employments;</hi> neither do they take care to set them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves before them as Precedents of <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance</hi> and <hi>Frugality,</hi> taking delight to see them <hi>hector</hi> and <hi>domineer</hi> over those that wait upon and attend them; by which means they become <hi>Haughty, Ambitious</hi> and <hi>Surly</hi> to all that are beneath them (as they conceive) in Birth or Estate; given

to <hi>Passion, Gluttony, Ebriety</hi> and <hi>Laziness;</hi> whereas they ought to have the contrary Vertues of <hi>Affability, Courtesie,</hi> and <hi>Genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,</hi> founded even in their very Natures and Constitutions; which infinitely more <hi>become</hi> and <hi>adorn</hi> a Noble Birth, and Fair Fortune, than an ill-natur'd and untra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctable Pride. Besides, a <hi>nice</hi> and <hi>fond</hi> Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation does, as it were, suffocate and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy all Knowledge, and True Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, even in the very <hi>bud;</hi> and chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly advances <hi>Folly</hi> &amp; <hi>Ignorance,</hi> the greatest Evils in the World; for where <hi>Folly</hi> and <hi>Ignorance</hi> joyn, (and they can never be separated,) pray what Expectation can there be of any Great or Honourable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction? The <hi>Fruit</hi> must of necessity be bad, when all within the <hi>Trunk</hi> of the <hi>Tree,</hi> the very <hi>Sap</hi> it self, is poyson'd and corrupt.

Moment in the Greater or Lesser World: How much then is it the Duty of Parents and Tutors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to see that Children are constantly and commendably employed; <hi>Idleness</hi> being a manifest Breach of the Command of God, and an open Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to the whole Course and Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Nature? It is the Mother of all <hi>Oppression</hi> and <hi>Violence;</hi> an Inlet to all <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Wickedness;</hi> and never goes alone, but is attended with a black train of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid and abominable <hi>Vices;</hi> rendring Men subject to the <hi>dominion</hi> of the <hi>gross, inferior</hi> and <hi>spiteful Powers,</hi> and <hi>evil Demons,</hi> who incessantly prompt them on to commit all kinds of <hi>Outrages</hi> against God, Man, and Beasts.</p>
               <p>From hence have all unlawful Sports and Games their rise; such as <hi>Cards, Dice, Billiards, Lotteries, Whimsie-boards, Stage-Plays, Drolls, Hunting, Hawking, Prize-play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Bull-baiting, Bear-baiting, Cock-fighting, wanton</hi> and <hi>lascivious Dancing, Racing,</hi> &amp;c. with a thousand other Vanities that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and Elder People, by their own Practice, teach their Children, whereof some are Rude, Rustick, Unmanly, and Unseemly; others Cruel, Bloody, and Oppressive; others Mean, Base, and Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feminate:
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:102586:32"/>
but all Sinful and Detestable, and ought to be condemn'd to the darkest and deepest Pit of Hell. And all this, <hi>forsooth,</hi> must be excus'd with the ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Name of <hi>Pastime:</hi> As if our Time, which is the <hi>greatest Blessing</hi> we have, were so intollerable a Burthen, that we must be beholden to the <hi>Devil</hi>'s <hi>Invention</hi> to help it off our Hands: Surely we shall, one day, find, That all we had, was but little enough to do our Duty in.</p>
               <p>Now, when I speak of <hi>Idleness,</hi> 'tis not to be understood of an utter insensible Stupidity of Soul and Body, a state of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Inactivity, or the doing nothing at all; but the doing of Evil, or that which Children ought not to do; which is the worst sort of Idleness: for, in the other sence, there is scarce any thing Idle in the whole Course of Nature. If Children be not exercised in some useful Art and Things tending to Vertue, they will be always doing the contrary. For in their First and Second Age, which is from their Birth to Seven Years of Age, and from thence to Fourteen, their Spirits are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily <hi>brisk</hi> and <hi>airy:</hi> Their Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations &amp; Desires cannot stand still, but will be endeavouring to penetrate into
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:102586:33"/>
the Knowledge of Things. Upon which account, good and wholsom Examples ought to be set before them: Their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Tasks ought to be assigned them, that they may betimes learn to dress the <hi>Gardens</hi> of their Souls, and sortifie them against the over-spreading <hi>Weeds</hi> of Vice and Ignorance, and keep their Bodies clean from Diseases and Distempers. For <hi>Idleness</hi> and <hi>Ignorance</hi> are the most inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Tyrants in the World; and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind's greatest Enemies, which this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Age has brought into great Favour and Esteem: And because they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to have their Children intirely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Subjection, most Parents accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom 'em to 'em even from their Birth; and as soon as they beg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n to Speak, fill their Heads with a Rhapsody of idle Prat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, Nonsence and Lies; and so, as it were, erect a <hi>School</hi> in their own Houses for the Nurture of <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Vice,</hi> and take no Pains to inform and instruct them in the Rudiments of <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>true Knowledge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is a grand Mistake, not to begin to teach Children any thing of Value till they are Eight or Ten Years of Age: As if they ought to <hi>commence</hi> then, when they shou'd almost have <hi>done</hi> Learning. They
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:102586:33"/>
are early and timely Plants that take su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest root, and thrive amain, (as the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of all Mankind can testifie.) In <hi>India</hi> they teach their Children to Spin fine Callico's and Muslins at Three Years old: Nor cou'd they ever bring them to Perfection, did they begin later. <hi>Italy</hi> abounds with fine Painters; and <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> with curious Spinners of Thread and Wool: In which Arts, all that have any Reputation, are very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily instructed. Pray tell me, What Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence can Age attain to, in Writing, Reading, Speaking Languages, Musick, Painting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if there have not been first some youthful Instruction implanted in them? It is a certain Truth, That the sooner we begin, the surer and better Progress we are like to make.</p>
               <p>It is no wonder then, that the Princes, and Great Men of this World, are so mightily given up to Wrath, Fierceness, and Fighting; when we consider, they are bred to it from their very Cradles. As soon as they can handle a <hi>Sword,</hi> they must have a small one provided; and when the Child shall in the least degree imitate any Warlike and Fierce Action, his Tutor and People about him praise
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:102586:34"/>
him to the Skies; <hi>I'll warrant</hi> (say they) <hi>my little Master will be a General before he dies.</hi> Then, when he's able to Ride, a <hi>Horse</hi> must be bought, with <hi>Holsters</hi> and <hi>Pistols,</hi> and all other proper <hi>Furniture;</hi> so his little Lordship must be forthwith mounted. Now his Ears are open to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>War</hi> and <hi>Battles;</hi> he dreams of nothing but <hi>Fighting, Killing</hi> and <hi>Conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> all the Discourse about him, is of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>Armies</hi> and <hi>Sieges,</hi> of <hi>Battalions</hi> and <hi>Squadrons,</hi> of <hi>Trenches, Bastions, Half-Moons, Parapets,</hi> and <hi>Counterscarps,</hi> with such impertinent <hi>Iargon,</hi> that the <hi>little Warrier</hi> fancies himself already in the <hi>Battle,</hi> just now a going to enter the <hi>Breach,</hi> and the <hi>Town</hi>'s our own. By such Methods as these, they <hi>animate</hi> and <hi>excite</hi> the <hi>Spirit</hi> of the Child, and stir up the Seeds of Fierceness and Wrath in his Soul; which they ought, with the greatest Care imaginable, to suppress and mollifie. Thus all Children are taught, from their Infancy, the Trade of <hi>Killing;</hi> and by practising on Inferiour Creatures, arrive, by degrees, to the Perfection of Murther, in killing of Men. This makes so many rash Young Men leave an honest and profitable Trade, where they have all
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:102586:34"/>
Things convenient and necessary, to run heedlessly in the Wars of Princes; blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, though voluntarily, submitting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to almost intollerable Fatigues and Hardships, opening their Breasts to Guns and Swords; and yet, after all, if they offer to quit their Colours, they are sure to be Hang'd, having bound themselves Apprentice to the worst sort of Slavery in the World. And this also makes the <hi>Gentlemen</hi> leave their Wives and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and all the Delights and Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their Estates, to travel into fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Countries, and there fight like mad, and venture their Lives against those they never had any Quarrel with. Now, I say, if Men are not well fraighted with good store of this unlucky Commodity call'd <hi>Wrath,</hi> it wou'd be impossible for them to Act as they do, contrary to all Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, and True Vertue: but the Power of <hi>Education</hi> is very great, and captivates all Mankind in one degree or other.</p>
               <p>Therefore, of whatever <hi>Spirit</hi> Fathers, Mothers, Tutors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> wou'd have their Children to be, let them take care to sow the Seeds thereof betimes in the Child's Soul. Wou'd you have your Child to Love and Fear <hi>God?</hi> You may easily do
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:102586:35"/>
it, to what Degree you please, provided he does not hear nor see contrary Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples. Wou'd you have him Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in Meats and Drinks? Then accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom him to proper Quantities and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Qualities in his Diet. Wou'd you have him Hardy, Strong and Healthy? Then use mean Foods, and give them in Order, and with constant Exercise pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to the Strength of the Child. Or, Wou'd you have him a Curious and Excellent Artist? Then keep him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant to the Practice of that Art, and where he may always see Examples of the same. The like is to be understood of all other Things.</p>

               <head>Some Rules concerning Proper <hi>FOODS</hi> for Children.</head>
               <p>IT is agreed on by all prudent Men, That <hi>simple Meats</hi> and <hi>Drinks</hi> are most friendly and acceptable to Nature, and Healthier than those that are <hi>rich,</hi> and compounded of <hi>various Ingredients,</hi> but more-especially for the tender Nature of Children. Did Mothers and Nurses
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:102586:35"/>
truly understand and consider what was most agreeable to the Simplicity of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, this Age wou'd be happy; and the Pains and Trouble of Bringing-up Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren would hardly be felt. If their Foods were made of Corn, as Gruel made of Oatmeal; Water-Pap, which is made only of Wheat-flower and Water, with a little Salt and Bread in it; their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren wou'd be, for the most part, Plump, Brisk, Strong and Lively. When the Child is Costive, then Water-gruel, with more or less Flower'd-Pap, eating a little Bread and Salt with it, is very good and proper. This sort of Food is not only Healthier than Pap made of Milk, but much more Strong, and every way more substantial. It generates better Blood, and causes a more free and undisturb'd Circulation. For I affirm, If Children shou'd never have any other Food for the first Seven Years of their Age, than Water-gruel, and Pap made with Flower, Bread, and Salt; their Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions wou'd be much healthier and firmer, free from innumerable Diseases wherewith thousands are now tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; withal, adding good Spring-water for their Drink.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:102586:36"/>
The World is not so grossly mistaken in any thing, as in the due Preparation of Meats and Drinks, especially as they relate to Children. Nothing is a greater Evil than <hi>Ignorance.</hi> All Meats and Drinks that are <hi>rich</hi> and <hi>delicate,</hi> are not in the least agreeable to the Nature of Children; such as Milk-Foods mixed with <hi>Sugar</hi> &amp; <hi>Spices;</hi> also <hi>Butter</hi> &amp; <hi>Cheese,</hi> if not eaten sparingly: all <hi>Fish, Flesh,</hi> and Foods wherein <hi>Eggs</hi> are mixed, as <hi>Custards, Cheese-cakes,</hi> &amp;c. are pernicious, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to some Children; likewise Pies made with unripe Fruit, mixed with Sugar, which must indeed be eaten sparingly.</p>
               <p>But what unaccountable and prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterous Methods do we follow? Our Governours Fondness and Ignorance de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroys us. Mankind would be as Healthy as any other Creature; and Healthier too, provided his Food was as natural and simple as that of other Creatures. I say, and I affirm nothing but Matter of Fact, A Man may do as good a Day's Work, nay, better too, that eats but a Penny-half-penny's worth of Oatmeal made into thick Gruel, than he that stuffs his Carkass with the greatest Varieties he can think on. A <hi>Gentleman</hi> of my Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:102586:36"/>
told me, That he liv'd for a Half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penny a Day, on that sort of Food, for 3 Months together. But be the Quantity what it will, I am sure a Man may live very well on it; and be more Strong, Brisk, and Lively, than with Beef and Mutton. Besides, if Childrens Diet were <hi>simple</hi> and <hi>natural,</hi> they wou'd be of larger Growth, finer and straiter Limb'd, and every way more compleat; especially if their Exercises were gentle, and suited to their Strength. This is evident, from the difference in Health and Strength between the Children of Poor People, and those of Greater Persons.</p>
               <p>Are there any People that have gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally <hi>more</hi> or <hi>healthier</hi> Children than the <hi>Scotch</hi> Women? Yet most of them live chiefly on Gruels made of Oatmeal; and their Cawdles, when they Lye-in, are no better then Spoon-meats made of Oat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meal &amp; Water, sometimes boiling there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with a little Small-beer or Ale. Besides, in those <hi>Northern</hi> Parts of the World, no People <hi>dandle,</hi> or carry their Children less about in their Arms: They are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd to it by their Poverty and Want, being forced customarily to labour abroad in the Fields for their Livelyhood, as
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:102586:37"/>
well as at Home; so that they have lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to give but little more Attendance on their Children, than just <hi>suckle</hi> and feed them at the usual Times. For the constant carrying and <hi>lugging</hi> of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren about, is very prejudicial to their Health, by often-times over-heating the Blood; especially if Elder and Stronger Persons take upon them that Office; for by an unaccountable Sympathy, they powerfully attract those fine Spirits from the Child, which would abundantly nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish and strengthen it. For Children be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tender in their Constitution, and their Spirits Volatile, every little Disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der inflames and precipitates them into Feavourish Indispositions; from whence proceeds a long <hi>train</hi> of other troublesom Diseases: (which I have often labour'd to acquaint Mankind with, to very little purpose; so much is <hi>inveterate Custom</hi> too powerful for me.)</p>
               <p>Children are likewise very much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced by lying in Bed with Old Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; and being kept too Hot, whereby they become Uneasie and Froward. For if things were rightly and orderly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged, there wou'd not be so much Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness and Perplexity to tend upon Four
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:102586:37"/>
or Five Children, as there is now upon One. They are preposterous in all their Methods; they over-Feed them, over-Cloath them, over. Tend them, and over-Bind them: And in other respects they are as much remiss as they exceed in this. If the generality of Women wou'd but exercise the least <hi>grain</hi> of Sence or Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, or if their <hi>Infallible</hi> Doctors wou'd be so kind as to tell them the Truth, they might quickly give themselves more Ease, and their Children more Health. Where there is no Order, there can be no good Effect, but every thing tends to Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and Irregularity. If they will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve no proper Methods, but do every thing without Order or Discretion, they must take what follows: For the Child will do every thing it is accustom'd to; and that Custom that comes nearest the <hi>simplicity</hi> of Nature, will soonest and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siest be embraced. If the Child be used to Suck and Feed at such and such cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain times of the Day and Night, it will soon be contented with it, and expect no other Treatment.</p>
               <p>There is another thing commonly practised by Mothers and Nurses, every way as ridiculous and hurtful as any of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:102586:38"/>
the rest; and that is, Whenever the Child is out of humour, or any thing is amiss, presently to clap the Breast or a Spoon into the Mouth of it; so inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manely forcing it to Suck or Eat: Which, instead of Quieting the Child, does the more Disorder it; and though, perhaps, not for the present, yet afterwards they shall find the Effects. For, the too often Eating, when Nature does not require, must of necessity disturb, heat and burthen the whole Body. A lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table piece of egregious Folly this, and never enough to be exposed! Wou'd it not look odly, if when a Man or Woman is out of humour, or any thing else is the matter, they shou'd immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately fall to Eating and Drinking, when perhaps they have been at Dinner not above an Hour before?</p>
               <p>There is another thing, of great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to be observed; <hi>viz.</hi> That to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to teach Children betimes any Art, Science, or other Employment, and keeping them moderately to it for the most part of the Day, generates Better and more Manly Thoughts in them; improves the Natural Genius, constantly supplying it with good Notions, so that
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:102586:38"/>
they become more Serious and Thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: For, <hi>Necessity is the Mother of Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> which is ever encreased by Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise and Practice. Now, at Play there is no such Necessity, but Children ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from one thing to another; and are no further obliged, than their own Fancy inclines them. For, <hi>Constraint</hi> to any thing, dulls their Parts, fatigues and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacitates them for the learning of those things they stand most in need to know. This sort of Instruction wou'd abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly advance and beget Frugality and Order, even to a Miracle. For having obtain'd their <hi>Knowledge</hi> by their Pains and Industry, it wou'd be as valuable to them as an Estate or Money procured by a Man's own Toil and Labour. So in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable are the <hi>Advantages</hi> that wou'd hereby accrue, that it is impossible to do any more than <hi>hint</hi> at the many Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits and Vertues that result from an Early, Prudent, and Well-methodized <hi>Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> There wou'd be little Reason then to reflect, That Boys and Girls play a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way that Time with <hi>Drums</hi> and <hi>Babies,</hi> which they might employ to more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable Uses, and turn to a far better Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. And the Reason hereof is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent;
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:102586:39"/>
Because (as we have already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated) they do all Things by <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample</hi> and <hi>Imitation.</hi> Having before no Prepossession, or Prejudice, they must of necessity own that for their <hi>Sovereign,</hi> and be subjected to its Conduct.</p>

               <p n="4">4. Now, when such <hi>Masters</hi> are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided as are every way accomplish'd for this purpose, you must proceed in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Order and Method: Which will not only make all Learning easie to the <hi>Children,</hi> but also to the <hi>Masters</hi> and <hi>Tutors.</hi>

5. Take Ten or Twenty Children, from Three Years old, to Five or Six at most, who are not to be suffer'd to speak one Word of <hi>English,</hi> but all keep silence and observe: And as much as may be, the Master and Tutors must make it their Business continually to speak <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>French</hi> to them, commanding them to <hi>do this,</hi> and <hi>fetch that:</hi> And when the Children do not understand them, they are to teach them by Example, <hi>doing</hi> and <hi>fetching</hi> the thing themselves. By this means they will understand the Names of most things about the House, in Six Weeks, or Two Months; and in the <hi>interim,</hi> they must be taught to Read the Languages they learn: So that in a Year's time they shall all speak both <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> as well as any Children shall do <hi>English</hi> at that Age. And when these first Children speak the Tongues, then all that are admitted into the School will naturally learn it of Course, by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation and Reading, as easily as any learns <hi>English</hi> from their Mothers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nay, they shall Speak it better, and more properly Pronounce it, than most Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren do their Mother-Tongue.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The <hi>Maids,</hi> and <hi>Nurses,</hi> and other
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:102586:40"/>
                  <hi>Servants,</hi> shall not speak any other Tongue but what is learn'd and taught in the School; and before they arrive to it, they shall be silent, and do all things by Signs.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The Day shall be divided into so many Parts as the Children learn Arts or Things. The <hi>Master</hi> and <hi>Tutors</hi> shall neither Whip, Beat, nor shew Anger or Passion toward any Child, be he never so dull: But instead of such Correction, shall take the dull Child aside, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend and Praise him for his Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours; inform him how many Men of mean Birth have advanc'd themselves to a Noble Pitch of Eminence and Glory, by their Learning, Vertue and Sobriety; and by these Means they shall excite and prompt him on to an honourable Ambition and Emulation. This, no doubt will have a good Effect: For both Wise Men and Fools do a-like love to be Praised. But other Methods shall be used for the executing of Justice, if at any time the Children become vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and criminal; such as shall not ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritate the Spirit, or provoke Passion; which is a great Enemy to the Souls and and Faculties of most Children, and too
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:102586:41"/>
too frequently practised in most Schools; which will be wholly prevented by the good and regular Methods we prescribe. For <hi>Order,</hi> when Children are accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom'd to it, has as great Power and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence as <hi>Disorder.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. The <hi>School</hi> shall be at some Distance from other Houses, or any Town, that there may be no <hi>Communication</hi> between the Children of the School and other <hi>wild</hi> Children; that they shall not know what Swearing, or any such <hi>frothy</hi> Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course is, or that there is any such thing in the World. And so of all other <hi>evil Communication.</hi> So that it will be easie to <hi>govern</hi> them, when <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Custom</hi> have their free Influences; and where there is nothing else seen or known but the <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice</hi> of <hi>Vertue,</hi> and <hi>Study</hi> of <hi>Learning.</hi>

In the <hi>Winter,</hi> the Children shall go to Bed at Seven a Clock at Night, and Rise at Seven in the Morning; and in the <hi>Summer,</hi> at Eight at Night, and Rise at Six in the Morning. For, above all things, Children shou'd have <hi>Rest</hi> enough, and <hi>Sleep</hi> enough; which does mightily strengthen and refresh Nature, and renders them brisk and <hi>alart</hi> at their Learning.</p>

10. As soon as they are up in the Morning, they shall spend one Hour in Reading, and then eat their Breakfast: After which, such as love <hi>Musick,</hi> shall play and practice one Hour, and those that are for <hi>Painting,</hi> the like: The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers shall walk in Gardens for the same time with their Tutors, and discourse of the Nature and Vertues of Herbs, P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

After which, they shall be instructed in the Business of the House, and the Art of <hi>Oeconomicks;</hi> also the Manner and Preparation of the Food they have each day for Dinner, and have the Reasons of every thing discovered to them. Then they shall all go to Dinner; after which, in the Summer time, they shall rest an Hour and a half, sitting silent in a Chair, where they may sleep, if they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to it, which will greatly enliven, and sit them for the Afternoons Business. After which, they shall read half an Hour, or an Hour, and then such as are
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:102586:42"/>
for Painting or Musick, must spend one Hour in the Exercise of those Arts, and in the mean while the others shall be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in <hi>Writing; Arithmetick,</hi> and <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compting.</hi> When this is done, they shall be employ'd again in Gardening, Plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Sowing, Weeding, Digging, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Every one having a little Garden of their own, which they shall be taught to Dress and Cultivate; and such as are not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of that Exercise, shall walk among the others, and learn from them to do it themselves, always having their Tutors along with them: After which, they shall walk, run, and play about for half an Hour, their Tutors carefully observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they do every thing with <hi>Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> and handsomly; for all those Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises that are perform'd by the Motion and Activity of the Body and Limbs, are to be used in the Afternoon, or near the time of going to rest, and not after Full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, or Dinner, as the Custom is.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Thus they shall all learn <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>French</hi> by Custom and Conversation; for there shall be nothing else spoke in the School. Likewise they shall learn to read the same Tongue, which may be
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:102586:42"/>
done a quicker and easier way, than the common Method, and by many degrees more to the purpose: For after any Child has learn'd the Letters, this will not take up above three or four Months at the most, to teach the dullest Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to read tolerably well, and in any Book, and some <hi>Mercurial</hi> Children will learn it in half the time. This Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of ours will be natural, and furnish the Child with more Variety of Words than the common way; by this way they shall lay a Foundation for the Knowledge of all things that are conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient and needful for Mankind to know. <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> shall be as their Mother Tongue, and in two Years they shall speak and read, and understand it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, and withal, in the same time learn many useful Arts and Sciences: The day being divided into several pairs, they shall easily pass out of one thing into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, without any Weariness or Lassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, by which means it will be like Play to them; for it is call'd Play, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Children do with pleasure pass from one thing to another of their own Inclination. But if they were confin'd
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:102586:43"/>
to it, they would find it very hard Work, and be more unwilling to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue at it, than others that are put to the study of any useful Art.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Now the learning and practising several Arts, will mightily acquaint them with the knowledge of Words; for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Art or Science has particular Terms and Proprieties of Expression, adapted to it, which they will be obliged to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand in the reading Books, <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> that treat on those Subjects, so that they will have but little need of a Dictionary, when they are put to write, or discourse of the nature of Things, which many great Schollars are forc'd to have recourse to.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Thus, when they have learnt to speak these Languages perfectly, then they shall be taught the true <hi>Grammar</hi> of them, which will be easily done. For to Speak is one thing, and the Art or Reason of Speaking is another. The first must be done by Imitation and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, the other is the work of Time, and must be improved by Degrees. They that learn the Art of Speaking before they can Speak, invert the true Method,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:102586:43"/>
and as they say, put the Cart before the Horse; and I do affirm, that if there be a true Method taken, the dullest Boy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live may be taught to speak good <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> as well as he has the use of his Mother-Tongue. No Man can speak any Language well, and discourse handsomly of all things, but he that learns young, and by Conversation, all the Rules in the World can never make him a Master afterwards. All other Methods of Learning are like the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of the <hi>Lawyers,</hi> who have used all possible Skill and Endeavours to make Honesty and Justice intricate, and hard to be understood, which the plainest Man upon Earth knows perfectly, without being beholden to their Books, or being skill'd in their Art. True Pronunciation and Speaking is learnt by Hearing. Those Children that are accustom'd to hear a Noble and Elegant way of Speaking, will imitate the same. This is the way to make Eloquent Orators, and good Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists. Pray tell me, if the best of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of them all would not be at a Loss, if they were call'd to assist a Person in the Buying and Selling most sorts of the

Commodities of Merchants and Shop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keepers, to discourse of all the parts of Housewifry, Agriculture, Navigation, Ships, their <hi>Tackle</hi> and <hi>Furniture,</hi> and a thousand other useful things? most of them I believe would be forc'd to their <hi>Dictiona<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="14">14. It is believ'd by some, that if a Child shou'd never hear Speaking, he wou'd never Speak; tho' there is indeed a real Ground in Nature for Language. It is a noble thing, and distinguishes Mankind from the Beasts, and wou'd do much more, if Man had not lost the true Knowledge and Understanding thereof by his Fall and Degeneracy, <hi>viz.</hi> The Language of Nature, which was the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal Tongue that in the first Ages of the World the Antients had some glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering Knowledg of, as appears by their

I am almost bold to say, that if Mankind had not Education, he wou'd be much more ignorant than the meanest of Beasts. Now the chief difference between the Education of Men
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:102586:45"/>
and Beasts is this; the latter have their Education from Nature, and act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their first and necessary Law. and the former from depraved Custom and Tradition, great part of which is Vicious and Devilish: He is hurried on with the Spirit of Error into all Acts of Violence and Injustice, being the Devil's Slave, yet boasting of his Knowledge and Understanding, which Knowledge and Understanding is not manifested in any thing, so much as in the works of Darkness.</p>

               <p>There is one evil Practice that I find Parents and Nurses generally, guilty of, and cannot conclude without some Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection upon the horrid and wicked
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:102586:45"/>
Consequences that attend it. From the very Cradle they use all means possible to learn their Children Pride and Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: If they have any thing new or fine, they never let them alone till they have made the young Things sensible of the Worth and Value of it, thereby laying unremovable Foundations for Self-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit and Flattery, which grows up in them by degrees, till they are seduced into Presumption, and a Contempt of others, and so begets and nourishes In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, Self-Love, Anger, Hatred, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which produces Irreligion, Unbelief, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition, Impenitence, A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Is the Inlet to Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity and Falshood, the Gare of Error, and the first step to Oppression and Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, Inhumanity and Madness. It blinds all the Inward Senses of the Soul, subjecting them to all Malignant Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, destroying the Image of God, poysoning the Imagination, and all the good Virtues, and active Powers of God and Nature. It fills the Fancy with dark
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:102586:46"/>
Ideas, and destroys the Harmony of the Universe. It is a stirring Power and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and may be justly styled the Son of the Devil. Every Man hugs and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resses it in himself, but abhors and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates it in another. It is a mortal E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy to Mankind, and the Spring head of all War, Devastation, Depopulation, Self-Murder, Lying, Distraction, and whatsoever is odious and wicked in the World.</p>
               <p>What Ignorance, Blindness and Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness then does posses Mankind, that they shou'd be at such continual Charge and Pains to improve and nourish this Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Quality, that sets the World and all Nature in a Flame?

The common Method is not only te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious and difficult, whereby many are discouraged, and grow weary before they are able to read tolerably, but also very chargeable, so that poor People are not able to defray the Charge of School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for their Children.</p>
               <p>Upon consideration of these things I gave my Mind to think of some more expeditious Course, and more natural Method, <hi>viz.</hi> A more easie, quick, and familiar way of learning Letters, so that it be very delightful, both to Schollar and Teacher.</p>
               <p>First, Teach your Child the Letters, and to spell a little in the <hi>Primmer,</hi> which may be done in a quarter, or half a Year, by often naming the Letters to them, and asking what they are; for the frequent Sounding or Speaking them goes in at the Ears, and penetrates to the <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> it being the Sense that records what is spoken; so that the oft repeating, and speaking of the Letters in the hearing of of the Child, makes a deeper Impression upon the Powers of the Mind.</p>
               <p>When this is done, take any Book that treats of Temperance and Ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tue, and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:102586:48"/>
distinctly read one, two, or three words, or so many as your Child or Schollar can readily speak after you, and so proceed, making the Child point to each Word, and look with the Eye upon them, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing each Word distinctly after you, and making a Pause after every Word, till the Child hath done repeating; and when you come to any Words or Word that the Child cannot easily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce or express, then you ought to reiterate it with a plain strong Voice, assisting and helping the Child in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing; but if it be still hard, leave it, go on, it will perhaps be easilier done at another time.</p>
               <p>Thus when you have read one Book, or as much of it as you think fit, chuse another, provided always that your Books be innocent and pleasant; by this means you shall accustom your Schollar to a variety of Prints, Letters and Words, which will be of great use to him; whereas in the common Schools you see a Child that can read tolerably well in one Book, or one Chapter, and yet not be able to read a word in another: but by practicing the Method we prescribe

               <p>All the Sences have their appointed Offices. Now the particular Office of Hearing is, to receive in, and distinguish Sounds, and bring them thro' the proper Organs, and present them to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, which is a <hi>Retentive</hi> Faculty of the Soul, whose Office is to Register all the Ears have presented it with, that they may be forth coming, when any Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion shall call for them.</p>
               <p>Now the Ears being the natural Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans to receive all Sounds and Words, that Sound, Voice or Word that is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by another Person, and receiv'd by a Third, makes a far deeper Impression on the Memory, than that which he reads himself: So that he that reads aloud, remembers more than he that reads softly to himself, because the strong Speaking enters the Organs more forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and conveys the Sound and Sense to the Memory, which records and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents it to the Judgment, which is the guide of Actions, and judges of what passes and repasses thro' the little World-<hi>Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:102586:49"/>
For this cause never any Man did or can pronounce any Language or Tongue truly and properly, by reading of it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if he has not heard it spoke, and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pronounced to him, which is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that many speak most of their words improperly, tho' they have read them a thousand times, but the Ears immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly catch what they hear properly spoken, and convey it to the Memory, so that it shall never be forgotten.</p>
               <p>Now the Sense of Hearing is made good by Hearing; as in Musical Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy, by the common use, and hearing of good Musick and Singing, the Ear can distinguish Sounds, and know when it is well perform'd, and the like, is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of the speaking of Tongues. For any Person shall learn to speak any Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage by ten Degrees sooner and better, by Hearing and Conversation, than by any other Method.</p>
               <p>Therefore Children shou'd be taught to speak the Tongue or Language by Hearing or Conversation, before they think of learning the Rules. For the Reason and <hi>Philosophy</hi> of Speaking, is a great Art, and the work of Time, and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:102586:50"/>
not at all to be taught Children. This preposterous Method does rather distract and confound them, than improve and profit: So that by the Methods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly used in the Schools, very few ever arrive to speak of many things. It is Conversation that givesChildren an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Tongue, or way of Speaking. By this means, <hi>viz.</hi> By frequency of Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Discoursing, the hardest words will become easie and familiar; for as we said already, they, ought to speak and read perfectly, before they enter upon the Reason and Rule of Speaking.</p>
               <p>Now the Advantages of the fore men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd Methods are: <hi>First,</hi> It saves Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of Time, which is of great Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; in our Schools, a Boy learns for seven Years, and after all, can neither write nor speak a Line of true <hi>Latin.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the difficulty in their way of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding damps and discourages the Child's Industry and Inclination to learn. <hi>Secondly,</hi> He shall pronounce his Words more properly, and exactly. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He shall more readily read in any strange Book, offer'd him at first sight. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It does wonderfully benefit and
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:102586:50"/>
imprint the matter on the Memory of the Teacher; so that there is as it were a Co-partnership in Learning, between the Master and the Schollar. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> By this way any Father, Mother or Friend, may with Ease and Delight teach their own Children to read at home, without the Charge or Trouble of sending them abroad to School where for the most part they learn nothing but lewd Words, and ill Manners, and in short, lose all their time. <hi>Sixthly,</hi> This Method will not be only beneficial to Children, but to those of maturer age, that would learn to read well, who may hereby be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd in three or four Weeks, to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and be made capable of pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing all Words with their right tone and accent, as well as if they had been bred Schollars. For example, when they have heard, and been used to pronounce this word <hi>[Participate]</hi> short, they will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver say <hi>[Par-ti-ci pate]</hi> making the last Syllable save one long, which wou'd be ridiculous; yet these, and a many other Absurdities, are the effects of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Methods of Teaching.</p>

               <head>Of Retaliation, or Rewards and Punishments.</head>
               <p>REtaliation both in Good and Evil, is the Original Foundation of the Law of Justice ordained by God and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which no Man can escape or avoid. The secret and sure hand of Gods Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice will certainly meet and find the Transgressor either publickly or private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this World or in the next.</p>
               <p>Upon this consideration <hi>Moses</hi> and all the wise Ancients founded and framed their Laws of Government in Conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to this Original Law of God in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which our Saviour Christ has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, saying <hi>Such Measure as you mete to others, such shall be Measured to you again.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:102586:52"/>
                  <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> and all the rest of the <hi>Philosophical</hi> Law-givers endeavoured by all means to make their followers sensible of the importance of this Law, being the first Principle and Foundation on which all true Religion and Vertue does depend. So that it is imposible for him to be a Sober, Vertuous, Temperate, and Good Man, that has no regard to this Law. Christ also told his Disciples, <hi>That they must do unto all Men, as they would have others do to them.</hi> Which is the compleat fulfilling of all Laws both Divine and Humane.</p>
               <p>Therefore there is the greatest ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity imaginable, that every Man be made sensible of the Worth, Value and Bounty of this eternal <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aw, and that Children should be instructed even from their very Cradle, that Rewards and Punishments assuredly attend the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and Violators thereof. For if little Children were well Educated in the fear of God, and the Methods of Order, Temperance and Cleanness, and taught that every Evil of what kind soever if not Repented of, and forsaken must be Reta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liated either in this World or the next, it
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:102586:53"/>
would immediately stem the Tide of those Enormities that are every Day committed without either Reproof from their <hi>Elders,</hi> or Regret to <hi>Themselves.</hi> Now I say, did Men firmly believe these things, the dread of Retaliation would keep them from Oppressing either their own Kind, or Creatures of inferiour Ranks and <hi>Species.</hi> For all sorts of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance and Oppression be they little or much, must be retaliated, as well in private Families, as in publick States. What else is the occasion of changing and transferring of Governments, from one to another, and the shifting of private Estates and Families; so that it is rare to have an Estate continue in one Family for three Generations, which proceeds from the neglect of living in, and obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God's Law in Nature.</p>
               <p>Kings, Princes, and great Men, with force and power, break all Bonds and Obligation of Justice, violate and oppress their Inferiors having no regard to that Golden Law, of doing unto all Men as they wou'd be done unto, with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand other Evils they commit, as if no Mercy or Sense did dwell in them. So
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:102586:53"/>
that oftentimes they are depose from their <hi>Government,</hi> out off by violent and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mature Deaths, or else these Evils are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taliated upon their Posterity. The like is to be understood concerning every pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Family and Person.</p>
               <p>When a sober industrious Person has got an <hi>Estate,</hi> what does he then but by his own mistaken Conduct, together with the <hi>Women</hi>'s idle and nonsensical Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods in the Education of his Children, make way for the transferring of it, and by this means sets it agoing much faster, and in a shorter time than it was got? Now some think this swift motion of transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Estates is occasion'd by the <hi>ill getting</hi> of them, which indeed is too often true, but not always; for it is visible that the ill Conduct of Parents, in bringing up their Children, does frequently do it: For all Idleness, Intemperance, and Mispe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t time are certainly punished; and tho' it be done by Children, yet they must un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo the Retaliation, both in the Good and Evil. No Creature under Heaven that breaks God's Law can escape the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, due for such a Violation and Transgression. And on the other hand,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:102586:54"/>
God is no Respecter of Persons; but whoever lives and obeys this sacred Law, is blessed with the sweet Influences of Heaven, and accepted of God, whether young or old.</p>
               <p>Now if Parents did but give themselves Leizure to think, they wou'd never suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer their Children to run headlong to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction as they do; nay, many give them Precedents and Examples for their evil Practices and Disorders. Which plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declares them to have no <hi>Faith,</hi> and that they do not believe one word of the Scripture, or the Commandments of God and Christ, recommended to them. For I must take leave to tell you, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving</hi> is quite another thing; for where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>Faith</hi> is, it is accompanied with great Power, which does as it were compel those that enjoy it, to a Conformity and Obedience to its Commands. It hath a secret <hi>Sympathetick</hi> Operation upon the Inclinations, Gestures and Intentions, and can powerfully change the innate Nature of the Mind.</p>
               <p>Suppose any sober Person chances to be at some distance from home, and at the same time a Servant or Messenger comes and tells him, that his House by
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:102586:54"/>
some Accident was on Fire, and that it burn'd so violently, that his only Child and Wife were consumed to Ashes in the Flames. Now do you not think that this Report would alter and change this Person from a Chearful, Sedate Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to a Melanchollick Anxious State of Mind, as not doubting the Truth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of? How many Examples have we of this kind? of Persons, that upon the News of ill Events Accidents, have been so sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized, and overwhelmed with Grief, that they could not be perswaded to Eat, Drink, or Converse with any Body. Some have been so overcome, that they have entred into Vows of Abstinence and Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denial, and others so disturb'd, that they have thro an innate Power of the Mind, and strong Imagination of the Belief of the Truth of it, shook off the Bridle of Reason, and broke the Chains of their Senses, and run mad and distracted; which would never have happen'd, had they not firmly believ'd what was reported: Which Instances are wonderful Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Manifestations of the Power of Faith. And it is clear in the business of Religion, that Men will hazard their
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:102586:55"/>
Lievs and Estates as freely, in the defence of a Diabolical Opinion, as for the Truth it self; and the reason is, because they believe it to be true.</p>
               <p>Pray therefore do but consider the Nature and Operation of undisturb'd <hi>Faith,</hi> and how powerfully it works on the Mind, and how it alters and changes Nature to all Intents and Purposes. Now I say, if <hi>Faith</hi> hath so powerful an Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration on Man for the least of Momenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Enjoyments, what shou'd be the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of true Faith, for, and of things, that are durable and eternal? Especially if we reflect that Mankind has not in any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree liv'd answerable to the Rule and Condition, on which Salvation and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness is promised and intail'd.</p>
               <p>Hence it is plain, that most Men in the World do bely themselves, when they say they have <hi>Faith,</hi> and that they believe; for Christ saith, <hi>That if we had</hi> Faith, <hi>tho' no bigger than a Grain of Mustard Seed, we might be able to remove Mountains;</hi> that is, all Sins and Evils that lie in our way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Faith</hi> is an ineffable Spirit and Divine Power. It is higher than all Heighths, and deeper than all Depths. It is a Spiritual
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:102586:55"/>
and Holy Virtue, that does penetrate, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the very Centre of all Beings and Commands over all the Celestial and Terrestrial Powers, having as it were the mighty <hi>Fiat</hi> in its self, making something where there was nothing. Man's Soul is its Chariot, where it rides in Glory and Triumph, altering and changing all Essences, Forms and Qualities: All things submit to its Influences, and nothing is able to withstand its Power.</p>
               <p>Now the true Season of Sowing and Planting this true <hi>Faith</hi> in Children is from three or four Years of age, to ten or twelve; and being well fastned and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd to them in those young and tender Years, a small Industry afterwards will improve it to a very high degree. And as it lays a sure and deep Foundation for all things, both in Virtue and Vice; so it is clear and most true, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> the that believes God's Commandments, and his Law of Justice and Retaliation, dares not abuse nor violate any of his Kind, nor inferior Creatures, nor be Intemperate, Idle, Lewd or Disorderly. I say, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, That it is impossible for Men to be so extreamly <hi>Brutified,</hi> and Act as they
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:102586:56"/>
do, had they but the least Grain of true Faith. It is only Talk, and nothing else, there being no greater Evil in the World than the evil Education of Children, and certainly Parents must, and are obliged to make a Retaliation for their Neglects, and ill Management of their Children. All the great Wickedness, Violence and Pollutions that are frequently committed in our parts, owe their Original to Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes in this Point. And shall not there be a Reckoning?

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This consideration cannot be too much, nor too earnestly pressed; for Knowledge, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with Vice, serves but to exalt it to its Perfection; and when a Nation or Person have thus fill'd up their Measures, they are fit Objects for Ruin and Destruction. The Nature thereof is such, that it draws Divine Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on their Heads, except infinite Love and Forbearance steps between, to give an Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity for Repentance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This being premised, and due care taken to prevent the sowing of this evil Seed, and also</hi>

                  <hi>to root up as much, as may be such evil Weeds; as may arise of themselves in Children, thro' the power of depraved Nature; then it may be proper to offer to their Understandings Things worthy the Nature of Man to receive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We find that Speech or Discourse by words, used by Men to communicate their Thoughts, to explain the Nature of Things, to detect Falshood and Vanity,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>is only peeuliar to Man, and differences them from the rest of the Creatures, being a Character of a Divine Stamp, and shows the Excellency of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We find by common Experience, that Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren learn Speech very early and easily, and it is equal what ever Language is offered to them, they will with the same ease acquire it, which I conceive is a clear Argument for what I before offered, that Example ought to be presented to Children of what you would instruct them in, and we find also, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Language Children are brought up in, and use till they come of Age, that becomes so natural to them, that it is difficult to learn another Language, commonly the first is so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest, that many cannot express themselves in another Language, but it shall have somewhat of the first mixt with it, which showsnot on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:102586:59"/>
                  <hi>how how easie it is to instruct Children by Example, but also what is learned in Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, is rooted so deep, that it is not easily Eradicated.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If for Example sake we here in</hi> England <hi>would instruct our Children in the</hi> Latin <hi>Tongue, or any other Language, would it not be easier, quicker, and more effectual to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it after the same manner they learned their first Speech, than by Artificial</hi> Methods, <hi>and</hi> Grammar <hi>Rules, which I conceive ought to be offer'd them afterwards? But this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath of late obtained with many Men, who are proper Iudges therein; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the less may be said thereof, it carrying so strong an Argument forit self, even in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Proposal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is found by experience, that in some parts of</hi> Europe, <hi>where two or three Languages are spoke, that the Children there commonly learn them together; as in</hi> Flanders <hi>the</hi> Dutch <hi>and</hi> French; <hi>in</hi> Switzerland, <hi>the</hi> German <hi>and</hi> French.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What may be the reason that here in</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland <hi>we speak not the</hi> Latin <hi>so readily as in some other Countries? May it not be for want of frequent Examples? Another Instance may here be very fitly offered, to show the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity</hi>
