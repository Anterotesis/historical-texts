            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Am bold to present this
liberal <hi>Discourse</hi> with
the greater <hi>Confidence</hi> to
<hi>you;</hi> because <hi>you</hi> alone
being witness with how little
application I have been able
<pb facs="tcp:96567:4"/>
to frame it, (importun'd as I was
by several <hi>Avocations</hi>) it may
with the better grace presume
upon your indulgence: There
is this only which I have infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
cause to regret; that the
tenuity of the <hi>Oblation,</hi> bears
so little proportion to the
<hi>duty,</hi> and the <hi>service</hi> which I
owe you: But, though I
might haply have oppress'd
you with a <hi>larger</hi> Volume, I
could not with a more <hi>illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi>
and becoming <hi>Argument;</hi>
nor indeed, made choice of a
fitter <hi>Arbiter</hi> then your self to
<hi>determine</hi> between us, who
have pass'd so much of your

your <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Country,</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:96567:4"/>
in a <hi>period</hi> when a less <hi>steady</hi>
Virtue must have succumb'd

the <hi>dignity</hi> of a <hi>Charge</hi> in

mention the constant <hi>Asylum</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Have this <hi>Request</hi> to make, and
this <hi>Account</hi> to give of the ensuing
<hi>Discourse;</hi> That as it was but the
<hi>Effects</hi> of a very few <hi>hours,</hi> a cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sory
<hi>pen,</hi> and almost but of a <hi>sitting,</hi>
The <hi>Reader</hi> will be favourable in
his <hi>suffrage,</hi> and not hastily <hi>pronounce</hi>
against the <hi>merits</hi> of the <hi>Cause:</hi> I do not
speak this to <hi>justifie</hi> my <hi>discretion,</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Conscious of my <hi>defects,</hi> I would presume
to <hi>engage:</hi> Let me be look't on but as the
<hi>Forelorn,</hi> who though resign'd for <hi>lost,</hi>
do service yet in the <hi>day</hi> of <hi>Battel,</hi> and
lead on the rest: I dare assure the most
<hi>instructed</hi> for <hi>Fight,</hi> that it will be no dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour
to be <hi>o'rethrown</hi> by such an <hi>Hero;</hi>
who, if I discern rightly of his <hi>spirit,</hi> by
that of his <hi>style,</hi> is too <hi>generous</hi> to insult
over the <hi>Vanquish'd;</hi> and it will be no
shame to resigne our Arms.</p>
            <p>I ingenuously acknowledge, that amongst
so many <hi>Pens</hi> as the <hi>Writers</hi> of this <hi>Age</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:96567:8"/>
employ, I find not many that are better cut.
On the other side, it must be granted, that he
has all the <hi>Topics</hi> and <hi>Discourses</hi> of almost
all the <hi>Philosophers</hi> who ever writ; and
that whilst he <hi>declames</hi> for <hi>Solitude,</hi> I am
forc'd to tread the most <hi>unfrequented</hi> and
<hi>solitary</hi> paths; and if for that reason I have
not oblig'd my self to the exactest <hi>method,</hi> I
have yet pursu'd my <hi>Antagonist,</hi> rightly <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall'd</hi>
and <hi>compar'd,</hi> who has himself laid
down, and resum'd as pleas'd him; nor in
these <hi>Prolusive</hi> and <hi>Oratorious</hi> Contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
is the liberty without good <hi>Example:</hi>
But that which would best of all <hi>justifie</hi> me,
and the seeming <hi>incoherencies</hi> of some parts
of my <hi>Discourse,</hi> would be the noble <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors</hi>
Piece it self, because of the <hi>Antithesis,</hi>
and the forms of his Applications. But as
I said, I do not pretend to <hi>Laurels</hi> and
<hi>Palms,</hi> but to provoke some stronger <hi>Party</hi>
to undertake our <hi>Agressor:</hi> The <hi>War</hi> is
Innocent, and I would be glad this way of
<hi>Velitation</hi> and <hi>short</hi> Discourses upon all <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,</hi>
in which other <hi>Languages</hi> greatly
out-do us, might exercise our <hi>reasons,</hi> and
improve the <hi>English</hi> style, which yet wants
the <hi>Culture</hi> of her more <hi>Southern</hi> Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
and to be redeem'd from the <hi>
                  <unclear>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince</unclear>,</hi>
without wholly resigning it to the <hi>Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:96567:8"/>
and the <hi>Theater,</hi> to the neglect of those
other <hi>Advantages</hi> which made the <hi>Romans</hi>
as <hi>famous</hi> for their <hi>Eloquence,</hi> as for their
<hi>Armes,</hi> and inabl'd them to subdue more
with their <hi>Tongues</hi> then with their <hi>Swords:</hi>
Let us consider it was but their <hi>native</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
which they familiarly us'd, and
brought to that Perfection; and that there
is nothing so <hi>course</hi> and <hi>stubborn</hi> but is <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished</hi>
by <hi>Art.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This ingenious <hi>Stranger</hi> (for some <hi>Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi>
and some <hi>Words,</hi> (yet apt, and well
inserted) perswade me he is so, (though a
<hi>subject</hi> of his <hi>Majesties</hi>) will justifie what I
aim at; And the felicity which we have of
gracefully <hi>adopting</hi> so many <hi>Languages</hi> and
<hi>Idioms</hi> into our own, frustrates all presences
of not infinitely improving it: This was
once the <hi>design</hi> of the <hi>Royal Society;</hi> and
as it was worthy their thoughts; so I hope
they will resume it: I add not this, as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming
my self to have attain'd the most
vulgar talent in this kind: My <hi>business</hi> has
only been the <hi>Vindication</hi> of an <hi>oppress'd</hi>
subject, and to do <hi>honour</hi> to <hi>Employment:</hi>
In the mean time, 'twere priety, if at <unclear>last</unclear> it
should appear, that a <hi>Publick Person</hi> has
all this while <hi>contended</hi> for <hi>Solitude,</hi> as it
is certain, a <hi>Private</hi> has done for <hi>Action:</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:96567:9"/>
But as I perswade my self, if it be so, he has
power to Retreat from <hi>Business;</hi> I protest
I have not the least <hi>inclination</hi> to it, though
for want of a <hi>better,</hi> I have undertaken <hi>this.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Gentleman</hi> is pleas'd to call his
<hi>Book</hi> but an <hi>Essay; Mine</hi> hardly <hi>pretends</hi>
to so much; which makes me presume, be
will not judge me <hi>uncivil,</hi> nor take any thing
I have said in <hi>ill</hi> part, the nature of this
<hi>War</hi> consider'd: But if he shall esteem it so
<hi>important,</hi> and think fit to <hi>Rejoyn;</hi> I so
far promise to assert his <hi>Cause,</hi> and the just
<hi>conceptions</hi> I have of his <hi>rare</hi> abilities;
that though I would willingly incite some
better <hi>Pen</hi> to wait on him, that I may still
enjoy the <hi>diversion</hi> and <hi>benefit</hi> of his <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses,</hi>
I will <hi>for ever</hi> be <hi>silent</hi> my <hi>self,</hi> and
after <hi>all</hi> I have said here to the <hi>Contrary,</hi>

it upon so wide a mistake,
as what is deriv'd from the sense of
an impious <hi>Poet,</hi> and the sentences
of a few <hi>Philosophers;</hi> insinuating
by the unconcern'd and inactive
life of <hi>Him</hi> who gives life and
activity to all Beings, that to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble
<hi>God</hi> (wherein consists our

still, and do nothing. <hi>Dissolvitur

And if <hi>Memmius</hi> be perswaded to

believe that the supreme Arbiters
of our actions would take little
notice of them, it was no conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to the more illuminated <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,</hi>
that to approch the tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the <hi>Deity,</hi> men should pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
their Ease, or hide their Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents

               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:96567:10"/>
and so indeed the Conscience of

by <hi>Plutarch,</hi> that the lives of
<hi>Great Persons</hi> should resemble that
of the <hi>Gods,</hi> who delight in such
actions as proceed from benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
and doing good to others;
since the contemplation of it alone
was superior to all other satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions:
But what if the same <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi>
tell us in another place, that
those who do nothing considerable

               <hi>Mihi

more remarkable, as 'tis oppos'd
to what he seems to press from the
lazy Deity of <hi>Epicurus:</hi> Certainly,
<hi>God</hi> that would not permit the
<hi>World</hi> it self to remain in <hi>Idëa</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but publish'd and brought it
forth to light by the very noblest

of all his actions (for such was its
educing out of nothing,) and that
of <hi>seven</hi> whole days and nights,<note place="margin">Gen. 2. 2.</note>
reposed but <hi>one</hi> himself; and has
been ever since preserving and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning
what he made; shews us
us by <hi>this,</hi> and by the continual
motions of the <hi>Stars,</hi> and revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions

that to resemble him (which is the
sum of felicity) we should alwaies
be in <hi>action,</hi> and that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more agreeable to his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. If we have recourse to the

we shall find <hi>there</hi> also, that even

which signifies labour and the

and would perswade us

with the empty breath of
<hi>Fame,</hi> and so very fond of it, that
without remembring the known
saying, <hi>Nemo eodem tempore assequi

empty glory in some <hi>Solitudes,</hi> and
affected <hi>Retreats,</hi> than in the most
expos'd and conspicuous actions
whatsoever: <hi>Ambition</hi> is not only
in publick places, and pompous
circumstances; but at <hi>home,</hi> and
in the interior life; <hi>Heremits</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
are not recluse enough to
seclude that subtile spirit, Vanity:
<hi>Gloriari otio iners ambitio est,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sen. Ep. 78</note> 'Tis
a most idle ambition to vaunt of

since it does but proclaim a desire

let no man know it: <hi>Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Neocles</hi> brother to <hi>Epicurus,</hi> as

that wary expression, <hi>Latenter esse

it: What says <hi>Plutarch?</hi> Even he
that said it, said it that he might be
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:96567:12"/>
known: I will not add how se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely
he pursues it (because our
<hi>Author</hi> may be concern'd, that a

transmitted us his name) but if it
be the property of those who are
excessively ambitious themselves
to redargue the glory and dignity

is, that many affect Greatness, few
Vertue, for which honours are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
desirable; be good and you
cannot be too popular, commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
makes it better; for permit
me to affirm, that there is an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable

               </gap>, this despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing

            <p>But let us suppose the motives
why men pursue <hi>greatness,</hi> to be
some of the particulars here enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated:
may we not as well
affirm <hi>Celador</hi> flies it for the appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
burthen, and because 'tis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensive,
out of closeness and ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice,
humour, or want of ability?
some grow sullen and peevish that
they be not advanc'd; others are
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:96567:13"/>
naturally Hypocondriacs and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnine,
tempers of the basest aloy:
But when opulent &amp; great persons
(says he) undertake Publick Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
the very <hi>rabble</hi> have so much
of prudence as to condemn them
for mad: when <hi>Philosophers,</hi> they
serve their <hi>Country,</hi> not their <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations,
&amp;c.</hi> None indeed but
the <hi>rabble</hi> make that judgment;
for being commonly mad, they
think all others like themselves;
and when <hi>Philosophers</hi> pretend it,
it seems by him they cease to be
<hi>Philosophers,</hi> and then 'tis no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
what they say. The truth is,
men then begin to praise <hi>Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
when either no longer vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and capable to act, that their
spirits and bodies fail; through
age, infirmity, and decay of senses;
or when they cannot otherwise
attain to what they aspire; which
sufficiently justifies the preference
of <hi>Employment;</hi> since to be thus
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:96567:14"/>
happy, they must first begin to
dote. Nor does the <hi>Merchant</hi>
traffick so dearly for <hi>Solitude,</hi> but
for his <hi>Ease,</hi> and the difference is
wide between them: If to be
owner of a stately <hi>house,</hi> to be
bravely <hi>furnish'd,</hi> to have a fair <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi>
a rich <hi>Coach,</hi> and noble <hi>Reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue;</hi>
if to eat good <hi>meat,</hi> drink
the most <hi>generous Wine,</hi> and make
more noise amidst his jolly friends,
than ever he did either at <hi>Sea,</hi> or
the <hi>Camp,</hi> be a <hi>Merchant</hi> or a <hi>Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers</hi>
Solitude; who would not
desire the pretty Retreat which he
describes? For this (I take it) 'tis
that both <hi>Merchants</hi> plow the
Seas, that <hi>Lawyers</hi> break their
brains, and <hi>Souldiers</hi> fight battels:
in sum, to live at ease, and splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly;
who before, and whilest
employ'd, were the Pillars and
Ornaments of their Country.
When <hi>Caesar</hi> is brought for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
<hi>aliquando licebit mihi
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:96567:14"/>

to the sence of this argument; it
ought yet so far to disswade us
from the pursuit of his <hi>example,</hi> as
'tis perfectly opposite to an <hi>Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical,</hi>
as well as <hi>moral</hi> position: No

               <note place="margin">Rom. 14. 7</note>
               <hi>No man,</hi> says <hi>Cicero, is born for
himself:</hi> Certainly the great <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus</hi>
had learn'd that lesson too
well to affect <hi>repose</hi> for <hi>himself</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
or with an intention to relax
the excellent Government which
rendred that <hi>age</hi> of his so happy
above others: He knew <hi>Iustice</hi> and
<hi>Fortitude</hi> were <hi>active</hi> Vertues, and
that <hi>Princes</hi> are <hi>Shepherds,</hi> whose
function 'tis not to play all day on
the <hi>Pipe,</hi> and make love to <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillis;</hi>
but to attend the good of
their flock: Nor indeed should
they trifle their hours in giving
audience to <hi>Bouffoons,</hi> or sport with
<hi>Apes:</hi> Would it become an <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror,</hi>
who should march before
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:96567:15"/>
               <hi>Legions,</hi> and give Laws to <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,</hi>
to play with <hi>Cockle-shells,</hi>
or be stabbing <hi>Flys,</hi> when <hi>Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors</hi>
are attending him, as <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi>
did? For what can this <hi>mihi
vivere</hi> less signifie in a <hi>Prince,</hi>
whose greatest glory proceeds
from <hi>actions,</hi> profitable and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
and to live for others, such as
renown'd the memory of this gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
<hi>Hero?</hi> whilest the rest aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning
themselves to ease, effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy,
and phantastick pleasures
(like <hi>Tiberius</hi> in his <hi>Capriae</hi>) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
the pity of their age, and
the subjects of <hi>Tragedy</hi> and <hi>Satyr:
Caesar</hi> then breath'd after <hi>Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
for <hi>relaxation</hi> only, and that
he might revert to his charge with
the more courage and vigour:
Thus <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Lelius</hi> went apart,
thus <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Varro,</hi> and not to
sing <hi>Verses</hi> to the Forests and
Rocks, and dialogize with <hi>Echoes,</hi>
the entertainments of <hi>Solitude.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:96567:15"/>
Neither does he less erre in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
it to publick business in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of <hi>dignity;</hi> seeing that which
takes care for the <hi>being</hi> of so many
<hi>Societies,</hi> is infinitely more honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
than what has only regard
to it <hi>self;</hi> and if his <hi>Logic</hi> hold,
<hi>quod effecit tale, est magis tale,</hi> those
are most to be reputed happy, who
render others so; since <hi>God</hi> and
<hi>Nature</hi> come under the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
Could his <hi>happy man</hi> remain
in that desirable estate, without the
active lives of others to protect
him from rapine, feed and supply
him with Bread, Cloaths, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
necessaries? For 'tis a grand

being the basest of humors, and

contrary, even in this <hi>age</hi> of ours,
as all Antiquity can hardly parallel:
Never was adverse Fortune en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred

their <hi>Relations,</hi> and all that
can be named <hi>Calamity,</hi> to preserve
their <hi>Loyalty</hi> and their <hi>Religion:</hi>
In sum, when our <hi>Princes</hi> submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the <hi>Axe,</hi> and our <hi>Heros</hi> to the
<hi>Haltar;</hi> whilest we beheld people
of meaner Fortunes, and private
condition, <hi>lovers</hi> of <hi>Solitude</hi> and
<hi>Ease,</hi> (repining at every inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
loss) prostitute both their <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi>
and <hi>Conscience,</hi> to preserve or
recover, what they but feared the
loss of, and this <hi>Elogy</hi> is due to
thousands of them yet surviving.
I acknowlege that the ambitious
person is in his sense a <hi>bottomless-pit;</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:96567:23"/>
and that <hi>Ingratitude</hi> and <hi>Treason</hi>
are too often pay'd for favour and
good Offices: Though I have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
asserted in what circumstances
even <hi>Ambition</hi> it self is laudable,
and may be stiled a Vertue: But
have <hi>Private men</hi> no thoughts of
amplifying their Fortunes, and of
purchasing the next <hi>Lorship?</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying,
not to say <hi>sacrificing</hi> their
<hi>Children</hi> to the next rich <hi>Heir,</hi>
and <hi>marketing</hi> for the <hi>Portion?</hi> Is
there not in the best governed Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
of <hi>Country Gentlemen,</hi> as
much purloyning, ingratitude, and
infidelity amongst their few <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants</hi>
and small Retinue (not to
mention ungracious and disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<hi>Children</hi>) as in the greater <hi>Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conomy</hi>
of a <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably

there more emulation, contention,
and canvasing, than in the remoter
<hi>Villages,</hi> or next good Towns?
They sell us <hi>repose</hi> too dearly (says

               <hi>Plutarch</hi>)<note place="margin">De tranq. animi.</note> which we must purchase

Women be of all other the
quietest lambs in the world, and
far exceed men in peaceableness
and tranquillity, since they seldom
stir out of their Houses; yet we
find the contrary so notorious, and
this gentle <hi>Sex</hi> (whom so much as
the wind dares not blow on) as
full of envy, anger, anxiety, jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie,
and pride, as those who
most of all converse in Publick,
and are men of business. And
therefore we are not to measure
felicity and repose from the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude

all rational <hi>Conversation,</hi>
and so come under the <hi>Category</hi> of

eating and drinking; no <hi>pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,</hi>
save the <hi>sensual:</hi> I have
known as great animosities among

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:96567:25"/>
of spirit, partiality, sense of inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and revenge upon trifling occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
and suggestions, as ever I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
in the greater and more bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied
world: 'Twas evident that
the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> were more
proud of their mean <hi>Apparel</hi> at
the <hi>Olympic</hi> Courses, than the most
splendid <hi>Rhodians</hi> in all their bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
and <hi>clinquant;</hi> and <hi>Socrates</hi>
soon espied the insolence of a
slovenly <hi>Philosopher</hi> through his
tatter'd mantle: The <hi>Gynic</hi> in his
<hi>Tub</hi> currishly flouted the Eastern
<hi>Monarch,</hi> and despised his purple
that secluded him from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
beams of the <hi>Sun.</hi> He ought to
be a wise and good man indeed
that dares trust himself <hi>alone;</hi> for
<hi>Ambition</hi> and <hi>Malice, Lust</hi> and <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition</hi>
are in <hi>Solitude,</hi> as in their
Kingdom: <hi>Peritstulto,</hi> says <hi>Seneca,</hi>
Recess is lost to a <hi>Fool,</hi> or an ill
man; and how many weak heads
are there in the world for one dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:96567:25"/>
Person! It was <hi>Crates</hi> the
Disciple of <hi>Stilpon,</hi> that bid the
<hi>morose</hi> walker, take heed he talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not with a <hi>Fool:</hi> some men, says
<hi>Epictetns,</hi> like unskilfull Musitians
sing no where tolerably but in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort;</hi>
and 'tis noted he must have an
excellent voice that can charm the
ear alone, which renders them so
difficult to be entreated. There
are few <hi>Plants</hi> that can nourish
themselves with their own juice;

            <p>But he declames only against the

defect in the brighter <hi>Lumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>
is observed, whilest the lewd

of his prodigious <hi>debaucheries:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sen. Ep. 82.</note> So
true is that of the <hi>Philosopher,</hi>
wherever men abscond themselves
humane miseries, or their vices find

them out and ataque them: <hi>Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta

within us enslave us, even in the

greatest <hi>Philosophers,</hi> nay the very
<hi>Fathers</hi> of them severely taxed
for the lowest pleasures, and the
sins not to be named? <hi>Seneca</hi>
himself escaped not the censure of
<hi>Covetous</hi> and <hi>Ambition; Pliny</hi> of
excess of <hi>Curiosity; Epicurus</hi> of
<hi>Riot; Socrates</hi> of <hi>Paederastie; The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mistocles</hi>
of <hi>Morosity; all</hi> of them
of <hi>Vanity, Contempt</hi> and <hi>Fastidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the instance of great mens
submissions to the commands of

holds well had the discourse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
<hi>Tyrants</hi> only and <hi>Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi>
but to produce that Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Parmenio,</hi> and <hi>Cleander,</hi> is
to quit the <hi>subject,</hi> and borrow
the extravagance of a <hi>mad-man</hi>
and a <hi>drunkard,</hi> to decry <hi>Princes</hi>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:96567:26"/>
and <hi>States-men,</hi> who are the most
conspicuous examples of <hi>tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance:</hi>
But I proceed to the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xime:</hi>
If nothing be <hi>morally</hi> good
which labours of the least defect,
then so long as his <hi>Celador</hi> is not
an <hi>Angel,</hi> he does no more come
within the first part of the <hi>Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
than the greatest and most
employ'd Person living; and if he
insist upon degrees, I answer; he
lyes not under the same <hi>temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and therefore neither can he
pretend to approch his merit:
but if I prove the most <hi>diabolical
Arts,</hi> and cursed <hi>Machinations</hi> to
have been forg'd by Persons of the
most <hi>obscure</hi> condition, and hatch'd
by the <hi>Sons</hi> of <hi>night, recluse,</hi> and
little conversant in <hi>affairs,</hi> I shall
infinitely distress that opinion of
its virtue or advantage; for being
either happy in it self, or render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
others so. The <hi>Monkes</hi> have
been so dextrous at the <hi>Knife,</hi> and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:96567:27"/>
other arts of mischief, that they
have not trembled to make the
holy and salutary <hi>Eucharist</hi> the <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicle</hi>
of destruction, when they
had any <hi>Kings</hi> to dispatch and put
out of the way; and have made
such havock of the <hi>French Henrys,</hi>
that but for these solitary birds,
those <hi>Princes</hi> might have surviv'd
all their sad misfortunes: It was
not for nothing that <hi>Ieroboham</hi>

(that <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Darkness</hi>) when

Story</hi> has accurately record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
The blackest <hi>treasons</hi> have

amongst us at this day, but
so many Persons who seem to be
the most self-denying people, and
the highest affected with <hi>Solitude</hi>
and devout <hi>Enthusiasme,</hi> despising
Honors, and <hi>publick Charges,</hi> whilst
they breathe nothing save ruine
and destruction? They are the
<hi>close, stagnate</hi> and cover'd Waters
which stink most, and are fullest of
mud and ordure, how calm and
peaceable soever they seem upon
the surface; whilst men of <hi>action,</hi>
and <hi>publick</hi> spirits, descending as
from the highest rocks and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nences,
though they sometimes
make a noise, have no leisure to
corrupt, but run pure and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
mixture: There is an heavy
<hi>Wo</hi> denounc'd in <hi>Scripture</hi> to those
who thus <hi>setle on their Lees: Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians</hi>
tell us the <hi>body</hi> is no longer
in health,<note place="margin">1 Zeph. 12.</note> than the <hi>bloud</hi> is in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and duely <hi>circulates: Action</hi>
is the <hi>salt</hi> of life, and <hi>diligence</hi> the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:96567:28"/>
               <hi>life</hi> of <hi>Action:</hi> All things in <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>
are in <hi>motion,</hi> and though 'tis
there only that we can promise re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to our selves; yet neither
dare I say, we shall do nothing
there; since the admiration of the
<hi>beatifical Vision</hi> will certainly take
up and employ all our faculties,
and set them in operation; nor
whilst we shall <hi>there</hi> be in perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
<hi>Exstasie,</hi> shall we <hi>live</hi> to our
selves, but to <hi>God</hi> alone. There
is then doubtless no such thing as
<hi>rest</hi> (unless it be that from earthly
toil, anxieties, and the works of
sin, which is that repose mention'd
by the <hi>Apostle</hi>) since <hi>Action</hi> is so
essential to our lives,<note place="margin">Heb. 4. 9.</note> that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutes
our Beings; and even in
all <hi>Theory</hi> and <hi>Contemplation</hi> it self,
there is a kind of <hi>Action,</hi> as <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers</hi>
do universally agree.</p>
            <p>Let it be confess'd the <hi>Court</hi> is a
Stage of continual <hi>Masquerade,</hi> and
where most men walk <hi>incognito;</hi>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:96567:29"/>
where the art of dissimulation
(which <hi>Donna Olympia</hi> has nam'd
the <hi>Keys</hi> of the <hi>Vatican</hi>) is avow'd;
yet it cannot be deny'd, but there
are some in that warm <hi>Climate</hi> too,
as perfectly sincere, as in the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;</hi>
and where <hi>Virtue</hi> shines with
as much lustre as in the closest <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirements,</hi>
where if it give any
light, it is but in a dark lanthorn:
And to be so innocent <hi>there,</hi> where
there is so much <hi>temptation,</hi> is so
much the greater merit: Believe
it, to conserve ones self in <hi>Court,</hi>
is to become an absolute <hi>Hero;</hi>
and what place more becoming
<hi>Heros</hi> than the <hi>Courts</hi> of <hi>Princes?</hi>
for not only to vanquish <hi>Armies</hi> in
the field, defend our <hi>Country,</hi> and
free the oppressed, are the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus
actions of those <hi>Demi-Gods;</hi>
but to conflict with the regnant
<hi>Vices,</hi> and overcome our selves,
greater exploits than the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of inchanted <hi>Castles</hi> and kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:96567:29"/>
of <hi>Gyants:</hi> For what violence
must be apply'd to be <hi>humble</hi> in
the midst of so much <hi>flattery; chast</hi>
amongst such <hi>licence,</hi> where there
is so much fire, and so much tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and not to look towards the
fruit which in that <hi>Paradise</hi> is so
glorious to the eye, and so delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to the taste? what a dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to purity, to come forth <hi>white</hi>
from the region of <hi>Smoke,</hi> and
where even the <hi>Stars</hi> themselves
are not without their <hi>spots?</hi> in
sum, not to fall into the <hi>nets</hi>
which the <hi>noon-day Devils</hi> spread
under our feet, above our heads,
and about us; and who pursue
those that flye, and bear down
those who resist? But, as I said,
if the difficulties be so great, how
much greater the glory? whilst
pretending to no such temptation
in his <hi>Solitude,</hi> there is less exercise
for his Virtue; it being rather a
<hi>privation</hi> from Evil, than any real
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:96567:30"/>
               <hi>habit</hi> to Good. Certainly, there
is not in the <hi>Country,</hi> that admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
simplicity pretended, nor do
they altogether transact with that
integrity: For is there not among
them as much iniquity in <hi>buying</hi>
and <hi>selling?</hi> as much over-reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the purchase of a <hi>Cow,</hi> or a
score of <hi>Sheep?</hi> as much conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
about the incrochment of a
dirty fence? as much <hi>regreating</hi>
with the <hi>Farmer,</hi> keeping up the
price of <hi>Corn,</hi> when the <hi>poor</hi> are
sterving? How many Oaths and
Execrations are spent to put off a
diseas'd <hi>horse?</hi> Have we not seen
as much ambition and state where
the <hi>Country Iustices</hi> conven<unclear reason="blotted">e</unclear> on
the <hi>Market-days</hi> at the petty
Towns, to have the Caps and the
Knees of the <hi>Bumkins?</hi> as much
canvasing for <hi>Suffrages</hi> and Voices?
not to insist on the prodigious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauches,
drinkings, emulation, and
perjuries at <hi>Elections?</hi> and even
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:96567:30"/>
greater pride, deadly feud, railing
and traducing amongst the <hi>She-Pharisees,</hi>
or little things of the
<hi>Neighbourhood,</hi> for the upmost
place in the <hi>Church-pew,</hi> or at a
<hi>Goshiping</hi>-meeting, as at <hi>Court,</hi> and
in the <hi>City</hi> between the <hi>Ladies</hi> of

while we grow weary of the <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,</hi>
and resolve against <hi>Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
and the sound of <hi>affairs;</hi>
repenting of the lost moments that
are past in <hi>Conversation:</hi> and yet
in every <hi>Cave,</hi> and every <hi>Cottage,</hi>
there is a <hi>chair</hi> for <hi>ambition,</hi> and a

though <hi>hell</hi> be <hi>raining</hi> out of <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:</hi>
and it may be observ'd that
we do not hear the least evil of
<hi>Lot,</hi> or the virtue of his <hi>daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
whilst they liv'd in the midst
of <hi>Sodom</hi> it self,<note place="margin">Gen. 19. 32.</note> 'till abandoning

               <hi>ebriety</hi> and <hi>incest.</hi> Verily, that is
truly great to retire from our <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
not from <hi>Cities,</hi> or <hi>Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi>
If you be <hi>Virtuous,</hi> let your
Example profit; if <hi>Vitious,</hi> repent
and amend; Strive not so much
to conceal your passions, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
them: for little do <hi>solitary</hi>
persons profit, without a mind a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapted
for it; <hi>Wise men</hi> only enjoy
themselves, not the voluptuous
or morose; and I have seen some
live discontented even in houses

            <p>When he celebrates <hi>Recess</hi> for

is fertile: it is not from the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance

from its sterility and defects, which

            <p>He proceeds again to the <hi>passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
of <hi>great men,</hi> which are indeed

One day that <hi>Philip</hi>
the <hi>second,</hi> had been penning a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
<hi>Dispatch,</hi> importing some
high affair of <hi>State,</hi> which em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
him almost the whole day;
he bid the <hi>Secretary</hi> that waited
by him, to throw some dust on the
paper; <hi>he</hi> instead of the <hi>Sand</hi>
snatching up the <hi>Ink-bottle,</hi> poured
it all on the <hi>letters:</hi> The <hi>King</hi>
taking a large sheet of clean paper
wrote it <hi>verbatim</hi> over again, and
when he had finished, calmly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
it to the confounded <hi>Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,</hi>
bid him dry it; but, says the
<hi>Prince,</hi> take notice that this is the
<hi>Ink,</hi> and <hi>this</hi> the <hi>Sand-box;</hi> which
was all the reproof he gave him:
I instance in this (because of the
rest of those <hi>Vertues</hi> I have enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated,
there are such Volumes
of <hi>Examples</hi>) to put to <hi>silence</hi> all
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:96567:33"/>
that can be produc'd, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of that <hi>passion,</hi> which is so
frequently charg'd on <hi>Great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;</hi>
but which indeed upon the
most trifling occasions, use to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compose
the most <hi>retired</hi> persons:
And what if amongst <hi>these,</hi> besides
many others, I should instance in
S. <hi>Hierome</hi> himself, and other <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>
of the <hi>Church,</hi> as recluse and
private as they were known to be

            </p>
            <p>As to the comparative exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
of <hi>Solitude</hi> from <hi>Vice</hi> for
want of <hi>opportunity;</hi> the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
is very slender; since (with
what I have already furnish'd to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
it) it implies only what <hi>mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters</hi>
it would else produce; and
indeed the most formidable that
were ever hatch'd, have thence
had their original; as I have abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
prov'd by the dark and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal
machinations of <hi>Solitary</hi>
Persons: so as his <hi>Happy-man</hi> seems
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:96567:34"/>
at best to be but a starv'd, or Chai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<hi>Lyon,</hi> who would do mischief
enough had he liberty, and a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
equal to his will: 'Tis instanc'd
in the <hi>madness</hi> of some few <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then</hi>
Emperors; but he passes by
the salutary <hi>Laws</hi> promulg'd by
<hi>them</hi> for the universal good: Nor
were there so many debauch'd and
Vicious of the <hi>Roman</hi> heretofore,
but I can name you as many <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi>
Princes religious to miracle
and without reproch, if what is
already said be not sufficiently ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>replicable.
As for the <hi>rest,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they might once have been
in their ascent; it was said of
<hi>Caesar,</hi> that either he should never
have aspir'd to <hi>dominion,</hi> or hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
once attain'd it, been <hi>immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal;</hi>
so just, so equal, and so merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
was his successive <hi>Reign:</hi> Never
was it pronounc'd of any <hi>private</hi>
Person, that he was <hi>a man after
Gods own heart;</hi> but we know it
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:96567:34"/>
was so of a <hi>King,</hi> and that from the
<hi>Almighty</hi> himself. And not to
mention <hi>Hezekias, Iosias, Iehosa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat</hi>
and many others recorded in
holy <hi>Writ:</hi> I durst oppose an <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus,</hi>
a <hi>Titus,</hi> a <hi>Trajan, Antoninus,

the <hi>Alphonsos</hi> and divers more of
the Crowned heads, before <hi>any,</hi> or
<hi>all</hi> he can produce: Its true, they
all <hi>dyed</hi> not in their <hi>beds;</hi> no
more do all in his <hi>Solitude;</hi> for
they often <hi>hang</hi> themselves, linger
in <hi>Consumptions,</hi> break their <hi>necks</hi>
in hunting, <hi>inflame</hi> themselves with
<hi>tipling;</hi> perish of the unactive
<hi>Scorbut;</hi> Country <hi>Agues</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharrs:</hi>
And if he speak it out,
who they were that <hi>stabb'd</hi> the
two <hi>Henrys,</hi> and our gallant <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham</hi>
whom he mentions; it
must be avow'd they were all
murther'd by <hi>private persons:</hi> But

whilst he is thus exact in recording
all the <hi>Vices</hi> of ill Princes; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the <hi>spots</hi> in the <hi>Sun</hi> are so ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
discern'd by his <hi>optic;</hi> he takes
no notice of the <hi>light</hi> it universal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diffuses, and is silent of the
<hi>Virtues</hi> of the good and the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent,
who have both in all ages
rewarded, cherished and protected
gallant men: But when he shall
have pass'd through all the <hi>Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi>
of the <hi>Great-ones</hi> who are
come to ruine and destruction, he
does not examine how many <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate

            <p>If <hi>Solitude</hi> be assistant to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion

               <note place="margin">Luk. 9. 10.</note> to avoid the importunities

to our heavenly <hi>Father</hi> in <hi>secret,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 6. 2. 6.</note>
and to do our <hi>Almes</hi> without a

the dignity of the <hi>service,</hi> but to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:96567:36"/>
avoid the temptation of <hi>hypocrisie,</hi>
and because we have infirmities;
whilest we are yet in another place
commanded to render our <hi>Works</hi>
so illustrious, that both <hi>men</hi> may
see them,<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 16.</note> and <hi>God</hi> may have the
glory. Certainly, the most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
motives to <hi>Religion</hi> are
from our imitation of others, and
the incentives of devout <hi>Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations,</hi>
as they approach the
neerest resemblance to the <hi>Church
Catholick Militant here on earth,</hi> so
doubtless do they to the <hi>Communion</hi>
of <hi>Saints Triumphant</hi> in <hi>Heaven:</hi> Is
there then no <hi>devotion</hi> save in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles</hi>
and <hi>Cells?</hi> and yet even
the most recluse <hi>Carthusian</hi> spend
<hi>eight</hi> hours of the <hi>twelve</hi> in divine
<hi>Offices</hi> together: The commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a true Christian consists in
<hi>doing,</hi> not in <hi>meditating</hi> only; and
it were doubtless an admirable
<hi>compendium</hi> of all our notional

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:96567:36"/>
               <hi>believed,</hi> and more were <hi>practised.</hi>
'Tis true <hi>Mary</hi>'s sitting at the feet

               <note place="margin">Luk. 10. 41.</note> and actively improv'd

               <hi>she</hi> was gently

            </p>
            <p>But he adds, that most <hi>tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
are in <hi>Solitude</hi> disarm'd of
the chains which render them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable
to us in <hi>Publick,</hi> as <hi>there</hi>
wanting the presence of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flaming

I sustain that <hi>absence</hi> does often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
augment the passion he
speaks of, and that our <hi>fansies</hi>
operate more eagerly when <hi>alone,</hi>
than when we are possess'd of the
object?
<q>
                  <l>Nor is there half so warm a fire</l>
                  <l>In fruition as desire;</l>

                     <pb n="56" facs="tcp:96567:37"/>
When we have got the fruit of pain,</l>
                  <l>Possession makes us poor again;</l>
                  <l>Sense is too nigardly for bliss,</l>
                  <l>And pays as dully with what is:</l>

            <p>Thus we are ever the most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitive
after <hi>mysteries</hi> and hidden
things, whilest those we enjoy, we
neglect or grow weary of: But I
proceed: The most superstitious
of men have been the greatest
<hi>Eremites,</hi> and besides the little
good they do by their <hi>Example,</hi>
there is not in the world a life
more repugnant to nature, and the
opportunities of doing our duty;
since even the strongest <hi>Faith</hi>
without <hi>Works</hi> will not save us:
For how can he that's <hi>immur'd</hi>
perform those acts of misericord,
which shall be so severely exacted

               <hi>Depart in peace,

whilst they give neither <hi>meat</hi> nor

But I am altogether astonished at
his instance in <hi>David</hi> again, as
prompted to his <hi>lust</hi> and <hi>murther</hi>
by the ill fate of his publick <hi>Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter;</hi>
when 'tis evident, had he been
employ'd, or but in good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
he had never fallen into so
sad a crime: Let it be remembred
that he was <hi>alone</hi> upon the <hi>Battle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
of his <hi>Palace,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Sam. 11. 2.</note> and then all
the water in <hi>Bathsheba</hi>'s Fountain
was not cold enough to extinguish
his desires; so mighty a protectress
is <hi>Society</hi> from that particular
temptation, that even the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of a <hi>Child</hi> has frustrated an
opportunity of being wanton. If
it were <hi>Gods</hi> own verdict,<note place="margin">Gen. 2. 18.</note> that to
be <hi>alone</hi> was an evil state, how
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:96567:38"/>
come we to have <hi>Adams</hi> society
blam'd? for even <hi>Adam,</hi> he says,
could not live innocent a day in it:
But, besides that the short durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his felicity is but a conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture;
I have some where read,
that but for <hi>Eves</hi> curiosity, which
prompted her to stray from the
company and presence of her <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,</hi>
the <hi>Serpent</hi> (as subtle as he
was) had never found an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to tempt her: He was indeed
too easily enticed by her example,
and no marvel, he was himself
alone; <hi>God</hi> had forsaken his sweet
associate, and then the first effects of
both their shame and disobedience
was their dark <hi>retirement:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 3. 10.</note> Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
there are many heinous <hi>sins</hi>
which <hi>Company</hi> preserves us from,
for it is even a shame to speak of
some things, which are done by
men in secret.</p>
            <p>I suppose it was no <hi>Widow</hi> (as
he speaks her to be) who so hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:96567:38"/>
entertained the great <hi>Elisha,</hi>
but a <hi>married</hi> Lady,<note place="margin">2 Reg. 8. 9, 10.</note> and of an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
Fortune: For the Text calls
her a <hi>great woman;</hi> and we find
her speaking to her <hi>Husband</hi> in
another place, concerning the
<hi>building</hi> and <hi>furniture</hi> of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi>
Chamber: Nor does the <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer</hi>
she return'd him, at all imply
her wants; she plainly needed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that the <hi>Court</hi> could confer
upon her; only an <hi>Heir</hi> she want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to inherit: <hi>she lived amongst her
People,</hi> and had company enough.
And verily we shall find the <hi>Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi>
of the same <hi>Prophet</hi> to be the
effect of a <hi>Persecution,</hi> not of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
it before <hi>Society;</hi> &amp; we meet
the holy man much oftner at <hi>Court,</hi>
in the <hi>Camp,</hi> at the <hi>Colledge,</hi> &amp; perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
employ'd, than either in the
<hi>mountains</hi> or in the <hi>Wilderness.</hi> But
let us grant that some Devotions
are best performed in our <hi>Closets,</hi>
yet does the life of a <hi>Christian</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:96567:39"/>
only in wearing the marbles
with our knees? I have already
shew'd that there are <hi>Works</hi> of
<hi>Charity,</hi> that can no where be
so well performed as in company:
nor can I assent that the being
<hi>alone</hi> contributes half so much to
our zeal, as the examples of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation:</hi>
How frequently does

               <note place="margin">22. Ps. 25. 35.—18. 40—9, 10</note> and

               <note place="margin">Deut. 32. 10.</note> yet had it at one
time in it, no less than <hi>six hundred

whereof the most devout were
the most publickly employed:
Witness <hi>Moses, Aaron, Ioshua, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leb,

            <p>To the Text in <hi>Hosea</hi> 2. 14.

under the type of the <hi>Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

for a time in the <hi>Wilderness;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isaiah 60.</note> but
neither did <hi>that,</hi> nor the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
presence of <hi>God</hi> in it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain
a rebellious people from
committing more crimes and inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences
in it, in <hi>forty</hi> years, than in

in the Wilderness,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ps. 106. 14</note> 
               <hi>and they tempted
God in the Desart.</hi> It is well known
that the first occasion of the <hi>Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical</hi>
life, we because men could
no longer live quietly in the more
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:96567:40"/>
               <hi>frequented</hi> places, by reason of the
heat of <hi>Persecution;</hi> and yet even
in their remotest recesses, he that
looks into St. <hi>Hieroms</hi> description
of it,<note place="margin">Passim in Epist.</note> shall find that they were in
such numbers, and so neer to one
another, that they were almost
perpetually in <hi>Company;</hi> nor does
any, I think, consider the stories
of <hi>Onuphius, Anthony, Simon Sty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi>
and the rest of that Spirit,
but as <hi>hypocondriacs,</hi> singular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and Authors of much super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition
and unprofitable severity:
The invasion of the <hi>Gothes</hi> on the

of those holy persons to these <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebrae,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 26.</note>
and the <hi>present distress</hi>
(to use St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s expression)
might sometimes be a sufficient
argument to recommend, if not
prefer, the <hi>Coelibate</hi> before the
<hi>Conjugal</hi> estate, and the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of that age to the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<hi>mode</hi> of living, which from
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:96567:40"/>
compulsion and a certain cruel ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
became afterwards to be of
choice and a voluntary obligation.
But does he think to derive any
force to his darling <hi>Solitude,</hi> from
the servile and busie occupations,
which none save <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>

teach, shall be among in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal

<hi>Lucians</hi> may possibly broach
those Fancies of the impertinent
employments of <hi>Alexander</hi> and
<hi>Caesar</hi> in the other World; but I
presume he takes them but for the
dreams of that Philosophical <hi>drol,</hi>
and to have no solid foundation
besides their scoffing and Atheisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Wits. He is now pleased again,
to imagine that there is nothing
which does more prevail with men
to affect <hi>Grandure,</hi> than what he
thinks due only to <hi>Phantosms</hi> and
<hi>Ghosts:</hi> Though <hi>Fame</hi> be indeed
a <hi>bubble</hi> in the estimation of those
who are not much concerned for
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:96567:41"/>
the future; I find yet how impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
it was for him to secure any
praise even to Solitude it self, by
the neglect of it; whilest he so
carefully has consecrated to poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
the <hi>Names</hi> and <hi>Elogies</hi> of so
many as seemingly despis'd it, on
purpose to obtain it: But this stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem
is very thin and transpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent:
For such as he mentions
not, I presume never were, and
those he does record, have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas'd
more by that artifice, than
if they had continu'd men of the
busiest Employment; <hi>Charles</hi> the
<hi>fifth</hi> and the rest he ennumerates,
being more celebrated for their
supposed voluntary <hi>abdication</hi>
(whatever the true motive were)
than for all the most glorious pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages
of their former Reigns: But
however these great men are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden
to their <hi>Patron,</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
the <hi>Pedants</hi> (as he calls them)
and the <hi>Poets</hi> are not less obliged
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:96567:41"/>
to him for the power he attributes
them of being able to make <hi>great</hi>
whomsoever they please: But
those persons I should think, to
have little merited of Posterity,
whose memory has no other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance
then their ayrie <hi>suffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges;</hi>
when it is from the sober
<hi>Pens,</hi> and the veritable <hi>Memoires</hi>
of Grave and Faithful <hi>Historians,</hi>
that the <hi>Heroick</hi> lives of deserving
men receive life and immortality
after death. Let the <hi>Pedants</hi> and
the <hi>Poets</hi> then celebrate the soft
and weakest circumstances of the
reignes of those Princes he would
justifie; the <hi>Pens</hi> of <hi>great</hi> and
<hi>Illustrious Authors</hi> shall eternize
those who persever'd in their gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure,
and <hi>publick Charges</hi> to the
end: for such were <hi>Xenophon, Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius,
Tacitus, Livy,</hi> and even <hi>Caesar</hi>
himself, besides many others as
well of antient as modern times,
from whose <hi>writings</hi> we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:96567:42"/>
the noblest <hi>Characters</hi> of
their Virtues: And if it be retor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that whilst they actually <hi>writ,</hi>
they were retired; I grant it;
but if men had not done things
<hi>worthy</hi> Writing, where had been
either the use, or fame of what
they so bravely acted, and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to Posterity? In the mean
time I acknowledge, that the
greatest <hi>Empire</hi> is to command <hi>ones
self,</hi> and that the <hi>Courts</hi> of <hi>Princes</hi>
have alwaies had this of ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to generous Souls; that they
but too frequently subject gallant
men to <hi>caparizon'd Asses;</hi> gay,
but vitious, or insipid: <hi>Princes</hi>
are not alwaies happy in their
choice of <hi>Favourites:</hi> But as it is
not universally so, and that it is in
the breast of the same <hi>Prince</hi> to
turn them off, or lay by the
<hi>Counters,</hi> to advance <hi>Good men,</hi>
and bring <hi>Virtue</hi> into reputation,
these external submissions may the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:96567:42"/>

but believe it with some useful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
as oft as they see a respect
paid them, which they must needs

accuse the <hi>deferent</hi> of so much
<hi>adulation,</hi> as praise him for his <hi>obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi>
so long as he offers no <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,</hi>

imitate their vices, or subject them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to the unworthy <hi>complyan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
he would insinuate; since in
that case, a fair retreat is alwaies
in ones power; and if on that
score, or the experience of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal
frailty, he be prompted to
it, how infinitely more glorious
will be the example of quitting
those specious advantages, which
can neither be conserved, or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
without succumbing under
a temptation? And when he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
of <hi>society,</hi> instancing in the

may find <hi>useful entertainments,</hi>
without retiring into <hi>Wildernesses,</hi>
immuring themselves, <hi>renouncing</hi>
the World, and deserting <hi>publick

there's a wide difference 'twixt

and to imagine that great

I believe the capacity of being
able to do good to deserving men,
so excessive a delight, that as 'tis
neerest the life of <hi>God</hi> himself, so
no earthly felicity approches it;
wherefore wisely (says <hi>Plutarch</hi>)
did the Ancients impose those

for want of liberal conversation
some of them appear in the world
like so many <hi>fantosmes</hi> in black,
and by declining a seasonable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erting
of themselves, and their
handsome talents, which <hi>Vse</hi> and
<hi>Conversation</hi> would cultivate and
infinitely adorn; they leave oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
for so many insipid and
empty fopps to usurp their rights,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:96567:52"/>
and dash them out of Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Francis</hi> the <hi>first,</hi> that great
and incomparable Prince,<note place="margin">Hist.</note> (as <hi>Slei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi>
calls him) was never brought
up to <hi>Letters,</hi> yet by the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of good <hi>Translations,</hi> the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
he took to hear learned
<hi>Discourses,</hi> and his inviting of <hi>Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars</hi>
to converse freely with him
upon all subjects and occasions;
he became not only very <hi>Eloquent,</hi>
but singularly <hi>knowing:</hi> For this
doubtless it was, that <hi>Plutarch</hi>
compos'd that express Treatise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
his Morals, <hi>Philosophan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum
esse cum Principibus,</hi> where he
produces us several rich <hi>Examples</hi>
of these profitable effects: And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
(says one) a <hi>Philosopher</hi> ought
not to be blam'd for being a <hi>Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier,</hi>
and that we now and then
find them in the company of <hi>great</hi>
and <hi>opulent</hi> Persons; nor imports
it that you seldom see their <hi>visits</hi>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:96567:52"/>
return'd; since 'tis a mark <hi>he</hi>
knows what he wants of accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishments,
and of their <hi>ignorance,</hi>
who are so indifferent for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
they may derive from
their Conversations. But I might
proceed and shew you, not only
what makes our learned <hi>book-worms</hi>
come forth of their Cells with so ill
a grace into <hi>Company,</hi> but present
you likewise with some of the
most specious <hi>Fruits</hi> of their so
celebrated <hi>Recesses;</hi> were it not
better to receive what I would say
from the lively <hi>Character</hi> which
<hi>Seneca</hi> has long since given us of
them: In earnest, marvellous is
the pains which some of them
take after an empty <hi>criticisme,</hi> to
have all the points of <hi>Martial</hi> and
<hi>Iuvenal ad uuguem,</hi> the scraps of
the ancient <hi>Poets</hi> to produce up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
occasion: some are for <hi>Roots,
Genealogies,</hi> and <hi>Blazons;</hi> can tell
you who married who, what his
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:96567:53"/>
great <hi>Grandfather</hi> was, and the
<hi>Portion</hi> that came by his <hi>Aunt:</hi>
This was of old (says <hi>Seneca</hi>) the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidemical
disease,<note place="margin">De brevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate Vitae.</note> for men to crack
their brains to discover how many
Oars <hi>Vlysses</hi> Gally carried; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it were first written <hi>Ilias</hi> or
<hi>Odyssea;</hi> and a profound Student
amongst the learned <hi>Romans</hi>
would recount to you who was
the first <hi>Victor</hi> at Sea; when <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants</hi>
came into use at Triumphs;
and wounderful is the concern a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<hi>Caudex,</hi> for the derivation of
<hi>Codices, Caudicarius, &amp;c. Gellius</hi>
or <hi>Agellius, Vergilius</hi> or <hi>Virgilius,</hi>
with the like trifles that make men
<hi>idly busie</hi> indeed, not better: yet
are these amongst the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
effects and rare productions of
<hi>Recess, Solitude,</hi> and <hi>Books,</hi> and
some have grown old in the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and been greatly admired for
it: But what says our Philosopher
to it? <hi>Cujus isti errores minuent?
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:96567:53"/>
Cujus cupiditates prement, quem
fortiorem, quem justiorem, quem li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beraliorem
facient?</hi> Who's the
<hi>better,</hi> less <hi>Covetous,</hi> more <hi>Valiant,
Iust,</hi> or <hi>Liberal</hi> for them? I tell
you <hi>Fabianus</hi> preferr'd <hi>Ignorance</hi>
before this unprofitable <hi>Science;</hi>
and certainly therefore useful and
Publick <hi>Employment</hi> is infinitely
superior to it: If needs we will be
<hi>Learned</hi> out of <hi>Books</hi> only, let it
be in something more useful; <hi>Qui
fructuosa, non qui multa scit, sapit;</hi>
for 'tis no <hi>Paradox</hi> to affirm, a man
may be <hi>learned</hi> and know but <hi>lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,</hi>
and that the greatest <hi>Clerks,</hi> are
not alwaies the wisest men.<note place="margin">Isocrat.</note> The
Greek <hi>Orator</hi> gives us this descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
of <hi>usefully</hi> knowing men:
Reckon not those (says he) for
Philosophers, whom you find to be
acute <hi>Disputants,</hi> and that can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
about every <hi>minute</hi> scruple;
but those who discourse pertinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of the most important <hi>Affairs:</hi>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:96567:54"/>
who do not entertain men about a
<hi>felicity,</hi> to which they can never <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive;</hi>
but such as speak modestly of
<hi>themselves,</hi> and neither want <hi>Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage</hi>
nor <hi>address</hi> on all <hi>emergencies;</hi>
that are not in the least discompo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with the common <hi>accidents</hi> of
life, but that stand <hi>unshaken</hi> amidst
all <hi>vicissitudes,</hi> and can with Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
support both Good and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
Fortune; In sum, those who
are fit for <hi>action,</hi> not discouraged,
or meditating <hi>retreats</hi> upon every
cross adventure: to this purpose
the <hi>Orator:</hi> But neither would I
by this be thought to discounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
even this kind of <hi>Erudition,</hi>
which more than any other is the
effect of <hi>Solitude,</hi> and very great
leisure, not to call it <hi>Pedantry;</hi>
much less <hi>Bookish</hi> and <hi>Studious
persons,</hi> who would prove the most
dear to <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Great men</hi> of
all other Conversations, had they
such generous encouragements, as
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:96567:54"/>
might sometimes invite them to
leave their beloved <hi>Recesses,</hi> as did
those great Philosophers whom
we have brought on the Stage:
But we bestow more now a days
in painting a <hi>Scene,</hi> and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of a ridiculous <hi>farce,</hi> than
in rewarding of the <hi>Poet,</hi> or a
good <hi>Historian,</hi> whose <hi>Laurels</hi> no
longer thrive and are verdant,
then they are irriguous and under
showrs of <hi>Gold,</hi> and the constella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of <hi>Crowns,</hi> for which they
give immortality even to <hi>Crowns</hi>
themselves: For what would there
remain of so many <hi>Pyramids</hi> and
<hi>Obeliscs</hi> of Marble, so many Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phitheaters,
<hi>Circs, Colosses,</hi> and
enormous <hi>Pomps,</hi> if Books and
Book-men <hi>aere perenniores,</hi> did not
preserve them to posterity? If under
Heaven then there be any thing
<hi>Great,</hi> and that approches <hi>Eternity,</hi>
it is from their hands who have
manag'd the Pen: 'Tis from their
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:96567:55"/>
labors (Ye <hi>Great Ones</hi>) that you seek
to live, and are not forgotten as the
dust you lie mingled with: Never
had we heard of <hi>Achilles</hi> but for
poor <hi>Homer;</hi> never of the <hi>Exploits</hi>
of <hi>thousands</hi> more, but from the
<hi>Books</hi> and <hi>Writings</hi> of <hi>Learned</hi> men,
who have it in their <hi>power,</hi> to give
more <hi>lustre</hi> to their <hi>Heros,</hi> than their
<hi>Crowns,</hi> and <hi>Purple;</hi> and can with
one <hi>dash</hi> of their <hi>pen,</hi> kill more
<hi>dead,</hi> then a <hi>stab,</hi> with a <hi>Stiletto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is no man alive that
more affects a <hi>Country life</hi> then my
self, no man it may be, who has
more experienc'd the delices of
it: But even those without <hi>action</hi>
were intollerable: You will say
it is not <hi>publick:</hi> If it contribute
and tend to it, what wants it but
the name and the sound? For he
does not mean by business to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
only in <hi>Cities</hi> or <hi>Courts;</hi> since
without that of the <hi>Country,</hi> there
would neither be <hi>Court</hi> nor <hi>City:</hi>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:96567:55"/>
But if he would have this life
spent only in <hi>Theory</hi> and <hi>Fancy, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasie</hi>
and <hi>Abstractions,</hi> 'twere fitter
for <hi>Bedlam,</hi> and a potion of <hi>Hele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor,</hi>
then for sober men, whose
lives and healths, wits and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
were given them for <hi>acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and not to sit with their arms
a crosse, and converse with sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows;
whilst the fates of <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras,
Archimedes</hi> and <hi>Pliny,</hi> whose
curiosity cost them their lives, may
well be ranked amongst those
whom he is pleas'd to name the
<hi>nobly senselesse,</hi> as far indeed trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
beyond <hi>themselves,</hi> as they
had transported themselves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the world: But</p>
            <p>It is after he has celebrated
the <hi>Pedant</hi> for being inchanted at
the story of <hi>Pompey,</hi> that he again
introduces the <hi>Country Gentleman,</hi>
whose easie and insignificant life
is preferr'd before that of the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piest
<hi>favourite;</hi> and can be as well
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:96567:56"/>
pleas'd with a few bawling <hi>Currs,</hi>
or what he calls an <hi>happy chase,</hi>
as with the acquisition of the most
useful <hi>Office</hi> in the <hi>State.</hi> But does
he call this <hi>solitude</hi> and <hi>recesse?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ep. 55.</note>
'Tis exceeding pretty what <hi>Seneca</hi>
observes of <hi>Servillus Vatia,</hi> who,
it seems, had long <hi>retired</hi> himself
to the most pleasant part of the
<hi>Baiae:</hi> There it was (says he) that
this <hi>Gentleman</hi> pass'd his time, and
had never been <hi>known</hi> but from
his famous <hi>solitude:</hi> No man eat,
nor drank better: He had <hi>rare
fish-ponds</hi> and <hi>Parks</hi> (I suppose he
kept good <hi>Hawks,</hi> and excellent
<hi>Dogs</hi>) in sum, he was thought
the only <hi>happy man;</hi> for arrive
what would, as to change in the

himself; and <hi>ô Vatia</hi> (they us'd to
say) <hi>tu solus scis vivere:</hi> For my

hîc situs est;</hi> Here lies <hi>Vatia;</hi>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:96567:56"/>
esteeming him as <hi>dead</hi> and <hi>buried,</hi>
whom others thought the <hi>only</hi> man
alive:<note place="margin">De brevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate vitae, c. 11. 12.</note> But he proceeds; There
are a number (says he) who seem
to have <hi>abandon'd</hi> the <hi>World,</hi>
that are as full of <hi>businesse</hi> in their
<hi>Villas,</hi> and Rural retirements, as
other men who live in <hi>Towns</hi> and
<hi>Cities;</hi> and trouble themselves
extreamly in their very <hi>solitude:</hi>
Though there be no body with
them, yet are they never in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose:
Of these we must not say
their <hi>life</hi> is <hi>idle,</hi> but an <hi>idle</hi> Occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation:
Do you fancy him retir'd
that goes a <hi>madding</hi> after <hi>Medals</hi>
and Curiosities, and spends his
time in raking a Tinkers Shop for a
<hi>rusty</hi> piece of Copper? or that is
dieting and breathing his Jockies
for the next <hi>Running-match?</hi> or
that consumes his time trifling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
<hi>Barbers,</hi> razing and spru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
himself, Powdering, Comb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and summoning a Council
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:96567:57"/>
upon every <hi>Hair;</hi> raging like an
<hi>Hector</hi> at a slip of the Scissars, or a
lock out of <hi>curl?</hi> and of which sort
of wretches there are some who
had rather see the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
out of order, than one of
their <hi>hairs:</hi> Call you these <hi>Retir'd</hi>
and at <hi>Rest,</hi> who are so eternally
<hi>inter pectinem speculumque occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pati?</hi>
or those who are alwaies
humming or whistling of a Tune
as they go about? These Persons
(says <hi>Seneca</hi>) are not in <hi>Repose,</hi>
but <hi>impertinently active:</hi> If at
any time they make a <hi>Feast,</hi> there's
nothing more pretty than to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
but the grave consultations
about plaiting of the Nappery, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the Plate and Glasses, and
setting out the Services: O how
sollicitous shall you have them,
that the <hi>Courses</hi> come up in time,
that the Fowl be skilfully <hi>carv'd,</hi>
and the <hi>Sauces</hi> exquisitely made!
and all this forsooth, that men
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:96567:57"/>
may say; <hi>Such a one knows how to
treat,</hi> lives handsomely and at his
<hi>Ease, &amp;c.</hi> when, God knows, all
this while, they are of all <hi>other</hi>
in the most miserable anxiety:
There were of these soft and reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<hi>Gentlemen,</hi> that had their <hi>Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers</hi>
to mind them when 'twas time
to go to <hi>Supper,</hi> and abandoned
themselves so prodigiously to
their <hi>ease,</hi> that they hardly knew
when they were <hi>hungry:</hi> I read
of one of them, who when he
was lifted out of his <hi>Bath</hi> and put
on his <hi>Cushion,</hi> asked his attendants,
whether he <hi>sate</hi> or <hi>stood,</hi> and was
so buried in <hi>sloth,</hi> that he could
not tell it without <hi>Witnesses:</hi> Such
another we have in <hi>Stobaeus</hi> that
was wont to demand of his men,
if he had <hi>wash'd,</hi> and whether he
had <hi>din'd</hi> or no? 'Twere endless
to proceed with the like instances
of <hi>retired</hi> Persons, and who seem
to be so full of <hi>self-enjoyment,</hi> and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:96567:58"/>
yet whose very pleasures are of
the lowest and the sordid'st a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of our life: What shall
we then say of our lazy <hi>Game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,</hi>
who sit long at the <hi>Cards,</hi>
the <hi>Wine</hi> and the <hi>smoke,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a <hi>grain</hi> of <hi>Sense</hi> from <hi>din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi>
to <hi>midnight?</hi> because they
are all of them slothful diversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
inactive, and oppos'd to <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Employment;</hi> since those who
are qualified with <hi>Business,</hi> and
have any thing to do in the world,
cannot part with such portions of
their <hi>time</hi> to so little purpose: By
all which we see, that <hi>Ease</hi> and
<hi>Solitude</hi> presents us with some
pleasures that are not altogether so
fit for our recreation, and as little
suitable to our reason and <hi>stoical</hi>
indifferency; nor seldom less dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
and ridiculous in their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
than the most <hi>Publick Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi>
For I find that one of the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:96567:58"/>
chief Prerogatives of our <hi>happy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
(and whom by a contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to his Argument, he thinks
ill defin'd by being tearm'd a <hi>little
World</hi>) is by the advantage of his
recess to mould <hi>Idëas</hi> of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
<hi>Species,</hi> never yet in being;
and to use his own <hi>expression,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
more Monsters than <hi>Africa</hi>

to fancy <hi>Building, Navies,
Courts, Cities,</hi> and <hi>Castles in the
Air.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the other side, do we think
that men of <hi>Business</hi> never vacate
to admire the <hi>Works</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they possess so many <hi>Works</hi>
of <hi>Art?</hi> I have sufficiently shew'd
how competent <hi>Philosophy</hi> is with

from Princes, <hi>Chaldean, Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian,</hi>

(even when his <hi>Army</hi> lay in the

               <note place="margin">Eccles.</note>
that I shall only need address you
to his <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Vanities:</hi> As for

which he again resolves here into

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:96567:60"/>
the like: Would any man think it
in earnest when he undertakes to

            <p>For the rest which he mentions

affect them, because I know of
