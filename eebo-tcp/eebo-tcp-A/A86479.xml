            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>ALthough by reaſon of the Conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſneſs of your Diſeaſe, and the many dependents I have upon me, I thought it not convenient to come unto you during your ſickneſs; yet I have not been wanting in my earneſt Prayers to Almighty God for you, nor in uſing the beſt means I could for your reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:136237:3"/>
            <p>It hath pleaſed God to hear my Prayers for you, and above means and hopes now to reſtore you to a Competent degree of health, for which I return unto him my humble and hearty thanks, and now you are almoſt ready to come abroad again, therefore I have thought fit to write this little Book to you, for theſe reaſons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe it is not yet ſeaſonable for you to come to me, in reſpect of theſe ſame reaſons above mentioned, which hitherto have reſtrained my coming to you.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe at your coming abroad, you will be ſubject to Temptations, by young and inconſiderate Company, which inſtead of ſerious Thankfulneſs to God for his mercy to you, might perchance perſuade you to a vain, and light jollity: And I thought fit to ſend you theſe Lines to prevent ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate impreſſions, and to meet you juſt at your coming abroad, to ſeaſon you with more wiſe and ſerious principles.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Becauſe you are even now come out of a great and ſore Viſitation, and therefore, in all probability, in the fitteſt temper to receive the impreſſions of a ſerious Epiſtle from your Father.</p>
            <p>And I have choſen to put it into this little Volume, becauſe it is ſomewhat too long
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:136237:3"/>for a Letter; and may be better preſerved for your future uſe and memory.</p>
            <p>God Almighty hath brought you to the very Gates of Death, and ſhewed you the Terrour, and Danger of it; and after that he had ſhewn you this Spectacle of your own Mortality, he hath marvellouſly reſcued and delivered you from that danger, and given you life, even from the dead, ſo that you are as a man new Born into the World, or returned to Life again, which now you ſeem as it were to begin: You have paſſed through thoſe two great Diſpenſations of the Divine Providence, thoſe two great Experiments, that God is pleaſed ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to uſe towards the Children of men, namely, Correction and Deliverance, his Rod and his Staff: And therefore in all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable conjecture, this is the moſt ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble time to give you a Lecture upon both, and thoſe admonitions which may be, render the one, and the other profitable unto you: And this I ſhall endeavour to do in theſe following Lines.</p>
            <p>Firſt, you ſhall not need to fear that I intend to upbraid you with the errors of your Youth, or to expoſtulate with you touching them: For I do aſſure you, I do from my heart forgive you all your follies, and miſcarriages: And I do aſſure my ſelf,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:136237:4"/>that you have repented of them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved againſt them for the time to come, and that thereupon God-almighty hath alſo fully forgiven what is paſt: And this is a great aſſurance thereof to me, in that he hath ſo wonderfully reſtored you, and given you as it were a new Life, wherein you may obey and ſerve him better than ever you yet did: And therefore if in this Letter, there be any touches concerning former vanities, aſſure your ſelf, they are not angry repetitions, but only neceſſary Cautions for your future ordering of your Life.</p>
            <p>The buſineſs of theſe papers, is principally, to commend unto you, two general Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances, and certain Reſults and Collections, that ariſe from them, they are all ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for your preſent Condition, and will be of ſingular uſe and benefit to you, in the whole enſuing Courſe of your Life.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I would have you as long as you live, remember your late Sickneſs in all its Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, and theſe plain and profitable inferences, and advices, that ariſe from it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I would have you remember as long as you live, your great deliverance, and the ſeveral Circumſtances of it, and thoſe neceſſary duties that are incumbent upon you, in relation thereunto.</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:136237:4"/>
            <p>It is evident to daily experience, that while Afflictions are upon us, and while deliverances are freſh, they commonly have ſome good effect upon us: But as the Iron is no ſooner out of the fire, but it quickly returns to its old coldneſs, and hardneſs; ſo when the Affliction or Deliverance is paſt, we uſually forget them, count them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon things, attribute them to Meanes and ſecond Cauſes: And ſo the good that Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind ſhould gather from them vaniſh, and men grow quickly to be but what they were before they came; their ſick-bed promiſes are forgot, when the ſickneſs is over.</p>
            <p>And therefore I ſhall give you an account of your ſickneſs, and of your recovery: And let them never be forgotten by you, as often as thoſe Spots and Marks in your Face are reflected to your view from the Glaſs, as often as this paper comes in your fight, nay as often as you open your Eyes from ſleep, which were once cloſed, and likely never to open again; ſo often and more often remember your ſickneſs, and your recovery, and the admonitions that this paper lends you from the Conſideration of both.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:136237:5"/>
            <p>Firſt, therefore touching your late ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, I would have you remember theſe particulars: 1. The Diſeaſe it ſelf, in its own nature, is now become ordinarily very Mortal, eſpecially to thoſe of your Age: Look upon even the laſt years General Bill of Mortality, you will find near Two Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand dead of that Diſeaſe the laſt Year, and had not God been very merciful to you, you might have been one of that number, with as great likelyhood as any of them that Dyed of that Diſeaſe: 2. It was a Contagious Diſeaſe, that ſecluded the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of your neareſt Relations: 3 . Your ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſurpriſed you upon a ſuddain, when you ſeemed to be in your full ſtrength: 4. Your ſickneſs rendred you Noyſom to your ſelf, and all that were about you, and a ſpectacle full of deformity, by the exceſs of your Diſeaſe beyond moſt that are ſick there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: 5. It was a fierce and violent ſickneſs, it did not only take away the common ſupplies of nature, as digeſtion, ſleep, ſtrength, but it took away your memory, your underſtanding, and the very ſence of your own Condition, or of what might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible to your good: All that you could do was only to make your Condition more deſperate, in Caſe they that were about you, had not prevented it, and taken more
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:136237:5"/>Care for you; than you did or could for your ſelf: 6. Your ſickneſs was deſperate, in ſo much, that your Symptoms, and the violence of your diſtemper, were without Example; and you were in the very next degree to abſolute Rottenneſs, Putrefaction, and Death it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Look upon the foregoing Deſcription, and remember that ſuch was your Condition, you were as ſad a Picture of Mortality, and Corruption, as any thing but Death it ſelf could make: Remember it: And Remember alſo, theſe enſuing Inſtructions, that may make that Remembrance profitable and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to you.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Remember that <hi>Affliction cometh not forth of the duſt, nor doth trouble ſpring out of the ground,</hi> Job 5.6. But this terrible viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, was ſent to you from the wiſe overru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Providence of God: It is he that bringeth down to the Grave, and bringeth up again. It is true, that this Diſeaſe may ſeem common, but you may and muſt know, that there was more than the common hand of God in ſending it upon you, in ſuch a manner, and ſuch a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and at ſuch a ſeaſon, when you were grown up to a Competent Age, and degree of underſtanding, to make a due uſe of it, that you might ſee his juſtice in Afflicting you, and his goodneſs in delivering you from ſuch a danger.</p>
            <pb n="8" facs="tcp:136237:6"/>
            <p>Secondly, Remember that Almighty God is of moſt infinite Wiſdom, Juſtice and Mercy, he hath excellent ends in all his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations of his providences: He never ſends an Affliction, but it brings a meſſage with it, his Rod has a voice; a voice Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding us, to ſearch and try our ways, and to examin our ſelves whether there hath not been ſome great ſin againſt him, or neglect of duty to him; a voice Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us to repent of what is a miſs, to humble our ſelves under his mighty hand, to turn to him that ſtriketh us, to ſeek to him by Prayer for deliverance, to depend upon him by Faith, in his mercy and power; to amend what is a miſs, to be more watchful, circumſpect, and obedient to him, in the future courſe of our lives, to fear to offend him: And if a man hear this voice, God hath his end of mercy and goodneſs, and man hath the fruit, benefit, and advantage of his Affliction, and commonly a Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table iſſue of it: Read often and attentively the 33th. Chapter of <hi>Job,</hi> from the beginning to the end.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Remember how uncertain, and frail a Creature man is, even in his ſeeming ſtrongeſt Age, and Conſtitution of health; even then a peſtilential Air, ſome evil humour in his blood, ſome obſtruction it may
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:136237:6"/>be of a little vein or artery, a little meat ill-digeſted, and a thouſand ſmall occurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces may upon a ſuddain, without any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable warning, plunge a man into a deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and mortal ſickneſs, and bring a man to the grave. Remember this terrible ſickneſs ſeized upon you ſuddenly, pulled down your ſtrength quickly, and brought you to the very brink of the Grave: And though God hath recovered you, you know not how ſoon you may be brought into the like Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Remember therefore, that you make and keep your peace with God, and walk in his fear in the days of health; eſpecially after ſo great a deliverance, and that for very many reaſons: 1. You know not whether you may not be overtaken with ſudden Death, and then it will be impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for you to begin that work: 2. If you have ſickneſs to give you warning of the approach of Death, yet you know not whether that ſickneſs may not ſuddenly take away your ſenſes, memory, or underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whereby you may be diſabled to make your peace with God, or to exerciſe any ſerious thoughts concerning it: 3. But if that ſickneſs give you fair warning, and take not away your underſtanding, yet your own experience cannot chuſe but let you know,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:136237:7"/>that pain, and weakneſs, and diſtraction of mind, and impatience, and unquietneſs, are the common attendants of a ſick bed, and render that ſeaſon at leaſt very difficult, then to begin that greateſt and ſolemneſs, and moſt important buſineſs of a mans Life. 4. But if your ſickneſs be not ſo ſharp, but that it leaves you patience, and attention of mind for that great buſineſs, how do you know whether your heart ſhall be inclined to it? Repentance and Converſion to God is his gift, though it muſt be our endeavour: And though the merciful God, never refuſeth a repenting, returning offender; yet how can a man that all the time of his health hath neglected Almighty God, refuſed his invitations, and ſerved his luſts and his ſin, expect reaſonably, that God in the time of ſickneſs, when the man can ſerve his ſins no longer, will give him the grace of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance?</p>
            <p>What ever you do therefore, be ſure you make your peace with God, and keep it in the days of your health, eſpecially after ſo great a deliverance from ſo deſperate a ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Remember that your Condition is never ſo low, but that God hath power to deliver you, and therefore truſt in him: But remember withall, that your Condition
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:136237:7"/>is never ſo ſafe and ſecure, but you are within the reach of his power to bring you down: You are now by the mercy of God recovered from a terrible ſickneſs, think not with your ſelf that your turn is now ſerved, and that you ſhall have no more need of him, and therefore that you may live as you lift, and never regard your duty to him; deceive not your ſelf herein, remember that this ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, within two or three days brought you upon your knees, even from a ſeeming ſtate of health: The Caſe is the ſame ſtill, nay much worſe, if this Affliction make you not better; Almighty God called you to love, and ſerve, and obey him, by the ſtill voice of his word, by the perſwaſion of your Friends, by the adviſes and reproofs of your Father; and when theſe were not ſo effectual, (as I know you now wiſh they had been,) He ſent a meſſenger that ſpake lowder, that would be heard, even this ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible ſickneſs; and moſt certainly, if you have heard the voice of this Rod, (as I am hopeful you have) and thereupon entirely turn to your duty to God in all ſincerity and obedience, it is the happieſt providence that ever befell you, and you will upon ſound Conviction, conclude with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>It was good for me that I was Afflicted:</hi> But on the other ſide, if notwithſtanding this
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:136237:8"/>voice of the Rod, you ſhall after your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery turn again to folly, and vanity, and exceſs, and harden your ſelf againſt this meſſenger; know for certain you are within the reach of the Divine Juſtice and Power: <hi>And if you walk contrary to him, he will walk contrary to you, and puniſh you yet ſeven times for your ſins,</hi> Levit. 26.24. I therefore give you that Counſel, that our Lord gave to him that he had healed, <hi>Behold thou art minde whole, go thy way and ſin no more, leſt a worſe thing befall thee.</hi> There is no conteſting with Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, he is ready and eaſie to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to the worſt of men, upon humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation and true repentance, but he is not to be Maſtered or Conquered by obſtinacy and oppoſition: <hi>Who hath hardened himſelf againſt him and proſpered?</hi> Job 9.4.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, I would have you Remember, that ſickneſs as well as death doth undeceive Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and ſhews them where their true Wiſdom lies: When a young man, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, is in the full career of his vanity and pleaſures, he thinks that Religion, and the fear of God, and walking according to his word, and the ſerious practice of duties of Religion towards God, prayer unto him, making our peace with him, are pitiful, low, fooliſh, and inconſiderable matters, and that thoſe that practiſe them, are a ſort
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:136237:8"/>of brain-ſick, melancholy, unintelligent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that want wit or breeding, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand not Themſelves or the World; that they are mere empty fancies and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, whimſies, puritaniſm, and I know not what elſe: But on the other ſide, they think they are the brave men that live ſplendidly, deny themſelves no Pleaſure, can Drink, and Roar, and Whore, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch, and wear the neweſt Faſhions; it may be, this Gallant or Wiſe man comes to be taken with a fit of ſickneſs, that tells him he muſt dye, Death is at the door, his Glaſs is almoſt out, and but a few ſands left in it: And then the man becomes quite of another judgment, he cries out of his former fooliſhneſs, he finds his pleaſures and intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance and exceſs, are not only perfect follies, but madneſs, vexation, torment; and Religion and Prayer to God, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion and Peace with God, they are now in requeſt; and now nothing but declamations againſt thoſe Courſes, which in his health he valued as the only Wiſdom; and nothing but promiſes of amendment; and reformation of Life, and Devotion to God; ſo ſickneſs hath undeceived the man, and given him a true and rectified judgment concerning Wiſdom, and Folly, quite contrary to what he had before. Therefore I would have you recollect your
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:136237:9"/>ſelf, (and if the violence of your Diſeaſe left you at any time the uſe of your reaſon) bethink your ſelf what opinion you then had of intemperance, waſting of time, unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful luſt, or any of thoſe ſins that formerly pleaſed you in your health, whether they did not appear to you in your ſickneſs, very vain, fooliſh, vexing things, ſuch as you wiſhed never to have been committed; and on the other ſide, what opinion you had in your ſickneſs touching Piety towards God, hearing of his word, calling upon his name, redeeming of time, modeſty, temperance: Whether thoſe actions of your life paſt, that favoured of theſe, were not Comfortable, and Contenting to you in your ſickneſs; whether your purpoſes, and promiſes, and reſolutions of your ſick-bed, were not full of ſuch thoughts as theſe: If it pleaſe God to recover me, I will never be ſuch a fool as I have been, I will never drink to exceſs, miſpend my time, I will never keep ſuch evil Company as I have done, I will be more devout towards God, more obedient to his word, more obſervant of good Counſel, and the like: And if you find it to be ſo, I muſt deſire you to remember that affliction, is the School of Wiſdom, it rectifies mens judgments; and I muſt again deſire you, to keep your judgment right ſtill, and ſet not
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:136237:9"/>the recovery of your health become the loſs of your wits; but in your health re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that Wiſdom your ſickneſs taught you, and practice what you then promiſed: <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member he is the wiſeſt man that provides for his latter end:</hi> Deut. 32.29.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, Remember by your former ſickneſs, how pitiful an inconſiderable thing the Body of man is; how ſoon is the ſtrength or it turned to faintneſs, and weakneſs, the beauty of it to uglineſs and deformity, the conſiſtency of it to putrefaction and rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and then remember how fooliſh a thing it is, to be proud of ſuch a Carcaſs, to ſpend all, or the greateſt part of our time in triming and adorning it, in ſtudying new Faſhions, and new Poſtures, and new De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices to ſet it out: In ſpending our time and proviſions in pampering it, in pleaſing the Appetite; and yet this is the chief buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of moſt young men of this Age: Learn therefore Humility and Lowlineſs, learn to furniſh thy Noble and Immortal part, thy Soul, with Religion, Grace, Knowledge, Virtue, Goodneſs, for that will retain it to eternity: How miſerable is that mans Condition, that whiles ſickneſs hath made his Body a deformed, weak, loathſom thing, ſin hath made his Soul as ugly, and deformed; The Grave will heal or cover the deformity
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:136237:10"/>of the former, but the Soul will carry its Ulcers and Deformity (without Repentance) into the next World: Learn and remember therefore, to have thy greateſt Care for thy Nobleſt part, furniſh it with Piety, Grace, Knowledge, the Fear and Love of God, Faith in Chriſt: And as for thy Body, uſe it Decently, Soberly and Comely, that it may be a fit Inſtrument for thy Soul to uſe in this Life, but be not proud of it, nor make it thy chiefeſt care and buſineſs to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn, much leſs defile it.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, Remember to avoid intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and ſinful Luſts: It is true ſickneſs and diſeaſes, and finally death, are by the Laws and Conſtitutions of our nature inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to all Mankind: But intemperance, exceſs of Eating and Drinking, Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Whoreing, Uncleanneſs and diſorder bring more diſeaſes, eſpecially upon young men, and deſtroy more young, ſtrong, healthy men, than the Plague, or other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural or accidental diſtempers: They weaken the Brain, Corrupt the Blood, decay and diſtemper the Spirit, diſorder and putrefie the humours, and make the body a very bag full of putrefaction: Some diſeaſes are as it were ſpecifical, and appropriate to theſe vices, other diſeaſes are commonly occaſioned by them, by their inflammation and putrifacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:136237:10"/>of the Blood and humours: And all Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, even thoſe that are Epidemical, Natural or Caſual, yet are rendred by thoſe vices far more ſharp, laſting, malignant and incurable, by that ſtock of Corrupted matter, they lodge in the body to feed thoſe Diſeaſes, and that impotency that theſe vices bring upon Nature to reſiſt them: Therefore if you ever expect to have as well a ſound body, as a ſound mind, carefully avoid intemperance and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery: The moſt temperate and ſober perſons are ſubject to ſickneſs, weakneſs and Diſeaſes, but the intemperate can never be long without them.</p>
            <p>And thus I have done with the proſpect of your Diſeaſe, and at leaſt many of theſe profitable uſes you may gather from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of it.</p>
            <p n="2">II. I ſhall now in the ſecond place, put you in Remembrance of your Deliverance, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which, you muſt remember: 1. That it was a great, eminent, and extraordinary Deliverance, you need no other evidence of it, than by looking back upon the greatneſs and ſeverity of your Diſeaſe before-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned: 2. It was a deliverance by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate power and mercy of that God, that ſent you the Viſitation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>na eademque manus vulnus opemque tulit.</hi> If you had been delivered by the immediate
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:136237:11"/>efficacy of means, yet you are blind if you ſee not that the efficacy of means depends upon the providence of God, it is he that provides it, and that makes means effectual. But in this deliverance God hath pleaſed to hedge up (as it were) your way from attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting it to means, and hath given you an indication, that it was done by his own im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate power, and that he delivered you above, and beyond means: It is true, you had a very able and careful Phyſitian, and very great attendance and care was uſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout you: But when your Phyſitian and all that were about you, began to deſpair of your recovery, when means proved ineffectual, when the ſtrength of Nature was exhauſted and baffled by your Diſeaſe, God Almighty upon a ſuddain, and beyond expectation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved you, and as it were by his own hand brought you back from the very threſhold of the Grave: And this he did, that you and all about you, and all your Relations might take notice of it, that it was he that did it.</p>
            <p>And thus Almighty God hath exerciſed towards you, two great Experiments, the firſt of his ſeverity, the ſecond of his mercy: And as your Sickneſs and Rod had its voice, (a lowd and ſharp voice) ſo your recovery and deliverance hath its voice alſo, a ſweet, gentle, and (I hope) effectual voice; and I will as ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as I can tell you what it is.</p>
            <pb n="19" facs="tcp:136237:11"/>
            <p>Firſt, Remember this benefit, remember it was reached out unto you, from the mere power, goodneſs, and mercy of God: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member evermore in your Heart and Soul, to be thankful to him for it: Remember as long as you live upon all occaſions to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it; daily to return upon your knees humble thanks for it, to him that had regard to you, and remembred you in your low Eſtate, to him that forgave your Iniquities, and healed your Diſeaſe, to him that did this for you when all means failed, that did it for you, when you had not the underſtanding to call upon him for it; to him that did it for you, that deſerved it not, for you that had provoked him, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected him too much in the time of your health. This God it was, that thus deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered you; Read often the 103 <hi>Pſalm</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively, and apply it to your own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, it will do you good.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Remember to acknowledge this good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God with all humility; your delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance was not the purchaſe of your own power, nor of your own deſert, it was an Act of the free and undeſerved goodneſs of God; what Almighty God ſaid by <hi>Moſes</hi> unto the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> Deut. 9.4.6. I ſhall ſay to you with ſome variation; underſtand therefore that the Lord thy God hath not
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:136237:12"/>given thee this deliverance for thy Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs: No it is the mere effect of his own goodneſs, and to give you opportunity to praiſe him, and ſerve him, better than ever you did before.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Remember that although great delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, require your great acknowledgments, yet there is ſomewhat more required, namely, a real practical glorifying of God, by ordering your Converſation aright, by ſerving him, pleaſing him, obeying him, living to his honour: This Almighty God expects as well as praiſes, and acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: As the end of God in afflictions is to make men better, ſo the end of God in deliverances is to make men better, and if we are not the better men by both diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, we do as much as in us lies diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point Almighty God in his deſign, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoint our ſelves of the benefit and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage intended in both, and eaſily to be gained by both. This therefore is the voice of this deliverance, it calls ſweetly, and gently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but earneſtly and effectually for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment of life: And that upon two great and moving arguments: 1. Your recovery and great deliverance calls for this from you, upon the accompt of common ingenuity and good nature, which obligeth a man to be obſervant and dutiful to his benefactor:
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:136237:12"/>God Almighty is the greateſt Benefactor, and hath manifeſted himſelf ſuch to you, upon a viſible and eminent account; this is engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment enough upon the account of common humanity, to be dutiful and obedient to him: When therefore you are at any time by the Temptation of your own Corruption, or by the ſollicitation of evil perſons, ſollicited to evil Actions: Conſider thus with your ſelf, Is this a becoming return to that God, that hath thus wonderfully delivered me? Is this the requital that I ſhall make to him for his mercy? Shall I pleaſe a vain Luſt, or a vain Companion, and diſpleaſe the great God of Heaven and Earth, that hath thus delivered me and done me more good, than all the World could ever do me, or than I can ever recompence? <hi>Do ye thus requite the Lord, O ye fooliſh People, and unwiſe? Is not he thy Father that hath bought thee? Hath he not made thee, and eſtabliſhed thee?</hi> Deut. 32.6.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This mercy calls for your obedience to God, in an eminent manner upon the account of common prudence and diſcretion; the benefit of your obedience to him will be your own, your own happineſs in this Life, and in that to come: There is no greater moral ſecurity againſt future dangers and troubles, than obedience, and reformation of Life upon great deliverances received, nor is
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:136237:13"/>there any greater invitation of new troubles and miſchiefs, than ingratitude, diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and great ſins after great mercies and deliverances: There is a kind of certain and infallible connexion between great ſins, after great mercies received, and great Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to follow, <hi>Ingentia beneficia, ingentia peccata, ingentia ſupplicia.</hi> Again, as I have formerly told you, you do not know how ſoon you may ſtand in need of the ſame mercy, and goodneſs of God, which you have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly found: You are never out of the reach of his power, and the neceſſity of his help; what ever you do, therefore never diſoblige him, by whom you Live, and whoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary mercy you may ſtand in need of, you know not how ſoon: There is nothing in the World doth more provoke God, than neglect, forgetfulneſs, or willful diſobedience after ſignal mercies: Theſe provoke the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful God to a ſeverity of the higheſt kind, becauſe the ſweeteſt and moſt obliging call of mercy and deliverance is neglected: Read the firſt Chapter of the <hi>Proverbs</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively.</p>
            <p>And the merciful God hath given us a plain Rule and Method, how he may be ſerved, obeyed, and pleaſed, he hath given us a plain diſcovery of his will in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of both Teſtaments: Read that often,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:136237:13"/>you have it by you, and you need not go far to find what is your Maker's Will, and what that obedience is, that he requires as the return of this, and all other his mercies: Yet I think it not amiſs, to mind you of ſome particulars, that may be uſeful for you upon this occaſion, and to direct you how par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to improve it, and ſo order your future Life in ſome meaſure anſwerable to it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I would have you make it your firſt buſineſs after your perfect Recovery, to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the courſe of your Life paſt, ſince you came to the Age of diſcretion, and ſee what hath been amiſs in it; whether you have not neglected Religion, and the Duties of it too much, as Prayer, hearing the Word Preached, obſerving the Lords day, receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Sacrament; whether you have not been guilty of intemperance, exceſs of drinking, wantonneſs, uncleanneſs, idleneſs, miſpending your time, and thoſe ſupplies which have been allowed you for your main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance; whether you have not too much delighted in vain and ſinful, and diſorderly Company, vanity and expence in Apparel: And if any ſuch, or the like faults have been, repent of them, be ſorry for them, reſolve againſt them; and let the future courſe of your Life be amended in relation thereunto;
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:136237:14"/>I have before told you, that your heavenly Father hath forgiven you, and I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given you, neither do I mention theſe things to upbraid you for them, but that you upon the conſideration of what hath been amiſs, may be thereby the better enabled to rectify and ſet in order your future Life: If this be done and practiſed, I will reckon your late ſickneſs and diſtemper one of the greateſt bleſſings that ever befel you.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I would have you always keep a habit of the fear of God upon your heart; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider his preſence, order your Life as in his preſence, Conſider that he always ſees you, beholds, and takes notice of you, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially whether you carry your ſelf anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to this great deliverance, it is one of thoſe Talents for which he will expect an Account from you.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I would have you frequently and thankfully conſider of the great Love of God in Jeſus Chriſt, whom he hath given to be the Inſtructor, and Governour, and Sacrifice for the ſins of you and all Mankind, through whom upon Repentance you have aſſurance of the remiſſion of your ſins and eternal Life; and frequently conſider how great an ingagement this is upon you, and all Mankind, to live according to ſuch a hope and ſuch a mercy.</p>
            <pb n="25" facs="tcp:136237:14"/>
            <p n="4">4. I would have you every morning read a portion of the Holy Scriptures, 'till you have read the Bible from the beginning to the end: Obſerve it well, read it reverently and attentively, ſet your heart upon it, and lay it up in your memory, and make it the direction of your life; it will make you a wiſe and a good man: I have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted ſomewhat with Men and Books, and have had long experience in Learning, and in the World: There is no Book like the Bible for excellent Learning, Wiſdom, and Uſe, and it is want of underſtanding in them, that think or ſpeak otherwiſe.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Every morning and every evening, upon your knees with all reverence and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of mind, return hearty thanks to God for his mercy to you, and particularly for this deliverance, deſire his Grace to enable you to walk in ſome meaſure anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to it, beg his Providence to protect you, his Grace to direct you, to keep you from evil Actions, and evil Perſons, and evil occurrences, beg his pardon for your ſin, and the continuance of his favour, always conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with the Lords Prayer.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Obſerve conſcionably the Lords day to keep it Holy, avoid idle Company, idle Diſcourſe, Recreations, and ſecular imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon that day; reſort twice that day
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:136237:15"/>to the publick Prayers and Sermon, come early to it, be attentive at it, keep your Eyes and Mind from roveing after vain thoughts or objects; and ſpend the reſt of that day, that is free from neceſſary occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, in Reading the Scriptures, or ſome good Books of Divinity.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Once ever Term at leaſt come prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly, and reverently to the Holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, receive it with great reverence, and thankfulneſs, and due Conſideration of the end of its inſtitution: Renew your Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with Almighty God that you made in Baptiſm, and to live Soberly, Righteouſly, and Godly before him, and beg his Grace and Strength to perform it.</p>
            <p>And as thoſe directions before, do more ſpecially relate to Almighty God, and your deportment immediately towards him; ſo theſe that follow, more eſpecially relate to your ſelf and others, and your moral Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation: Therefore,</p>
            <p n="8">8. Be very moderate in Eating and Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Drunkenneſs is the great vice of the time, and by Drunkenneſs I do mean not only groſs Drunkenneſs, but alſo Tipling, Drinking exceſſively, and immoderately, or more than is convenient or neceſſary; avoid thoſe Companies that are given to it, come not into thoſe places that are devoted
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:136237:15"/>to that beaſtly Vice, namely, Taverns and Alehouſes, avoid and refuſe thoſe devices that are uſed to occaſion it, as Drinking and Pledging of Healths: Be reſolute againſt it, and when your reſolution is once known, you will never be ſollicited to it: The <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chabites</hi> were Commanded by their Father not to drink Wine, and they obeyed it, and had a bleſſing for it; my Command to you is not ſo ſtrict, I allow you the moderate uſe of Wine and ſtrong Drink at your meals, I only forbid you the exceſs, or unneceſſary uſe of it, and thoſe Places and Companies, and Artifices that are Temptations to it.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Avoid Wanton and Laſcivious, Speeches and Company: Read <hi>Proverbs</hi> 2, 5, 6, 7.9. A Whore hunts for the precious Life of a man, and that vice brings a ruine with it to the Body, Soul, and Eſtate: If you cannot Conveniently contain your ſelf in a ſingle Life, and be of Competent health, Marry, but with the Adviſe and Counſel of your Father, while he lives.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Be frugal of your time (it is one of the beſt Jewels we have) and to that end avoid Idleneſs, it conſumes your time, and lays you open to worſe inconveniences; let your Recreations be healthy, and Creditable, and Moderate, without too much expence of time, or money: Go not to Stage-plays, they
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:136237:16"/>are a moſt profuſe waſting of time; value time by that eſtimate we would have of it, when we want it, what would not a ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man give for thoſe portions of time of health, that he had formerly improvidently waſted?</p>
            <p n="11">11. Bee diligent in your Study and Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; it is an Act of duty to Almighty God that requires it, and it will be your wiſdom and benefit; it will be a good expence of time, a prevention from a Thouſand incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences and temptations, that otherwiſe will befall a man; it will furniſh you with knowledge and underſtanding, give you the advantage and means of a comfortable and plentiful ſubſiſtence, and make you a ſupport, comfort and benefit to your Friends and Country.</p>
            <p n="12">12. Be frugal in your expences, live within the Compaſs of that Exhibition, that Gods Providence and your Father's abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſhall ſupply you withall; it is enough to maintain an honeſt provident man, and ten times more will not be enough for a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe mind: A frugal man will live Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably and Plentifully upon a little; and a profuſe man will live beggerly, neceſſitouſly and in continual want, whatever his ſupplies be.</p>
            <pb n="29" facs="tcp:136237:16"/>
            <p n="13">13. In all your expences conſider before hand: Can I not be well enough without this that I am about to buy? Is there an abſolute neceſſity of it? Can I not forbear 'till I am in a better Condition to compaſs it? If I buy or borrow can I pay? And when? And am I ſure? will this expence hold out? How ſhall I bring about the next Quarter, or the next year? If young men would but have the patience to conſider, and ask themſelves Queſtions of the like nature, it would make them Conſiderate in their Expences and provident for the future; and theſe Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations will in a ſpecial manner concern you, in reſpect of your Fathers great Expences for you, which though I have forgiven, and forgotten, I would have you remember with Gratitude and Caution.</p>
            <p n="14">14. The vanity of Young-men in loving fine Cloaths, and new Faſhions, and valuing themſelves by them, is one of the moſt Childiſh pieces of folly that can be, and the occaſion of great profuſeneſs and undo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Young-men: Avoid curioſity and too much expenſiveneſs in your Apparel: Let your Apparel be comely, plain, decent, cleanly not curious or coſtly; it is the ſign of a weak Head-piece, to be ſick for every new Faſhion, or to think himſelf the better in it, or the worſe without it.</p>
            <pb n="30" facs="tcp:136237:17"/>
            <p n="15">15. Be careful what Company you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort with, and much more careful what perſons you grow intimate with; chuſe ſober, wiſe, learned, honeſt, Religious Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, you will gain Learning and Wiſdom, and improve your ſelf in Virtue and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by converſing with them: But avoid debauched, fooliſh, intemperate, prodigal, atheiſtical, prophane Company, as you would avoid a Plague; they will Corrupt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do you, they are a ſort of the muſt pitiful fools in the World, and familiar acquaintance and converſation with them, will endanger to make you like them.</p>
            <p n="16">16. Weigh and conſider your words be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you ſpeak them, and do not talk at random or at a venture; let your words be few, and to the purpoſe, be more ready to hear others than to ſpeak your ſelf; accuſtom your ſelf to ſpeak leiſurely, and deliberately, it will be a means to make you ſpeak warily and conſiderately.</p>
            <p n="17">17. Be very careful to ſpeak truth, and beware of lying; as lying is diſpleaſing to God, ſo it is offenſive to man, and always at the latter end returns to the reproach or diſadvantage of him that uſeth it; it is an evidence of a weak and unmanly mind. Be careful that you believe not haſtily ſtrange news, and ſtrange ſtories, and be much more
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:136237:17"/>careful that you do not report them, though at the ſecond hand, for if it prove an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth, (as commonly ſtrange ſtories prove ſo) it brings an imputation of levity upon him that reports it, and poſſibly ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage to others.</p>
            <p n="18">18. Take heed what you promiſe, ſee that it be juſt, and honeſt, and lawful; and what is in your power, honeſtly and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly to perform: And when you have ſo promiſed, be true to your word. It is for the moſt part the faſhion of inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and Young-men, (eſpecially that run in debt) they will with great aſſeverations, promiſe preciſe payment, at this or that day; when either they certainly know they cannot perform, or at leaſt have no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable aſſurance that they can do it; and when their turn is ſerved, they are as back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in performance, as they were before liberal in their promiſes. Breach of promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and lying are much of a nature, and commonly go together, and are argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of an impotent and unmanly mind.</p>
            <p n="19">19. Beware of Gaming, it is the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denneſt Conſumption of an Eſtate that can be, and that vice ſeldom goes alone; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly debauchery of all kinds accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies it: Beſides it makes a man of a wild,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:136237:18"/>vaſt and unſettled mind; and ſuch men are impatient of an honeſt Calling, or of moderate or honeſt gain.</p>
            <p n="20">20. Run not into debt either for Wares ſold, or Money borrowed; be content to want things that are not of abſolute neceſſity, rather than to run upon the ſcore; ſuch a man pays at the latter end a third part more than the Principal comes to, and is in perpetual ſervitude to his Creditors, lives uncomfortably, is neceſſitated to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe his debts, to ſtop his Creditors mouths, and many times falls into deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Courſes.</p>
            <p n="21">21. Be reſpectfull to all, familiar and intimate with few, be Grateful to your Benefactors, eſpecially to thoſe, who under God, were inſtrumental for your good, in your late ſickneſs, and return your thanks to them; to your Father that ſpared no coſt for your Recovery, to your Doctor that was exceedingly diligent about you, to thoſe that attended you in your ſickneſs, to thoſe that together with your Father often prayed to God for your Recovery, and for a bleſſing upon this Affliction, whoſe names you ſhall in due time par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly know. But above all, to Almighty God, who not only provided and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the means, but ſaved, and delivered
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:136237:18"/>you above means, and when means fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>
            <p n="22">22. Laſtly, I ſhall conclude with one advice more, without the obſervance where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of my labour in writing this long Epiſtle will be probably fruitleſs: Be not wiſe in your own conceit, this is the unhappy error, and many times the ruine of Young-men eſpecially: They are uſually raſh, giddy, and inconſiderate, and yet extreamly confident of that which they have leaſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to truſt, namely their own underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which renders them moſt reſerved from them that are willing and beſt able to adviſe them, impatient of reprof, love to be flattered, and ſo become uncapable of good and wiſe Councel, 'till their follies have reduced them to extream ſtraits and inconveniences; ſuſpect therefore your own judgment: Adviſe often with your Father, eſpecially in all things of moment; be glad of his Councel, and be Contented and willing to follow it, and to guide your Life according to it; at leaſt 'till ripeneſs of Age, Obſervation, and Experience, have enabled you better to adviſe your ſelf: This is an eaſie, and ready, and cheap way of attaining Wiſdom, and avoiding of infinite inconveniences.</p>
            <pb n="34" facs="tcp:136237:19"/>
            <p>And thus I have in this long Epiſtle, given you the means how you may improve both your ſickneſs, and recovery, to the Glory of God, and your own benefit.</p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore Conclude with two Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, that may the more ingage you to this uſe of both theſe diſpenſations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The danger is great, if Afflictions make not a man more humble and dutiful, and the danger is yet greater, if great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances and mercies do not make a man more thankful and obedient to God; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the moſt obliging method that the Gracious God can uſe towards the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men, for that end, in this Life: And the neglect of that invitation, adds Ingratitude and Contempt to the neglect of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The benefit that you will receive by making a good uſe of theſe two diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in improving your dutifulneſs and obedience to God, will be ſingular and excellent: 1. It will make you a wiſe man, by making you a Good, and a Religious man: Believe it from your Father, who will not deceive you, nay, believe it from a greater than your Father, the very Spirit
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:136237:19"/>of truth, who cannot deceive you; the true fear of God, is the only true Wiſdom: Read <hi>Deut. 4.6. Job 28.28, Pſal, 111.10, Prov. 1.7. Prov 9.10. Eccleſ. 12.13,</hi> and very many more declarations there are of this great truth: 2. It will make you a happy man, it will give you the Favour and Love of God, which is better than Life it ſelf: You ſhall have his Mercy to pardon you, his Providence to protect you, his Wiſdom to direct you, his Goodneſs to bleſs you, and to forgive, and forget what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever hath heretofore been done amiſs by you: This will make all Conditions Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable to you, whether Life or Death, Sickneſs or Health: By this means you may be a Comfort to your Father, a ſupport to your Brothers and Siſters, an Inſtrument of good to your Country, and attain an Honeſt, Credible, and Competent Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence in this World, and an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inheritance of Glory and Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in the World to come. Thus I have given you a large Letter of ſound and good Counſel: Set your heart to it, and obſerve and remember it: We ſee how unſtable our Lives are, you nor I know not how ſoon, either or both of us may leave this World: It may be, this may be
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:136237:20"/>the laſt paper of Advice that your Father may give you: But however it ſhall pleaſe God to deal with you or me, touching our continuance in this World, yet let me leave this with you, in the cloſe of this Letter: If I ſhall find that theſe directions are dutifully obſerved, I ſhall be ready from time to time, freely to adviſe and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect you; and as I have paſſed by your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Extravagancies, ſo I ſhall thereby have great aſſurance, that God hath bleſſed this Viſitation to you. But on the other ſide, if I ſhall find that you neglect my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, that you make light of them, that you ſtill purſue thoſe Courſes that will certainly be bitterneſs in the end, I muſt then tell you, I ſhall pray for you, and be ſorry for you with my heart; but I ſhall not eaſily be perſwaded to give any more Advices or Counſels, where I find them deſpiſed or neglected. In this paper there are many things omitted, which might have been inſerted; but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Reading of the Holy Scriptures will ſupply unto you that defect: I have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen only in this paper to mention ſuch things which are ſeaſonable for you upon this occaſion. God Almighty hath not been wanting to you in Admonition, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:136237:20"/>Mercy, and Deliverance; neither hath your Father been wanting to you in Education, Counſel, Care, and Expence: I pray God Almighty bleſs all unto you. This is the Prayer of,</p>
