         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

concerne the time,</hi> when it is supposed to haue beene
held: by euery one of which I doubt not but the
basenesse and forgery of this Synod will bee made
manifest.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>first,</hi> had there been any such true Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,
the Church should not haue accounted that at
<hi>Nice,</hi> but this at <hi>Rome</hi> for the first generall Councel:
for this could not be thought a prouinciall Synod,
seeing vnto it were called, and present in it, as the
Acts do shew, of the Westerne Bishops 139. of the
Greeke Bishops 132. out of <hi>Rinocorura</hi> (which <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomee</hi>
                  <note n="h" place="margin">Ptol. Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bul. 3. Africae.</note>
placeth in the very vtmost part of Egypt,
farre beyond <hi>Alexandria</hi>) 57. Bishops. When out
of so many seuerall Prouinces, subiect to seuerall
Patriarkes, so many Bishops as 328. were called and
present: what reason can bee imagined why this
should not be a generall Councell as well as that at
<hi>Nice,</hi> wherein were present not so many Bishops,
nor in likelyhood out of so many distinct Prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces?
And because it was held before the <hi>Nicene</hi>
Councell, it must needes (had there beene such an
one) haue beene reckoned the first of all generall
Synods. Seeing then the Church neuer so accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
it, but euer held that at <hi>Nice</hi> (which was celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:9494:11"/>
after this) for the first, it is manifest by the
Churches iudgement that they knew not of any
such Romane Councell as this vnder <hi>Siluester.</hi>

                  </note> vs, that in the
edition of <hi>Cresconius</hi> the Greeke Bishops are omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and he giues a reason why they could not bee
present at this Councell, because there was not
time enough to call Bishops out of so remote coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries:
adding further, that <hi>Syluester</hi> called onely the
Italian Bishops to the Synod. <hi>Baronius</hi> might as
well in plaine tearmes haue professed the Acts of
this Councell, wherein all these are sayd to haue bin
assembled, to be false and forged, (which is the
point we endeauour to proue:) but the Cardinall
was loth to speake so plainely, and after the <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi>
fashion, to call a Spade a Spade. Let vs passe by
this his modestie: See but how vncertaine and
incoherent these coniectures of <hi>Baronius</hi> are. It is
very vncertaine how long or short the time was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Synod was first summoned till the Session
thereof: and why out of <hi>Greece</hi> they might not as
easily come to <hi>Rome</hi> vpon a short summons, as out
of <hi>Egypt</hi> and the vtmost part thereof (where <hi>Rinoco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rura</hi>
is) I thinke it would trouble <hi>Baronius</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare.
Againe, whereas <hi>Baronius</hi> would out of the
<hi>Cresconian</hi> edition haue the number of Bishops in
that Synod to be 230. he might haue obserued that
his fellow <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
                  <note n="k" place="margin">Bell. lib. 2. de pont. ca. 26</note>, yea and their owne <hi>Breuia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi>
                  <note n="l" place="margin">Breu. loc. citat.</note>
directly checketh that number, and telleth him,
that there were 280. or 284. Bishops present: and
yet neither of those numbers doe accord with the

of that Councell: for if the Greeke Bishops
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:9494:12"/>
and they of <hi>Rinocorura</hi> be both omitted, there are
but 139. which wants 90. of <hi>Baronius</hi> number, and of
<hi>Bellarmines</hi> 140. If they of <hi>Greece</hi> onely bee left out,
and the other of <hi>Rinocorura</hi> admitted, then were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
196. which wants of <hi>Baronius</hi> number 34. and of
<hi>Bellarmines</hi> 84. So incoherent and confused is their
account in seeking to defend the truth of this Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod.

               <p>But leauing them thus intangled in their defence
of this Synod, I wish any indifferent man to thinke
with himselfe, what credit is to bee giuen to that

                  <hi>the Romane Presbyters and Deacons that were

who tels vs withall, that this reducing the Popes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection

hundreth yeares old. Which antiquitie wee enuy
not to Cardinall Deacons, seeing the Cardinall
confesseth that for the first times (vntil 1000. yeares
after Christ) all the <hi>Romane</hi> Presbyters and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons
were Cardinals alike, no difference being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, for which some were to be called Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals,
and not others. Wherefore seeing this <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi>
Synod giues the Title of Cardinals to <hi>Romane</hi>
Deacons, of which name at that time there neither

By what other Arithmeticke then he can finde any

Cardinals, but by the rule of falshood, it is not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
to coniecture. And although among seauen,
it were no incongruitie to call two or three of
them Cardinall Deacons, as chiefe among the rest,
yet to call them all Cardinals, as the Councel doth,
it is as absurd as to call all the thirtie two points,
Cardinall winds; which none but such as the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfull

               <p>In another Canon,<note n="g" place="margin">Can. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Siluester is said to haue
appointed with a loude voyce, that no Presbyter
should make Chrisme, and the reason thereof the
Pope there giues, because Christ hath his, Name of
Chrisme.</hi> By which reason it is as forceably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent,
that no Bishop, nor the Pope himselfe
may make Chrisme. The deriuation of Christs
name will inforce the one both as Logically and
Theologically as the other. And why may not a
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:9494:15"/>
Presbyter make Chrisme, as well as make Christ
himselfe? Or why shall not this reason exclude
a Presbyter from consecrating or transubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Bread, as well as from consecrating
Oyle or Chrisme? Sure this and the former rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son

framed in one forge of simplicitie and folly.</p>

that this <hi>Romane</hi> Councell was held a whole yeare
before the <hi>Nicen</hi> began, or was either appointed or
summoned. Now I would here intreate Cardinall
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> to reconcile his contradiction vnto this:
for hee clearely affirmes that the <hi>Nicen</hi> Councell
was begun the yeare before <hi>Constantinus Caesar,</hi> and
<hi>Crispus</hi> were Consuls. <hi>It co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued,</hi> saith he<note n="d" place="margin">Lib. 1 de conc c. 5.</note>, <hi>three years
&amp; it ended when</hi> Paulinus <hi>and</hi> Iulianus <hi>were Consuls.</hi>
Certainely either <hi>Bellarmine</hi> must confesse this Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod
to be forged, or else acknowledge his owne
grosse error in making the <hi>Nicen</hi> Councell to begin
a yeare before this: to say nothing that it seems some
incongruitie also for <hi>Constantine</hi> or <hi>Siluester</hi> to call
first a generall Synod to <hi>Nice,</hi> and during that
Councell, to call another as generall also to <hi>Rome,</hi>
wherein shall be more Bishops then at <hi>Nice;</hi> which
yet vpon <hi>Bellarmines</hi> assertion is euidently conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent.
But it is certaine that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in his Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nologie
both in this and many other places is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
defectiue, and in making two Councels
to be held at one time, the one at <hi>Nice</hi> of 318. the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
at <hi>Rome</hi> of 328. (or 280. Bishops, as hee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts)
he was not so well aduised as hee might and
should haue beene. So for <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> this Councell
and note of time in it, is a cleare conuiction of his
error.</p>
               <p>For the thing it selfe,<note place="margin">The occasion of this second Roman Synod</note> that this Councell was not
held in that yeare of their Consulship, as <hi>Baronius</hi> &amp;

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:9494:21"/>
discouery of this fiction and the falsly supposed oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions

Doubtlesse, the Cardinall was in some exstasie or

directly this testimony doth ouerthrow his whole
purpose touching this Romane Councel, which he
striues to defend. For it is certaine, that the 9. yere of

being <hi>Caesar,</hi> falling out in the 19. yeare of <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines</hi>
Empire, could not begin till the 25. of Iuly, in
that yeare when <hi>Crispus</hi> was third time Consul; see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on that day, in that yeare, began the 19. yeare of
his fathers Empire. Wherfore seeing both that La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
Chronicle of <hi>Eusebius</hi> testifieth, and <hi>Baronius</hi>
confesseth that <hi>Crispus</hi> was murdered in that ninth
yeare, it ineuitably ensueth, that he was aliue two
months after the <hi>Romane</hi> Synod was ended, which
was on the 30. of May in that same yeare. So incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderate
was the Cardinall in producing this testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
as his chiefest proofe, that by it he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated
the murder of <hi>Crispus,</hi> neither to haue
bene any occasion of <hi>Constantines</hi> baptisme, or of his
holding this <hi>Romane</hi> Synod; neither so much as to
haue hapned before, but two moneths after the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod

               <p>Besides, that Latine Chronicle of <hi>Eusebius</hi> is

many waies vntrue, and such as the Cardinall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
in these times of <hi>Crispus</hi> reiecteth. In that <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebius,</hi>
it is said that <hi>Crispus</hi> was made <hi>Caesar</hi> in the
eighth yeare of <hi>Constantine: Erroris arguitur</hi>
                  <note n="q" place="margin">Bar. an. 315. nu. 3.</note>, saith
the Cardinall, <hi>Eusebius</hi> is in this point erronious:
why may not another giue the like censure of the last
yeare of <hi>Crispus,</hi> and say, <hi>Erroris arguitur, Eusebius</hi>
erred, in saying <hi>Crispus</hi> died in the 9. yeare of his
being <hi>Caesar?</hi> Againe, the ninth yeare of <hi>Crispus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Caesar,</hi> and his murder, are both set downe in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebius</hi>
to be in the twentieth yeare of <hi>Constantine:</hi> of
this the Cardinall sayth,<note n="a" place="margin">Bar. 324. nu. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Perperam positus est,</hi> This
yeare is placed amisse in <hi>Eusebius.</hi> May not another
say as iustly, the ninth yeere of <hi>Crispus</hi> is <hi>perperam po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>situs,</hi> set downe amisse in <hi>Eusebius,</hi> to bee the yeare
when he was murdered? Hath <hi>Baronius</hi> a priuiledge
aboue others to play the Criticke with <hi>Eusebius?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Last of al, there is more then a vehement &amp; strong
suspition, that all this that <hi>Baronius</hi> citeth out of the
Latine Chronicle of <hi>Eusebius</hi> (that <hi>Crispus was mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
in his ninth yeare</hi>) is but some addition that
hath crept into the text, for (as after you shall see)
neither did <hi>Euagrius</hi> nor <hi>Sozomen</hi> know of any such
thing in <hi>Eusebius:</hi> and to this day, in the Greeke
<hi>Eusebius</hi> there is nothing at all, either touching the
murther of <hi>Crispus,</hi> or touching the time of his
death. And the like corruption of <hi>Eusebius</hi> his chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle
in other places, may easily be obserued; as to go
no further, in the verie next yeare before this, that
is, in the 18. or, as <hi>Scaligers</hi> edition accounteth it,
the seuenteenth yeare of <hi>Constantine,</hi> in the Latine
<hi>Eusebius</hi> there is this set downe, <hi>that</hi> Constantine

thrust in by some, who finding that calumny a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Constantine,</hi> set down in <hi>Zosimus</hi> (as it is<note n="b" place="margin">Zosim. lib. 2. pa. 31. neque multo post vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olata iurisiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randi religione laqueo vitam <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in his other bookes is so farre from imputing
any blame or blemish to <hi>Constantine</hi> touching that
action, that he expresly saith<note n="d" place="margin">Eus lib. 2. de vita Con. c. 18.</note> of <hi>Licinius, That he
suffered, meritas iustasque poenas,</hi> iust and deserued
punishment, which had it bene effected by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie
of <hi>Constantine</hi> had certainely bene vniust.</p>
               <p>But enough of this testimony out of <hi>Eusebius</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
Chronicle, which besides this suspition, so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
waies doth contradict the Cardinalls owne as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion.
So that still it remaines sure, that supposing
<hi>Crispus</hi> to haue beene murthered, yet his murther
must fall out after the nineteenth yeere of <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>
begun, as we haue proued, and then the Romane
Councell which was ended before that time, is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely
conuicted to be a counterfeit.</p>
               <p>But what shall be said (to adde this in the last place
touching <hi>Crispus</hi>) if <hi>Crispus</hi> was not at all murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by <hi>Constantine?</hi> what then will become of the
seeking for expiation, or of baptisme to wash away
that sinne: of this Romane Councell, of the donati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Constantine?</hi> all the other must needs be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:9494:26"/>
fables if that which is the supposed occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and foundation of them all be fabulous. For the
triall of this doubt, heare first what <hi>Sozomen</hi> sayth,
<hi>I am not ignorant,</hi> saith he<note n="a" place="margin">Sozom. lib. 1 ca. 5.</note>, <hi>that</hi> Constantine <hi>is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
by heathen writers to haue murthered diuers
neere of blood vnto him, and by name his owne sonne</hi>
Crispus: <hi>for which fact afterwards being sory, hee
sought expiation of the heathens; but not obtayning it,
he began to be in loue with christian religion, and so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
a christian. Truly this seemes to me to be fained by
those who slander christian religion: So Sozomen.</hi> And
the very same doth <hi>Cassiodore</hi>
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Trip. hist. Cassiod. lib. 1. ca. 6.</note> in his tripartite hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie
set downe.</p>
               <p>Heare againe what <hi>Euagrius</hi> saith professedly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Zosimus</hi> the narrator of this murther and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty.
<hi>Zosimus,</hi> saith he<note n="c" place="margin">Euag. lib. 3. ca. 40.</note>, <hi>is one of those who are addicted
to the nefarious and execrable religion of the heathen, &amp;
therefore he is inflamed with spite against</hi> Constantine
<hi>because he was the first Emperor who forsaking that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable
superstition,</hi> embraced Christianity. Againe,
<hi>Infinitis maledictis pium &amp; magnificum Constantinum
lacerat;</hi> he doth with infinite calumnies disgrace the
holy Emperor Constantine. <hi>For he reporteth that hee
murdered his own son Crispus, and his wife Fausta; and
when he could not by his own heathen priests be expiated
from these crimes, then forsaking his ancient religion he
turned Christian. Quod autem ista omnino falsa sunt, mox
ostendam:</hi> But that these things are vtterly false I
shall straight declare. And a little<note n="d" place="margin">Ca. 41.</note> after he refutes
that slander of <hi>Zosimus</hi> concerning <hi>Crispus,</hi> not
<hi>only by other authours and reasons, but euen by Eusebius
who liued &amp; was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uersant both with Const. &amp; Crispus</hi>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:9494:27"/>
Which I therefore mention not onely to reprooue
that calumnie of <hi>Zosimus,</hi> but to declare how iustly
the Latine Chronicle of <hi>Eusebius</hi> is to be suspected
in this matter, seeing in it this cruell murther is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
imputed to <hi>Constantine:</hi> wheras <hi>Euagrius</hi> by
the vndoubted testimonies of <hi>Eusebius,</hi> proues the
falshood of that narration. Againe, seeing both <hi>Eua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grius</hi>
&amp; <hi>Sozomen</hi> reproue this as a calumny deuised
by the heathen, and set out by <hi>Zosimus;</hi> who can
thinke that they would not much rather haue repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
it in <hi>Eusebius,</hi> had he expressed the same, as in
that Latine Chronicle it is? Or why should <hi>Euagrius</hi>
reproue <hi>Zosimus</hi> because he reported that which he
heard, liuing long after, in the time of <hi>Honorius:</hi> if
<hi>Eusebius</hi> who liued and conuersed with <hi>Crispus</hi> had
so expresly deliuered the same?</p>
               <p>Heare <hi>Nicephorus: I know,</hi> saith he<note n="a" place="margin">Niceph. lib. 7. ca. 35.</note>, <hi>what crimes
the Grecians do impute to Constantine, per sycophantiam
&amp; calumnias, by slanders and calumnies;</hi> and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing
this heathenish narration of the murther of
<hi>Crispus,</hi> and after it embracing the Christian religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
he addes: <hi>Haec manifesta figmenta, these are mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
fictions, by which they doe traduce the faith and pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of Christians, veluti per comaediam,</hi> making as it
were a play or poeticall comedie thereof: <hi>Crispus

(for the murthering of whom they say <hi>Constantine</hi>
fought expiation in his nineteenth yeare) died in the
twentieth yeare of <hi>Constantine.</hi> So <hi>Nicephorus.</hi>
Heare lastly their owne <hi>Augustinus Steuchus</hi>

with great scorne reiects the authority of <hi>Ierome,</hi>

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:9494:27"/>
giues this as one reason, because he writes that</hi> Crispus
<hi>was cruelly murthered by him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is true indeed that many writers doe mention
this murther as committed by <hi>Constantine;</hi> but the
first and most ancient in whom I finde it set downe,
is <hi>Zosimus,</hi> who liued about the yeare 400. after
Christ, who extremely hating the christian religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
in all places where hee can picke any occasion, is
desirous to publish any calumny against the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors
thereof, especially against <hi>Constantine,</hi> as <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uagrius</hi>
truely obserued: from him it is like that <hi>Oro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius,
Sidonius</hi> and others liuing in that age or neere
hand, first tooke it, and from them afterward many
receiued it, <hi>clausis oculis,</hi> not examining the truth or
circumstances of the narration. But seeing both <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uagrius</hi>
and <hi>Sozomen</hi> diligently sifted and examined
the truth of that matter, and found it to bee but an
heathnish calumny (which the circumstance also of
time doth manifest) to disgrace the honour of that
most famous Emperour: there is more credite and
trust herein to bee giuen to them, then to many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who without tryall relate the same as they
found it repeated out of <hi>Zosimus,</hi> of such as tooke it
from <hi>Zosimus.</hi> And thus much of this circumstance
of time when this Councell was held, to wit after
<hi>Constantines</hi> murthering of <hi>Crispus</hi> in the yere when

Constantine fell into a leprosie, as is vulgarly reported,
that he was clensed thereof by Baptisme; that he should

which was shewed then to</hi> Constantine, <hi>is yet in Saint</hi>

Now seeing this is a verie Chymerical fiction; when
the Pope himselfe was glad to vrge such base forged
and indeede incredible legendarytales, for the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping
of images, the rest of the Synod you may
bee sure, would take heart to treade in his steps,
and so they did very mannerly; for that whole
Councell is fraught with such rales, and out of
the credit of them, was decreed an Anethema to
all that deny adoration of images. Of the like
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:9494:35"/>
writings alledged in that Councell, I shall perhaps
haue occasion elsewhere to entreate: by the way
let me here obserue touching this of <hi>Constantine</hi> and
<hi>Siluester,</hi> that whereas that <hi>Nicen</hi> assembly esteemed
it a principall reason for the honouring of Images,
it is, if it be truely weighed, a most manifest demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration,
that in the primitiue ages, Images were nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
adored, nor yet set vp in Christian Churches.
<hi>Constantine</hi> as before I shewed, had bene not onely
a professor of the Christian faith, but a publicke de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender
and protector of it, and of Catholickes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Heretickes, for more then ten whole yeares
before he fell into his supposed leprosie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, as his law
before mentioned dated in his eight yeare is an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragable
witnesse. About his thirteenth, at most
fourteenth yeare, he set out those other lawes for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edifying
and repairing of Churches and Oratories,
for the speedy effecting whereof he was so religious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
carefull, that he writ to <hi>Eusebius</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Eus. de vita Const. l. 2. c. 45</note> (and the same in

any where, you are all to see that those buildings be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
looked vnto, so that either those churches which
remaine may be repaired and enlarged, or where neede
is new may be builded: and what is needfull for that work
call for of the Gouernours of Prouinces, to whom I haue
giuen in charge, vt omni studio &amp; propensione animi sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministrent,
that they giue those things to you with all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse

                  <note n="b" place="margin">Euseb. lib. 10 hist. c. 2. 3. 4.</note> witnesseth. Now when there
were so many magnificent Churches and Oratories
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:9494:35"/>
builded and beautified, specially in the chiefe ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
either those Images of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> and the
like, were not set vp; or if they were, <hi>Constantine</hi>
in all that time either came into none of those
Churches and Oratories, or at least adored not, no
nor saw those Images. And truely I shall neuer bee
induced to thinke that <hi>Constantine</hi> for sixe or ten
yeares together was a Recusant, and came not at the
Church of Christians, of whose zeale in praying,
loue to the word of God, and to the preachers ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
there are so many vndoubted testimonies. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
that he should come to those Churches (as
most certainly he did) had the Apostles Images bin
then set vp and adored by Christians, his irreligion
and negligence had bene without excuse, who in
all those yeares gaue no adoration to the two chiefe
Apostles, neither at <hi>Rome</hi> where he was often, nor
at <hi>Sirmium,</hi> nor at <hi>Millaine,</hi> nor in any other place
of his Empire; nay that hee did not so much as see
and know the Images of those two Apostles, till
<hi>Siluester</hi> at this time of his leprosie, in his ninetenth
yeare, shewed them vnto him, it is hereby euident,
that Images were in those dayes neither adored nor
set vp in their Churches and Oratories: But this by
the way touching the worth and worthy proofes
of that second <hi>Nicen</hi> Sinod.</p>
               <p>9 By this may further bee perceiued what true,
holy and religious lessons the <hi>Roman</hi> Church com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth,
and practiseth in their publike Liturgy,
one of which in their Breuiarie containes the sum
of this poeticall fable touching the leprosie of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi>

<hi>That</hi> Constantine <hi>being thus cured, gaue libertie vnto

God, which is stuffed with so many vntruths.</p>
               <p>Lastly, wee see by this, that the Romane Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod

hee receiued the fruit of baptisme,</hi> that is,
grace and iustification. So may it bee said of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine,</hi>
euen before hee was baptized, seeing hee

how very friuolous a collection they make from

preiudice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to others, that baptisme is not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to any, (but without all doubt, not to <hi>adulti</hi>)
that they may haue grace or iustification, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are supposed by the Church to haue
the first grace and to bee iustified, therefore
are they baptized, and receiue the seale of their
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:9494:40"/>
former, and an holy instrument of a second grace,
and further assurance of their iustification; But of
this else-where.</p>
               <p>And this I haue answered, supposing <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>
to haue spoken as the Imposter makes him,
and so often to make boast of his iustification.
But that the Emperour said in truth no such thing
at all, it is witnessed by <hi>Eusebius,</hi> who was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
in the Councell, and heard the Emperours
Oration, and hath wholy set downe<note n="c" place="margin">Euseb. lib. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

which both wise, eloquent, and religious speech
of <hi>Constantine,</hi> there is no such thing either saide
or signified: the same is in like manner related
by <hi>Sozomen</hi>
                  <note n="d" place="margin">Sozom. lib. 1. cap. 18.</note>, of that which the Cardinall cites
out of his forged <hi>Dalmatianus</hi> not one syllable. And
this by the way may bee one strong presumption,
that the Authour of those Acts meant not truth
and good dealing, in the rest of the disputations and
Narrations he sets downe, when at the entrance he
was so bold as to deuise a false and witlesse Oration
for the Emperor. But if it please God that I may
euer finish my other Treatise concerning the eight
generall Councels, I purpose, and nothing doubt,
to demonstrate by vndeniable euidences, that
there is no truth nor credit at all to bee giuen to
that forged Authour, whom <hi>Baronius</hi> heere cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth

confidently affirmes and proues out of <hi>Euse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius,
that he was not slaine till the nineteenth yeare cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
of Constantine.</hi> Wherefore if he was baptized
as <hi>Anastasius</hi> witnesseth, in the eighteenth yeare, then
was he baptized before the murther of <hi>Crispus,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he fell into his leprosie, and so not onely <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
and <hi>Binius</hi> himselfe; but Pope <hi>Hadrian,</hi> their
Breuiarie, and this very Roman Synod vnder <hi>Silue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi>
are clearely proued to be fablers, who all teach
his baptizme to follow the murther of <hi>Crispus,</hi> and
the leprosie of <hi>Constantine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some may perhaps wonder that <hi>Baronius</hi> did
not alledge the Pontifical of <hi>Damasus</hi> in this cause,
for therein it is expresly sayd, <hi>That Siluester comming
from exile in the mountaine Soracte, whither he had fled
for the persecution of</hi> Constantine, <hi>baptized</hi> Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,
<hi>and cured him of his leprosie.</hi> Now <hi>Damasus</hi> is
an ancient father and Pope, liuing neere to that time
also. His name might haue gained great counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
and credite to this baptizme by <hi>Siluester.</hi> But
the reason of the Cardinalls silence of <hi>Damasus</hi>
name, is euident. The Pontificall is vulgarly called
in deed and inscribed by the name of <hi>Damasus:</hi> but
<hi>Baronius</hi>
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Bar. an. 384. nu. 15.</note> himselfe confesseth that <hi>Damasus</hi> is not

Besides, of the two, it is lesse to be regarded, that
the errors, then the crimes and scandals of Bishops
be knowne to Catechumes, or to any others, as
<hi>Constantine</hi> wisely considered, when at the <hi>Nicene</hi>

(as <hi>Theodoret</hi>

the Emperour being as yet vnbaptized, sate in so

he might not be present at <hi>Nice,</hi> vnlesse he had bene
baptized.</p>
               <p>A third reason they make, <hi>Because Constantine was

               <p>Besides these actions of peace, from which as
you see, the baptisme of <hi>Constantine</hi> by <hi>Syluester,</hi>
cannot be concluded, <hi>Baronius</hi> vrgeth a sixt reason,

saith he<note n="d" place="margin">Bar. ann. 324. nu. 45.</note>, <hi>that Constantine was not baptized, till a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
before his death, then hee must be held for pietie
and religion farre inferiour to Constantius: for as
that time when Constantine dyed, hee was preparing
a warlike expedition against the Persians, and before
that he had made many battailes against his enemies;
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:9494:48"/>
all which time, and in all which warres, he remained
vnbaptized: whereas Constantius being to fight against
Magnentius, Ne lixam quidem voluit nisi ante bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zatum,
in hostem proficisci,</hi> would not suffer so much
as a Skull to goe into the battell, vnlesse he were first

               </p>
               <p>You may clearely perceiue, that by the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals

and that for a certainetie, to haue beene farre worse

thus to disgrace <hi>Constantine,</hi> hath most
fouly disgraced himselfe, and bewrayed his owne

though <hi>Constantius</hi> with his whole Armie, had
beene baptized, and had receiued all the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
in the World, yet seeing hee was euen
then an Heretique, and an impious oppugner,
and persecutour of the true and Catholique faith;
none of all his outward actions, though they bee
neuer so holy in themselues, could make him, I say
not equall, but not comparable in any degree to
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:9494:49"/>
                  <hi>Constantine,</hi> a most pious, religious, and sincerely
Orthodoxall Emperour. <hi>It is neither circumcision</hi>
                  <note n="g" place="margin">Gal. 6. 15. Rom. 2. 28.</note>,
<hi>nor baptisme, but a new creature,</hi> and an heart pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified

which auailes with the Lord: and it is a very true
saying which is collected out of Saint <hi>Austen</hi>

did, and yet bee a wicked man, yea a very Deuill,
as <hi>Iudas</hi> was; but haue the loue of God, the
loue of Gods true Church and Children, and
be a wicked man, he cannot. This loue of God,
and Gods Church, which <hi>Constantine</hi> inwardly
and sincerely embraced, made him (though for
the outward acte vnbaptized) by many degrees
more acceptable vnto God, and more honourable
in the Church of God, then the outward recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
of baptisme, or any other Sacrament could
make <hi>Constantius,</hi> in whom there was no sincere
loue to God, but an extreame hatred of Gods
truth, and of his holy seruants who professed the
same.</p>
               <p>And yet had the Cardinall sought by this his
diuinitie, to haue dishonoured <hi>Constantine</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
though his fault therein had beene vnex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusable,
it might more easily haue obtained par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.
But by this position of his, he hath made
both <hi>Valentinian,</hi> and <hi>Theodosius</hi> the Great, farre
worse then <hi>Constantius</hi> also. Of the warres made

to haue the most religious of them all, to

               <p>Besides all this which concernes the diuinitie of
<hi>Baronius,</hi> there are two speciall points to bee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued

would not suffer, ne lixam</hi>

                  <hi>quidem,</hi> not so much
as a skull vnbaptized to goe with him to battaile.
Now in <hi>Theodoret,</hi> out of whom <hi>Baronius</hi>
                  <note n="h" place="margin">Bar. an. 351. nu. 15.</note> relates

religious and most holy <hi>Constantine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other point which I obserue, is, an eminent
defect in the Cardinals reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Who would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
himselfe, reading in the Card. this high com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dation

that <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stantius</hi> was baptized at the time when
he made the warre with <hi>Magnentius?</hi> for otherwise,
if <hi>Constantius</hi> also was then vnbaptized, you will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely
iudge the Cardinall to haue dalied in this
matter, who by the pietie of <hi>Constantius</hi> condemnes
<hi>Constantine</hi> for going to warre being vnbaptized.
Now the truth is, that <hi>Constantius</hi> was not baptized
when he fought with <hi>Magnentius</hi> and ouercame him
in that battle in <hi>Pannonia,</hi> where<note n="g" place="margin">Vt liquet ex Zosimo lib. 2.</note> himselfe was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,

                  <hi>a little before his death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the fiue and twentieth

of the Cardinalls reason, or how is <hi>Constantine</hi> for
his going to warre vnbaptized, farre more impious
then <hi>Constantius,</hi> seeing that <hi>Constantius</hi> in all the
warres that he made was vnbaptized also?</p>
               <p>Neither will it helpe the Cardinall to say, that yet
the souldiers of <hi>Constantius</hi> were baptized, and

acted a play of the Christian religion before the
Emperour, in derision of the Christian Faith and My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries.</hi>
To expresse the custome of Christians, he
was laid as one <hi>Clinicus,</hi> on his couch vpon the
Theater, then he called for baptisme; the mimicall
Presbiter being brought, asked him if hee did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue,
who answering he did, he was mimically bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized:
and then apparelled in white, and then for
making that profession, he was in mimicall fashion
led to be executed. But this play was then turned
into sad earnest, for at that time he being truly and
sincerely conuerted to Christianitie, in stead of
cursing and deriding, began to blesse and adore
Christ, and seriously exhorted the Emperour, and
all in the Theater, to embrace the holy Christian
Faith, as himselfe did: at which the Emperour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
incensed with rage, commaunded him to bee
most cruelly tormented; and when by no torments
whatsoeuer, he could be driuen from the constant
profession of Christ, he was at last beheaded, and
is now enrouled among the blessed Saints and
Martyrs.</p>
               <p>If these be not sufficient, there are yet some more

by Imperiall Lawes, and banishing Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes?
Sure the Cardinall would bee impatient,
and iudge one little lesse then bereft of wit and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
who would conclude, that because
there were no precedent examples of these (and
a thousand thousand such like matters) therefore
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:9494:54"/>
                  <hi>Benedict</hi> the ninth, or <hi>Iohn</hi> the 23. were not Popes;
or <hi>Iohn</hi> 12. &amp; <hi>Stephen</hi> 7. did not those abominations;
or that therefore there neither was, nor might bee
any generall Councels assembled; or that the <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cen</hi>
Councell did not, or might not decree Arians
to be Heretickes; or that <hi>Constantine</hi> might not,
and did not establish Christianitie by his Imperiall
Lawes. Its so poore, so silly and sencelesse a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
to proue a thing was not done, or might not
be done, because there was no precedent example
for doing the same, that I well hope some of the
Cardinals friends will cause this passage of his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
to passe one day vnder some <hi>Index expurgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi>
and be quite wiped out of his Annales: that
the world doe not wonder to see so great and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned
a Cardinall, to make so fond and feeble,
so silly and sencelesse arguments.</p>
               <p>An eight reason, which is proper to <hi>Binius</hi>
                  <note n="q" place="margin">Bin. Notis in vitam Silu. §. Baptizauit.</note>, is
taken out of <hi>Eusebius</hi>
                  <note n="r" place="margin">Euseb. lib. 3 de vit. Const. ca. 3.</note>, <hi>In whom Constantine is said
many yeares before his death, to haue shewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
in a Picture, hauing aboue his head the signe
of the Crosse, and vnder his feete the olde enemy the
Deuill, represented in the shape of a winding Dragon,
Medio ventre transfixum, thrust through the middest
with a Lance, and cast into the deepe sea.</hi> From this
Picture, thus disputes <hi>Binius. How could this be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
to Constantine, if hee was not then baptized?
For euery Catechume is energumenus, possessed of the
Deuill, and is so farre from killing the Serpent, that
he is rather possessed by him, Nam aliter à Catechu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meno
non expellitur quàm per baptismum,</hi> For the
Deuill is not otherwise expelled from a Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chume,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:9494:55"/>
then by baptisme. Thus <hi>Binius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then by <hi>Binius</hi> diuinitie, <hi>Valentinian</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror,
of whom before I spake, was still possessed
with the Deuil, for he was not at all baptized: Then
those Martyrs who die Catechumes, are still posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
And what a worthy peece of Theologie is this,
to teach, such as are possessed with the Deuill, to
goe straight to heauen? <hi>For so did Valentinian, as
Saint Ambrose</hi>

to expell the Deuill out of those holy assemblies,
till <hi>Siluester</hi> did this, nine yeares after the one Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,
and a yeare and a halfe after the <hi>Nicene</hi> was,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:9494:55"/>
(by <hi>Bellarmines</hi> assertion) begunne: Or might one

as <hi>Binius</hi> himselfe confesseth <hi>Constantine</hi> did, and
not also at <hi>Nice?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Besides, there are two answeres which specially
concerne this obiection. The former is touching
<hi>Eusebius,</hi> and that which hee conceiued of that Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture.
He thought it indeed <hi>To be</hi>
                  <note n="o" place="margin">Vt liquet ex ipsis verbis Eusebij loco citato.</note> 
                  <hi>the Picture of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine,
and that the Emperour meant to expresse him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
thereby.</hi> But what if <hi>Eusebius</hi> misconceiued <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine?</hi> and whereas <hi>Constantine</hi> in that table, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to represent Christ like a valiant Warriour,
conquering and killing the old Dragon, treading
him vnder his feet, and casting him into the sea; <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebius</hi>
thought this was indeed to expresse <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>
himselfe. Sure euen that which <hi>Eusebius</hi> addes
in that place, doth much perswade, that <hi>Constantine</hi>
meant not himselfe, but Christ; for hee saith, <hi>That
many admired the wit and acutenesse of the Emperour,
that he, diuino afflatu pulsus, moued by the holy Spirit, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured
those same things, which by the words of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi>
                  <note n="p" place="margin">Isa. 27. 1.</note>, <hi>were foretold of that dragon, that God should thrust
a great terrible sword into the dragon, and kill him in the
sea.</hi> Thus <hi>Eusebius,</hi> whereupon it is clearely conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,
that <hi>Constantine</hi> intending to represent that
which the Prophet <hi>Isay</hi> in those words expresly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
vnto God, did not represent himselfe, but
Christ (of whom <hi>Isay</hi> prophesied) <hi>To be the killer &amp;
destroyer of the old Serpent.</hi> But of this I haue spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
more at large in another Treatise, touching S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>.
<hi>George</hi> killing the Dragon, and that which may be
thought to be signified thereby.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:9494:56"/>
The other answer is touching <hi>Binius</hi> his collection,
admitting <hi>Constantine</hi> to haue bene indeed represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by that picture, as both he and all Christian reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Emperours may well be, seeing they by their
zealous defending and propagating the Gospel, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
the violent and fraudulent oppugners ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
may truly be said by <hi>the power of Christ, to conquer
and kill the old Serpent, and tread him vnder their feete.</hi>
Now I would demand of <hi>Binius,</hi> how he knowes that
<hi>Constantine</hi> set forth this table or picture, after hee
was baptized, rather then before? Certainely by
<hi>Eusebius,</hi> who expresly auoucheth<note n="q" place="margin">Lib. 4. ca. 61. 62. 63.</note> his baptisme to
haue bene after his 30. yeare, when <hi>he was neare his
death,</hi> and this picture to haue beene <hi>erected long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi>
                  <note n="r" place="margin">Nempe ante coactum conc. Nicen. vt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet ex lib. 3. ca. 3. &amp; 4.</note>:
it is vndeniably consequent, that <hi>Constantine</hi>
had killed and troden vnder foote the Dragon long
before his baptisme, &amp; so the witnesse of <hi>Binius</hi> doth
directly contradict that which he affirmes, &amp; would
proue out of him. Againe, I would demand how he
knowes this picture was set vp by <hi>Constantine,</hi> after
his 19. yeare, rather then before it? for by <hi>Eusebius
narration</hi> it clearely appeares, that the Emperor set
it forth, vpon his subduing of those persecuting ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants;
and therefore the Dragon which <hi>Constantine,</hi>
as <hi>Eusebius</hi> thought, killed, is there<note n="s" place="margin">Lib. 3. ca. 3.</note> said to haue op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned
the Church <hi>impiorum tyrannide,</hi> by the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
of the wicked. Now the last persecutor and
tyrant, in whom the dragon oppugned the Church
in <hi>Constantines</hi> time, was <hi>Licinius,</hi> whom <hi>Constantine</hi>

then erected that picture, as a publicke monument,
how by his meanes, the tyranny of Sathan was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
by the power of Christ: and <hi>Eusebius</hi> to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
that this picture had reference to those times,

manner, <hi>Quibus rebus ad exitum perductis;</hi> These
things being ended, (to wit, touching the conquest
of tyrants, and of the fury of the dragon) yet <hi>the mind
of Constantine was much troubled for that pestilent
schisme, which he heard was in the churches of Thebes &amp;
Alexandria, about the cause of Arius:</hi> and so hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
to that narration, (which he had a little inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted)
touching the Emperours course which hee
took in the matter of <hi>Arius.</hi> So this picture, by which
<hi>Binius</hi> supposed, to proue the baptisme of <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>
in his 19. yeare clearely proues, that he peruerts
both the writings of <hi>Eusebius,</hi> &amp; the fact of <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi>
both which do shew, that he had ouercome the
Dragon before his nineteenth yeare, much more
before his baptisme.</p>
               <p>The ninth reason, and that which carrieth indeed

               <p>It is true that some of the Ancients (as now <hi>Bini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>)
considering no more then those outward acts
of <hi>Constantine,</hi> thought him in his latter time to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline

                  <hi>Bishop of Calaret</hi>
a Confessor, who knowing the fact, but not the
cause of <hi>Athanasius</hi> banishment, said of <hi>Constantine,
that hee hated and banished Athanasius, quia noluerit

Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> in his Chronicle (if it be not falsly,<note n="r" place="margin">Hier. in. Chron. an. 31. Constantini.</note>

thereupon, <hi>that hee declined in Arianam Sec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam,

<hi>Binius</hi>) very iniuriously from these or the like facts,
conclude any change in the faith of <hi>Constantine:</hi> for
his faith and profession was still the same, that is,
Catholike; the change was not in him, but in <hi>Euse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius:</hi>

these words of <hi>Eusebius,</hi> and all the sacred actions
performed both by <hi>Constantine,</hi> and the Bishops,
as meant of an hot bath? Did he deferre this so
many yeares, that hee might goe to an hot bath at

yea being a lumpe of lies, and a very masse of misre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported

of all to <hi>Eusebius,</hi> whose Historie and Chronicle,

receiued both light and warmth from the fire of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebius,</hi>
doth like <hi>Aesops</hi> Viper, disgorge the venome
of his mind and virulency of his tongue vpon him,
whom he should, and that most deseruedly, haue
honoured.</p>
               <p>Now though I cannot in all matters, nor intend
in any one error, to patronize <hi>Eusebius,</hi> yet can I
not endure to heare this <hi>Romane Rabsheca,</hi> so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignely
misuse a reuerend Bishop, and a most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned
Historian: and specially for deliuering a
most cleere, certaine, and vndoubted truth. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
many other, there are foure points in the
Cardinals Inuectiue, which I will touch in this
place.</p>
               <p>The first is the Cardinals acutenesse, in spying a
strange repugnancy in the sayings of <hi>Eusebius,</hi>
whereas he affirmes<note n="a" place="margin">Euseb. lib. 4. de vit. Const. ca. 62.</note>, <hi>Constantine to be the first Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
that was baptized: Baronius</hi> to disgrace <hi>Eusebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
as contradicting himselfe, and therefore as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
of credit, saith<note n="b" place="margin">Bar. ann. 324. nu. 46.</note>; <hi>Planè immemor, Eusebius had quite forgot what himselfe had said in his owne Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie</hi>
                  <note n="c" place="margin">Euseb. lib. 6. histor. eccle. ca. 33.</note>, <hi>that Philip who was Emperour long before Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine,
was a Christian.</hi> Doe you not admire the
Cardinals subtiltie, who can see a repugnancy in
those two assertions, which are both true, and fitly
coherent the one to the other? Had <hi>Eusebius</hi> said,
that <hi>Philip</hi> the Emperour had beene baptized, the
Cardinall might iustly haue insulted, and declaimed
against him. But seeing <hi>Eusebius</hi> saith onely, that
he was a Christian, and saith not that he was bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed;
you may sooner see here the Cardinals hatred
to <hi>Eusebius,</hi> then any contradiction in his writings.
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:9494:63"/>

neither of them were baptized, neither of them, by

the first, who to his Christian profession added bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme,
and by his authoritie commanded all his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects
to embrace the Christian faith. In which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
he is vsually called also the first Christian Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour;
not simply, nor in regard of the profession

                  <hi>none should beleeue that
Constantine was baptized at Nicomedia, in whomsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
this be found reported, seeing there is none before
Eusebius who hath reported the same.</hi> Was not the
Cardinall, thinke you, bereft of reason when hee
thought any before <hi>Eusebius</hi> could report either
when, or where <hi>Constantine</hi> was baptized? <hi>Eusebius</hi>
liued at that verie time, hee conuersed daily and
familiarly with <hi>Constantine;</hi> who could sooner or
better know it, more certainely relate it, then such
a Bishop? The Cardinall might as well proue that
none should beleeue that <hi>Constantine</hi> was Emperor,
in whomsoeuer this be found to be said, because no
Historian before <hi>Eusebius</hi> doth mention or write
the same. Nay, it may much more firmely be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
that <hi>Eusebius</hi> his report hereof is most true,
seeing none in that age did controule or contradict
him therein: their generall silence being a secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,

knowing it to be so certaine, that they rested satisfied
in his report, they thought it needlesse to say the

                  <hi>did allow the rest in Eusebius; therefore if
you except that Epistle to Abagarus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the prayses of
Origen, his Historie is such, cui fides omnino habe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retur,</hi>
as may wholy bee credited. And for the
Chronicle of <hi>Eusebius, He was</hi> (saith Canus<note n="a" place="margin">Ibid.</note>) <hi>a man
of great diligence and labour, of exceeding varietie
of reading, and of very graue iudgement. Neither
doe I know whether any Authour, either in the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine

Thus <hi>Canus:</hi> who hauing so diligently examined

ought not onely to ouersway, but vtterly abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish

               <p>First, for that calumnie of the Theopaskites, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected

<hi>Eusebius</hi> did truly and rightly teach two distinct na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
to be, and to abide in Christ, the diuine and the
humane, all his bookes doe abundantly testifie. In
his Historie hee<note n="o" place="margin">Euseb. lib. 1. Eccles. hist. c. 1.</note> sets downe this <hi>as the foundation
of all that followes, That Christ being God, induit
hominem nobis similiter passionibus obnoxium,</hi> tooke
vpon him man, or humane nature, being by it
subiect to passion as wee are: and againe, <hi>that the
Deitie is impassible,</hi> hee plainely teacheth in that
Epistle of his which is recorded in <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odoret,</hi>
wherein he<note n="p" place="margin">Epist. Eusebij Caesar. apud Socr. li. 1. ca. 5. prope finem. &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

void and incapable of passion, affection, or mutilation.</hi>
To say nothing that the heresie of the Theopaskites,
(which those <hi>Nicene</hi> fathers impute to <hi>Eusebius) did
but spring vp, and was borne about</hi>

which was both spoken and meant of <hi>Euse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius
Nicomediensis.</hi> Or else, saith hee<note n="a" place="margin">Ibid.</note>, <hi>they were
deceiued, because</hi> Eusebius Caesariensis <hi>did in the</hi> Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene
<hi>Councell a long time doubt, whether the word</hi>
Homousios <hi>might bee allowed or no: but when it was
explained by the</hi> Nicene <hi>Fathers what they meant
thereby, decreto Homousianorum subscripsit, Eusebius</hi>
then subscribed to the <hi>Nicene</hi> Decree. So <hi>Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The very same is witnessed by <hi>Tritemius</hi>
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Trit. lib. de script. eccles. in, Eusebius.</note>, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that <hi>whereas</hi> Eusebius <hi>was first an Arian, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to the</hi> Nicene <hi>Councell, errorem deposuit, hee
abandoned his errour, and embraced the</hi> Nicene <hi>faith.
Tritemius</hi> addes one point further most worthy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bring
for cleering of <hi>Eusebius. He at the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the</hi> Nicene <hi>Councell, composed that Creed,
which is called the</hi> Nicene <hi>Creed, and in token of his
most sincere faith offered it to bee read and confirmed
by them, In which Creed, hee so crushed the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
of the Arians, that they approued it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
either adding or subtracting ought at all from
that forme of faith which</hi> Eusebius <hi>had made.</hi>
Thus <hi>Tritemius.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:9494:69"/>
Whence it is cleere, that <hi>Eusebius</hi> was at no time
an hereticke, no not euen then when hee embraced
the heresie of <hi>Arius.</hi> Before the time of the Councel,
he erred indeede (as <hi>Cyprian</hi> had done in another
matter) but then the cause was not as yet fully deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
&amp; he was not obstinate no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> pertinacious (which
onely makes an hereticke) in that error, but euen
then he was <hi>paratus corrigi:</hi> And his owne fact did
demonstrate the same: for after full discussion of the
cause, he submitted his, to the Churches iudgment:
he forsooke, and as <hi>Tritemius</hi> saith, <hi>deposuit, left his
error,</hi> and subscribed to the Catholicke faith, which
vntill that full discussion, he had erroniously, but
not pertinaciously, and therefore not heretically
oppugned. After the Councel he cannot be thought
an hereticke, being so constant (as we haue alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

they say, that <hi>Eusebius was shaken out like chaffe, and
cast out of the Church.</hi> For though he bee cast out of

heere vpon earth, yet is he (as you see) reckoned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the glorious Saints of God, and receiued in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the tryumphant Church in heauen. Thus <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
by his disgracing of <hi>Eusebius,</hi> hath now occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
vs, not onely to defend the honour of <hi>Eusebius,</hi>
and vindicate it from his calumnies and slanders;
(wherein I confesse, I was very willing to take some
paines, for the benefit which the whole Catholique
Church hath receiued by his writings:) but further
also to leaue this baptisme of <hi>Constantine,</hi> witnessed
not onely by other ancient Fathers, Bishops, and
Historians, but by the vndoubted testimonie of that
<hi>Eusebius,</hi> whom <hi>Constantine</hi> and all the world hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

their owne Martyrologies honor for a blessed Saint

the Doctour tels vs a Storie, well worthy remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring,
how it came to be called Chaffe. The narrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<note n="q" place="margin">Mart. loc. cit. nu. 35. &amp; seq.</note> is this: <hi>When Gratian had composed his book of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees,
he brought it to Rome, to haue it approoued by the
Pope: but in token of reuerence, he gaue it to a learned
Cardinall, that hee should present it to his Holinesse.
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:9494:73"/>
The Cardinall being very ambitious, perusing the booke,
and liking it well, added heere and there, many other
testimonies and Texts of Fathers and Popes, and then
presented it to the Pope as his owne worke. Gratian dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining
thereat,</hi> and remembring the verse, <hi>Sic vos
non vobis mellificatis apes; in presence of the Cardinal,
auouched before his Holinesse, that the Booke was his,
and not the Cardinals; and for proofe thereof, he repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
without book, the order and summe of the Chapters,
omitting such as the ambitious Cardinall had inserted.</hi>
Whereupon when <hi>the Cardinall pleaded, that sure he
had not composed this booke, seeing he knew not of such
Chapters, Gratian answered concerning euery such
Chapter, as it was read vnto him, Hoc Capitulum non
est de tritico meo: Palea est, Palea est,</hi> This Chapter is
none of my Wheat, its Chaffe, its Chaffe. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
to euery Chapter, which was not truly <hi>Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
in stead of that ambitious Cardinals name, which
was deseruedly buried in obliuion, <hi>There was set, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lea.</hi>

               <p>I must needes confesse, that when I considered,

Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> also, Pope <hi>Nicholas,</hi> Pope <hi>Hadrian,</hi>

they commend to the world, as bearing eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
Donation, and then of the Donation it selfe, of both
which, that they are base and improbable fictions,
there are many vndeniable reasons: Some few of
which I will touch.</p>
               <p>For the Charter: All that wee haue formerly
said of the supposed leprosie, Persecution, and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:9494:75"/>
of <hi>Constantine</hi> by <hi>Siluester,</hi> are vndoubted De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations
of the forgerie of this Edict of Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
for in the Charter are al these not only related,
as certaine truthes: but they are made the very
ground and occasion why <hi>Constantine</hi> made this
Charter. Seeing then there is neither truth, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alitie
in the foundation, certainely there is no truth
at all in the Charter it selfe, which is builded vpon
such fictions and fables. But leauing these, I wil pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
a few other considerations in this cause.</p>
               <p>First, in this Edict is mentioned the <hi>See of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople
as one of the Patriarchall Sees:</hi> whereas
neither it had Patriarchal dignity before the second
general Councell, (that is more then fiftie<note n="a" place="margin">Conc. Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>st. 1. habitum est, an. 381. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Donation is supposed to bee made,) nor was
there at that time, so much as the name of <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople:</hi>
for the Citie was then called <hi>Byzantium:</hi> and
diuers yeeres after when <hi>Constantine</hi> had much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged
it, and made it, as <hi>Socrates</hi> saith<note n="b" place="margin">Soc. l. 1. c. 12.</note>, <hi>parem
&amp; aequalem Romae,</hi> equall to <hi>Rome;</hi> choosing it for the
Imperiall fear, it was then first called from his name,
<hi>Constantinople:</hi> and this was done, as <hi>Baronius</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
acknowledgeth<note n="c" place="margin">Post hoc (Conc. Nic.) Patres Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinopolin perrexere. Bar. 325. nu. 196.</note>, <hi>a little after the</hi> Nicene <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,</hi>
was ended: but as <hi>Sigonius</hi>
                  <note n="d" place="margin">Sig. l. 4 de occid Imp. an. 330.</note> more truely tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth,
<hi>fiue yeeres after that</hi> Nicene <hi>Councell, when</hi>
Gallicanus <hi>and</hi> Symachus <hi>were Consulls.</hi> So very
stupid was the forgerer, that to gaine to the Pope,
and See of <hi>Rome,</hi> principalitie ouer <hi>Constantinople,</hi>
hee makes <hi>Constantine</hi> write of that citie, which
was not, no nor the name of it so much as extant in
the world at that time. I should thinke indeede,
that there was some fraud vsed in the inserting of
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:9494:75"/>
this name, but that all the seuerall formes extant of
this Charter, as that of <hi>Albericus,</hi> of <hi>Isidore,</hi> of the
<hi>Gregorian and corrected edition of the Decrees,</hi> haue
all the same name of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and <hi>Pope Leo the
ninth,</hi> who assureth vs, <hi>that hee felt and saw the very
authentical Charter,</hi> mentioneth the same name in his
Decretall Epistle. Besides in the <hi>Greeke Edict,</hi> set

the copie of the Edict, which hee sets downe</hi> (wherein
also this name of <hi>Constantinople</hi> is expressed) <hi>is in
the registry of the Vaticane.</hi> Seeing then there is
such an vniforme consent in all the formes and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies
of the Charter, both Greeke and Latine; seeing
the Charter is so safely kept in their Vaticane,
and ratified by the Decretall Epistle of Pope
<hi>Leo,</hi> for true and authenticall: there can bee no
suspicion of corruption at all in those wordes
of the Edict: The errour and corruption was in
none at all, but in the author himselfe, who

Now the fourth Consuship of <hi>Constantine,</hi> (as
by the Fastiboth Greeke and Latine, besides other
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:9494:77"/>
euidences is cleere) was before the eleuenth yeere of
his Empire: by which account <hi>Constantine</hi> should
haue made this Edict and Donation 8. or 9. yeere
before the occasion &amp; cause therof was offered; and
prophetically should tell, how he was a leper, bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
and therby clensed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his leprosie, many yeeres
before hee had any leprosie, for which hee needed
any clensing. Againe, see the stupiditie of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerer;
not <hi>Gallicanus,</hi> but <hi>Licinius</hi> was colleague with
<hi>Constantine</hi> in that yeere, as appeareth both by the
Fasti, and by many Imperiall Edicts, dated in this
manner,<note n="t" place="margin">L. 1. de Pignoribus. C. Theod. &amp; quàm multae aliae leges.</note> 
                  <hi>Constantino A. 4. &amp; Licinio 4. Coss.</hi> Nay
I say further, seeing <hi>Gallicanus</hi> was neuer Consull
with <hi>Constantine,</hi> as by the Fasti is euident, it cleere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
followes, that this Edict which was made in the

                  <hi>Gelasius</hi> mentioneth, in this <hi>Steuchus</hi> deserueth to

before <hi>Balsamons</hi> time, in these the Cardinal
saith farre amisse. So with <hi>Steuchus</hi> we professe,
and haue prooued also, that this Edict of Donati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is ancient, as being knowne not onely in the time
of <hi>Leo</hi> the ninth, but of <hi>Hadrian,</hi> yea of <hi>Gelasius</hi>
also: and with <hi>Baronius</hi> we professe, and haue cleare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prooued, the same Edict to be nothing else but
a forgerie and figment. What they say amisse, wee
reiect in either: what they rightly affirme, we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of either: and vpon the true confession of
<hi>Steuchus,</hi> we conclude the Edict of Donation to
be ancient: againe, vpon the true confession of
<hi>Baronius,</hi> we conclude it to be a forgerie: And
vpon both these truths, which they seuerally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse,

by a Charter and Instrument: and two of those
Popes further testifie, that the Charter of that dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was extant, &amp; to be seene in their times, among
their recordes or in their registry. The first is Pope
<hi>Hadrian,</hi> who in the thirtie fift Epistle before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
faith of the donation of <hi>Constantine,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<hi>In Lateranensi scrinio eas haberi,</hi> that they were
kept in the <hi>Laterane</hi> Registry: this was about the

ninth, <hi>Who saw</hi> (as he tells vs) <hi>and handled the very
Charter of Constantines Donation:</hi> and this was about
the yeere 1050. The 3. is Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> the 3. who
saith, <hi>that Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stantine left vnto Siluester the city of Rome,
and declared per pragmaticum Constitutu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> by a pragma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall

euidences for many little quillets, would suffer the
charter of so faire a patrimony, as is the <hi>Empire of the
West,</hi> either to be lost, or to perish, or to be corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted?
Or if the originall had by some rare mishap
beene lost, would they lose al copies and extracts, all
records, and inroulments of so faire a Charter? Or
could all these be lost and perish, and none of the
Popes lament, or bemoane the losse of them? For to
say it was falsified or corrupted, vnlesse it were by the
Popes themselues, or their agents, (who had the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stodie

did iustly and constantly oppose themselues

               <p>The other Coniecture which <hi>Gretzer</hi> alledgeth,
concerneth the Popes patrimony <hi>in the Cottian Alps:
long before the time</hi> (saith<note n="u" place="margin">Gretz. Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend. 1. ad lib. de Munifi. pa. 90.</note> he) <hi>of Pipine, that other
Donation was made, which Paulus Diaconus</hi>

                  <hi>mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth:
Aripert King of the Lombards restored the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:9494:87"/>
of the patrimony of the Cottian Alpes, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
did belong to the Apostolicke Sea, but had beene
for a long time detained by the Lombards; and this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
written in golden letters, he sent to Rome:</hi> from
these words of <hi>Paulus Diaconus, Gretzer</hi> concludes<note n="a" place="margin">Loc. cit pag. 91.</note>,
<hi>Cum ergo certo certius constet, seeing it is most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
that before Pipines time, yea before Ariperts,
(that is, before the yeare seauen hundred and foure,)
the Pope or See Apostolique, had diuers Prouinces sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
to their Dominion, and there appeares no euidence
for any other title, whereby they should haue and hold
those lands, it followeth, that the right to haue them, is
not vnprobably deriued from the Donation of Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine.</hi>
So <hi>Gretzer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I answer, that this reason is many waies defectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
sophisticall, and improbable. First, the proofe
is onely of the <hi>patrimony of the Cottian Alpes,</hi> but the
conclusion is of <hi>many</hi>

<pb n="154" facs="tcp:9494:88"/>
a few Cottages, or Farme houses, to <hi>Rome;</hi> to all
<hi>Italie,</hi> to all the Western Prouinces and kingdoms?
Its true, I confesse, that the <hi>Alpes Cottiae,</hi> was <hi>one of
the seuenteene</hi>

                  <hi>Prouinces which belonged to Italy, and
into which it was diuided.</hi> But that the Popes patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
was not the whole Prouince, but some <hi>Cortes,
or villages therein, Sigonius</hi> euidently doth witnesse,
who saith<note n="c" place="margin">Sig. lib. 2. pa. 38.</note>; <hi>There were at this times, when Rotharis was
King of the Lombards,</hi> (which was more then sixtie
yeares before <hi>Aripert) two Prouinces in the hither part
of Italy, adhuc Imperatoriae ditioni subiectae, which were
as yet subiect to the Emperors Dominion, and those were
Alpes Cottiae, et Opitergium.</hi> The Prouince then of
<hi>Alpes Cottiae,</hi> was the Emperors, and subiect to him,
vntill that time when <hi>Rotharis</hi> inuading it, <hi>Imperato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri</hi>
                  <note n="d" place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>prouinciam eripuit, bereaued the Emperor of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince,
and depriued the Pope, opulento patrimonio, of a
fat patrimony which of old he had in the same Prouince.</hi>
So <hi>Sigonius,</hi> speaking of this very patrimony which
<hi>Aripert</hi> restored to the Pope. <hi>Gretzer</hi> might as well;
nay much better conclude, that because some No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleman,
hath a Mannor, and some Lordships, and
Farmes in the Wolds of <hi>York,</hi> therefore <hi>Certo certius</hi>
the dominion of al England in right doth belong to
him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, what a sory collection is this of <hi>Gretzer,
because Histories and Records make no mention of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
title, by which the Pope had that patrimony in the
Alpes Cottiae; therefore he deriues it from the Donation of
Constantine?</hi> why? Is there no other means how the
Pope might get that, but onely by <hi>Constantines</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation?
what if the records of the conueiance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:9494:88"/>
made by some other, were lost or burnt, in some
of those often irruptions, sackings, and spoylings
by the <hi>Gothes, Vandals,</hi> or <hi>Lombards?</hi> What if those
lands came to the Church by no Donation at all,
but by defect of Heires, by vertue of that Law<note n="e" place="margin">Eus. lib. 2. de vit. Const. cap. 36.</note> of
<hi>Constantine, If none of the kindred of Martyrs, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors,
and exiles be aliue, who may succeed as heires vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, vt Ecclesia semper cuiusque loci haereditatem
adeat, ratum esto;</hi> be it enacted, that euery where, and
for euer, the Church shall haue and enioy their pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions.
Or why might not the Pope haue it by some
<hi>purchase,</hi> the oblations and treasures of the Church
being anciently so very great, that they might easily
purchase much more then that one patrimony, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
<hi>Cortes et villas?</hi> Or what if he had it by Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of some other either before, or after <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines</hi>
time? Certaine it is, that many priuate men,
gaue not onely goods, but lands &amp; faire possessions,
both to other Churches, and to that at <hi>Rome. Prosper</hi>

So many and so ample Donations of lands, were
made vnto the Church in <hi>Austens</hi> time, that both

to the Church, of such houses, lands, orchards, and the
like, as by the tyranny of others had beene taken away,

those Epistles which goe vnder the names of the
ancient Popes, to bee truly theirs, and no counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feits)
will not deny such Donations of Lands, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonies
and possessions, to haue beene made in
the <hi>time of Vrbane the first, and of Pius the first,</hi> that
is, an hundred and sixtie yeares before <hi>Constantine</hi>
either was baptized, or made this supposed Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
For those Popes do expresly mention, <hi>praedia</hi>
                  <note n="k" place="margin">Epist. 2. Pij. 1. &amp; Epist. Vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bani 1.</note> 
                  <hi>diuinis vsibus dicata,</hi> the Church lands or Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony:
and the one of them further insinuates, this
custome to haue beene long before his time. For
<hi>whereas many sold their lands, and brought the price of
them, and bestowed that on the Church; It was thought
more conuenient, saith he</hi>
                  <note n="l" place="margin">Vrban. 1. Epist. citat.</note>, <hi>both for the present, and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
times, if they would giue, haereditates et agros, The
lands and inheritances themselues vnto the Church.
Whereupon Christians gaue their lands and patrimonies
to the mother Churches, and the same in each Diocesse was
in the disposing of the Bishops, who with his whole Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie
of Presbyters, Deacons, and other Church Officers in
that Diocesse, were in common to be maintained therwith.</hi>
Which same custome, Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> obserueth, who
mentions<note n="m" place="margin">Cypr. Epist. 34.</note>, <hi>Sportulas Presbyterorum et diuisiones men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surnas,</hi> the stipend &amp; monthly allowance which the
Bishops allotted to the Presbyters. Seeing then by
the testimonie of those two Popes, it appeares,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:9494:89"/>
that 160.<note n="n" place="margin">Pius papatu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> inijt an. 158. Bin. Nous in vit am Pij. 1. Constantinu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> volunt bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zari an. 324.</note> 
                  <hi>yeeres</hi> before <hi>Constantine</hi> made this sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed

it; and one part of their lands, as <hi>Sigonius</hi>

was this <hi>very Patrimony in the Cottian Alpes,</hi> how
inconsequent is this reason of <hi>Gretzer? The patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
in the Alpes, was giuen to the Romane See, long
before Aripert, and no record appeares by whom: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it was giuen by Constantine.</hi> Why may hee not
rather conclude, therefore it was giuen in <hi>Valentini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
time,</hi> or in Pope <hi>Pius,</hi> or in <hi>Vrbanes</hi> time?
for they both witnesse, that the Church had <hi>patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
aud lands</hi> then giuen vnto them. Seeing the
Recordes are not extant, to testifie the gift of those
<hi>Cortes &amp; Villae,</hi> what more probabilitie is there, that
they should be giuen by <hi>Constantine,</hi> rather then by
other Christians, either before or after him? The Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites
reason is much like, as if some noble man in
the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the first, (when they were called
to shew <hi>Quo warranto</hi> by what warrant or title they
held their landes, most of their euidences being in
the Barons warres lost or burnt) should haue thus
reasoned, My Auncestors held these Mannors and
Lordships, in the time of King <hi>Richard</hi> the first, and
long before, and because there appeares not by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordes
any other title whereby they had them, it is
most probable, that they were giuen by King <hi>Brutus</hi>
vnto them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly the Iesuites reason and proofe, taken
from the <hi>fact of Aripert and Litprandus,</hi> doth direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ouerthrow that donation of <hi>Constantine,</hi> which
he would thence conclude. For by <hi>Sigonius</hi> it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares

some other lands to the See of <hi>Rome.</hi> But this in king
<hi>Litprandus</hi> is more manifest. <hi>Hee restored to the Pope

donauit, and further hee gaue vnto the Pope a patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
at Naruium, another at Ancona; a third at Auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum,
a fourth at Humanate, with the vally of Sutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um
called Magna.</hi> Thus <hi>Sigonius.</hi> Had all <hi>Italy</hi> beene
giuen by <hi>Constantine</hi> to the Pope and his successors,
neither <hi>Aripert,</hi> nor <hi>Litprandus,</hi> could haue giuen
any lands, villages or patrimonies therein vnto him;
they should but haue restored them all; seeing then
they restored some, as by name that patrimony in
the <hi>Alpes Cottiae,</hi> and gaue others; it is cleere by the
very restitution of the one, and gift of the other, that
the whole was not iudged to belong to the Pope,
but some parcells onely; and that those (euen that
verie patrimony in the <hi>Alpes Cottiae</hi>) was giuen not
by <hi>Constantine</hi> (for <hi>his gift was of the whole countrey,

               </p>
               <p>The fourth and last defect in the Iesuites reason

the profit of the dominion, and the exercise of the
iurisdiction hee committed to the Pope. Againe<note n="h" place="margin">Ibid. pa. 298.</note>,
<hi>The donation to the Pope is good, quoad proprietatem
&amp; dominium particulare, sed non quoad iurisdictionem

and particular dominion in those lands, but
not good to passe away the whole or supreame Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
or the Imperiall right in them.</p>
               <p>The same <hi>Rosellus</hi> addes two or three other
points very worthy obseruing to this purpose. One,
that the Pope is not capable of Soueraigne domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
no not in those very territories which haue been
giuen vnto him. <hi>Although,</hi> saith he<note n="i" place="margin">Ibid. pa. 298.</note>, <hi>the Pope bee
capable of the Imperiall right, quoad subsidium,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the profit, <hi>non tamen est capax principaliter,</hi>
yet is he not capable thereof as the principall owner
of it; <hi>nay it is,</hi> saith he, <hi>impossible that in the same per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
should consist the Imperiall authoritie, and the
priesthood, et ideo impossibile est per viam praescriptio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi>
and therefore though the Pope prescribe neuer
so long time for his holding those territories, yet it
is impossible that by way of prescription, the Pope
should either in whole, or in part hold <hi>ius impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riale,</hi>
Imperiall or Soueraigne right therein.</p>
               <p>An other is, that Emperours being the supreame
Lords, may vpon iust cause recall any, or all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
donatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; take into their owne hands the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:9494:93"/>
or propertie in those Territories, which the
Popes hold by vertue of those Donations. To which
purpose he thus saith; <hi>The</hi>
                  <note n="m" place="margin">Ibid. pa. 298.</note> 
                  <hi>Donations, for passing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the propertie in those goods, is firme, yea it is not
reuocable by succeeding Emperours, if they haue no
cause to reuoke it; Cum causa autem posset,</hi> but vpon
iust cause it may be reuoked, by the successours of
those Emperours who made the Donations. Now
whether the Popes haue giuen, and that often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
many and iust causes, to reuoke those Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
I list not here dispute. Their so often iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
with the Emperours, their vsurping that Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall
authoritie which belongs not to them, but to
the Emperour; their often misusing Emperours in
most base and indigne manner, and making them
of the Popes Lords, the Popes vassals; these may
seeme to any who are not factious on the Popes
side, to bee iust causes to resume all those lands,
which he either by Donation or vsurpation posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth.
But I leaue this to their iudgement, to whom
in right it belongs; and those are the Emperours
and secular Princes themselues; as the same learned
Lawyer there rightly sets downe: <hi>If</hi>
                  <note n="n" place="margin">Ca. eod. pa. 299.</note> 
                  <hi>there happen,</hi>
saith he, <hi>a controuersie betwixt the Pope and the Prince,
concerning any meere temporall matter,</hi> (and such is
this touching the temporall possessions granted to
the Pope) <hi>I thinke the Emperour himselfe ought to be
iudge herein, seeing in temporall matters he is aboue all;
euen the Pope himselfe, and Ipse est iudex suae causae,
The Emperour is iudge in his owne cause, as the Law
teacheth.</hi> So he.</p>
               <p>The third is this, that whereas the <hi>Popes,</hi> to make

The like to that in <hi>Rossellus,</hi> is taught by another
of their famous Lawyers, <hi>Franc. Vargas</hi>
                  <note n="c" place="margin">Fr. Varg. lib. de Author. Pontif. Axi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>om. 1. nu. 2.</note>, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth
<hi>Baldus,</hi> and diuers other Lawyers, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
with him. He sets downe two assertions;
The one, that <hi>suprema Principis iurisdictio est prorsus
inabdicabilis,</hi> the supreame iurisdiction of the King
cannot possibly be giuen away from him: The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that <hi>it is impossible, that the Emperour should
make any, vel parem sibi, vel superiorem,</hi> either equall
or superiour to himselfe: for, as <hi>Baldus</hi> saith, <hi>Lex re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia
contradicit,</hi> that is contrarie to the law or nature
of a King. Then out of doubt, neither <hi>Charles,</hi> nor
<hi>Lewis,</hi> nor <hi>Otho,</hi> nor any other Emperor either did,
or could by any of their Donations, passe away their
Soueraigntie to the Pope.</p>
               <p>The words of <hi>Baldus</hi> are very remarkable, hee
speaking of this Donation of <hi>Constantine,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
with his owne, the iudgement of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours
of Law, saith<note n="d" place="margin">Bald. in Prooem. de Feud. nu. 32. 33.</note> thus; <hi>They determine that this
Donation, quoad expropriationem territorij, dignitatis,
et iurisdictionis, non valere nec possibilem esse;</hi> neither
is, nor possibly can be of force, to passe away either
the proprietie, or supreame Dominion in those ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories,
or the Imperiall dignitie and iurisdiction
ouer them. <hi>The commodities, profits, et vtile domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,
may be granted,</hi> saith he, <hi>salua semper ab Imperio,
recognitione et fide;</hi> alwaies reseruing and keeping
safe to the Emperour, recognition and feoltie, to
hold them from him: <hi>for to say, that the Emperour
would by his Donation, mutilate, or cut away the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the Empire, est species fatuitatis,</hi> is a kind of
follie. Thus <hi>Baldus;</hi> by whose cleere testimonie,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:9494:95"/>
                  <hi>Gretzer, Marta, Steuchus, Albanus, Iacobatius,</hi> and al
that plead either for the Charter, or for the Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or that an absolute Dominion was giuen by
<hi>Constantine</hi> to the Pope; they all by the iudgement
of <hi>Baldus,</hi> are a consort of fooles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aretine</hi> not onely assents to <hi>Baldus,</hi> but much

the Emperour, non potest dare quotam Imperij,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
giue away any quotient, <hi>neither a third, nor a
fourth part, nor halfe of his Empire; but he may giue
some goods belonging to the Empire. Whereby Baldus,</hi>
saith he, <hi>meanes that the Empire being an entire and
vniuersall power, the Emperour by giuing ought, cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
not to bee vniuersall Lord of all belonging to the
Empire.</hi> Then by <hi>Aretines</hi> iudgement, neither
<hi>Constantine,</hi> nor any other Emperour, by any Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of Lands and Territories, either doth, or can
passe away his supreame and Imperiall right in and
ouer them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lucas de Penna,</hi> is very pregnant in this point;
<hi>Imperij Regalia,</hi> saith he<note n="b" place="margin">Luc. de Pen. Cod. de omni agro deserto. l. Quicunque desertum. fol. 184. &amp; 185.</note>, <hi>sunt inalienabilia,</hi> the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alties
of the Empire cannot be giuen away, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienated
from the Empire. Whereupon hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferres,
that <hi>though the Emperour should sweare that
he would not reuoke such royalties, as were alienated
to the preiudice of his Crowne and Dignitie; posset
tamen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

this his oath, hee might recall such
grants and alienations. And he giues that reason,
which before was touched, <hi>because the Emperour
sweares at his Coronation, to keepe safe the honours and
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:9494:96"/>
rights of his kingdome: but by alienating his demaines
and Territories</hi> (much more his Regall Soueraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and Dominion) <hi>he doth not preserue but impaire
the Imperiall rights.</hi> Thus he. By whose iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
neither was by any of those Donations the
Soueraigntie and Royaltie past away from the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour;
and if it were, yea, and that also by an oath,
yet seeing such an oath was vnlawfull, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
to the Imperiall oath taken at his Coronation,
it can binde none, nor can it be <hi>vinculum iniquita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi>
a band to tie him to doe wrong, or contrarie
to his lawfull oath: and therefore notwithstanding
such an vnlawfull oath, Emperors (as he thinks) may,
and ought to reuoke such grants, and take from the
Pope their Imperiall rights and royalties, which he
now claimeth and vsurpeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Albericus de Rosate</hi> is abundant in this cause. <hi>Let
vs see,</hi> saith he<note n="x" place="margin">Alb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

could be of force to the preiudice of his Successours,
Accursius holds it could not: so doth Ioh. de Pari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ijs;</hi>
And he giues this reason thereof: <hi>Because none be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
deputed to an Office, may doe ought against his
owne Office. But it is against the Office deputed to the
Emperour, to impaire his Empire, or cut and take away
any part from it. For by the same reason, that hee
cuts away one part, hee may cut away also another: and
so may his successours: and so the Empire should at last
be brought to nothing, and vtterly destroyed; which is
against the publique good, and the end why the Empire
is ordained. Ex quo verè credo.</hi> Whereupon I do
truly beleeue, <hi>that the foresaid Donation, de iure, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be of force to preiudice the Empire, or the successors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:9494:96"/>
But may not the Church, saith he, prescribe in this
matter? To this <hi>Albericus</hi> answeres by three diuers
steps and degrees. First, saith he, <hi>For corporall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
there is no doubt, but longissima praescriptione,
by most long prescription of time, the Church may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
it selfe, praestitis tamen tributis &amp; censibus,</hi> yet
so that it yeeld tribute, and due pensions as an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement
of the supreame right and domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the Emperour. Secondly, <hi>For</hi>
                  <note n="y" place="margin">Alber. de Iurisdict. omn. Iud. l. finali. §. per iniquum nu. 4. fol. 146.</note> 
                  <hi>those things
which are of meere or mixt Empire, Praescriptio dat
tantum vtile dominium, directum non tollit,</hi> Prescrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
doth onely giue the vsefull or profitable domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
(to the Pope) but it doth not take away the
direct or supreame dominion from the Emperour.
Againe, <hi>Contra principem non nisi quoad vtile domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium
praescribitur,</hi> Prescription against the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
is onely of force, for the profitable dominion,
not for the direct or supreame, <hi>because the Pope in v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the dominion, doth it as the Emperours minister,

                     </gap>d in the Emperours name, and so the Soueraigne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
doth rest in the Emperor.</hi> Thirdly, may not by the
Canon Law, prescription, or long possession bee
good fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the Popes right in this cause? To this <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bericus</hi>
                  <note n="z" place="margin">Alber. de Quadriennij praescript. loco ante cit.</note> answeres, <hi>that it is least auaileable by that law.
For by the Canon Law there is required to a forceable
prescription, Titulus, et bona fides,</hi> both a good
Title, and also good dealing. <hi>Both which,</hi> saith hee,
<hi>seeme to be wanting in this case; for there is a Title pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
where there is no Title at all, quia datus per
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>um qui dare non potuit,</hi> because the Title was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to the Pope, by him who could not giue it:
<hi>and because the alienation is made contrarie to Law,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:9494:97"/>
as we haue shewed. Bona fides also is heere wanting,
because the Pope and their successours knew, res esse ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enas,
hoc est, Imperij,</hi> that the things giuen vnto them
were not <hi>Constantines,</hi> but the Empires. Thus <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bericus:</hi>
shewing plainely both by reason, by the
Ciuill, and by the Canon Law, that such Donati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of an absolute and Monarchall Dominion as
they pretend to be made by <hi>Constantine, Charles, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wis,
Henry,</hi> and <hi>Otho,</hi> are of no force at all, nor can

This is,</hi> saith hee, <hi>a most certaine argument: Because
Pope Boniface 4. desiring to build a Church in honour
of the blessed Virgin, in that place where the Pantheon
stood, necesse fuit ei facultatem obtinere à Phoca,</hi> hee
was of necessity to obtaine leaue of <hi>Phocas</hi> so to doe.
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:9494:98"/>
                  <hi>The Pope,</hi> saith he, <hi>being then, not Dominus sed Inquili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
not Lord, but tenant vnder the Emperour, <hi>om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni

                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:9494:99"/>
Is it credible, that if <hi>Constantine</hi> had formerly
made either by word or writing, an absolute Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Rome, Italy,</hi> and the Westerne Prouinces to
the Pope, and that so solemnly, that as <hi>Leo</hi> 9. saith,
hee <hi>decreed that donation to abide firme and inuiolable,
in finem mundi,</hi> vnto the end of the world; is it cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible,
I say, that so pious and prudent an Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
would within twelue yeares after doe contrary
to his owne act? especially in his last will and testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
wherein hee would rather haue testified his
religious affection and loue to the Church, by an
addition of some other gift, then leaue so eternall a
blemish vpon his name of inconstancy, of iniustice,
of impietie, of sacriledge, and of making his owne
children inheritours of that which he knew was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his to giue, nor which they without open in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iustice,
impiety, and sacriledge might accept, hold,
or possesse.</p>
               <p>The second reason is the perpetuall possession and

they with one consent teaching that by the meanes
of that <hi>Gregory, Leo</hi> the Emperour was depriued
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:9494:101"/>
(vnder colour of pietie, but in truth, perfidiously
and traiterously) of the Westerne dominion: the
Pope, as <hi>Diaconus</hi>
                  <note n="z" place="margin">Paul Dia. lust. lib. 21. pa. 665.</note> saith, <hi>causing Rome and Italy to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake

Rome and all Italy, and the right both of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
weale and of the Church in the Westerne parts, ab
obedientia Leonis &amp; Imperij,</hi> from the obedience of
<hi>Leo</hi> and from the Empire. The Romanes and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
at that time adhaered to the Pope, and so by
this traiterous meanes hee got the possession of
much of that, which afterward by <hi>Pipine</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi>
the Great was confirmed vnto him. And that was
done by <hi>Gregory</hi> about the 730. yeare after Christ,
vntill which time, <hi>Italy,</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> remained in the
Emperours possession and subiect to his dominion.</p>
               <p>Can it bee imagined that <hi>Constantine,</hi> if hee had
made such an absolute and solemne Donation of
<hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> to the Pope, would immediately, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
the next yeare after that, and all his life time,
haue continued the possession, rule, and gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
thereof by his lieutenants in such sort as hee
had done before? or may we thinke that both him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
<hi>Constans, Theodosius, Valentinian,</hi> and other
most pious and religious Emperours, would haue
vsurped that gouernment and intruded themselues
into S. <hi>Peters</hi> patrimony? Or if all those Emperours
would haue beene so vniust and impious, may wee
thinke <hi>Syluester, Iulius, Leo, Gelasius, Gregory,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Popes, men of high courage to defend their
rights, that they would haue put vp so great indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,
without once so much as checking the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
for so open wrong, sacriledge and vsurpation?
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:9494:101"/>
Or may not the silence of so many Popes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
possession by so many Emperors, be thought
a iust reason to condemne that pretended Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
               <p>The third proofe that <hi>Constantine</hi> made no such

whereof though it were easie to produce a long Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue,
yet I will heere cite but a few. The first, is

               <p>The second is Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> who among

of this donation, but they affirme that, whence it is

was baptized at <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> and by <hi>Eusebius</hi>
Bishop of <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> and that but a little before his

followeth, that hee did not make this Edict
of donation after his baptisme by <hi>Siluester,</hi> nor at
<hi>Rome,</hi> nor ten yeares before he died, as in the Edict
it is said that hee did. If <hi>Marta</hi> knew not this to bee

haue been extant nine or tenne whole yeares before
euer it was made or thought vpon.</p>
               <p>See next the truth of <hi>Marta:</hi> where, I pray you,
doth the <hi>Nicene</hi> Councell beare witnes of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation?
Not in the Acts thereof: for of them there
is no more extant, but that which in <hi>Eusebius, Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasius,
Socrates, Theodoret,</hi> and other ancient Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
is recorded. In none of which there is any

or Canons: They are extant and in euery
mans hand, and in them there is not one word tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
this Donation.</p>
               <p>Heare now I pray you, the wise answer of <hi>Marta:
because by the</hi>
                  <note n="s" place="margin">Mart. cap. cit. nu. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>Acts of this Councell, the Donation did
specially appeare, propterea toto conatu insidi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ti sunt isti
mali homines,</hi> therefore did those wicked men ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
with all their power <hi>to falsifie and suppresse the
Nicene Decrees, vt illius memoriam penitus abolerent,</hi>
that they might vtterly abolish the memory of this
Donation. By this <hi>Marta</hi> would perswade you that
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:9494:108"/>
this Donation is testified in some of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
which were suppressed and lost. But if these
Canons be lost, how knowes <hi>Marta</hi> that this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
was mentioned therein? Or why may not
another say that <hi>Constantine</hi> made the same Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the Bishop of <hi>Bizantium,</hi> and prooue it
by those <hi>Nicene</hi> Canons which are lost? How can
<hi>Marta</hi> refute this, but hee must withall condemne
his owne folly in alleadging for his proofe the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
which are perished? Againe, who were
those wicked men that did abolish the <hi>Nicene</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
wherein this Donation was mentioned?
That Arrians and Heretickes, to the end they
might abandon the faith, laboured to falsifie the
<hi>Nicene</hi> Canons, hath beene often said and by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny:
But that euer any man falsified or suppressed
any of those Canons to this end which <hi>Marta</hi> hath
deuised, that so they might abolish the memorie of
<hi>Constantines</hi> Donation, none, as I thinke, so much
as euer dreamed thereof before <hi>Marta,</hi> nor any I
hope, will euer abette him in so foolish a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite.</p>
               <p>Now whereas <hi>Marta</hi> will needes vndertake to
prooue some of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Canons to bee lost,
though his labour therein be altogether vaine, (see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

If <hi>Steuchus</hi> could haue forborne rauing, hee
might haue knowne that other manner of men then
<hi>Parthians,</hi> or <hi>Turkes,</hi> and enemies to Christ, could
not see this Edict to flow from the <hi>Nicene</hi> Councel.
Nay to haue seene, that it could not possibly flow

(one much esteemed &amp; magnified by <hi>Steuchus</hi>)
saw that this <hi>Charter was made the fourth day</hi>

although that which I haue formerly said touching

(of all which the Author of those Actes was

author of them was a most impudent fabler; yet

               <p>1. That this Romane Councell followed the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme

Now that those Actes of <hi>Siluester</hi> doe put
this Councell after the baptisme of <hi>Constantine,
Baronius</hi> doth testifie, who for this ver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

These things touching the first Romane Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,
are heere inserted in the Actes of <hi>Siluester,</hi>
but against the order of time. <hi>For that Councell,</hi>
saith hee<note n="m" place="margin">Bar. an. 315. nu. 10.</note>, <hi>was held in the tenth yeare of Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi>
that is, nine yeares before hee was bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized.</p>
               <p>2. Those Vaticane Actes affirme, <hi>the two sonnes
of Constantine, namely Constantinus and Constans to
haue beene Augusti, that is, Emperours, before the tenth
yeare of</hi> Constantine, <hi>when this Councell is suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to haue beene helde.</hi> An vntruth so notorious
that <hi>Baronius</hi>

               <p>3. That <hi>Helena</hi> heard of <hi>Constantines</hi> baptisme as

Helena, and that shee was a Pagane, a Iudaizing Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gane,

                  <note n="x" place="margin">Bin. not. in Conc. Rom. 1. §. Concilium.</note>, <hi>that Constantine

                  <hi>that Helena did instruct and traine vp Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine

whereby you may further see what truth there is in

was more then fortie yeare<note n="c" place="margin">Vixit annos 65. regnauit 31. Socr. lib. 1. ca 26.</note> old, that hee then

               </p>
               <p>Now because all the rest of the narration, as well
the Romane Councell, as the disputation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,

on this vntruth, that <hi>Helena</hi> was at that time a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gane,

his meaning is plaine. For hee neither

speaking comparatiuely, and comparing it to his

those Acts are read by Catholiques, and therefore they
may be read. In which words, what manner of appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
there is, euery one,</hi> saith Cusanus, <hi>may consider.</hi>
For if from hence any will conclude, that <hi>Gelasius</hi>
approues those Acts, hee might as well conclude,
because a prouinciall Synod at London did say,
that many Catholikes in the Church of England, do

for though he say<note n="k" place="margin">Canus. lib. cit. cap. 5. §. Quod deinde.</note>, <hi>that</hi> Gelasius <hi>did not reiect those

                  <hi>should by no meanes, accept or credit those writings,

for such writings doe smell either of imposture, or
heresie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Gelasius</hi> then, is so far from approuing (as they
boast he did) those shamelesse Acts of <hi>Siluester,</hi> that
by the confession of Bishop <hi>Canus,</hi> he did indeede
prohibit and condemne the same.</p>
               <p>And all this I haue said, supposing those Acts of
<hi>Gelasius,</hi> which are now extant, and which are set

there are sundry, and effectuall reasons to induce any
man, that this, touching the Acts of <hi>Siluester,</hi> and
much more in those Synodall Acts, is falsely ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed

certaine it is, that if the Synodall Actes be corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
(in such manner as I haue shewed and prooued)
then <hi>Gelasius</hi> with that Romane Synod, approues
not the Acts of <hi>Siluester:</hi> if they bee not corrupted,

shamefully, euen this Collector also (whom they

Councell, to lift vp the authoritie of the Romane

               <p>It were easie by many other examples, to declare

<hi>Fr. Pisarro,</hi> saith hee, <hi>hauing discouered those lands
on the South of Panama, some of them by signes enquired
of the Indian inhabitants, the name of that countrey:

the Indians answered,</hi> Peru: therby noting, as he saith,
<hi>the name of the riuer, and from this their answer the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
was euer since called Peru.</hi> But herein his conie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
is many wayes fallible: for why may not one
thinke that the Indians truely expressed the ancient
name of the Region? or, say they meant the riuer,
why may not that riuer take his name of the Region,

well misconceiue the answer of the Indians, as the

that there is a straight course, and that almost

               <p>But the true and vndoubted Epistle<note n="k" place="margin">Ea extat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pud Athanas. Apol. 2. pa. 198</note> of <hi>Iulius</hi>

And the Canon also which here is alledged for sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred,

because they called not him, nor the Westerne Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops

The Canons most iustly forbid any decree (which

to say, that <hi>no Councell can be held, nor no Bishops bee

others may examine the cause, yet the last and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
sentence must belong to the Pope: which to be
a forgerie, and quite repugnant to the sacred Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons,
the Epistle of the <hi>Africane</hi> Bishops to Pope
<hi>Celestine</hi> doth demonstrate: for therein they testifie<note n="o" place="margin">Cone. Afric cap. 105.</note>
the <hi>Nicen Councell to haue decreed, that the causes as

referred suis Metropolitanis,</hi> to the Metropolitans of

should be there ended where they did arise, leauing
no appeale from their sentence to any, no not to
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:9494:142"/>
the Pope, but onely to a Prouinciall first, and then to
a generall Councell.</p>
               <p>By this now it doth cleerely appeare how shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
Pope <hi>Leo</hi> 9. was in seeking to maintaine the
dignitie of their See by forged authors, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
Decrees, which hee magnifies for sacred wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
and holy Canons. Now, if <hi>Leo</hi> would dare
to deale thus shamefully for the honour and gaine
of holding Councells, and of being a iudge of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops;
would hee not much more aduenture, to set
forth like forged Records, for gaine of <hi>Rome,</hi> of <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
and of all the Westerne Prouinces; to bring all
Emperors in subiection vnder his feet, and to hold

               <p>The third Pope alledged, as a witnesse of this

                  <note n="q" place="margin">Mart. loc. cit. nu. 37.</note>, <hi>appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
the Decrees compiled by Gratian, both the</hi> Triticum

<hi>Constantinus,</hi> wherein this Edict is expressed. Be it
so: yet hee approoued it no otherwise then as <hi>Palea.</hi>
And it had beene a point worthy of <hi>Martaes</hi> labour,
to prooue that the Popes approbation can transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiate
<hi>chaffe</hi> into <hi>wheat,</hi> or make of a forged, a true

Cardinall foisted into <hi>Gratians</hi> Decrees, I
would gladly know, of what truth and credit that

He cites as the booke of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Augustine, that Treatise,

<hi>Bellarmine</hi>
                  <note n="x" place="margin">Ibid.</note> rightly proues, seeing S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Benedict</hi>
is named therein, who liued more then an hundred
yeares after <hi>Augustine</hi> was dead. No marueile if Pope
<hi>Eugenius</hi> approuing these, and an hundred such like
passages in <hi>Gratian,</hi> approued also that <hi>Chaffe of
Canstantines Donation,</hi> which is of the same stamp
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:9494:143"/>
with the former. Chaffe it was, and for all the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
of <hi>Eugenius,</hi> or any other Pope, Chaffe it
will be euer, and ought for euer to be so accounted.</p>
               <p>As for Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> 3. (to whom may be added,
<hi>Clement</hi>
                  <note n="y" place="margin">Clementin. lib. 2. tit. 9. ca. Romani.</note> 5.)
It was but a point of good manners in
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to approue that Charter, which they saw <hi>Hadri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
1. Leo</hi> 9. &amp; <hi>Eugenius</hi> 3. to haue before them, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
for authenticall. Who were they, that they
should giue the lye to 3. of their predecessours? But
that which disgraceth both the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; the former Popes
is, that <hi>Nicholas,</hi> and <hi>Clement,</hi> followed heerein <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genius,
Leo,</hi> &amp; <hi>Adrian;</hi> and they followed the Acts of
<hi>Siluester.</hi> Now those Acts being, as wee haue before
demonstrated, nothing but a very sinke of lies, and
sottish fables, the Popes by their approbation can no
way giue or gain any credit to such vntruths, but they
impaire their owne credit, and extreamely disgrace
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, in seeking by such fabulous &amp; forged wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
to vphold the dignity of their pontificall See.</p>
               <p>After the foure Popes, let vs examine two of their
general Councels, which are alledged as witnesses of
this Donation. The former is <hi>their second Nicene,</hi> of
which <hi>Marta</hi> saith<note n="z" place="margin">Mart. ca. cit. nu. 10.</note>, that it beares witnesse to the
Donation. <hi>Steuchus</hi> more plainely and confidently
affirmes, <hi>that this</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Aug. Steuch. lib. cit. pa. 87.</note> 
                  <hi>takes away all doubt concerning the
truth of this Donation, seeing the definitions of generall
Councells are of greatest authoritie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The answere is easie: first, in that second Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene
Councell, there is no mention at all of this
Donation, nor ought whence it can be collected.
For though they approue that part of the Actes of
<hi>Siluester,</hi> wherein the persecution, leprosie, and bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:9494:144"/>
of <hi>Constantine</hi> by <hi>Siluester,</hi> is set downe, yet
of the other part of those Actes, wherein this Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is expressed, they make no mention at all. And
that the one may be approued, and the other reiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
Card. <hi>Baronius</hi> is an vndeniable witnesse, who
admits<note n="b" place="margin">Bar. an. 324 nu. 31, 32. 33.</note> the former, and yet the later hee vtterly
condemnes<note n="c" place="margin">Bar. an. 1191 nu. 52.</note> as a forgery. Againe, the second Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene
Councell is of no truth or credite in the world.
They are so impudent in alledging lies, fables, and
forged writings, that three quarters of those Actes,
though they be very large (I speake it confidently,)
are nothing else, but either vntruths or forgeries.
The Councell of <hi>Frankford</hi> gaue a true and iust cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of that their <hi>Nicene</hi> Synod, when it said<note n="d" place="margin">Car. Magni. lib. 3. ca. 30.</note>, that
those Fathers <hi>being destitute of proofes out of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Scriptures, turned themselues, Ad apocryphas &amp;
risu dignas naenias,</hi> To apocryphall and ridiculous
toyes. Of a thousand, take but two or three exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>
               <p>First, the Actes of <hi>Siluester,</hi> touching <hi>Constantines</hi>
persecution, leprosie, and baptisme, <hi>are approoued</hi>

                  <hi>therein;</hi> which Acts to be not onely vntrue, but a
very puddle of lies, wee haue before<note n="f" place="margin">Sup. ca. 10.</note> demonstrated.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that miraculous narration set
downe by <hi>Euagrius,</hi> of the Image of Christ made
without hands, and sent to <hi>Abgarus</hi> King of <hi>Edessa,</hi>
by which that citie was made vnconquerable, is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued

Now if <hi>Philips</hi> endowing the Church with
many and great possessions, will not proue, that hee
made a Donation of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> to the Pope, it
was a very witlesse conceite in <hi>Marta,</hi> to thinke that
because <hi>Constantine</hi> endowed the Church, therefore
without all doubt hee made this Charter of Donati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

that <hi>Constantine</hi> made this Charter of Donation,

haue reproued in the West none, but <hi>Constantine</hi> for
endowing the Church, nor could he haue reproued
other Westerne succeeding Kings and Princes for
endowing the same, with their lands and possessions.

of Dominion in them, which was then chalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged

the true causes which moued <hi>Wickliffe</hi> to reprooue

Of <hi>Constantine</hi> and <hi>Siluester,</hi> he onely saith, <hi>that they

                  <hi>seducti à diabolo,</hi> seduced by the deuil,
in giuing so excessiuely, after such a manner, and to
such ends as they did. <hi>Wickliffe</hi> in this his very bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
the succeeding Kings and secular Lords, for gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
so much to the Church, demonstrates plainely
that he thought not <hi>Constantine</hi> to haue made this
supposed Donation, nor to haue formerly giuen all
the Westerne Prouinces to the Church. For then
none at all of the Westerne Kings after <hi>Constantine,</hi>
could haue giuen ought to the Church.</p>
               <p>The verie same also shewes the iudgement of the

                  <hi>Wickliffe, for that hee reprooued other succceding Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours

they doe heereby demonstrate their iudgement to
haue beene this, that other Princes and secular

               </p>
               <p>Besides this, there is another answer to this testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.
Either <hi>Litprandus</hi> who was Bishop of <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mona,</hi>
is not the Author of that Treatise, or if he
be, then is he of no truth nor credit in the whole
world. Doe but take a taste of his truth, wit, and
iudgement. This <hi>Litprandus</hi> discribing how base
and sordid the Bishops of the Greeke Church in
those daies were, saith; <hi>I speak</hi>
                  <note n="y" place="margin">Litpr. Crem. loc. cit. nu. 87.</note> 
                  <hi>the truth, and lye
not, throughout Greece, Bishops are not hospital, they sit
alone at a table not couered, themselues doe both sell
and buy their commodities, themselues shut their
doores, themselues carrie their owne meate to table,
ipsi agasones, themselues play the Carters and Muli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
themselues are Capones, I would say Caupones,

So their <hi>Litprandus.</hi> Can any but laugh
at the folly of this fabler, specially considering,

that <hi>Curopaletes</hi> in that very age witnesseth, the

then suffered to professe that Law, vnlesse he had,
I say not a tincture, but a deepe die of the Papacy,

the Donation to haue beene truly

brought by that time, much corne and moulter to
the Popes mill. This being then presupposed to
be true, (which is vt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>erly false) that <hi>Constantine</hi>
made that Donation, <hi>Baldus</hi> and other Lawyers
disputed onely whether this Donation supposing
it to be made, were in law good, and of force, or
not; or how, and in what manner it might be saide
to be good in law. Much like as Schoole Diuines
about the same time disputed, whether Christs
body were really present in the Sacrament by way
of Transmutation, or of Transubstautiation; both
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:9494:163"/>
the one and the other supposing (but not belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
and granting) that which is vtterly vntrue,
that Christ is really and corporally there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.
Or as at this day, the Romanists contend
among themselues, whether the Pope hath direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
or indirectly, power and authoritie to depose
Kings, and take away their Kingdomes; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the Pope in truth, hath no such authoritie any
way at all: as those disputers suppose on both
sides. The verie like did the Lawyers. They
would not, nor was it safe for them to question
whether <hi>Constantine</hi> made that Donation: but
supposing that, (which is vntrue) they onely dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
whether being made, such a Donation was
good and forceable in law or not: or how and by
what right he could giue away so great a part of
the Empire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Baldus</hi> to please the Popes Holinesse, holds
that the Donation is firme, and that after the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
manner that can be wished, but withall after
such a manner, as is most vnlikely, and can neuer
be proued. First, by any Imperiall, any humane
authoritie, or law, <hi>Baldus</hi> professeth plainly, that
according to the determination of the ancient
Lawyers, <hi>Constantine</hi> could not make that Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
nor could it be of force, to passe away his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall
right. Constantine <hi>or other Emperours
may passe away,</hi> saith he<note n="n" place="margin">Bald. in Prooem. de Feudis. nu. 32. 33.</note>, <hi>the vse, profit, or commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie

to thinke that any <hi>Emperour would thus mutilate
the Empire is, as Baldus</hi> there addes, <hi>species fatuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi>
a point of folly. Seeing then as <hi>Baldus</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth,
neither the Imperiall right and royaltie
can possibly be passed away, nor the vse, profit,
and commoditie of so great a part of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
can by any humane law be giuen or granted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
how, or by what meanes shall this Donation bee

                  <hi>Baldus</hi> goes a note farre beyond
<hi>Ela,</hi> and tels vs, <hi>That this Donation</hi> (supposing it
was made by <hi>Constantine) potius fuit diuinitatis,
quam humanitatis,</hi> was an Act of God, rather then
of Man: and that it <hi>proceeded a fide catholica,</hi> from
the Catholike faith, not from any Imperiall Law.
Let either <hi>Marta,</hi> or <hi>Baldus,</hi> or any other proue,
that God either by himselfe, or by any Diuine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation,
or any other way known to the Church,
commaunded <hi>Constantine</hi> to make this Edict, and
we will most willingly assent vnto it, euen <hi>fide ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholica.</hi>
Till they proue this, (which they are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
able to doe) both <hi>Baldus</hi> must bee held for a
base flattering parasite of the Pope in this matter,
and <hi>Marta</hi> for a trifling disputer, who from an
vntrue supposall of <hi>Baldus,</hi> and his vntrue colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
vpon that supposall, striues to proue an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
assertion of the veritie and validitie of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantines</hi>

to which purpose he saith, <hi>vere credo,</hi> I

to preiudice the Empire, or the Emperours successour.</hi>
The second is a <hi>Memorandum,</hi> touching that fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
which he borrowed of <hi>Baldus,</hi> that this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
proceeded from God. <hi>Albericus</hi> tels vs,
that <hi>himselfe heard some great men say, and that it
is recorded also in authenticis scripturis,</hi> in very
credible writings, that <hi>when this Donation was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
and accepted</hi> (which certainly was neuer in

<hi>there was then a voyce heard from heauen, saying;
Hodie seminatum est venenum aspidum in Ecclesia
Dei,</hi> This day is the poison of Aspes powred into
the Church. A pregnant euidence that God
commaunded not <hi>Constantine,</hi> nor any else, to
make any such Donation: for God doth powre
grace, and not poison into his Church. The third
is a caueat for their Church, not to be too inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
vpon this Donation. <hi>I haue heard,</hi> saith hee,
<hi>of men worthy to be credited, that in the time of Pope

               <p>In the last place, to make vp the number of

besides sundrie authorities, by many effectuall
reasons, shewes that <hi>Constantine</hi> made no such
Donation. One is, <hi>For that by the consent of</hi> Euse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius
<hi>and all Historians,</hi> Constantine <hi>in his last will
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:9494:169"/>
and Testament diuided the Empire to his owne sonnes,
and gaue</hi> Italy <hi>and other places, (which are saide to
be giuen to the Pope) to one of them; quod profecto
non fecisset,</hi> which truly hee would neuer haue
done, <hi>had he formerly giuen the same to</hi> Syluester.
Another reason is this, <hi>Because neither</hi> Damasus,
<hi>nor Historians, either Greeke or Latine, who haue writ
the Acts of</hi> Constantine, <hi>vllam de hac refecere men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem:</hi>
none of them haue made any mention
of this Donation; <hi>Procul dubio non omissuri,</hi> who
without all doubt, would not haue omitted it, <hi>if
either it had beene made, or if they had knowne that it
had beene made, whereof,</hi> saith he, <hi>they could not
haue beene ignorant, seeing they so diligently writ all
the Acts which concerned the Church in</hi> Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines
<hi>time.</hi> A third reason he addes, <hi>Because it is
certaine by the consent of all Writers, that the Popes
for foure hundred yeares after</hi> Syluester <hi>and</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine,
<hi>did not vse that Donation, nor had the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
iurisdiction of Rome.</hi> Thus he.</p>
               <p>By this now it appeares, how vainely <hi>Marta</hi>

Those who among them are most fauourable on
his side, presupposing the truth thereof (which
neither he nor they can euer proue) vpon that
false supposall, striue to maintaine it to be <hi>de iure,</hi>
of force: but diuers, and some the verie best of
them, denying it to be of any worth, validitie, or
force at all: and vpon supposall that it was made

               <p>I am much ashamed, that Doctor <hi>Marta,</hi> euen

ignorance: was there no way to impare
the Empire, but by making this Charter? What
if by his diuiding the Empire into three parts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong

it? Seeing in such causes those sayings seeme es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially

many the like. What if <hi>Constantine</hi> gaue away
some Citties, Forts or Castles, standing vpon the

Churches, hee bestowed so much of the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes,
as that the want thereof seemed to some

               <p>Againe, see what a godly and religious mind
<hi>Marta</hi> beares to the Christian Faith. Hee will
proue by the Ciuill Law, that Christian Religion,

the Constitution of Saint</hi> Constantine, <hi>who by the

the other reading of</hi> minuit, <hi>is reiected by</hi> Castrinsis
<hi>as false, &amp; ita est,</hi> and it is false indeede, saith hee.
Besides other reasons, the very words themselues
doe shew this, seeing it had beene verie absurd
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:9494:171"/>
for <hi>Zeno</hi> to say, That <hi>Constantine by the Christian
faith had impared,</hi> but hee might most truly and
iustly say, <hi>That by the Christian faith,</hi> Constantine
<hi>had fortified and strengthened the Kingdome.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
it had beene most absurd in the Emperour
<hi>Zeno,</hi> to call him <hi>Diuum Constantinum,</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine,</hi>
and so commend him (as he doth in that
very place) <hi>for embracing of the Christian faith,</hi> if
he had meant, that by the Christian faith the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
had beene impared. But that which puts this
matter out of all doubt, is another Edict of the
same <hi>Zeno;</hi> called <hi>Henoticum,</hi> which thus begins,
<note n="m" place="margin">Henot. Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non. extat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pud Euag. lib. 3. cap. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>Quoniam procerto scimus Imperium nostrum à sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cera
solum &amp; vera fide tum initiam habuisse, tum
stabilitu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> esse, tum robur, ac praesidium, quod expugna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri
nequit ex ea sumpsisse,</hi> Because we know assured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that our Empire by the true faith, hath both
receiued the beginning, and beene established
and strengthened in such sort, that it cannot bee
expugned. How could <hi>Zeno</hi> say here, that the
true faith did impare his Empire, who certainely
knew it to bee the most inexpugnable prop and
stay to vphold his Empire. It was fit that <hi>Marta</hi>
for defending of a false, counterfeit, and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Donation, should be so farre infatuated, as that
euen in his owne profession he should alledge a
false and foolishly corrupted Text of the Law.</p>
               <p>Next to <hi>Zeno,</hi> the Emperour <hi>Iustinian</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
from whom <hi>Marta</hi>
                  <note n="n" place="margin">Mart. ca. 30 nu. 28.</note> reasoneth in this
manner, <hi>Iustinian saith, that Leo the Emperour post
Constantinum fidei principatum auxit,</hi> did after <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi>
enlarge the Dignitie or Maiestie of the
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:9494:172"/>
Faith; <hi>From which words,</hi> saith Marta, <hi>it is gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that</hi> Iustinian <hi>also knew of the foresaid Donation.</hi>
Doe you not thinke that <hi>Marta</hi> had sent his wit
to <hi>Rome,</hi> when he writ this at <hi>Naples? Iustinians</hi>
words are plainely spoken of the faith; <hi>Marta</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds
them, as meant of the Empire. <hi>Iustinian</hi>
saith, <hi>Constantine</hi> planted and propagated, and
that <hi>Leo</hi> enlarged the faith; <hi>Marta</hi> thence collects
that <hi>Constantine</hi> diminished, and <hi>Leo</hi> encreased
the Empire, whereof there is not any sound at all
in the words of <hi>Iustinian.</hi> To conclude, from
<hi>Leo</hi> his encreasing the faith after <hi>Constantine,</hi> that
<hi>Constantine</hi> therfore impared it, is as if one should
collect, that <hi>Romulus</hi> impared the Cittie of <hi>Rome,</hi>
because <hi>Seruius Tullus</hi> after <hi>Romulus</hi> enlarged it.
And if it were graunted, (which neither is true,
nor any part of the meaning of <hi>Iustinian</hi>) that
<hi>Constantine</hi> had impared the Empire, yet doth it
no way follow which <hi>Marta</hi> collects, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Constantine</hi> gaue away <hi>Rome, Italy,</hi> and all the
Westerne Prouinces to the Pope; or that <hi>Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi>
knew that <hi>Constantine</hi> made this Edict of
Donation. He might impare the Empire an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
waies, and not giue so much away, or not
giue it to the Pope. Besides all this, <hi>Marta</hi> to
make his false Glosse more colourable, clips away
those words of the Text in <hi>Iustinian,</hi> which eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
manifest both the fraud of <hi>Marta,</hi> and the
true meaning of <hi>Iustinian;</hi> these are <hi>Iustinians</hi>
words, <hi>Leo</hi>

which before that Coronation and transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<hi>Charles</hi> had conquered, in respect of them,
their sayings are verie true. For it is most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
that in respect of these, <hi>Charles</hi> obteined
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:9494:183"/>
thereby neither more right vnto them, nor more
power and authoritie ouer them then before hee
had: for hee formerly held them both <hi>iure belli,</hi>
and <hi>iure consensus populi:</hi> and his power which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hee had being <hi>royall and supreame,</hi> was truly
<hi>imperiall:</hi> and so neither for <hi>right vnto,</hi> nor <hi>autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
ouer</hi> those Countries did hee receiue any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease.
In this respect the addition was onely
<hi>Nominall,</hi> as giuing him the highest stile and
name of <hi>Augustus,</hi> or <hi>Emperour,</hi> it was not <hi>Real,</hi> as
giuing him either more <hi>right,</hi> or more <hi>authoritie</hi>
in those Prouinces. <hi>Hier. Balbus</hi> teacheth this, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note n="o" place="margin">Hier. Balb. lib de Coron. pa. 68.</note>;
<hi>All interpreters of the law, vno ore, parique

to the kingly power. And hee further saith; <hi>That
the election alone is of the substance, the rest, to wit;

not so great as at the first it seemes. He supposeth,

                  <hi>making him Emperour of the West, the</hi>

is the onely matter of <hi>realitie</hi> superadded, that he
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:9494:183"/>
could finde. But there must necessarily be added
two restrictions, to make good this assertion. The
one, that he had to those vnconquered Prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
such right onely, and so <hi>farre, as the people of</hi>
Rome <hi>and States of</hi> Italy <hi>could giue vnto him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Now
because there was in them no right at all at this

whatsoeuer power and right they had vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

that in him the right and rightfull power ouer
such Prouinces still resided, till either by <hi>iust con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest</hi>
those Prouinces were taken from him, or else
by <hi>voluntarie cession,</hi> or <hi>other right,</hi> he passed them
away. By reason then of this former defect, that
may be said of the peoples giuing or transferring
to <hi>Charles</hi> the right vnto those Prouinces not as
yet conquered, which was often said<note n="s" place="margin">Nich. 1. Epi, 10 §. Quonia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. &amp; Hadr. 2. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist. 4.</note> of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinations

               <p>The other restriction is, that admitting they

vnto those as yet vnconquered westerne Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces

the words of <hi>Lupoldus</hi> be admitted, that <hi>Charles</hi>
by being made westerne Emperour, receiued an

as the Romanes and Italians could giue the same,
it is not much materiall. But for the maine point
which concernes our present purpose, thus much
is euident and cleerely demonstrated, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
it was that <hi>Charles</hi> receiued by his Imperiall
Coronation, and by being made Emperour at
that time, whether onely a <hi>Nominall Title,</hi> or some
<hi>Reall authoritie</hi> together with it, he both receiued
and held the same, not from <hi>Pope Leo,</hi> nor from
any <hi>Papalauthoritie</hi> and power, but from the ioynt
<hi>consent</hi> and <hi>Decree</hi> of the whole Romane and Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian
State; whose <hi>consent</hi> and <hi>Decree</hi> for giuing
that <hi>Title</hi> of westerne Emperour vnto <hi>Charles,</hi> and
either <hi>confirming</hi> what right he before had vnto
the conquered, or <hi>giuing</hi> a new right vnto some
vnconquered Prouinces iniuriously deteined,
was but signified and <hi>ministerially</hi> expressed by
Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> as the <hi>mouth</hi> and <hi>hand</hi> of that politicall
bodie. The Act it selfe was the Act of the <hi>whole
bodie,</hi> which being the onely <hi>principall</hi> agent,
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:9494:184"/>
translated both the Imperiall Title, and whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
authoritie was with it conferred.</p>
               <p>Neither is is to be doubted at all (or so much
as questioned) but that <hi>Charles</hi> and his successors
had a most <hi>iust aad rightfull Title</hi> vnto Rome, Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and other parts of the westerne Empire, which
he subdued: seeing hee first obtained them <hi>Iure
belli,</hi> and then <hi>Iure consensus populi,</hi> declared vpon
his conquest, first at <hi>Modoetia,</hi> then at <hi>Rome,</hi> in a
verie great assembly of all the States, and after
both these, <hi>An.</hi> 800. confirmed by the vnanimous
<hi>consent and Decree</hi> of the Romane and Italian
States at the time of his Imperiall Coronation.
Which his right<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>iure Gentium</hi> produce a iust Title in the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
it hence ensueth that the <hi>Title</hi> of <hi>Charles</hi> to
Italy, was iust, seeing his conquest thereof was
grounded vpon <hi>a iust cause of warre.</hi> Againe, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the westerne Empire was then vacant both
for the <hi>Title</hi> and <hi>Right,</hi> it hence againe ensueth,
that <hi>Charles</hi> wronged none of their right or pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session,
by taking vpon him Imperiall authoritie
in Rome, Italie, and other subdued Prouinces of
the westerne Empire; the right vnto them being
then <hi>tanquam ius in nubibus,</hi> did descend vpon

of the Church: and his taking of Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne,

the western Empire giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the Pope vnto Charles

the head or cheefe of the Church declared</hi> Charles <hi>to
be Emperour, nomine totius populi Romano Imperio
subiecti,</hi> in the name of all the people subiect to
the Empire, <hi>the people themselues, sic desiderante,</hi>
desiring the same; <hi>the Emperour of</hi> Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<hi>being at that time iustly depriued of the westerne
Empire by the Pope. Dedit ergo populus Christianus
per Pontificem Imperium Carolo;</hi> therefore the
Christian people subiect to the Romane Empire,
gaue the Empire vnto <hi>Charles</hi> by <hi>Leo,</hi> that is by
his hands or ministerie. <hi>Euen as when the succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of heires happens to faile in any Kingdome, the
people of that kingdome, per ordinum eiusdem regni
primores dat regnum nouo regi,</hi> giues that kingdom
to a new King, by the chiefe Peeres and Orders
of the same Kingdome. Thus <hi>Epo;</hi> who cleere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               <p>But what shall bee said to Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the

as that the translation was made either

                  <hi>made,</hi> and <hi>Charles confirmed.</hi>
Let any one peruse that Donation, and hee will
admire the vile and shamelesse dealing of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta:</hi>
For neither in that which is mentioned of
<hi>Charles,</hi> nor in that of <hi>Pipine,</hi> is this Donation of
<hi>Constantine</hi> either confirmed, or so much as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.
I say more, those Donations of <hi>Pipin,</hi> and
<hi>Charles,</hi> doe euidently, and vndeniably conuince
this Donation of <hi>Constantine</hi> to bee a forgerie.
For in those Donations, is particularly expressed
what Citties, Dukedomes, and Territories in Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>Pipine</hi> gaue, and <hi>Charles</hi> confirmed to the
Pope: what was not expressed in their Donati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
neither <hi>Pipin,</hi> nor <hi>Charles</hi> iudged to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long

of diuers Dukedomes, and ports in Italie,
and gaue them to others, as <hi>Sigonius</hi>

<hi>they were; and these afterwards became a

to be forged.</p>

But of this Edict of <hi>Constantine</hi> there is not
so much as one word, from whence the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of it can so much as probably be concluded.
Nay, such particularizing of the Popes Title in
some parts of <hi>Italie,</hi> and some Prouinces or Ilands
in the West, manifestly proues, that hee neuer
meant to confirme all the westerne Prouinces to
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:9494:188"/>
the Pope, which by confirming of this one Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Constantine</hi> he should certainly haue done,
yea, had he confirmed but this one, all the other
Confirmations had beene most idle, needlesse,
and of no effect.</p>
               <p>The last Emperor alledged by <hi>Marta</hi> is <hi>Charles</hi>
the fourth. That he (as <hi>Otho</hi> &amp; <hi>Friderick</hi> had done)
<hi>confirmed the patrimony of S. Peter vnto the Pope, is

some parts onely in Italie to the Pope; being there
expressed,</hi> and his reseruing of Soueraignety to
himselfe, vndeniably proues, that hee thought
not all Italy to belong to the Pope, nor to him
as supreame Lord; and therefore this Donation
of <hi>Constantine,</hi> by which Italie and all the We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterne

sort there are three cyted in <hi>Marta.</hi> The first is
<hi>Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Masseus</hi>
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Apud Mar. ca. cit. nu. 25.</note>, who saith<note n="c" place="margin">Ch. Massae. cron. an, 314<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

either all the Westerne prouinces, or all

speakes not one word. Nay he<note n="d" place="margin">Ibid. an. 336.</note> expresly declares
that <hi>Constantine by his last will and Testament gaue
the Westerne Kingdomes to</hi> Constantine <hi>his sonne,
and the East to</hi> Constantius. So that testimonie
of <hi>Masseus</hi> which <hi>Marta</hi> produceth for proofe of
the Donation, doth indeed directly ouerthrow
the Donation.</p>
               <p>Not much vnlike is <hi>Iohannes Hugo</hi>
                  <note n="e" place="margin">Citatur a Mar. ca. cit. nu. 25.</note>, whom
<hi>Marta</hi> should haue ranked among his Lawyers:
for though in one place he say<note n="f" place="margin">Ioh. Hugo lib. de offic. 4. praelat. seu quadriuio eccles. §. sed sunt.</note>, <hi>that</hi> Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
<hi>granted regall dignitie to the Pope, and subiected
Rome to the Church,</hi> yet a little after he withall
saith (that which cleerly demonstrates the false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
of this supposed Donation.) <hi>That</hi>
                  <note n="g" place="margin">lib. eod. §. est autem im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perator.</note> 
                  <hi>the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
is princeps</hi> and <hi>Dominus totius Mundi,</hi> the
Prince and Lord of the whole world, (then sure
Lord of Italy, Rome, and of the Pope himselfe.)
<hi>That all Prouinces and all nations</hi> (then Italie &amp; the

he can neither hold any inheritance, <hi>nor other</hi>
                  <pb n="360" facs="tcp:9494:192"/>
things which are humane. So by <hi>Hugoes</hi> testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,
the Pope must either ackowledge his subie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to the Emperour, (and so this Donation
to be false) or else renounce all his earthly pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions,
and so all the right which he pretendes
to any part of his lands, either by other title, or
by this Donation.</p>

whose<note n="h" place="margin">Cit. a Mar. loc. cit.</note>, words if <hi>Marta</hi> had duely considered, he
might haue seene directly to oppugne this his
pretended Donation. For he<note n="i" place="margin">Iac. de va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualenti. in Cant. expos. 10.</note> saith, that <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi>
gaue to the Church, Rome with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iacent
patrimonie, and 72 Cities in Italy, with
many other Townes, adding that other Kings by
his example bestowed such like giftes on the
Church. Had <hi>Valentia</hi> thought <hi>Constantine</hi> to
haue made this Donation, hee could not haue
said either that other Westerne Kings had done
the like, or that <hi>Constantine</hi> himselfe had giuen
some few Cities and townes in Italy, seeing by
this Donation, not onely all Italy, but all the
Westerne Kingdomes are giuen to the Pope.</p>
               <p>Besides all those that <hi>Marta</hi> produceth, there
is one passage in <hi>Lud. Viues,</hi> which I could wish
to ouerpasse in silence. But his wordes are so
iniurious and opprobrious to the most religious
<hi>Constantine,</hi> more beseeming <hi>Iulian, Zosimus,</hi> or
some malicious Pagane, then any Christian or

into the Church not as a true Christian, but
bringing With him, wealth, honour, and pride into
the Church. Venit in Christi Domum comitatus
Doabolo,</hi> hee entred into Christs house accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
with the Deuill. <hi>Martyrdome then ceased,
zeale was cooled, pietie declined, and the faith began
to totter. Viues</hi> might as iustly commend <hi>Nero<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Dioclesian, Galerius,</hi> or other persecutors, because
they made many Martyrs, and sharpened the
zeale and pietie of Christians; as dispraise <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi>
for bringing peace, and with it all the
blessings of peace to Gods Church, euen that
free passage of the Gospel throughout the whole
Empire, at which thogh heathens repined, yet the
holy Church, yea the holy Angels of God sung
Halleluiah, and sounded foorth many Hymnes
of praise and thankesgiuing vnto God. Hee
might as iustly declaime against Phisitians, for
freeing of those from sicknesse and affliction, who
in the time<note n="l" place="margin">Hos. 5. 15.</note> of their aduersitie seeke diligently vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God: or write inuectiues against <hi>Moses</hi> and
<hi>Ioshua,</hi> and call their dayes vnhappy, seeing they
brought the Israelites out of the fornace of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,
annd out of the wildernesse, and brought
them to the land of their peace and prosperitie,
a land flowing with milke and hony, where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fat with Gods blessings, they began to kicke
and spurne against the Lord. Was it not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for <hi>Viues</hi> to declaime against <hi>Constantine</hi>
alone, but to condemne also the pietie, faith and
zeale of the whole Catholike Church in those
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:9494:193"/>
happy dayes. Neuer was the faith more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly

If in some Christians that most happie peace

but to the corruption of their owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,

and being luxuriant with prosperity, turnes
his best blessings into a curse vnto them. <hi>Viues</hi>

their owne vprightnesse. But an inexcusable er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
blinded and misled <hi>Viues</hi> in this matter. He
supposed (not without a great blemish to his
iudgment &amp; learning,) <hi>Constantine</hi> to haue made
this excessiue and exorbitant Donation. He had
heard it said that when this Donation was accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Pope, a voyce from heauen had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed:
This day is poyson powred into the

wheras had he but with any diligence ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined
the cause, he might haue easily discerned,
that this Donation was neither giuen nor accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in <hi>Constantines</hi> dayes, and that the poyson of
Antichristian souereigntie, pompe and pride
maintained by this Donation, neuer insected,
nor infested the Church, till the dayes of Pope

               <p>The first is drawen from the Iustice of God,
<hi>who</hi>

                  <hi>being omnipotent would neuer,</hi> or as <hi>Marta</hi>
saith, <hi>could not haue suffered this Edict of Donation,
if it had beene a figment, to haue deceiued and darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the minds of the faithfull, and of the</hi> Romane
<hi>Church euen vnto this day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First <hi>Marta</hi> doth well, to acknowledge their
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:9494:194"/>
                  <hi>Romane Church,</hi> or as Carerius<note n="b" place="margin">Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni donatione<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Orthodoxi &amp; veri Catholici, veramesse fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentur. Car. lib. 2. de potest. Pont. Rom. ca. 21. § Veru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> saith, such <hi>as are
true Catholikes among them to hold this Charter to be
true.</hi> For seeing <hi>Leo</hi> the ninth in his Decretal E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle
hath declared it to be the authenticall wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of <hi>Constantine,</hi> their Church, and all who
are rightly catechised among them, with <hi>Super
hanc Petram,</hi> cannot chuse but hold and beleeue
it, to bee such as the Pope saith it is: heerein
they build vpon that Rocke, which will neuer
faile them. But I trust by this time <hi>Marta</hi> sees,
that herein both their Pope and Church builde
vpon sand, euen on a fond, fabulous, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
Donation. Againe, if <hi>true Catholiques,</hi> yea
and their <hi>Catholike Romane Church,</hi> hold this for
the true Charter of <hi>Constantine,</hi> what must bee
thought of Card. <hi>Cusanus,</hi> of Card. <hi>Baronius,</hi>
of <hi>Iac. Almane,</hi> of <hi>Gretzer,</hi> yea, of <hi>Pope Aeneas
Syluius,</hi> who all condemne and reiect this Edict
for a figment and forgerie? None of these in
<hi>Martaes</hi> iudgement, are of the Romane Church,
nor with <hi>Carcrius</hi> true Catholikes; They all
must now bee cashiered, and blotted out of
the booke of life, rather then this one base
and witlesse forgerie must be forsaken.</p>
               <p>Againe, whereas <hi>Marta</hi> saith, that <hi>God would
not suffer their Church and her Children to bee blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
deceiued, or deluded with this figment,</hi> he should
haue considered that to be most iust with God,
which the Apostle foretelleth, <hi>Because</hi>
                  <note n="c" place="margin">2 Thess. 2. 10. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
not the loue of the truth, therefore shall God send
them strong delusions, that they should beleeue lyes.</hi>
Neither would it seeme strange to <hi>Marta,</hi> (if hee
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:9494:195"/>
were not a meere stranger to the word of God)
that the omnipotent and iust God, should suffer
them and their Church to be so long deluded
with a figment. The iustice and omnipotency of
God winkes at and suffers with long patience
greater abhominations in the Romane Church
then this. The aboundance of their Idolatries
and tyrannies, the Apostacy of the Romane An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist,
and his Antichristian Synagogue, God
seeth and suffereth long; But <hi>tarditatem supplicij
grauitate pensabit, Knowest thou</hi>
                  <note n="d" place="margin">Rom. 2. v. 3. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>not that the long
suffering of God, leadeth thee to repentance? But thou,
after the hardnesse of thine heart, that cannot repent,
heapest vp wrath against the day of wrath, and of the
declaration of the iust iudgement of God.</hi> He suffers
them, as he did the <hi>Amorites</hi>

               <p>A second reason brought by Card. <hi>Albanus,</hi> is
drawne from the truth of God, who by the
mouth of his Prophets, foretold that <hi>Constantine</hi>
should make this very Charter of Donation.
<hi>This grant of</hi> Constantine, saith he<note n="l" place="margin">Hier. Alban. lib. de Donat. Constant. nu. 23.</note>, (and hee

                  <hi>them all, offert se vaticinium illud,</hi> that

I, and what is my people? or what can we promise to
thee O God. All things are thine: but these things

thee. Quis neget hoc in loco concessionem illam Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantint

but that this Donation of <hi>Constantine</hi>

touching the future guift of an Empire? of

nor so much as any coniecture for his propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
prediction of this Donation. But seeing <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banus</hi>
is so delighted with voluntarie expositions
of the Scriptures, he may finde 1000. farre more

Another faire allusion to those Prophets of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist,

Popes most vile and iniurious persons, who doe
not onely perswade, but enforce Emperours to
sweare to maintaine and defend a false, forged,
and Chimericall Charter, and to make God a
witnesse of that as a truth, which hath no realitie
nor truth at all in it. It may againe be answered,
that if this oath be offered to Emperors at their
coronation, they might, and still may vpon iust
warrant refuse to take the same: not onely, for
that it is impious &amp; blasphemous for any (much
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:9494:197"/>
more for an Emperour) to sweare that they will
maintain that as a true &amp; real Charter of <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi>
which was neuer made by him: but because
it is most preiudicial also to their owne Imperial
rights and royall dignities. And they may more
safely refuse to take it, seeing the Pope vpon such
their iust refusal, may not rightly deny the crown
vnto them. <hi>Mich. Coccinius</hi> saith<note n="s" place="margin">Mich. Cocci. lib. de Imper. translat. prope finem.</note> very rightly in

chosen Emperour, although he doe not, or will

               </p>
               <p>But say the Pope doe refuse and deny to

what damage, hurt, or inconuenience doth insue

For, <hi>ex ipsa electione,</hi> saith he<note n="t" place="margin">Ibid. fol. praeced.</note>, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue

authoritie of the whole Romane State; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of them all being virtually included in those
Electors, into whom they transferred their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of electing an Emperour. And <hi>seeing before
they transferred this power, or while they reteined it
in themselues, presently vpon their election, the party
elected, had full Imperiall authoritie, without expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
either the examination, or approbation of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi>
the very same power also must presently
vpon the election be in the partie elected by
those, vnto whom they haue transferred their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of electing; and seeing <hi>neither</hi> Constantine,

the forenamed Emperors without it haue done.</p>
               <p>The same <hi>Coccinius</hi> giues yet another reason,
why the Pope may not deny the Imperiall
Crowne, though the elected Emperour refuse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
oath of feoltie, or homage, (and such is that
whereby they sweare to defend this Donation of
<hi>Constantine</hi>) offered to him by the Pope. For
<hi>the Pope</hi> saith he<note n="u" place="margin">Ibid.</note>, <hi>can doe nothing in praeiudicium

but by such an oath of feoltie or homage hee
should preiudice the Emperor, who <hi>by meanes of
this oath should become the Popes vassall, and hold his
Empire from him. But the Emperor holds his Empire

it were admitted, that both <hi>Eugenius</hi> and <hi>Sigis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund</hi>
intended this verie Charter of Donation.
But that neither in this promise, nor in those
formes of oaths set downe by <hi>Hildebrand</hi> and
<hi>Clement</hi> the fift, that in none of them the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
pretended from <hi>Constantine</hi> is intended, there
are three euident reasons. First, which of all the
Emperours that euer tooke this oath, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
Rome, Italy, Spaine, France, Germany,
and all the Westerne Prouinces to belong, and
that also as to the supreame Lord, to the Pope?
as by this Charter it is said they doe. For the
Kingdome of France, to say nothing of many
other westerne Kingdomes, seeing Pope <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centius</hi>
the third professeth<note n="g" place="margin">Innoc. 3. cap. per vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabilem, qui filij sint legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi. lib. 4. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretal. tit. 17.</note>, <hi>That the King there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,

acknowledgeth none to be his superiour in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
matters, it is incredible that either the
Popes would require, or any Emperors, though
required by the Pope, would euer take a solemne
oath and sweare, that the Pope were a superiour
temporal Lord in that kingdome to him. Nay, if
Emperours sweare to maintaine that the Pope
was and ought to be the supreame Monarch in
Rome, Italy, and all other Westerne Prouinces,
how doth their owne <hi>Hier. Balbus</hi> say, and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently

                  <pb n="377" facs="tcp:9494:200"/>
or <hi>Imola,</hi> or any other shew, by faire and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
recordes, that all Emperours since the
time of <hi>Clement</hi> the fifth, or <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
the Pope to be the <hi>supreame Monarch in all
the Westerne prouinces;</hi> or else let them esteeme it
no other then a slander of Imperial Maiesty, and
an imputation of periurie to al Emperours since
that time, to say, that they sweare to maintaine
the Charter of <hi>Constantines</hi> Donation. And yet
I say nothing all this time of that which <hi>Albericus</hi>
rightly obserues<note n="q" place="margin">Alberi. in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. verbo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectio Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratoris.</note>, that this Chapter <hi>Romani</hi> is
another of those Decretals which are not <hi>iuri
consonae,</hi> and which were made against the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of the Empire.</p>
               <p>A second reason is taken from the confession
of <hi>Gretzer,</hi> who expresly professeth, that in the
Chap. <hi>Romani,</hi> there is no mention of this Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
or Edict at all, <hi>There is nothing</hi> saith he<note n="r" place="margin">Grets. Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen 2. ad lib. de munif. princ. pa. 114. §. In Epilogo.</note>, <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly

as this Charter speakes of, to wit, Rome,
Italy and all the Westerne prouinces. So they
might both take and obserue that oath, and yet
withall hold this Donation to be a forgerie.</p>
               <p>The last reason is, that other oath which <hi>Otho</hi>

Is Rome and Italie no part of the Empire. Can
they againe sweare, that the Pope ought to bee
Supreame Monarch in all those, and yet
preserue or keepe inuiolate the Honour of their
Imperial Crowne? Is not <hi>Soueraigntie</hi>

wisedome of Emperours can admit both these,
being directly repugnant, and contradicting
oaths the one to the other? Seeing it is certaine
that <hi>Constantine</hi> granted Priuiledges and Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to the Church, they may well with their
former oath, sweare to maintaine those, so farre as
they are or shall be made certainely knowen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto
them: but to sweare that they will main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
this pretended Charter of <hi>Constantines</hi>
Donation, and withall sweare to preserue the
rights and roialties of their Empire, without o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
and euident periurie they cannot. Nay I say
more, that seeing they are by vertue of this Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall
oath bound to maintaine both the <hi>Rights</hi>
&amp; <hi>Roialties</hi> of their Empire, they are euen thereby
and by that sacred oath, bound not only to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
and abolish for euer this pretended Charter
of <hi>Constantine,</hi> which is most preiudiciall both to
their <hi>Rights</hi> and <hi>Royalties:</hi> but further also, to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
and striue to recouer both their <hi>Imperiall
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:9494:201"/>
Soueraigntie in Rome and Italy,</hi> and whatsoeuer
<hi>Lands, Citties, or Territories</hi> the Pope vsurpeth,
and for which euident and certain proofe cannot
be shewed, that by iust and legall conueiance
they haue bene either for the <hi>vsus fructus</hi> giuen,
or otherwise passed vnto the Pope. But hauing
spoken of this point before, I will not now fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
insist vpon it.</p>
               <p>You haue now seene, whatsoeuer of any worth
or weight, either <hi>Marta, Steuchus, Albanus, Epo,
Rufus,</hi> or others of that rancke, could finde to
gaine any credit or countenance to this Donati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Constantine.</hi> All which being now fully
refuted, you doe see how desperate their cause
is, which they so eagerly and pertinaciously
striue to support, by such false, forged, and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendary
writings. But that which now after
the full refuting of this Donation, I would
specially obserue, is this: That seeing by this
Charter and Donation of <hi>Constantine,</hi> the Popes
neither haue, nor can haue any right or iust title,
either to Rome, Italie, or any Citties which
therein they possesse; and seeing againe Card.
<hi>Albanus</hi> tels<note n="z" place="margin">Hier. Alb. lib. de Donat. Const. nu. 5.</note> vs, <hi>That the Popes nullum alium suae
possessionis titulum attulerunt,</hi> haue brought or
produced (they would no doubt if they could) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other Title, but onely this grant and Charter
of <hi>Constantines</hi> Donation, it hereupon cleerely
ensueth, that the Popes neither now haue, nor
euer had any right or iust title, either to Rome
and Italie, or to those Citties and large Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories
which they possesse therein.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="380" facs="tcp:9494:202"/>
Lastly for <hi>Marta,</hi> who hath of all most labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in pleading for defence of this base and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
forgerie, though there can no more be said
for excuse of him, then was said for <hi>Faustus</hi> the
<hi>Manichee, that the badnesse of his cause enforced him
to plead so badly,</hi> yet may it, and will it still iustly
be answered, as S. <hi>Austen</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">August. lib. 16. cont. Fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stum. ca. 26.</note> did to <hi>Faustus;</hi> I grant

               <p>But for his alledging so many false, counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:9494:214"/>
if they be lazy, mad or troublesome, the Shepheard
must presently remoue them, and put them from their
office. This doth reason teach, this doth the Councell
of</hi> Lateran <hi>decree.</hi> Againe, <hi>Christian kings are
sheepe, are rammes, are wolues, and are dogges.
Whence it is that the Pope carrieth himselfe in a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
manner towards them. As they are sheepe, if
they be scabby, he may put them out of the fold: as
they are rammes, if they be troublesome, and push

they are Wolues, he may driue them away; Quate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus

to the whole folde of Asses, <hi>that is, to the whole

<hi>let vs honour the Romane Church, and though
the yoake which the Pope imposeth be such as we can
scarcely beare, yet let vs with deuotion endure
the same. Ex quibus verbis,</hi> saith Scioppius, <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
Issachar agnoscas, de quo Genes. chap. 49.
Issachar asinus fortis.</hi> By these words of Charles,
you may see that he was a verie right Issachar, of
whom it is said, Issachar is a strong asse. Is not
this now think you, a fine peece of Catholike Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie,
to account and call the whole Catholike
Church a fould of asses, all Catholike Kings asses
with bels, all other lay persons, asses without bels;
none but Bishops to be Men and Muliters, and the
Pope the chiefe Muliter and driuer of all the
Asses. So shall the man be honoured, whom the
Pope will honour. The more zealous and deuout
one is in obeying him, and embracing his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:9494:215"/>
the greater Asse they account and call him.
Thus haue they not onely stript Emperours and
Kings of their Royalties and Imperiall rights, but
of their goods, lands, and possessions, yea of their
honours also; and in the end, for suffring all these
indignities at the Popes hand, they account them
to be verie Asses.</p>
               <p>Now though by this, they doe euidently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate
the Donation of <hi>Constantine,</hi> of which
we haue hitherto entreated, to be of no force at
all, seeing neither he, nor <hi>Pipin,</hi> nor <hi>Charles,</hi> nor
any other could giue ought to the Pope; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all the claime which they pretend, to any
kingdomes, territories, or possessions, by such Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
are but a meere mockage of the World;
yet because they doe hereby chalenge an higher,
a better, and far more ample title, to all that is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
by those Emperours to haue been giuen,
euen such, that in stead of praysing their munifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
for that which they gaue, imputes open in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iustice,
tyrannie, and sacriledge to them, for that
they gaue not all; let me entreat a litle of this
point also, and cleere the honour not only of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine,</hi>
but of all other Kings and Princes, (for
this concernes them all) whom by this doctrine
they make meere intruders and vsurpers of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
they doe not as tenants at will, hold of the
Pope. A large argument I confesse, and which
would require whole volumes, but purposing
<hi>summa sequi fastigia rerum,</hi> I will only speake at
this time of these three points. First, <hi>whether
Christ as Mediator and Redeemer of mankind, had
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:9494:216"/>
such a soueraigne and direct temporall Monarchy, as
for his vicares they now claime from him;</hi> which is
indeed the first and the maine foundation of their
papall Monarchy. Secondly, <hi>Whether Christ left
and committed any such temporall Monarchy to
Peter,</hi> which is their second foundation. Thirdly,
<hi>Whether this Monarchicall Empire now claymed for
the Pope, be not condemned by the iudgement of
holy and learned men in all ages and successions of
the Church.</hi>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Or the first, whether Christ was
such a Temporall King or no,
we must consider, that there is a
threefold Kingdome of Christ
mentioned &amp; taught in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Scripture. The first is <hi>his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Power or Excellencie,</hi> whereby he being
God, is the supreame Lord of all things; for <hi>The
earth</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Psal. 24: 1.</note> 
                  <hi>is the Lords and all that is therein.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
which Kingdome, foure things are cleare
and certaine. First, this Kingdome belongs to
Christ neither by vertue of his <hi>death,</hi> nor of his
<hi>resurrection,</hi> but <hi>by reason of the inseparable vnion
of the manhood to the Godhead in Christ,</hi> by which
he being that one person, which is both God and
man, from the verie first instant of his conception
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:9494:216"/>
that man being verie God, hath the same power
and Kingdome with God. And as himselfe saith<note n="b" place="margin">Iohn 10. 30</note> 
                  <hi>I and my Father are one,</hi> so is this Kingdome of
God and Christs, both one. Of this Kingdome of
Christ, are those words to be vnderstood, <hi>All</hi>
                  <note n="c" place="margin">Math. 28. 28</note>
                  <hi>power is giuen to me, both in heauen, and in earth:</hi>
And that, <hi>He</hi>
                  <note n="d" place="margin">Heb. 1. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>hath made him heire of all things;</hi>
And that, <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e Father</hi>
                  <note n="e" place="margin">Ioh. 13. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>hath giuen all things into

                  <note n="f" place="margin">Ioh. 17. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>tua mea sunt,</hi> all
that is thine, belongs also to me, and is mine.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this Kingdome of Christ, is <hi>Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable
vnto any meere creature whatsoeuer,</hi> for it
is grounded on the <hi>Infinitie of Gods power,</hi> who as
by his infinite power, he made all things of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
so by the same infinite power, he ruleth, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth,
and disposeth of all things. And because
no creature is capable of that <hi>Infinitie of power,</hi>
neither is any, capable of that vniuersall King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Excellencie, whith ariseth from the <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie</hi>
of diuine power. And as <hi>Infinitie of nature</hi>
cannot be transferred vnto any creature, so nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can Infinitie of power be giuen or transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
vnto it, but this is, and resides onely in that
<hi>Infinite Essence of God,</hi> nor can it agree to any, but
to that person, which is truly God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this <hi>supereminent and vniuersall King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Christ, doth neither abolish, nor hinder, but
establish and ratifie all other particular and secular
kingdomes.</hi> For as it was said,<note n="g" place="margin">Daniel 2. 37</note> before Christs
incarnation, to Nebuchadnezer; <hi>The God of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
hath giuen thee a kingdome,</hi> so Christ also after
his incarnation, both approues and confirmes the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:9494:217"/>
kingdome of Cesar, saying,<note n="h" place="margin">Mat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 22. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>Giue vnto Cesar, the
things that are Cesars.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>this kingdome of Christ is not tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
or secular, but farre more eminent then any, yea
then all secular kingdomes in the whole world.</hi> Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
kingdomes are temporall, and mutable; this
eternall, and immutable: they administred by tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
persons, by temporall meanes, by temporall
counsels: by temporall lawes, by temporall wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons,
by temporall punishments: This kingdome
is administred by the onely eternall God, by his
eternall, omnipotent, and immutable will, wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
counsell, and prouidence; either with
meanes, or without meanes, or contrarie to
meanes, as it seemeth best to him; administred
also, so vnresistably, that nothing can resist the
power of this kingdome, for nothing can come to
passe without the prouidence and will of God,
<hi>either</hi>

               <p>The second kingdome of Christ is of <hi>Grace;</hi>
and the third is of <hi>Glory:</hi> Or if any like to call
them both but one kingdome, it is not amisse; that

possessors of that heauenly inheritance.</p>
               <p>Of both these Kingdomes there may two
things be obserued. The former, that they are
in a speciall manner called <hi>the kingdomes of Christ.</hi>
For though they be the kingdomes also of the
<hi>Father,</hi> and the blessed <hi>Spirit,</hi> because <hi>Faith</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Gal. 5. 22. &amp; 1 Cor. 12. 11.</note> and

                  <hi>Grace</hi> are wrought in the hearts of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
by his <hi>Spirit:</hi> and, <hi>God giueth both grace</hi>
                  <note n="d" place="margin">Psal. 84. 11.</note>
                  <hi>and glory;</hi> yet because the holy <hi>Spirit</hi> worketh
that grace, and the <hi>Father</hi> giueth this Kingdome,
for the <hi>mediation and merit</hi>
                  <note n="e" place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 18. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>of Christ,</hi> therefore
are they by a certaine p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>erogatiue, saide to bee
<hi>Christs,</hi> for that he purchased and merited by the
infinite and inestimable price of his blood, and
bloody death, (which was sufficient to haue ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somed
and freed all,) that both <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi>
should be giuen to whomsoeuer himselfe would;
and that is to <hi>All</hi> and <hi>Onely</hi> to the beleeuers in
him, to <hi>All</hi> and <hi>Onely</hi> the elect<note n="f" place="margin">Eph. 1. 4.</note> in Christ.</p>
               <p>The other is, that <hi>neither of these kingdomes is, or
can, with any colour of reason, be accounted a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
or terrene kingdome.</hi> Both of them in their
nature spirituall: The former is wrought by Gods
<hi>Diuine Spirit,</hi> and in the <hi>Spirits</hi> of the Elect, and
that by a <hi>spirituall</hi> manner of working; The la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is for place, not terrene but <hi>celestiall;</hi> for time,
not temporall, but <hi>eternall;</hi> and for condition, not
subiect to any disturbance or change, as tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
kingdomes are; but setled in an <hi>vnchangeable
state</hi> of most happy tranquillity.</p>
               <p>Now seeing in the holy Scripture there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
set downe nor mentioned any other kingdom
of Christ, but one of these three, which wee haue
now described; and seeing it is cleare and certaine,
that none of these three is a temporall Kingdome,
but the first, onely <hi>diuine,</hi> the second onely <hi>spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall,</hi>
the third onely <hi>celestiall;</hi> it remaines cleere
and euident, that <hi>Christ Iesus neither euer was a
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:9494:218"/>
temporall King,</hi> such as are the secular Princes and
Monarches here vpon earth; <hi>neither euer, either
had such a Kingdome, or executed and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
the Offices of such a King.</hi> And it were easie
to demonstrate (if it were worth the labour) that
those Romanists who pretend Christ to haue had
a temporall Kingdome, doe either ignorantly, (<hi>as
Franc. Bozius</hi>) or Atheistically (as that <hi>Scurra Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oppus,</hi>)
or impiously, (as the rest) peruert the holy
Scriptures to their owne vaine and phantasticall
conceits.</p>
               <p>Let vs heare our Sauiour himselfe witnessing
this truth. When Pilate demanded of him, if hee
were a King, he answered<note n="f" place="margin">Ioh. 18. 36.</note>, <hi>My Kingdome is
not of this world.</hi> He professeth himselfe to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
a <hi>King,</hi> and to haue a <hi>kingdome;</hi> a Kingdome
of <hi>Excellency and power,</hi> as he is God; a Kingdome
both of <hi>Grace and Glory,</hi> as he is the mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
God and Man: but for any <hi>temporal and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene
Kingdom,</hi> such as Pilate meant, he vtterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
that he was such a <hi>king,</hi> or had such a <hi>kingdom.</hi>
And he giues a plaine reason thereof, for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
<hi>my seruants would surely fight:</hi> As if hee had
said; Had God sent me to be a temporall King, I
would haue come with temporall pompe, with a
temporall guard, and temporall weapons to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
my right, &amp; reuenge my wrongs; &amp; then nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
my self nor my seruants wold put vp all these
indignities: but because my <hi>kingdom</hi> is not <hi>terrene,</hi>
because I come to serue others &amp; not to be serued
with such <hi>Princely seruice,</hi> by this my carriage O
<hi>Pilate,</hi> thou maist know, that my Kingdome is not
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:9494:219"/>
of this world, not a <hi>temporall or terrene kingdome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His facts declare the same, when the <hi>Iewes</hi>
                  <note n="g" place="margin">Ioh. 6. 15.</note>
                  <hi>had taken him to make him a temporall king, hee fled
away,</hi> refusing such a Kingdome, euen when it was
offered vnto him. When they <hi>came, desiring</hi>
                  <note n="h" place="margin">Luc. 12. 13.</note>
                  <hi>him to diuide the inheritance betweene two brethren,
he refused to doe it, saying, Man who made mee a
Iudge betweene you?</hi> As if he had said, the ordering
of such temporall affaires, belongs to temporall
Kings and their subordinate Iudges or Officers,
God hath giuen that authority to them; Seeing
I neither by Gods appointment, nor by delegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from <hi>Cesar,</hi> haue that temporall authority, it
belongs not to me to intermeddle with those tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall

being the Son of God, to whom all Kingdomes

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:9494:219"/>
not onely <hi>de facto,</hi> but <hi>de debito. For seeing,</hi> say
they, <hi>Christ said not, ne scandalizentur, but, ne scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalizemus,</hi>
lest we giue an offence vnto them; <hi>if
Christ</hi> (who had taken vpon him that state of
humility, &amp; who was not yet known to the world
to be God) <hi>had denyed tribute vnto Cesar, Actiui
scandali rationem habuisset,</hi> he had giuen offence
vnto them, <hi>causing them to thinke that he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned
the Law of God.</hi> To which purpose <hi>Ierome</hi>
saith<note n="o" place="margin">Hier. com. in 17. Math.</note>, <hi>Christ as being the Kings sonne, was not

he was bound to fulfill all iustice; one part
of which, was subiection and paying tribute to
<hi>Cesar.</hi> So Christ both by his words, and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
witnessed his kingdome not to haue beene
<hi>temporall,</hi> while he was here vpon earth, neither
did he challe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge, or euer vse the authority of <hi>a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall

but establishing that authority which God had

<hi>Gabriell</hi> of a <hi>spirituall and eternall kingdome,</hi> and
such Christ indeed had. But omitting all the rest,
I will adde three or foure testimonies of their
owne learned writers testifying this.</p>
               <p>The first is <hi>Card. Bellarm.</hi> who thus writes<note n="b" place="margin">B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Christ as he was man, while he liued vpon earth, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                  <hi>did hee euer exercise any such temporall
power; and therefore it had beene in vaine for him to
haue had it, seeing that power is in vaine which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
brought into act.</hi> And whereas some pretend,
that when Christ whipped the buyers and sellers
out of the temple, he did therin vse his kingly, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral,

                  <hi>that Christ did that, not by any secular or kingly

                  <hi>such a temporall kingdome
&amp; secular power, was neither necessary nor expedient
for Christ, but altogether superfluous &amp; vnprofitable
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:9494:220"/>
for him.</hi> Againe, <hi>That Christ,</hi> saith he<note n="f" place="margin">Recognit. lib. 5. de Rom. Pont. c. 4. p. 33.</note>, <hi>had an
vniuersall kingdome of power, as hee was God, a
spirituall kingdome of grace, and a third which is an
eternall kingdome of glorie, I do reade; but that he
had a fourth kingdome which is properly temporall,
such as other Kings here vpon earth haue, I find not
either in the Scriptures, or in the Fathers: Nay, I
esteeme such a kingdome to be contrarie to the pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of Christ, mentioned in the Scriptures, and to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor
of the error of the Iewes, &amp; Heretikes.</hi> Again<note n="g" place="margin">Lib. eod. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cog. pa. 35</note>
                  <hi>I haue read the books of the Fathers, with what dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
I could, and I haue often read them to denie
Christ to haue had a temporall or terrene kingdome,
but I haue no where read them to affirme that he had
such a kingdome,</hi> Thus Bellarmine.</p>
               <p>The next is <hi>Cornelius Iansenius,</hi> one of their
learnedest and best expositors of the Gospell.

sensible, or terrene, but because it was figured
by the kingdome of Dauid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third is <hi>Adam Sasbout,</hi> who vpon those

text of Scripture that he lights vpon. That
<hi>Adam,</hi> and in him all mankind, by their voluntarie
transgression, forfeited vnto God their right both
to the celestiall kingdome, and to all the blessings
of this life, which God had promised vnto them;
and so made themselues by the iust iudgement of
God, seruants both to sinne and satan: That Christ
to redeeme mankind out of this miserable serui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
payd vnto God that inestimable price of his
owne bloodie death and passion; that by his most
pretious death on the Crosse, he purchased and
merited at Gods hands, first, remission of sinnes,
and then both grace in this life, and an eternall
Kingdome in the life to come for all his elect;
These, the Scriptures euidently teach, the Fathers
professe, and the whole Church of God euer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued.
But that <hi>Adam</hi> sold either the kingdomes
of earth or of heauen to the diuel, or that Christ
payd any price to the diuel, to redeeme either the
one kingdome or the other at his hands (who was
in truth nothing else, but the Iaylour or executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Gods wrath,) or that Christ bought at all
any temporall kingdome, either of God or the
diuel, to bestow it on the Pope, is such diuinitie as
is fit to be preached onely to a fold of Asses, and
preached onely by him, who professeth himselfe
(and we enuy not that so iust a title should be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
vnto him) to be an Asse, and one of no small
vnderstanding in that fold of Asses. Now seeing
this, which is the best and fairest ground or title
that he could find either for <hi>Christs,</hi> or the <hi>Popes
temporall kingdome,</hi> is prophane, blasphemous, and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:9494:222"/>
Atheisticall, you may well thinke, that the rest of
their building which relies on this, must needs
be sutable vnto it; that is, not onely <hi>impious</hi> and
<hi>blasphemous,</hi> but such as sets open a wide gappe to
Atheisme, and most contemptuous prophaning
of the holy Scriptures, and the most Sacred

               <p>Our Sauiour teacheth this fully, <hi>Math</hi> 20. and
<hi>Luke</hi> 22. When Iames and Iohn dreaming of a
temporall kingdome which Christ should haue,
desired<note n="d" place="margin">Ipsi dicun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur hoc petijsse Mar. 10. 35. sed illam petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem ipsorum mater Christo proposuit, ideo ipsa dicitur pro eis hoc petijsse Math. 20. 20.</note> and made the motion by meanes of

the left hand in his Kingdome,</hi> That is, to haue tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
authoritie, power, and dignitie, next vnto
Christ himselfe; he correcting this their erronious,
ambitious, and vnfitting desire, said to them, and to
all his Apostles, and in them to all their Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours,
<hi>The Kings of the Gentiles, dominantur cis</hi>
haue secular and coactiue dominion ouer them,
(that is, ouer the Gentiles and people subiect vnto
their authoritie) <hi>and they that are great among

them to do what they command:) <hi>vos autem
non sic, But it shall not be so with you; but whosoeuer
will be great among you, let him be your minister

to be ministred vnto, but to minister.</hi> In which
words, as S. Bernard<note n="e" place="margin">Bern. li. 2. de Cons. ad. Eug.</note> rightly obserues, is set
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:9494:223"/>
downe, <hi>forma Apostolica,</hi> the verie forme of the
Apostolicall authoritie giuen vnto them and their
successours by Christ, and what from Christ they
ought to challenge. And first, our Sauiour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
what he would not giue vnto them; to
wit, not any <hi>temporall, ciuill,</hi> or <hi>coactiue</hi> authoritie,
such as the Kings of the Gentiles exercised, and
as they desired him to giue vnto them; and then,
what he would giue vnto them, to wit, authoritie
of <hi>Ecclesiasticall ministration,</hi> and <hi>seruice,</hi> which
himselfe exercised.</p>
               <p>That they desired <hi>secular,</hi> and <hi>coactiue</hi> autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
such as is vsed in temporall kingdomes, and
desired Christ to giue this vnto them, is euident
by their owne words, <hi>Grant that we may sit</hi> (as
secular Iudges and Magistrates) <hi>the one at thy
right, the other at thy left hand</hi> (that is, in high
dignitie and place, euen next to thy selfe) <hi>in thy
Kingdome,</hi> which they thought<note n="f" place="margin">Regnu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sti huius vitae ac saeculare fore opinabantur, Chrys. in cap. 20 Math. Hom. 66</note> should be a
temporall Kingdome. Christ not onely checketh
their ambition, and denies to grant this vnto
them, but giues a manifest reason of his deniall
thereof: <hi>The Kings of the Gentiles</hi> (those he
names, because at that time there were no other
Kings in the world) haue this <hi>temporall</hi> and <hi>coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue
dominion</hi> which you desire of me, and they,
partly by themselues, partly by their deputies and
subordinate officers, exercise the same. To giue
this, belongs to them, and not to me. I haue it not
my selfe, and therefore I cannot giue it to you,
nor depute you vnto such rule. I came not to rule
temporally, but to serue; and that which I, as your
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:9494:224"/>
Messias, and ruler of my Church, doe giue vnto
you, is, to serue as my selfe serue, not to rule in
temporall sort, as I doe not so rule. If you would
haue this, you must seeke it of the Kings of the
Gentiles; they onely at this time, haue this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
vnder God, originally in themselues, they only
are to depute others to haue it vnder them, and
from them. But if Kings should thinke it conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
to conferre this subordinate secular and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actiue
authoritie vpon them, whether then they
should accept it or no, of that our Sauiour speakes
not one word. He onely denies that <hi>himselfe</hi> will
grant that secular power, which they desired <hi>him</hi>
to giue vnto them. But seeing our Sauiour doth
not prohibit it, and the Church euer since Kings
embraced Christianitie, hath allowed it, most

Christ in such such, <hi>as if Christ had denyed not sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply

which they collect from the compound

import (as they suppose) vniust, cruell, and tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call

cruelty and tyranny in all, and especially in his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
there is no doubt; but that hee meant to

that in this place, they ought not to be taken in

the English, in S. <hi>Ierome,</hi> the former word is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly

dominion and rule, and the latter, by <hi>exercising
authority;</hi> not one translating them, <hi>tyrannicè domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nari,
or saeuam ac crudelem authoritatem exercere:</hi>
and which against those, with whom we deale, is
of most force, their vulgar Latine edition which

they may nullo praetextu, by no colour depart;</hi> This, I
say, hath simply <hi>dominantur eorum &amp; potestatem

though with some incongruity<note n="m" place="margin">Nam, eoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, legitur pro, earum.</note> of Latine, and
against Grammar.</p>
               <p>Againe our Sauiour in S. <hi>Luke</hi>

                  </gap>, which out of question, signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
<hi>dominantur.</hi> Whereby it is certaine, that the
compound verbe in S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> doth signifie the
same also: or if it doe not, yet his words in Saint
<hi>Luke</hi> simply denie dominion to bee giuen vnto
them. <hi>The Kings of the Gentiles</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">

vse it; <hi>but with you it shall not be so:</hi> not by any
grant from me.</p>
               <p>Lastly, had our Sauiour denyed onely tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
and cruell dominion vnto them, hee had not
fitly reproued them at this time, nor answered
their request, made vnto him. For they would
easily haue replyed, why, we seeke not any cruell
nor tyrannicall kinde of dominion; all that we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
is to be emine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in <hi>secular</hi> &amp; <hi>coactiue</hi> authority
and power, in thy temporall and earthly king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
Seeing then it is certaine, that Christ de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:9494:225"/>
to grant that which they desired, and their
desire was not of <hi>tyranny,</hi> but of <hi>temporall domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
it is not to bee doubted, but our Sauiour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed
that he would grant or giue vnto them any
secular, ciuill or coactiue authority at all, either
milde or tyrannicall.</p>
               <p>Now seeing Christ denyed to giue any secular
power at all to any of his Apostles, or to their suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors,
<hi>à fortiori</hi> he must needs deny to giue that
which they now claime to the Pope, <hi>Regall, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchicall,
and supreme dominion, and that ouer all
kings in the world,</hi> either to <hi>Peter</hi> or <hi>Iames,</hi> or any
of all their successors. Our Sauiours words, are
farre more emphaticall and forceable against this.
<hi>The Kings of the Gentiles haue this dominion;</hi> If I
should giue this vnto you, I should contrary to
mine own precept, take from <hi>Cesar</hi> what belongs
to <hi>Cesar. The Kings of the Gentiles haue this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion;</hi>
should I giue this vnto you, I should make
all of you Kings, and not seruants; now I appoint
you to be (as I my selfe am) seruants vnto your
brethren, not kings ouer all your brethren, and
least of all ouer all the world. S. <hi>Bernard</hi> very
rightly applying this text to the Pope, who then
carried himselfe like an Emperour, tels him, that
<hi>Apostolicall ministration which is inioyned to</hi> Peter
and all his successiors, <hi>is incompatible which Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchical
dominion,</hi> which the Pope then vsurped,
and which is now challenged. <hi>If,</hi> saith he<note n="n" place="margin">Bern. lib. 2. de consid. ad Eugen.</note>, <hi>you
succeed in the Apostolicall vocation, you may not v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surpe</hi>
(Monarchicall) <hi>dominion, Planè ab alterutro
prohiberis,</hi> you are certainely forbid the one of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:9494:226"/>
these two. <hi>If you will haue them both, you shall lose
them both.</hi> And to shew plainely that such inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant
temporall dominion vsed by the Pope,
cannot possibly bee claimed from Christ, nor bee
<hi>iure diuino,</hi> he addes, <hi>Vt alia quacunque ratione, haec
tibi vendices, certè non Apostolico iure,</hi> by what
means soeuer you claime such dominion, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
you cannot haue it by Apostolicall right.
And if it be not Apostolicall, then is it certainely
either humane (which they scorne,) or (which is
the truth indeed) diabolicall. To the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
doth their learned Lawyer <hi>Ant. Rosselus</hi>
                  <note n="o" place="margin">Ant. Rossel. Monarch. part. 1. c. 70. p. 298.</note> say

the same man should bee both a full Bishop and

Empire, or dominion neither is, nor can be
in a Bishop. The reason whereof is, that opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which Christ hath made betweene them;
the one, to be the Lord and ruler of all his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
and therefore subiect or seruant to none, but

to be subiect to him, who is by God appointed to

               <p>Our Sauiour againe teacheth this, by that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement

teach, was Bishop therof) and then much more
all <hi>Peters</hi> successors, are commanded by the Spirit
of God, to be obedient to secular Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
it is vndeniably consequent, that Christ did
not giue a supreame temporall dominion either to
<hi>Peter,</hi> or to any other Apostle, or to any of all
their successors: for had he giuen that, then should
not they haue beene commanded to obey other
Kings, but all other both Kings and people should
haue beene taught and commanded to obey e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
in all ciuill and temporall matters, <hi>Peter</hi> and
<hi>Peters</hi> successors.</p>
               <p>If notwithstanding all this euidence, any will

yet exempt either <hi>Peter</hi> or the Pope, or any other
from this commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Apostle, that may
be iustlie replied vnto him, which S. <hi>Bernard</hi> saith,<note n="f" place="margin">Ber. Epist. 42.</note> 
                  <hi>Si omnis anima, &amp; vestra,</hi> If euery soule must

               <p>But besides this of <hi>Bernard,</hi> I will oppose two

                  <hi>calumnies,

other Apostles and Christians abetted him in that
claime, the supreame temporall Monarchie of the
world, then could Christianity neuer haue beene
cleared of that calumnie: nay it had beene no
calumny at all, but a certaine truth; for seeing by
the doctrine of Christians, <hi>Peter</hi> and his successors
were for euer to haue the supreame temporall do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
ouer the whole world, all other king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
and Monarchies had beene quite subuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
all Emperors and Kings should by this haue
become subiects, seruants, homagers and vassals to
<hi>Peter</hi> and the Pope. He should haue beene their
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:9494:228"/>
temporall Lord, whom they ought to obey, their
Landlord from whom they should haue taken and
held all their possessions, and their supreame Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch
from whom they must deriue all their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
authority. Thus had the Christian faith
and doctrine, subuerted all other temporall King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
to establish a new temporall Monarchy in
the Pope alone. Seeing then the Apostles taught
that accusation to be a most odious calumnie, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they,</hi> as Chrysostome saith<note n="i" place="margin">Chrys. in cap. 13. ad Rom. in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

Christ by his Law non euertit politiam, sed melius in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituit,</hi>
did not subuert any other ciuill state, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
wealth or Empire, but bring them all to bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
order, by embracing faith, &amp; with it piety, and
all godlinesse; it is hence most cleare, that Christ
neither before, nor after his resurrection, erected
that new-found temporall, Pontificall Monarchy,
<hi>which as</hi> Scioppius<note n="k" place="margin">Gas. Sciop. ca. 46. Regnum Christi <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>truely saith, ouerthrowes all
other kingdomes and Empires in the whole world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other reason is this, that if Christ had
meant to giue such a temporall Monarchy to <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
he would no doubt haue furnished him with
secular meanes, secular strength and power, first, to
obtaine, and then to vphold and maintaine that
Monarchy. Now the <hi>weapons of their warfare
were not carnall,</hi> as the Apostle saith<note n="l" place="margin">2 Cor. 10. 4.</note>, <hi>but spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall,
mighty to cast downe all the strong holds of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan.</hi>
Certainly they might if they had had Christs
allowance, haue vsed their power to subuert King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
and bring all to a temporall subiection vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Peter.</hi> They could most easily haue subdued
all the instruments of Satan, and all mortall men
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:9494:228"/>
who had opposed themselues to this Pontificall
dominion. For who could haue resisted them,
who with a word onely could smite their oppug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
with blindnesse, as <hi>Paul did</hi>
                  <note n="m" place="margin">Act. 13. 11</note> 
                  <hi>Elimas,</hi> yea

                  <hi>Ananias &amp; Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phira?</hi>
But because this power was giuen them,
onely to confirme the Faith, and enlarge Christs
Spirituall, but not their owne temporall kingdom;
they onely vsed it for the furtherance of Christs
glory, and neuer either did, or might vse it to set
vp their owne secular dominion, and lift them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
aboue all Kings, and Princes. Nay, seeing
the Apostles were faithfull in the house of God,
and preached euerie part of that doctrine which
Christ taught vnto them; S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> testifying of
himselfe, which is also true in the rest, <hi>I haue</hi>
                  <note n="o" place="margin">Act. 20. 27</note>
                  <hi>kept nothing backe, but haue declared vnto you the

so much as once declared that <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Peters</hi>
Successors, were to haue a temporall Monarchy
ouer the whole world, and that all Kings must
hold both their Crownes and Kingdomes from
them; all to be tenants, homagers, and vassals vnto
them: it may hence certainly be concluded, that
this temporall Monarchy which they claime to
<hi>Peter</hi> and the Pope, is no part of <hi>Gods counsell;</hi> and
then without all doubt, it is no other but the verie
<hi>counsell of the diuell.</hi>

               <head type="sub">That the Popes Temporall Monarchy is condemned
by the iudgement of the Primitiue Church, and of
generall Councels; as also by the Fathers, and
learned writers, who liued till the 500. yeeres after
Christ.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He third point which herein
I proposed, was, to shew that
this direct temporall Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy
which they claime to
the Pope, with those conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents
&amp; conclusions which
depend on it, hath been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
by the vniforme
consent of holy Fathers, and learned writers in all
ages of the Church. A worke in truth nothing
so difficult to proue, as laborious to collect; and if
I feared not to be too prolixe, I would make it
cleare by the testimonies almost of all writers of
account, in all the ages of the Church. But study<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
breuitie, I will select some onely out of that
heape which I had not without great labour col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected,
by which may be conceiued what the
iudgement hath beene of the rest in this point.</p>
               <p>First, there are two generall considerations
which may be here obserued. The one is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
iudgement of Popes, Bishops, Martyrs,
and all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Christians of the Primitiue Church, so
long as Emperours persecuted the Faith; that is,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:9494:229"/>
vntill the Empire of <hi>Constantine.</hi> Had Christians
belieued or knowne in those dayes, that the Pope
was an higher temporall King then secular Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
and that none of those Emperours had any
lawfull authoritie to punish or put them to death,
seeing they had no authoritie at all from their su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame
temporall Monarch, the Pope, so to doe;
why did not those Popes command Christians,
(as they might lawfully haue done) to make resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
by temporall force? why did they not (as
being superiour Lords they lawfully might) who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
depriue those Emperours of all their authority
which they so tyrannously abused against Christ?
Specially considering that, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Bell. lib. 5. d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>When Princes goe about to turne their people from

and ought to be depriued of their Dominion; yea<note n="b" place="margin">Ibid. sect. Tertia.</note> 
                  <hi>non licet Christianis tolerare,</hi> Christians may
not then so must as tolerate them. At least, why
did neither the Popes, nor any of all those Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyres,
vse that iust Apologie for themselues, that
none of those Emperours had any lawfull autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
ouer them, seeing they had none deriued from
the Pope? How were they not perfidious in Gods
cause, by concealing that truth, which if they had
taught, would haue quenched all persecutions?
How were they not iniurious to Gods Church in
suffering those tyrants, who had no lawfull autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
from their highest temporall Monarch, to
murder and massacre the Saints of God? Nay,
how can they be excused from being accessorie
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:9494:230"/>
to their owne deaths, when they vsed neither that
temporall authoritie of the Pope, whereby they
might iustly haue resisted; nor that iust defence
of speech, whereby they might haue repressed all
those tyrannies? For if any think, they had not at
that time temporall power, and strength sufficient
to haue made resistance, <hi>Tertullian</hi> plainely wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth
the contrarie. <hi>If</hi> (saith he)<note n="c" place="margin">Tertull. Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loget cap. 37.</note> 
                  <hi>we Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
would be open enemies, should we want either
number or power? Are not we moe then the Mauri,
Marcomans, or Parthians? moe then any nation?
we haue filled all places that you haue, your Cities, your
Ilands, your Castles, your municipall Townes, your
Tents, your Tribes, your Pallaces, your Senate, your
Markets, onely we leaue to you the Idol Temples. Cui
bello non idonei fuissemus?</hi> What warre were we
not able to vndertake? But because both the
Popes and all other Christians then knew, that
they had no such lawfull authoritie to make resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
to their Gouernors, they layd downe their
neckes, and endured all tortures, euen death it self,
vsing no other weapons, but <hi>teares</hi> and <hi>prayers:</hi>
Against Emperours being their Lords, they had
<hi>scutum,</hi> but not <hi>gladium.</hi> The Popes temporall
sword and secular Monarchy which might easily
haue resisted, and quenched all those persecutions,
was not knowne or once dreamed of among any
Christians in those first three ages of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
Church.</p>
               <p>The other generall consideration, is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
iudgement of holy generall Councels. I
haue in an other Treatise<note n="d" place="margin">A treatise of Councels which be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall and lawfull</note> proued at large, that
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:9494:230"/>
besides the Sardican, and that vnder <hi>Mennas,</hi> there
were held no more but eight, which are rightly
to be counted and called <hi>Oecumenicall and lawfull
Councels.</hi> All that followed that eight, which was
held at Constantinople about the cause of <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi>
either in the yeere 869, in the time of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian</hi>
the second; or in the yeere 879, in the time of
<hi>Iohn</hi> the eight, and both of them in the time of
<hi>Basilius,</hi> were in truth either not Oecumenicall,
or if such, yet not lawfull generall Councels.
Now by all those eight, which were only Oecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menicall
Councels, the Popes temporall Mornar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy
is clearly and certainly condemned. For all
those were both <hi>assembled, gouerned,</hi> and <hi>dissolued</hi>
by the authoritie of secular Emperours; all the
Bishops in all those Councels, by their <hi>comming</hi>
at the Emperours call and command; by their
willing <hi>submission</hi> to Imperiall gouernment, when
they were assembled; by their not <hi>departing,</hi>
but with the Emperours leaue, and licence, did
acknowledge and proclaime Emperours to be the
onely supreame Lords, Gouernours, and temporal
Monarches in the Church. All which points, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I haue fully in my other Treatise out of the
Synodall Acts of euerie one of those Councels
made cleare, I will not here repeat the same. Let
me only now mention one testimonie out of that

these words, and turned <hi>Nobis</hi> into <hi>Vobis;</hi> quite
contrary both to the Greeke Text, to the ancient

now in his last editions of the Councels, corrected
that his errour, and rightly reades the words, as
they are also in their Romane edition of the
Councels, <hi>Nobis</hi> and not <hi>Vobis.</hi> So by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
Iudgment of all the Oecumenicall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels,
which as yet haue beene held, that is, of the
whole Catholike Church, whensoeuer it spake in
one voyce, this temporall Monarchy of the Pope
is most cleerely condemned, and the soueraigne
authority of secular Emperors aboue the Pope, is
most cleerely demonstrated.</p>
               <p>Heare now the softer voyce of the Church,
speaking in those Fathers and learned Writers,
who liued in the seuerall ages and successions
thereof. For though this question of the Popes
temporall Monarchy was not mooued in the
Church till more then a 1000 yeeres after Christ,
yet such is the force of Trueth, that euen before
this controuersie arose, that Antichristian pride
was by the ancient Fathers both condemned and
refelled, though not in expresse maner (which, the

testimony is not now to be found in the Popes

once extant, and is now to their eternall infamy,
and wrong of <hi>Anastasius,</hi> yea of the whole
Church, expunged, there are two euident witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
The one is <hi>Onuphrius</hi>

<hi>primus omnium,</hi> first of all did <hi>attempt to depriue
Emperors, had continued from the time of</hi> Charles
<hi>the Great, and was brought in by the authority of
Pope</hi> Hadrian, he thus concludes: <hi>Cuius rei memi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit</hi>
Anastasius Bibliothecarius <hi>in historia Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stica;
Quem locum Gratianus Canonum collector no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tauit.
Anastasius</hi> the library keeper, mentions this
in his Ecclesiasticall historie, and <hi>Gratian</hi> in his
collection of the Canons, points at, or cites that
place of <hi>Anastasius. Gretzer</hi> could not deny <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuphrius</hi>
to testifie this, but because it is against his
and his Masters fancy, he saith<note n="t" place="margin">Gretz. lib. 2. cont. Replic. ca. 1. §. Dixi.</note>, <hi>It is an error of</hi>
Onuphrius; Onuphrius <hi>forgot himselfe herein.
Peruicacy</hi> will euer find one shift or other, but by
this cleere and true testimony of <hi>Onuphrius,</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
that maine truth, of this Synod and Synodall
Decree) two things are cleere; the one that <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasius</hi>

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:9494:242"/>
booke of the Popes liues; the other, that <hi>Gratian</hi>

by either part giuen vnto the other both then

the veritie of this Appellation. The sentence and
censure of the Pope in this and following ages,
was for this point but the partiall and vniust sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of some factious, seditious and schismaticall
Hildebrandists, condemned by the Vniforme and
consenting iudgement of the whole Catholike
Church in all the seuerall ages thereof, till the
daies of <hi>Hildebrand.</hi> The sentence and censure
of the Imperialists was for this point the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxall
and consenting iudgement of holy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels
and of the Catholike fathers for more then a
thousand yeeres together after Christ. If they
obiect, that some of the witnesses whom in this

or succeeding ages we produce, were accounted
Heretikes, we iustly reply, that those also whom
they produce against vs, in this cause, were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
Heretikes. Either by the iudgement of
the other, was counted and called Hereticall, and
so neither of both since this rent in the Church
made by <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> is an equall or fit iudge of
the other. The vnpartiall Iudgement in this cause
must proceede from the former, ancient, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
voice of the Church before it was rent or
diuided in this question. And seeing with the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialists
in this point wholly concurres, and from
the Hildebrandists wholly dissents the consenting
voice and iudgement of the Catholike Church in
all the former ages thereof, that is, for more then
1000. yeeres together, it is an euident demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that the Imperialists, and those who are wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
on our part, in this doctrine, both in truth
are, and are by all others to be accounted and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Orthodoxall; and that the Hildebrandists and

condemne all wealth and all secular dominion</hi>

Herods, who thought Christs kingdome to be terrene
and secular; which opinion some in these daies em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace,
who so much decline the errour of the Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denses,
that they fall to the quite contrarie errour.
Their errour is, that the Pope in Christs steed hath
dominion and iurisdiction in temporall matters, yea,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:9494:266"/>
dominion aboue secular Kings and Princes, because
the Pope hath his power immediately from God, and
Princes haue theirs from the Pope: whereupon they
say, that solus papa est verus dominus temporalium,</hi>
the Pope is the onely true Lord of all temporall
goods, <hi>Princes and others they are but dispensatores,</hi>
stewards of them vnder the Pope. <hi>This opinion,</hi>
saith he, <hi>sprung from the errour of Herod, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours
of the errour of Vigilantius: it partakes also
with that pernicious doctrine of the Pharisies, who
to the end the people might giue greater oblations to
them, taught, non teneri populum ad censum redden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum
Caesari,</hi> that the people were not bound to
pay tribute and duties to <hi>Caesar.</hi> But what is your
owne iudgement in this matter? Hee following a
saying, which he cites out of <hi>Austen, Fides medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um
tenet inter duos errores contrarios,</hi> saith, <hi>Veritas
medium ponit,</hi> Truth is in the middle betweene
those two errours; <hi>for Ecclesiasticall persons may
haue temporall dominion, against the Waldenses:
and they haue it not as being Vicars to Christ, but
ex concessione &amp; permissione principum,</hi> by the
grant, permission and delegation of Princes. And
intreating<note n="h" place="margin">Ibid. cap. 5.</note> whether secular or Ecclesiasticall
power is more worthy, his resolution is, <hi>That in
spirituall matters the Ecclesiasticall power is more
excellent, but in temporall matters the secular power

<hi>neither is it quoad ista in aliquo subiecta,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect

hereof, <hi>Because the temporall power is not deriued
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:9494:266"/>

hath nor can haue so much force nor authoritie,
to reprobate or adnull the decree of Constance,
as the true decree at Constance hath, and ought
to haue, to reprobate and adnull the decree at

this whole Councell, all the Bishops in their

which saith to the Popes (as hee protests some to haue
written, and some Popes haue beleeued) O how great
is the sublimitie of your power! how incomparable
to it, is secular authoritie! As to Christ is giuen all
power in heauen and in earth, so did Christ leaue

And though to these most worthy seruants of

all these, I will alledge cheefely the testimonies
of some of their owne and best learned writers
in this age, most of them such as are extreamely
partiall on the Popes side, and earnest in his
cause, that themselues giuing testimonie to that
truth which we maintaine, and like Midianites,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:9494:287"/>
sheathing their swords in the bowels one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

whole world. <hi>Verum ridicula haec profecto,</hi> But
truly thus to say is ridiculous. And he sets down
diuers reasons to disproue that ridiculous asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
One, because <hi>if it were so, then there should
none be truly Kings in the world but onely the Pope.</hi>
Another, <hi>because Christ himselfe refused to bee a
Temporall King, when the Iewes would haue made
him one:</hi> and he answered, <hi>to one of the brothers
who requested him to diuide the inheritance, who
made me a Iudge, or a diuider between you?</hi> Of which
words <hi>Catharinus</hi> thus saith; <hi>Hic locus videtur co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gere
vt fateamur,</hi> This place seemes euen to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force
vs to confesse, <hi>that secular iurisdiction was
not giuen vnto him.</hi> Againe, <hi>we doe not deny that
the Pope hath dominion of tempor all things, but this
we say, that such dominion is not giuen to him as
Pope, nor immediatly by Christ, sed illud habet quasi
vnus quilibet hominum,</hi> but he hath it as any other
man, vnto whom by humane right such power
befals. Againe, <hi>In this, that the Pope is Christ Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>care,
there is no force to proue, that power is giuen
to him, ad regendum omnia regna mundi in tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libus,</hi>
to rule all kingdomes in temporall affaires.
<hi>Nay this doth rather perswade, that such power is
not giuen vnto the Pope, seeing Christ whose Vicare
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:9494:288"/>
he is, refused that honour, and tooke it not vpon him,
as hee was man, but was himselfe subiect to secular
powers.</hi>

rare and admirable <hi>Records</hi> and <hi>Monuments</hi> hath
<hi>Nicholas</hi> compiled, and out of him <hi>Steuchus</hi> and
<hi>Gretzer</hi> published; which though in themselues
they might iustly be contemned, yet because the
Popes and their flatterers applaud and please
themselues with such toyes and fancies, let vs see
how weake they are to support that Monarchical
Soueraigntie, which they build on such sandy
foundations; and I nothing doubt to make it eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that by none of all their pretences, none of
those most renowned and glorious Empires euer
were, or euer will be brought vnder the yoake of
subiection to the Popes Temporall Monarchy.</p>
               <p>Here first in general for al kingdomes it may be
rightly said, that the admitting of this one <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall</hi>
Temporall Monarchy of the Pope, is the
vtter ruinating, adnulling and annihilating of all
other kingdomes in the world. <hi>Scioppius</hi> truly
saith<note n="b" place="margin">Sciop. in 540 Ecclesiast. ca. 46. pa. 15<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

mu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>di,</hi> doth abolish all other temporal kingdoms.
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:9494:302"/>
And to the like purpose <hi>Amb. Catharinus</hi>
                  <note n="c" place="margin">Amb. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thar. in cap. 13. ad Rom. §. Verum.</note>, <hi>If the
Pope be the temporall Monarch of the whole world,
nulli ergo vere terrarum Domini essent in tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libus,
sed solus Pontifex,</hi> then should none else be
truly Temporall Kings here vpon earth, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Pope. For seeing <hi>Soueraigntie</hi> (which as I
haue formerly proued, is the very essence of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall
authoritie) should then be in the Pope a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
he alone and none else should truly bee
King: Al others should be but <hi>Viceroyes, Deputies,</hi>
or <hi>Lieutenants</hi> vnder him, subiect to him, as their
supreame Lord both for their persons &amp; possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
So this very position of the Popes <hi>Vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall
temporall</hi> Dominion aboue all Kings, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes
an euident and vnauoydable contradiction
to it selfe. For if the Pope bee such a Monarch,
there can be no other Kings to acknowledge this
Papall Monarchy. And if there bee any other
Kings to acknowledge this, euen <hi>eo nomine,</hi> for
that they are <hi>Kings,</hi> they doe directly deny and
ouerthrow his Monarchicall Soueraigntie.</p>
               <p>But if you please to descend to particulars, it
will cleerely appeare, that the acknowledgment
of this Papall Monarchy is neither so generall,
nor so true as they pretend and boast. Let vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
with the most Christian King, and his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

of which <hi>Scioppius</hi> saith, <hi>that it is held nullo alio

of such points, it were easie to shew,
how their owne <hi>Genebrard</hi>
                  <note n="c" place="margin">Gil. Geneb. in sua Chron.</note> fets downe another,
and farre stronger Title to that Kingdome, yea
such also, as wholy excludes the Popes donation:
easie againe to shew, how by that, which some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note n="d" place="margin">Frank. dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</note>
of their owne Catholikes relate touching
that very kingdome of <hi>Nauar,</hi> that there is no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
for any Prince to hold any kingdome by
that title. But as it was vnfit for <hi>Scioppius</hi> to be so
peremptory, so neither is it fit for me, nor will I
presume to enter into the discussion of such ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.
This which I haue already sayd being
sufficient to be spoken of the kingdome of Spain.</p>
               <p>For the kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> their insolency
in pretending the Popes <hi>Temporall Soueraignty</hi>
ouer it, enforceth mee more at large to manifest
the vanity of such their boasting. And I nothing
doubt, but to make cleere vnto them that which

which fell out in that very age wherein both the

zenith of their highest exaltation.</p>
               <p>How farre that renowned Conquerour was
from acknowledging their Papall Monarchy, or

               <p>In the next Kings dayes there fell out great

them so greeuously, that they said they would in no

should not receiue consecration from the Pope. When
contrary to his promise, hee receiued the Papall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration,
the King vnderstanding thereof, Omnem

to come within his kingdomes or dominions.
Euident tokens that the King and State of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
held not the Pope for their Temporall
Lord, seeing euen in Spirituall causes they yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
so slender subiection, that they were ready
to renounce and forsake the Romane Church,
rather then consent to the Pope in those things.</p>
               <p>In the reigne of <hi>Henrie</hi> the second, <hi>the King</hi>
                  <note n="m" place="margin">Math. Paris. in Hen. 2. ann. 1164. in initio</note>
                  <hi>called a very great assembly to</hi> Clarendon, <hi>at
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:9494:308"/>
which were present the Archbishops, Bishops, Abbots,
Priors, Earles, Barons, and Nobles of the Kingdome.
In it was made a Recognition and confirmation of the
customes and liberties of the kingdome, anciently v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sea
in the times of former Kings, and which debe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant
in Regno, &amp; ab omnibus teneri,</hi> ought to bee
obserued in this kingdome, and mainteined by
all. One of those ancient customes was this,
<hi>That no Archbishop, Bishop, or other person of this
kingdome, might goe out of the Realme</hi> (to wit, to
the Pope) <hi>abque licentia Domini Regis,</hi> without
the Kings leaue: <hi>and if the King granted them
leaue, yet they should put in security, that neither in
going, returning, nor staying, they should doe ought
to the hurt or dammage of the King or kingdome.</hi>
Another custome was, <hi>That if any appealed, it
should be from the Arch-deacon to the Bishop, from
him to the Arch-bishop, and from him to the King,
ita quod non debeat vltra procedi absque assensu Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini
Regis,</hi> from the King they might appeale
to none, nor proceed further in the cause with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Kings licence. When the King and
whole State confirmed these decrees, they did
euen demonstrate, that they held not the Pope
to be a superior Lord or higher Iudge, then the
King, no not in Ecclesiasticall, much lesse in ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
causes. To <hi>these Decrees at Clarendon,</hi> Thomas

                  <hi>of the Barons was, that he was worthy to bee

their iudgement he went away, omnibus clamantibus

<hi>that they shall not be deliuered out of prison till they

whereof pertaineth to the Kings Court, or
which doe sue in another Court, to defeate or impeach
the iudgements giuen in the kings Court, such should
personally answer for such their offence within two

their Atturneyes, Procurators, Eexcutors, and Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teiners
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:9494:311"/>
should be put out of the Kings protection, and

               <p>The speciall reasons which I will vse to proue

such persons as bought Allume of the Florentines.</hi> It

<hi>ought not to bee allowed.</hi> In <hi>Richard</hi> the thirds

Court of</hi> Rome, <hi>should not preiudice any man at the

                  <hi>excommunication was

plea for the defendant to say, <hi>that the plaintiffe is
excommunicated by the Pope, although he shew forth
the Popes Bull to witnesse it; For the Iudges ought
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:9494:314"/>
not to allow such an excommunication: and that the
Certificate of no excommunication is auaileable in

pleasure was, that</hi> according to the law <hi>he should be
hanged and drawne,</hi> as a Traytor, <hi>but the Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
and Treasurer kneeled for him before the

<hi>Edward Coke,</hi> whose exact knowledge in that
profession is not vnknowne to any. But these
few, (which by the helpe of those who are very
learned in that profession, I was desirous to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
for my owne satisfaction) are sufficient to
testifie the Popes authoritie, euen his <hi>Censures of

               <p>And I was much more earnest and glad to be

themselues expert, or seeke not, as I professe
I haue done, to bee informed by them who are
learned in the Law; the collusions of <hi>F. Parsons,</hi>
who would seeme to make some answer<note n="h" place="margin">Pars. answer to the 5. part of Reports set forth by Sir Edw. Coke.</note> to that
Treatise, may perhaps cast a mist before their
eyes, whereas if the truth be duly and fully scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
the Iesuite by that his answere, hath mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelously
both disgraced himselfe, and bewrayed
the weaknesse of that cause of the <hi>Popes Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,</hi>
which he vndertook to defend; but he could
no otherwise support it, but by flying to <hi>Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:9494:315"/>
Sophistical,</hi> and <hi>Reuiling</hi> euasions, on which
his whole dispute doth consist.</p>
               <p>Of the <hi>Impertinency</hi> of his dispute, take this
demonstration. We in all our writings do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
and make euident, that by the <hi>Soueraigne au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi>
which we giue vnto kings in causes Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall,
we intend not <hi>any either Supreame or
subordinate power</hi> to preach, to administer Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
to ordeine, to suspend, excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,
and absolue, or iudicially to decide and
define doubts of faith: This <hi>power</hi> is giuen to no
Laicall, but onely to <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> persons; and
giuen or deriued to them onely from Christ, by
the mediation of his Apostles and Bishops. And
because in all these there is a direction in the
waies of God, but no corporall force or punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
coacting men to walke in those waies,
therefore is this rightly called a <hi>Directiue power,</hi>
or a <hi>power of executing</hi> those Spirituall duties.
But the power which wee acknowledge to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to Kinges in causes Ecclesiasticall, is an
<hi>Imperiall,</hi> not <hi>Spirituall;</hi> a <hi>Supreame coactiue,</hi> not
a <hi>directiue</hi> power; a power <hi>Mandatorie,</hi> comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
those Ecclesiasticall duties to be done, not
<hi>Executory,</hi> as doing those themselues: Such a
<hi>power,</hi> as by which all Kings and Princes are au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized
by God, as being his immediate Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerents
vpon earth, not onely to <hi>permit</hi> with li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie
and freedome, but to <hi>see all those spirituall
duties performed in</hi> their kingdomes by <hi>Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi>
persons, yea, to <hi>coact</hi> and <hi>compell</hi> both them
to performe, and others to embrace the same du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:9494:315"/>

which we euery where proclaime, <hi>F. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi>
not being able with any colour to oppugne
this truth, that he might seeme to say somewhat

the same in their owne persons; as namely, to giue ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
orders, to create and consecrate Bishops, absolue
sinnes, administer Sacraments, teach, preach, iudge,
and determine in points of faith.</hi> Thus disputes the
great Iesuite against vs. In all which euery one
may see that this grand Master in their Romish

point which he vndertooke, but fighteth onely
with his owne shaddow; and when he hath refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
this idle and sottish conceit of his owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uising,
then he insultes, and triumphs as if he had
killed the wise and worthy <hi>Vlisses,</hi> whereas in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
deed the blind <hi>Polyphemus</hi> hath done nothing
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:9494:316"/>
else but hackt and hewed in peeces one of his
owne hogges.</p>
               <p>As his dispute is <hi>Impertinent,</hi> so is it in euery
part <hi>Sophisticall.</hi> I will instance onely in this
whereof we now entreat touching the reiecting
of the Popes Excommunications. He seeing
that they were often and expresly by the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected,
deuiseth this shift, (and it is very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent<note n="n" place="margin">Pars. lib. cit. ca. 11. nu. 24. &amp; ca. 12. nu. 15 &amp; saepe alibi.</note>
and vsuall in him) that the reiecting of
them proceeded not from any want of respect to
the Pope, nor from the denial of his authoritie in
this kingdom, but <hi>from want of a Certificate fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the
Arch-bishop or Bishop, that those writings were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the Popes Bulls, and not counterfeit.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
besides his supine ignorance, hee bewrayes
a resolute intent rather to cauil and wrangle, then
to dispute and argue. It is true, that in the books
of the Law there is often mention of <hi>hauing a
Certificate from the Bishop.</hi> But that <hi>Certificate</hi> was
not to testifie that this was truly and certainely
the Popes Bull or Excommunication, (for how
could any Bishop here, be able to certifie that?)
but to certifie that the partie (whom that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication
did concerne) was by the Arch-bishop
or Bishop himselfe excommunicated.
Which to be the true meaning of those words,
there are many cleere proofes. By the Statute
<hi>an.</hi> 27. of <hi>Edw. 3. cap.</hi> 1. it is expresly declared,
that the very <hi>suing to the Court of Rome,</hi> and seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by such <hi>courses to hinder or impeach iudgement
in the Kings Court, was the very destruction of the
Common Law, vsed at all times in this Realme.</hi> So
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:9494:316"/>
by the consenting voyce of the whole State, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
and confirming the Common Law, the
very <hi>Act of procuring the Popes Excommunication,</hi>
(and not the want of a Certificate of the truth
thereof) is declared to be an Act contrary to the
<hi>Common Law,</hi> and therefore to bee condemned
and reiected by <hi>that Law;</hi> and that also <hi>at al times.</hi>
Had the want of a <hi>Certificate from the Bishop,</hi> bene
once knowne to auoid the force of the Popes
Bull of Excommunication, would any, thinke
you, after that, haue beene so simple or carelesse
in their owne causes, as not to haue brought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
with the Popes Bull, a Certificate thereof
from a Bishop? Would <hi>Edward</hi> the first haue
beene so rigorous, nay tyrannicall, as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
one for Treason, and <hi>will that he should be
hanged and drawne,</hi> or but to be <hi>abiured the land,</hi>
for omitting a part of the forme in legall procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding?
for want of a <hi>Bishops Certificate of the Popes
Bull?</hi> Did euer the Statute or Common Law
iudge such an omission to be so heynous, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
a <hi>Capitall offence against the Crowne?</hi> Long
before this, the <hi>ancient Lawes of the Land were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognised
and confirmed by all the States of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and that also by oath in the reigne of</hi> Henrie
<hi>the second,</hi> as both <hi>Math. Paris.</hi> whom before I
cited, and an Act of Parliament<note n="o" place="margin">An. 10. Hen. 2. verba Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam. citantur à D. Edw. Coke in 6. part. Relat. in Praef.</note> vnder the same
<hi>Henry</hi> the second, witnesseth. It was then decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to bee an Act vnlawfull and preiudiciall to
the King, for any <hi>to Appeale to the Pope in any
cause, without the Kings consent.</hi> Whence it is
cleere, that the very suing for the Popes Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:9494:317"/>
and not want of a Certificate was
the offence in Law taken at those writs. Nay the
Certificate, that such a writ was truly procured
from the Pope, had beene an assurance of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
not an help to the offender. Besides, in the
14. of <hi>Henrie</hi> the fourth, fol. 14. it is said, that
<hi>the Certificate of no excommunication is auaileable in
Law, but only of such excommunications as are made
by the Arch-bishop or Bishop.</hi> And therefore though
the Popes Excommunication had beene by all
the Bishops in the Realme certified, <hi>yet in law
it was not auaileable,</hi> because it was the <hi>Popes
Excommunication,</hi> and not the Bishops. Nay it is
further there said (which is a cleere demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this truth) that though an Exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was <hi>certified by the Archbishop of</hi> Canterburie,
vnder his seale, yet for that <hi>the same Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
was but in execution of a Sentence in the Court
of Rome,</hi> and was not vpon any cause originally
depending before the Archbishop, it <hi>was ruled,
that the said Excommunication should not be allowed.</hi>
How much more then was the Popes owne Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication
(though certified by a Bishop)
by the Law reiected, when euen those Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications
made and certified by Bishops,
which of themselues were of force, lost their al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance
in law, when they had reference and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance
to the Pope, and at his solliciting of
the Bishops, were made against any for executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a sentence in his Court? Lastly, the reasons
why those Excommunications of the Pope are
in law reiected, doe vndeniably conuince this.
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:9494:317"/>
One reason hereof was, <hi>because</hi>
                  <note n="o" place="margin">12. Edw. 4. fol. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>it was against
the Kings regalitie and Crowne.</hi> To want a Certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
that the Bull was truly the Popes Bull, none
can imagine to be preiudiciall to the King, or to
his royaltie: at the most that is but an error and
ouersight in the partie that pleadeth, it is no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation
to the kings right. But <hi>to bring an excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
from the Pope, as from a superior Iudge
then</hi> the King; to bring the <hi>Popes authoritie</hi> and
writ, to hinder the proceeding of Iustice in the
Kings Court, &amp; to ouermaster the Kings autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
this indeed directly, and in <hi>Capite</hi> touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the Crowne and the Kings royaltie; for in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
it is a very deniall of the <hi>Kings Soueraignty,</hi> a
deniall that he is in truth a King. Another reason
which is often set downe in the bookes of Law<note n="p" place="margin">12. Edw 4. fol. 16. &amp; alibi.</note>,
is this, because <hi>the Pope is not a Minister or Officer
to the Kings Court.</hi> Whereby is meant, that such
Excommunications as are of force in Law, must
be made by those who are ministers, and subiect
to the King. And the reason hereof is euident:
because if the Excommunication be vniust, the
Court in the Kings name may command, and the
King may compell them to redresse the same.
Now to the Pope, neither could the <hi>Iudges</hi> (as
they say) <hi>write,</hi> (to wit, <hi>authoritatiue</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund
him) nor could the King compell him
to reuoke or redresse his Excommunication,
though it were neuer so vniust. By all which it is
euident, that the Popes excommunications were
by the Common Law, and that at all times reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
<hi>eo nomine,</hi> because they <hi>were the Popes,</hi> and
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:9494:318"/>
so were derogatorie to the royall dignitie; not
as the Iesuite cauilleth, because they wanted the
<hi>Bishops Certificate</hi> to testifie the truth of them: for
which his fancie as those who are very learned in
that profession, assure me, he hath no ground at
all in the bookes of the Law. But <hi>F. Parsons</hi>
thought by his equiuocating, and cauilling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Bishops Certificate (whereof he knew
there was mention in the bookes of Law) to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude
the simple and vnskilfull Reader, who ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cannot, or will not regard to enforme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
in such matters. But howsoeuer among
his owne ignorant proselites he may gaine an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause,
yet by his so vile and malicious sophisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
with the Law, among all men of sound
learning and vpright iudgement, hee hath made
himselfe a very <hi>Ludibrium</hi> vnto them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Parsons</hi> fearing his <hi>Sophistry</hi> would faile him,
as it hath in this, turnes him to his other shift,
which is indeed his last refuge, and that is open

of <hi>Nihil dicit,</hi> for in very deed, he speakes <hi>Nihil

now cleere, that <hi>by the Common Law,</hi> the Popes
supreame authoritie euen in Ecclesiasticall,
and then much more in Temporall causes, of
which wee intreat, is reiected; and seeing that
Law is the selfe-same now that it was alwaies, it
being a certaine, immutable and inflexible rule;
it remaines as cleere and certaine, that not onely
since the Conquest, but euer since there was a
Common Law in this Realm (that was euer since
there was a Common-weale therein;) which
knew the Pope, the Popes Soueraigntie hath bin
by the Church of this Realme, and that euen by

The other reason to proue this, is drawne from
the Brittanes &amp; their Church. That their Church
was not subiect to the Popes Iurisdiction, no not

when <hi>Austen</hi> the Monke came hither, being sent
from Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> the Great; and especially
their <hi>different obseruing of Easter,</hi> is a certaine and
vndoubted euidence. For seeing the Popes, spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially

                  <note n="b" place="margin">Euseb. lib. 5 hist. ca. 24.</note> shewes, were so <hi>earnest</hi>
to draw the Asiaticall Churches to the Romane
<hi>custome in the obseruation of that day,</hi> none may
thinke but that they would prouide to haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie
in such Churches as were subiect to
their owne Iurisdiction. Besides this difference of
Rites, the Brittane Bishops manifestly declared
that they held not their Church nor themselues
to be subiect to the Pope, nor to his authority.
Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> appointed <hi>Austen</hi> to be their Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop.

                  <note n="k" place="margin">Baron. ann. 604. nu. 65.</note>
being no other waies able to auoide the

of schisme,</hi> because they would not yeeld
obedience to the Pope. Wherin <hi>Baronius</hi> shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
begs the maine question in that his dispute.
Neither could he, nor will others euer proue,
either that <hi>all Churches,</hi> or that this of <hi>Brittaine</hi> in
particular, did owe subiection to the Romane B.
The Church of Brittaine<note n="l" place="margin">Bert. in sua Diatrib.</note> in ancient time, like
other Prouinces, had <hi>a Patriarch, or Patriarchall
Primate of her owne:</hi> to him the other Bishops in
this Church were subiect, as they in Aegipt to the
Patriarke of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> diuers in the Easterne
parts of Asia, to the Patriarke of <hi>Antioch;</hi> they in
Italy to the Patriarke of <hi>Rome,</hi> and so in other
Prouinces. Among these Patriarkes, and Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archall
Primates, by reason of the Imperiall seat,
and other seats of Iustice in seuerall Prouinces,
there was a <hi>Primacy,</hi> or <hi>Precedency</hi> of one before

no <hi>subordination</hi> or <hi>subiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> of one vnto another.
Admit those Bishops had then separated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Pope, (which yet doth not appear:)
it is not the separation from the Pope, or from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Bishop, no nor from any Church, but onely
the <hi>cause of separation</hi> that makes a schismaticke:
And seeing the Pope then sought to oppresse the
ancient liberties of the Brittaine Church, and to
bring them vnder his yoake to whom they were
not subiect; the <hi>Cause of their separation</hi> from the
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:9494:321"/>
Pope being iust, could not make them Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall;
but if the Pope and his adherents did for

commuinion with them. But the Essence and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality
of that Heresie, was their teaching that
Easter ought of <hi>Necessity</hi> to bee kept on that day
and <hi>none other:</hi> which <hi>Necessity</hi> they grounded
vpon the <hi>Mosaicall Law,</hi> wherein that day is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely
commanded, from which law they thought
and taught others, that none might depart, and
so by their doctrine they couertly and closely la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
to reduce Iudaisme, and all the Iudaicall
rites, one of which was this of Easter; and for
which, hauing most colourable pretences, they
vsed it but as a pully to drawe on the rest. <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi>

<hi>luna mensis.</hi> Hee indeuored cunningly to bring
Iudaisme into the Church, teaching that Easter
was on no other day to be kept, but on the 14. as
<hi>Moses</hi> commanded. With this Heresie (which
quite abolisheth Christ, &amp; euacuateth the whole
Gospell) those famous Churches in Asia, and
this of Brittaine had no affinity. For although
they celebrated the same day that the Iewes did,
and the <hi>Quartadecimanes</hi> vrged, yet they kept it
neither after the manner, nor vpon that ground
that the Iewes and Heretikes did. The Iewes and
Heretikes obserued that day <hi>eo nomine,</hi> because
<hi>Moses</hi> in his Ceremoniall Law, prescribed it. The

Religion of the Brittanes did wholy agree with that of

the doctrine of the Popes Supremacie in causes
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:9494:323"/>
Ecclesiasticall, was no point of the Brittanes
faith, but a doctrine which both by their professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

was condemned by Pope <hi>Gregorie,</hi> and all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes

<hi>That the faith which the Brittaines formerly had in

was then the same which the <hi>Romane Church,</hi> and

what a slender witnesse is <hi>Polydore</hi> for so weighty
a matter? An <hi>Italian,</hi> one of the Popes Pentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,

payed them to Rome, which is this, <hi>Quoniam
denarius hic Elemosyna Regis est,</hi> because those
Peterpence are the Almes of the King. Among
the Lawes of S. <hi>Edward</hi> the Confessor, which
are extant in another ancient Manuscript<note n="l" place="margin">Cod. M. S. legum antiq. Inter leges. St. Edw. fol. 35: extat in Bibl. D. Rob. Cot.</note>, the

<pb n="244" facs="tcp:9494:325"/>
and <hi>verbatim</hi> set downe, as in the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Sintius,</hi> the same reason of payment is
there also expressed, <hi>Quoniam Denarius hic Elemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syna

he might bee vndoubtedly certified of the true
Lawes, which were formerly vsed by the Saxons
in this Realme, caused a collection of them to
be made by the consent of <hi>sworne men, 12 to be
chosen out of euery Shire of England.</hi> They all
(witnesses for number, antiquitie, and credit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
all exception) among other ancient Lawes
and Customes, mention this concerning <hi>Rome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scot
or Peter-pence,</hi> in the very same manner and
words as the former did; and this very reason,
for the payment thereof by them is expressed,
<hi>Quoniam Denarius hic Elemosyna Regis est.</hi> By all
which it is euident, that by those Peter pence, the
Pope and Church of Rome is certainely proued,
to be <hi>Elemosynarius</hi> a Beeds-man to the Kings &amp;
kingdome of England, as receiuing that Annual
<hi>Almes</hi> from them, to the payment whereof they
<hi>voluntarie</hi> bound themselues. And from this vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarie
guift of an Almes, to conclude that the
Pope is the highest Lord of England, is euen
such a reason, as if a begger from the guift of a
penny, or an Hospitall from the guift of twentie
shillings, which you promise or binde your selfe
yearely to pay, should conclude that they are
certainly your Landlord, and that you hold all
your lands and possessions of them, and in token
of recognition thereof, do pay yearely to the one
a penny, or to the other a pound.</p>

                  <hi>with
gold,</hi> whereas the former was <hi>but with waxe.</hi> The
Copy of which Grant being wholly set downe
in that Manuscript Collection of <hi>Nicholas Card.</hi>
of <hi>Arragonia,</hi> of which before I spake, after I had
also seene<note n="i" place="margin">In Bib. prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicta.</note>, perused, and compared with the
former, it did fully satisfie me for the Fact a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.
And though it be not easie to coniecture
what the Popes pollicy might bee in procuring
this second resignation, seeing for euery Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
and substantiall point, it doth <hi>Verbatim</hi> agree
with the former; yet thus much I thinke may bee
easily obserued, that both these may well bee <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualide,</hi>
but that they both should be of force it is
impossible: the validity of either one, makes the
other vtterly inualid. For if the <hi>former was of
force,</hi> then <hi>Iohn</hi> hauing passed away all his right to
the Kingdome by it, hee could haue nothing to
passe by <hi>the later</hi> to the Pope; and then the <hi>later</hi>
is vtterly void and of no force at all: Againe, if
the <hi>later</hi> be of force, so that by it <hi>Iohn</hi> granted or
resigned the Kingdome to the Pope, then
was nothing at all past away, granted, or
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:9494:326"/>
resigned by the former, and then the <hi>former</hi> is vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
inualide. And of the two, though they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme
more of the gold, yet if I might aduise
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they should hold them to the waxe: specially
for that the <hi>golden Charter</hi> (as <hi>Parisiensis</hi>
                  <note n="k" place="margin">Math. Par: an. 1245. §. Diebus.</note> tels them
was said by many to haue <hi>beene melted in that fire</hi>
at Lyons, which <hi>Innocentius</hi> the 3. himselfe, <hi>was
thought to haue kindled in his own Palace, that vnder
pretence of that losse, he might more colourably exact
a Collection of the Clergie: the fire preuailing fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then the Pope intended, deuoured that golden
Iewell, and some other of lesser value.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But on whether soeuer they set their rest, it is
certainely no better then a staffe of Reed, to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
the pretended Dominion of the Pope. For
though we suppose it to haue beene sometimes
of force, yet the saying of <hi>Polidore</hi> their owne
witnesse, and the Popes Fauourer is very true in
this case. <hi>Omnia</hi>

tyed, and those burdens were laid vpon King
<hi>Iohn</hi> alone, they bound not any of his successors;
and this, saith he, <hi>Satis constat,</hi> is very cleere and
certaine. For as <hi>Accursius, Albericus,</hi> and other
Lawyers teach<note n="m" place="margin">De quibus vid. sup. part. 1. cu 8. pa. 170.</note> of the Donation of <hi>Constantine,</hi>
that it could not preiudice his successors, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
same may bee said of the Donation of King
<hi>Iohn:</hi> as the Charters, so the validity of them is
not vnlike. Yea, by the iudgement of <hi>Lucias de
Penna,</hi> the grant or Alienation of a Kingdome
though confirmed by oath also, as was<note n="n" place="margin">Iurauit rex se iudicio Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiae paritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, Math. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris. an. 1213. §. Rex deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que.</note> this,

                  <pb n="348" facs="tcp:9494:327"/>
himselfe. For <hi>though an Emperour,</hi> saith hee<note n="o" place="margin">Sup. par. 1. ca. 8. pa. 169.</note>,
<hi>sweare that he will not reuoke such royalties as are
giuen away to the preiudice of his Crowne, yet he may
reuoke them notwithstanding that his oath.</hi> And the
reason is, because the Emperour at the <hi>time of his
Coronation, hauing sworne to keepe safe the honour
&amp; rights belonging to his Empire,</hi> his second &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Oath (whereby hee sweares to alienate the
rights of his Empire, or suffer them to be aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
or withheld) being <hi>vnlawfull,</hi> neither doth
it, nor can it binde him to violate his former, iust
and <hi>lawfull Oath;</hi> for <hi>Iuramentum</hi> is not <hi>Vincu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum
Iniquitatis.</hi> And this directly concernes the
very case of King <hi>Iohn.</hi> Nay, what if the Pope
himselfe adnulled this grant of King <hi>Iohn.</hi> Both
the Charters were made in that one yeere. 1213.
as by their date appeares. Of the next yeere thus

               <p>And all this I haue spoken, vpon supposall that
those Charters, or either of them, made by <hi>Iohn,</hi>
had sometimes bin of force. But the truth is, that
neither of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was euer of any force to transfer or

of <hi>Iohn</hi> and their issue also being extinct, the right

this now it is euident that <hi>Iohn</hi> at no time (and
least of all, when hee was deposed and depriued
of his Kingdome by the Popes iudiciall sentence
as then he was when this Charter was made) had
any right to the Kingdome; and seeing he had no
right to take it to himself, much lesse had he right
to giue it to another. He could giue no more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
he had: Right to the Kingdome hee had none in
himselfe, right to the Kingdome hee could giue
none to the Pope. Of his gift that may bee said
which is vsually spoken in another matter,
<hi>Nihil habuit dare, Nihil dedit.</hi> And although such
Acts of <hi>Iohn</hi> as concerned the <hi>making of Lawes,</hi> or
administration of Iustice either <hi>betwixt subiect &amp;
subiect,</hi> or <hi>himselfe and the subiects</hi> are to be held of
force, as were also the like Acts of some other,
and namely of <hi>Richard</hi> the third, one knowne
and confessed by all to bee an Vsurper: though
those Acts, I say, of <hi>Iohn</hi> be rightly iudged to be
of <hi>force,</hi> because the State of the Kingdome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to his gouernment, and yeelded obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
vnto him, thinking it better to accept and
obey such a King as had but a <hi>pretended title,</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then to haue no <hi>King</hi> or ruler at all; yet for
his other Acts <hi>betwixt him and strangers, such as
concerned the rights of the whole Kingdome and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality
of the Crowne,</hi> and which tended to the
bringing of the whole Kingdome into bondage
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:9494:328"/>
and vassallage vnto others; for these, neither the
Acte of <hi>Iohn,</hi> nor of any other were, or were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
iudged to be of force; there was an Inualidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
in <hi>Iohn</hi> to doe such Acts, and when he did any
such, there was a meere Nullitie in the same.</p>
               <p>As the Giuer had no power to giue, so neither
was the kingdome such a <hi>Gift</hi> as could be passed
away by <hi>Iohn.</hi> For no Emperour can without
the consent of his State, giue his Empire to a
stranger; seeing in so doing, he should preiudice
the rights of others, and make them subiects
and vassals to another, without their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent:
whereas both <hi>equitie and naturall reason
teacheth,</hi> as out of <hi>Lupoldus</hi>
                  <note n="u" place="margin">Lupol. de Iur. regni &amp; Imp. ca. 14.</note> was before decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<hi>that the Act which preiudiceth the right of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
must be approued by them all.</hi> Now although
in the Charters, King <hi>Iohn</hi> is made to say, that
<hi>he did this communi consilio Baronum,</hi> by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
consent of his Barons; yet was that clause,
as many other, most falsely and fraudulently put
into the Charters by the Popes Legates. The Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons
and State were so farre from consenting to
this Grant, that when the first Charter was sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

                  <hi>the Popes

                  <hi>Nullus Rex, No King nor

all which, there is yet a farre more authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
proofe of the inualidity of King <hi>Iohns</hi> grant,
and that is the Iudgement of the whole king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
assembled in Parliament in the time of
<hi>Edward</hi> the third. This matter touching the
Grant which King <hi>Iohn</hi> made to the Pope, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
proposed and discussed in that Parliament;
<hi>Vpon</hi>
                  <note n="l" place="margin">Ex Rotulo Parliam. an. 40. Ed. 3. nu. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>full deliberation, the Prelates, Dukes, Earles,
Barons and Commons answered and said with one
accord, that neither the said King</hi> Iohn, <hi>nor any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
can put him, nor his Realme, nor his people in
such subiection without their assent: and as by many
euidences appeareth, if it was done, it was done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
their assent, and contrary to his owne oath at his
Coronation. And besides this, the Dukes, Earles,
Barons, Gentlemen, and Commons, doe accord and
agree, that in case the Pope shall enforce, or attempt
by processe, or by any other manner of doing, to
constraine the King or his subiects to performe this,
(as it is said he will) these parties will resist and
withstand it with all their puissance.</hi> Thus are the
words of the Act: A demonstration aboue all
exception, that to the Grant or Charter made
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:9494:330"/>
by K. <hi>Iohn</hi> to the Pope, there was no assent of the
Realme; and therefore that K. <hi>Iohn</hi> neither did,
nor could by that his Grant, or by either of those
Charters, resigne or transferre his kingdome to
the Pope, but that in his very Act of doing it,
there is not onely an Inualiditie, but a meere
Nullitie.</p>
               <p>The third Nullitie ariseth from the <hi>Cause,</hi>
which moued <hi>Iohn</hi> to make this Grant to the
Pope. And though in both the Charters <hi>Iohn</hi> is
made to say that he did it, <hi>for pietie and deuotion,
to make satisfaction to God and the Church for his
sinnes;</hi> that he did it also <hi>bona nostra spontaneaque
voluntate,</hi> of his owne free accord, and with a
willing mind; yet are these in truth, nothing else
but pretences: An easie matter it was for the Pope
and his Legates, to make <hi>Iohn</hi> write what colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
pretence they listed, when they made him
giue away his kingdome to whom, and as they
listed. The true and onely <hi>Cause</hi> inducing, nay en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcing
<hi>Iohn</hi> to make this Grant, was that immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
danger and feare, to loose both his Crowne
and his life also, into which extremitie, both of
danger and feare, the Pope himselfe had now
first brought <hi>Iohn,</hi> that so he might bee plyable
to his owne perswasions, &amp; then held him so fast
inwrapped and ensnared, that without the Popes
helpe he was now inextricable. His land was
now <hi>vnder a generall Interdict</hi>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>same Prouiso,
and that <hi>totidem verbis,</hi> expressed in both the
Charters, I did euen wonder to see their vanity,
and with what insolency they boast that Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:9494:333"/>
of Dominion is here giuen to the Pope,
and the King made an homager and vassall vnto
him by this Grant: all which this one Prouiso
doth manifest to be vntrue. For the <hi>Right</hi> of a
King is <hi>Soueraigntie of Dominion:</hi> The <hi>Libertie</hi> of
a King, is <hi>Freely</hi> and <hi>Absolutely to rule,</hi> without
being subiect or seruant to any other mortall
man. And the very essence of <hi>Regalitie,</hi> as I haue
before shewed, is <hi>Supremacy of authoritie, Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
of any, saue onely of God.</hi> Seeing all these
are expresly and directly excepted in both the
Charters, they vtterly made void whatsoeuer is
before mentioned, either as granting Soueraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to the Pope, or as acknowledging subiection
in the King. In both these respects, by reason of
this one Prouiso &amp; Exception, there is a certaine
Nullity of the Grant made in both the Charters.

Whereof there are so many euident profes,

make any doubt thereof. Had the Pope knowne
this Kingdome to haue beene the Popes Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,

hath the same Church now (vpon King
<hi>Iohns</hi> Grant) for her Lady in Temporall affaires
also? <hi>Innocentius</hi> doth hereby cleerely witnes that
this Realme of England, neuer till K. <hi>Iohns</hi> time
acknowledged the Roman Church for her Lord
in temporall matters. And therfore by the Popes
owne iudgement, neither <hi>Henry</hi> the second, nor
any former King did euer acknowledge, as in

which much impaireth the credit of <hi>Henries</hi> E-Epistle
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:9494:335"/>
and acknowledgement made vnto him.
<hi>Henry</hi> after congratulation for his election, and
signification how he sent that pension of <hi>Peter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence</hi>
vnto him, which he expressely calls <hi>Benefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi>
as noting it to be giuen in curtesie, and as an
Almes, not as a duty, he thus saith, <hi>What honour
and obedience your See had in the time of my father,
and Predecessors, the same I will that you haue in my
time: In this tenor that I also do entirely enioy those
dignities and customes in my Kingdome, which my
Ancestors had in the same: And I certifie you that as
long as I liue, the dignities and customes of my King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
shall not (God willing) bee impayred. And
though I (which God forbid) should so much deiect my
selfe, yet my Nohles,</hi> imo totus Angliae populus
id nullo modo pateretur; <hi>yea the whole Kingdome
of England will not suffer the impayring thereof.</hi>
So cleerely and constantly doth King <hi>Henry</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
that neither himselfe would, neither would
his people permit the impayring of the dignities
and custome of the Kingdome: and therefore
that neither himselfe nor they would euer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
such <hi>Feudatary</hi> subiection to the Pope,
as in that forged Epistle is both against the
mind, the hand and seale of the King, and against
the consent of the Kingdome acknowledged.
Those other acts of King <hi>Henry,</hi> recorded in Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians,

learned a man, exercised in the diligent search of

of this Epistle, going vnder the name of King
<hi>Henry</hi> the second, so familiar and obuious in their

The Councell at Paris held in the time of <hi>Lewes,</hi>
witnesseth also those books to haue bin written
with the allowance and approbation, yea in part
by the direction of <hi>Charles. When your father</hi>
Charles, say they<note n="c" place="margin">Synod Paris. sub Ludouico &amp; Lothario in principio.</note>, <hi>had caused the second Nicene

<hi>when further hee had noted and obserued certaine
chapters of the Nicene Synod which were to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued,
he sent the same chapters by</hi> Euguilbert <hi>an

it euidently hence followeth, that
what Chapters of the second Nicene Councell
are in those bookes reproued, the reproofe was
either <hi>praenotata</hi> obserued, or at least allowed by

not onely reiected and condemned their second

that vnder his owne name against that Synod,

will tell him, and that most truely, that
<hi>Gratian very often erres in citing sayings vnder the

this to be certainely one of those errors of <hi>Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi>
that which I haue already said of <hi>Charles,</hi> doth
make euident. For <hi>Charles</hi> would neither himselfe
endure, nor suffer others to beare that <hi>yoke of ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of Images,</hi> though imposed by the Pope:
neither would he beare or indure to heare of that

Monarchie,</hi> but himself imposed his owne yoke of
Soueraignty vpon the Pope, <hi>permitting him</hi> no
otherwise to haue Rome, and other Cities in <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
but so that the <hi>Soueraignty and highest dominion
should still remaine in himselfe.</hi> So both the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine

<hi>Issachars</hi> saying to bee none of his. <hi>Scioppius</hi> may

whether soeuer of them was Author of that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree,
certaine it is, that neither the one nor the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
can thence bee prooued to bee such a very
Asse or right <hi>Issachar</hi> as <hi>Scioppius</hi> fancieth. For in
that Decree, there is neither mention nor intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of bearing the yoke of the Popes temporall
Monarchie, wherein consisteth the very essence
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:9494:342"/>
of A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>inity. This yoke <hi>Charles</hi> as hath bin vndeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
demonstrated, could not endure, but he as I
haue shewed imposed vpon the Pope, the yoke
of his owne Soueraignty. The counsell of <hi>Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi>
also, was so farre from once dreaming of that
Papall yoke, that they directly subiect the Pope
to the yoke of the Emperours authority &amp; Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty,
saying<note n="s" place="margin">Conc. Trib. in prooemio.</note> of <hi>Arnulphus</hi> the Emperour, that
<hi>God had preferred him, omnibus ecclesiasticae sublimita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis

then certainely aboue the Popes. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
(which was indeede made by the Counsell<note n="t" place="margin">Ab Episcopis decretum illu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> factum iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, illa verba quae nobis est mater Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticae dignita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis.</note>,

Ecclesiasticae magistra rationis,</hi> may also bee the
Mistres of Ecclesiasticall reason; that is order &amp;

that such Ecclesiasticall Orders, Rites or Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
as that our mother Church imposeth on
vs, let vs with patience and humility obserue,
though otherwise the yoke of them be scarce to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable.
From whence to conclude any acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement,
that all, euen Kings and Emperours
must beare the yoke of the Popes temporall Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie,
it beseemed none but only such as <hi>Sciop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius</hi>
