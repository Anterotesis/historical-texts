            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The King ſtandeth in the field in the middest of his Army, and hath his Queene next vnto him and his nobilitie about him, with his ſouldiers to defend him in the forefront of the battell.

The Biſhops ſome name <hi>Alphius,</hi> ſome Fooles, ſome Archers, being placed next to the King and the Queene. The Knights ſome call horſemen, and they are men on horſebacke. The Rookes ſome call Elephants, carrying Towers vpon their backes, and men within the towers. The Pawnes ſome doe call footemen, and they are ſouldiours on foote, carrying (ſome of them) pikes, and otherſome har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuſhes, otherſome halberdes, and otherſome the iaueline or target. Our Engliſh Cheſſemen are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly made nothing like to theſe foreſaide faſhions: to wit, the King is made the higheſt or longeſt: the Queen is longeſt next vnto him. The Biſhop is made with a ſharp top, and clouen in the mids, not much vnlike to a Biſhops Miter. The Knight hath his top cut aſlope, as though he were dubbed Knight. The Rooke is made likeſt to the King and Queene, but that he is not ſo long. The Pawnes be made the ſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt and leaſt of all, and thereby they may beſt be kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen.

The other eight alſo next them on both ſides, are full of Pawnes. So that there are thirty two peeces, which is to each player ſixteene, whereof there be eight great ones and eight little. The roomes where euery one of them are ſet, I will name ſeates: the other which bee empty, I will name places or houſes. Thorowe the which (as well ſeates as places) the great Cheſſe men and ſmall do runne in their order, forward or backe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, to giue the mate to the contrary King. And to tell you, why there be ſo many houſes, and why ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more nor leſſe, it paſſeth my intelligence: and I thinke there will be found no other reſolution, but the wil of him that made the play, whom the beſt Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoriens record to be <hi>Exerſes</hi> the philoſopher, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe called <hi>Philometer,</hi> who to reproue the tiranny &amp; bad maners of <hi>Euilmerodach</hi> K. of Babylon, firſt deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed this game.

But whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it was, no doubt the inuention and wittineſſe thereof is greatly to be commended and followed.</p>

               <head>Certaine generall rules chiefly to be vſed in the Cheſſe play.</head>
               <p>Firſt, you muſt play nocaſt or draught in vaine, if it be not vpon great neceſsitie.</p>
               <p>Secondly, You muſt not make a fault.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, You muſt not be too haſtie to play.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, If you haue a good draught to make, looke if you haue not a better.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, If you haue aduantage, you may wel make a change, and yet not looſe it.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, If you haue aduantage, wherewith you may win the game, take heede that you ſpoile not your game, nor to abandon your King to win onelie a Pawne.</p>
               <p>Seuenthly, the principall thing is, to ſet your king in a ſure place, when he marcheth forth.</p>
               <p>Eightly, The two Pawnes which be on that ſide where the King is tranſported, muſt not be remoued but in great neceſsitie: for that, oftentimes the game is loſt by remoouing the Rookes Pawne or Knights Pawne one roume, becauſe that there the contrarie King findeth the way of the mate.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, Then you muſt goe abroad with your peeces, and not keep them incloſed at home.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, it is good, that the twoo Pawnes of the King and the Queene, be vpon their fourth houſes, and alſo thoſe of the Biſhops.</p>
               <p>It is to be noted for the well vnderſtanding of the marching forth of the Cheſſe men, that the Cheſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boord ought to be ſet in ſuch ſort, that the Rooke on
<pb facs="tcp:9714:6"/>
the right ſide bee ſette in a white place, and take the Cheſſe men which you will white or blacke. Further you muſt knowe the names of the peeces and of the places: for the Cheſſe men that are on the kings ſide, be named the Kings Cheſſe men, and likewiſe the kings houſes vnto the middeſt of the Cheſſe boorde. And from thence forward are the contrary kings hou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſes. As for example: The Pawne which is before thy king, is in the ſecond houſe of thy king. And if thou remoue him one ſtep, he ſhall be in the third, or if he go further, in the fourth houſe of the king: But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwardes and if he doe goe further yet, hee ſhall be in the fourth houſe of the King of the contrarie parte. And ſo of all the other Cheſse men on that ſide. The other ſide is that of the Queene, as well in Cheſse men, as in houſes, therefore for this cauſe is it needefull to haue before you a Cheſse boorde with the Cheſse men, for to ſee with your eyes the Arte which briefly ſhall be declared in this Treatiſe. And ſo, after preſuppoſing the game, you may beginne af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter two ſortes to play it as foloweth.</p>
               <div n="1" type="subpart">
                  <head>The firſt maner of playing.</head>
                  <p>The firſt manner is to beginne with the Kings Pawne: and the ſecond is to begin with the Queens Pawne. The firſt (according to my iudgement) is the beſt: that is to wit, to beginne with the Kings Pawne as farre as he may goe. And if the contrarie party play the kings Pawne as farre as he may, thou ſhalt play thy Kings knight to three houſes, from the kings biſhop. And if he play his kings knight to three houſes from the kings biſhop thou ſhalt take with
<pb facs="tcp:9714:7"/>
thy knight his kings pawne, and if hee take alſo thy pawne with his knight, play thy Queene before thy king.</p>
                  <p>And if he retire his knight into the third houſe of his kings biſhop, thou ſhalt giue him check with thy Queene, in turning her away from thy knight, the which thou ſhalt remooue into the third houſe of his Queenes biſhop. And then hee can not play ſo well, but that he ſhall looſe his Queene.</p>
                  <p>And if hee remooue not his knight, but play his Queene before his king, thou ſhalt take his knight with thy Queene: then hee will play his Queenes pawne one roume againſt thy knight, to the end that if thou remooue it from thence, hee may take thy Queene. Therefore thou ſhalt play thy Queenes Pawne as farre as he may go, and if he play the pawne of his kings biſhoppe one ſteppe, thou ſhalt play the pawne of thy kings biſhop as farre as he may go, and if he take thy knight with his Queenes pawne, thou ſhalt take his pawne, with that of thine, and if he play his other knight to the ſecond houſe of his Queene, thou ſhalt remooue thine to the third houſe of thy Queenes biſhop, by that meanes thy Queene ſhal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine ſafe.</p>
                  <p>And if the pawne of his kings biſhop do take thy pawne, thou ſhalt play thy knight to the fourth place of his queene, to take her, but if he ſet her in her third houſe, then ſhalt thou take his pawne with thine.</p>
                  <p>And if he take thy pawne with his knight, thou ſhalt ſet thy queens biſhop in the fourth houſe of thy kings biſhop, and ſo of force he ſhall loſe his knight: but if he take not thy pawne with his knight, hee is
<pb facs="tcp:9714:7"/>
like to leeſe his owne.</p>
                  <p>If in ſteed of taking thy pawne with his knight he take it with his queen, thou ſhalt take his with thine, which after ſhall bee taken with his knight. This done, thou ſhalt giue him checke with thy knight, in taking the pawne of his queenes biſhop, and he ſhall be forced to looſe his queenes rooke.</p>
                  <p>And if hee take not thy pawne, but (to ſaue his queene) placeth her in the third houſe of his queenes biſhop, thou ſhalt play thy kings biſhop, to the fourth houſe of his queenes knight for to take her, and if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteede of taking her, ſhe take thy biſhop, thou ſhalt giue him check with thy knight in taking the pawne of his queens biſhop, then ſhalt thou take his queene, for the gaine is much greater than of the rooke.</p>
                  <p>And if in ſteede of placing his queene in the third houſe of his biſhop, he place her in the fourth, thou ſhalt ſet thy queens biſhop in the third roome of thy King for to take her.</p>
                  <p>And if hee giue the checke with his queene in the fourth houſe of his rooke, thou ſhalt couer it with thy biſhop, by which meanes hee can doe no more but remooue her into the third houſe of his biſhop, and thou ſhalt play the pawne of thy queenes knight, as farre as he may goe, for to take his queene, then he ſhall be forced to ſet his queene in the third houſe of his biſhop, and thou ſhalt play thy kings biſhop into the fourth houſe of his Knight, to take his Queene, and if ſhe take it, thou haſt thy inſtruction in the laſt Article before. Then can he not play it well, for if it become to pillage or ſpoile of queenes, thou ſhalt haue ſtill the aduantage of the checke of thy Knight
<pb facs="tcp:9714:8"/>
for to take his rooke. So ſhall he be weaker both in ſmall and great peeces, as ſhall be declared in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle following.</p>
                  <p>And if hee ſet his queene in the third houſe of his King, thou ſhalt yet giue him checke with thy Knight, according to the laſt inſtruction. But if he ſet her in the third place of his Kings Knight (which is the beſt that hee coulde play) yee ſhall ſpoile toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your Queenes, then ſhalt thou giue the checke with thy Knight, in taking the pawne of his queens biſhop, to take his rooke.</p>

                  <head>The ſecond maner of playing it.</head>
                  <p>The ſecond manner of play, is to beginne with the Queenes pawne. If therefore thou beginne, thou ſhalt remooue thy Queenes pawne, as farre as he may goe, and if hee play his as farre as hee may, thou ſhalt play the pawne of thy queenes biſhop as farre as he may goe: and if he take it, play thy Kings pawne as farre as hee may goe: he then will play the pawne of his queenes Knight, as farre as hee may to ſaue his other pawne, and thou ſhalt play the pawne of thy Queenes Rooke two ſteppes: and if he take it with his pawne, thou ſhalt take his other pawne with thy Kings biſhop, then muſt hee of force take that Knights pawne, in playing thy Queenes knight into the third houſe of thy biſhop, on that ſide: for thou ſhalt haue three peeces all prepared to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
                  <p>But if he take not thy rookes Pawne, but play the
<pb facs="tcp:9714:8"/>
Pawne of his Queenes biſhop, thou ſhalt take his pawne with that of thy rooke, and he will take thine with that of his biſhop. Then play the Pawne of thy Queenes knight, and if hee take it, thou ſhalt take with thy kings biſhop his knights Pawne, and ſhalt ſay checke, which hee will couer with his queenes biſhop, and with thy queene thou ſhalt take his other Pawne. And if he take thy biſhop with his, thou ſhalt take his with thy queene, and ſhalt ſay checke, and if he couer it with his queene, it will be no great daunger to ſpoile them both together, becauſe the pawne of his queenes rooke, being without compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, ſhal leeſe himſelfe of force, if thou prepare thither thy Knight or thy biſhop.</p>
                  <p>But if with his biſhop he take not thine, but play his queenes Knight to the third houſe of his biſhop, to take thy queens pawne, thou ſhalt play thy queens biſhop to the third houſe of the King: and if hee play his queenes Rooke in the ſeate of the Knight, then remooue thy queene (out of the diſcouerie) to the fourth houſe of thy queenes Rooke, and if he ſet his Queene in the third houſe of his Knight, thou ſhalt remooue thy Queenes Knight to the third houſe of the biſhop.</p>
                  <p>This done, thy biſhop ſhall kill his Knight, and his Queene ſhall put to death thy Biſhop, then thy Queene ſhall take his Rookes pawne who will ſet himſelfe out of the way for feare of feeling the heauy ſtrokes of thy queene. And in ſo doing ſuffereth his King to fall into checke, and yet for ſome other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, thou ſhalt remoue thy Kings Knight in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſecond houſe of thy King, then ſhalt thou
