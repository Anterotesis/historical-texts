         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>For the Rams horns blowing, they ſhall not endure the

            <p>This is thy caſe, O <hi>England!</hi> and the Nations round

            <p>Your ſtink is aſcended, and the cry of your iniquities
gone up into the ears of the Lord of Sabbath, who will
ariſe and plead with thee, O <hi>Chriſtendom!</hi> in one Nation

and gone after ſtrange fleſh, and from the life of the
holy Apoſtles and Prophets, and gone into the killing,
devouring, and deſtroying one another; So that an ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
conſumption is determined from the Lord to come
upon thee, and the whole Earth, which ſhall ſpoile your
glory, and deface your beauty.</p>
            <p>For what Fighting Quarreling, Striving, Tearing,

Weapons, which the true Saints, Miniſters and Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers

Light;</hi> And ſince them the Wolfe hath got into the
Sheeps cloathing, which is to be rent off, and thou ſtript

is bringing to paſſe, whoſe work thou canſt not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand.</p>
            <p>For all thy Threats, Bonds, Priſons, nor Arm of fleſh
will not terrifie nor hinder the birth born of the Spirit
from doing the will of God; <hi>the corner Stone</hi> is ſet upon
thy head, and the little ſtone cut out of the Mountains
without hands ſhall fill the whole Earth, it ſhall bruiſe the
feet of the Image whereon the Image ſtandeth; and the

            <p>And Sion ſhall ariſe and ſhake her ſelf out of the duſt,
and put on her beautiful Garments which long hath lain
in the duſt mourning, yea, thou Daughter of Sion ſhall
rejoyce and break forth into ſinging, and the daies of thy

got up ſince the Apoſtles daies, thy Weapons cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
thee, nor be able to withhold nor alter the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination

to be poured forth upon thee without mixture, who haſt

               <hi>ſat as a Queen,</hi> and ſaid in thy heart, <hi>thou ſhalt ſee no ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,</hi>
which haſt lived in the many mixtures, out of the
ſimplicity, and out of the truth, and ſo out of the ſervice
of the only true God, who is a Spirit and will be worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
in the Spirit and in the Truth, and ſo haſt grown
ſubtle, lewd and ſtubborn, clamorous; and to keep up
thy falſe Church, and falſe Worſhip, haſt invented <hi>Wracks,
Tortures, Priſons, Inquiſitions</hi> to torment and afflict others;
So ſhalt thou know thy bed of ſorrows, who being out of
the Truth and Service of God, haſt ſerved the divers
luſts and pleaſures, contrary to the Spirit, and contrary
to the Truth, which is the Light.</p>
            <p>Therefore, O <hi>Chriſtendom!</hi> conſider what thou haſt
brought up thy Children to, and what thou art training
them up in, that Chriſts Voice haſt not heard nor heareſt,
ſo are running after the ſtrangers, having itching ears,
whoſe heart is even ſurfeited with delights and pleaſures,
and drunk with the blood of the Saints; But into a bed
of torment thou muſt be caſt, and thy companions with
thee, and bitter lamentation thou muſt know, who haſt
lived in pleaſures on Earth, and been wanton, and faired
deliciouſly every day <hi>Dives-like.</hi> thou muſt alſo drink of
the ſame cup which thou haſt filled unto others, which
ſhall be filled unto thee from the hand of the Lord who
is Juſt and Righteous; And doſt thou think that thy car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Weapons will ever be able to defend thee, who haſt
committed ſpiritual whoredoms, and led many into cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity?</p>
            <p>O<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the cup of the Lords fierce indignation thou
canſt turn from, and not drink of it, who haſt drunk the
blood of his Saints, And the ſons of <hi>Sion</hi> more comparable

heart ake thinkeſt thou when thou ſhalt drink it? and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
thy portion from the Lord, which in one day will
come upon thee, and them that have committed Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
with thee, whom the worthy Name of Chriſt haſt
blaſphemed, and called your ſelves <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and cauſed
his Truth to be evil ſpoken of, &amp; his Name to be blaſphem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
through thy lewdneſs, adulteries and whoredoms, who
ſhall be made bare and naked, and thy lewdneſſe diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62089:4"/>
the Lord will bring it to paſſe, and plead his cauſe
with thee, who haſt the face of an impudent whoriſh wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
hardened in wickedneſſe and deceit; thy day of
deſolation and widowhood haſteneth on thee, for ſtrong
is the Lord which will perform this; And haſt called thy
ſelfe a Church, and Church-members, and haſt told peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
out of thee there is no ſalvation nor ſafety; and ſo
haſt beguiled the unſtable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But are they in ſafety that are
in the Adultery, Uncleanneſſe, Defiled, where the whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
have been committed, and the bed hath been defil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?
For what whoredoms like it in the whole World that
have been committed in thee, and haſt brought up thy
Children in, thou <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> adulterated from the life
of thy Maker, from the life of Righteouſneſſe, and the
life of Holineſſe, and yet telleſt of thy ſafety, and that
there is no ſafety out of this Church, who haſt cauſed the
Name of Chriſt to be an abhorring before men, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Nations, that have been any thing ſober minded, or
have had a ſearch and inquiry after him, after Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and after Truth; or to know of his waies, his teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
the beloved of the Father, whom the Soul loves, and
ſo to know their ſouls beloved, which thou haſt cauſed to be
ſtumbled at and offended; And ſo haſt cauſed the worthy
Name of Chriſt to be as a <hi>by-word</hi> among the Nations that
knows him not, and to be evil ſpoken of among the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</hi>
What ſtinks have proceeded from thy Inquiſitions,
<hi>Wracks, Tortures, and Priſons,</hi> disjointing mens bones, and
burning their fleſh about Religion, Church and Miniſtry;
What havock hath there been made in thee, O <hi>Chriſtendom!</hi>
and in all the parts thereof, of the honeſt ſimple hearted
Lambs of Chriſt ſince the Apoſtles daies, which is even
dreadful to conſider what a weight lies upon thee, what
Tearing, Rending, and deſtroying hath been in thee and
by thee of the harmleſs flock of Chriſt; Where hath
been the like heard of among any people in any part of
the World, beſides the like things that have been done in
thee? So that the Name of the Holy Child Jeſus hath
ſuffered by thee which thou haſt blaſphemed, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
commanded to Wrack, Torture, Burn, Impriſon,
nor make Inquiſitions, but bid <hi>love Enemies;</hi> Neither
did his Miniſters, Meſſengers, or Servants give forth

any ſuch command, but ſaid <hi>overcome evil with good;</hi> And ſo haſt
thou kicked againſt reproof and hateſt to be reformed, but the
Lords judgments will purſue thee, who is juſt, and overtake
thee, to recompence thee who is mighty, and the ſtroak of his
hand thou canſt not eſcape, nor withhold the fury of his indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
(except thou repent) which will preſſe thee down into
the Lake, where the Beaſt, falſe Prophet, and them that have
committed lewdneſſe with thee are to be taken and caſt in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live
together; and thou the great whore judged, that have
ſtood up againſt the true Prophet, and rejected the Light and
Life of men Chriſt Jeſus, at whoſe Name every knee muſt bow
and Tongue confeſſe, through whom the ſons of <hi>Adam</hi> driven
out from God, muſt have their redemption up to God again,
who is the way, and there is not another; who took not upon
him the nature of Angels, but the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> whom the
Angels are to worſhip, the Anointed of God, the Saviour of
mankind, the true Light of the World, that lighteth every man
that cometh into the World, that all men through him might
believe and be ſaved; For he that believeth is not condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but he that believeth not is condemned already, the <hi>Light</hi>
is his condemnation; and who comes to the <hi>light,</hi> obtains life,
that life which hath been Apoſtatized and Eſtranged from ſince
the Apoſtles daies, which alſo is the ſalvation, to be led out of
darkneſſe, out of ſin and tranſgreſſion, which hath long reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
