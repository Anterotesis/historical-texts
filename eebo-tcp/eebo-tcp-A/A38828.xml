         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>AN EPISTLE OF <hi>MARGARET EVERARD</hi> TO The People called <hi>Q<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>AKERS,</hi> AND The Miniſtry among them:</head>
            <head type="sub">More eſpecially to ſuch of them to whom ſhe hath been par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly known, and who are concerned for her, as if ſhe were loſt and fallen from Truth.

            <p>TO all who are heartily concerned for me, fearing I am loſt or fallen from Truth. I know no reaſon for ſuch fear, you might have taken the freedom to have viſited me one way or other, and let me have known your reaſons. Well, becauſe I believe ſome do love me, and deſire to know how it is with me, I now tell you, and that to the Honour and Praiſe of my
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:35681:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
good God, It is as well, and better with me than ever it was, and the Lord's Preſence and Power is with me. Publick and private loving Friends, I had rather not have writ, but left it to time and to the Lord who will plead my Innocent Cauſe. Now to the beſt of my remembrance, few have been ſo kind to come and ſee me, but have taken things upon report, and have rather paſſed Sentence and reported again. But all is little to me, the more they have done, the more the Lord is to me: Nay, and I can ſay, I rather rejoyce, not that they are ſo unfair as to Judge from a bare report, but that the Lord is pleaſed to accept of me as a Sufferer for my Lord Jeſus Chriſt's ſake. And now my Friends I think to tell you, how I have proceeded, or what I did that was the cauſe of this diſturbance. Firſt, I was not ſatisfied con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſtate of things as we are a people, I have been diſſatisfied for ſome Years, about the Miniſtry and the ſhortneſs of my own Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and the Groſs Errors in our Friends Books, and I cryed to the Lord many times in ſecret, but durſt not pretend to find much fault, only ſometimes a little to my Husband about the Miniſters; but I knew my ſelf was to blame as well as others, but was not full clear in my Underſtanding. Neither was I fit to ſtand a ſtorm, as I did believe it would be, and as I have found it to be, and may yet find more. Such was the great diſſatisfaction I met with, that I was much backward to ſpeak in Meetings, and have ſo been for ſome Years laſt paſt, for ſome reaſons I could give, but one was, I had ſome ſmall Glimps of ſome matters of Doctrine which I for my part had never ſpoke of, nor ever heard any of our Friends ſpeak of as I remember, but did not ſpeak at any time for the reaſons aforeſaid, nor could I have ſtrength, until my good God gave me ſtrength; then I began in a great deal of fear, I did ſtammer a little ſometimes, and ſo I do ſtill, as the Lord pleaſeth; but no ſooner did I ſo do, but many roſe up againſt me, and my Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; it being new Doctrine to them, ſome ſaid I was gone from my former Innocency and ſimplicity; others ſaid, I Preached <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>George Keith</hi>'s Doctrine, but the Doctrine of neither <hi>George Keith,</hi> nor any other Man's Doctrine but Chriſt's, though I love and eſteem <hi>George Keith</hi> for his faithful Teſtimony to the Doctrine of Chriſt; ſome ſaid they could find in their hearts to oppoſe me, others ſaid they could or would pull me down, ſome could not ſtay to hear, and ſaid it is pitiful ſtuff: by what I ſaid you may Judge what Doctrine I did Preach: firſt ſome ſaid, <hi>What Good can a Chriſt without do us? Let us mind the Light within that is enough for us, and not to trouble our ſelves with</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:35681:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>a Chriſt without,</hi> and denying the Reſurrection. <hi>And calling the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it Wiſdom, and a feeding upon the Tree of Knowledge and Scripture notions,</hi> and did tell us, <hi>in Meetings our Friends did not mind Scripture noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons at first.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to be ſhort as the matter will bear, I have been and am a great ſufferer, I count, for Truth. And Friends, I would have us conſider what is the reaſon our Hearts are ſo Ignorant; Oh truly! I may juſtly take a part and ſay, the Leaders of the People have cauſed them to err. Oh! I have often thought I could bring them no farther than I was come my ſelf. O Friends! we have been in a great extream, and in as great as many others; for they Preach Chriſt without, but if they believe him within they have been ſhort of Preaching him within, or directing the minds of the people to the Divine Light of Chriſt, by which they might have been lead to look with the eye of their Souls to Chriſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and in his Light to ſee the great Love of God in his Son, and what God did by him for poor Mankind, and what he is now a doing in Heaven without us for us, and what he is ſtill to do for us at the great and laſt day of Judgment.</p>
            <p>I ſay, the People and the Teachers, or very many of them, have been and are ſhort in this weighty matter, and have taken up a Reſt ſhort of true Faith in Chriſt as he was ſent to dye for us. I do declare a bare Hiſtorical Faith of theſe things is not ſufficient; Oh! no, no, it is a Living Faith wrought in the Heart by the Spirit and Power of God. It is God's Gift, and what our bleſſed Lord Jeſus Chriſt did purchaſe by his Death and Sufferings, and ſhedding of his moſt precious Blood; and bleſſed be his pure Eternal Holy Name, he is the diſpencer of it, and of all other bleſſed Gifts and Graces. I ſay, they come through him to us and for his ſake, and although it is ſaid, all Men have not Faith; yet thoſe ought to have it who are teachers of others. For I do declare, thoſe who Preach it and direct to a Living Faith in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, ſo as to beget any Soul into it, ought to have Faith in ſome degree themſelves; and they that have it not, ought to uſe all means whereby they may attain to it, becauſe it is impoſſible to pleaſe God without it as the Holy Scripture declareth.</p>
            <p>And I ſay, it is not enough to believe in God, as he is the great Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and Upholder of all things; but we muſt believe in the Lord Jeſus
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:35681:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Chriſt as he taught himſelf, <hi>ye believe in God belieae alſo in me.</hi> Here I underſtand they did believe in God, and conſequently in his Light in their Hearts, which was in order that they might <gap reason="illegible: scratched out" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> in him alſo. As I ſaid before it is a heart-belief wrought by the Spirit of God, as it is written, <hi>with the Heart man believes unto Righteouſneſs, and with the Mouth Confeſſion is made unto Salvation.</hi> And as I ſaid, ſo I ſay ſtill, we ought to uſe all means poſſible that God hath ordained, to believe, ſo one great and neceſſary means is, Reading the Holy Scriptures, and hearing the Doctrine of this great Myſtery Preached, to wit, of Faith in Chriſt Cruciſied, in which all is included that is neceſſary to our Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and as we uſe our endeavours in Reading and Hearing, and as thoſe that ſpeak by the help and aſſiſtance of the good Spirit of God, and they that hear are gathered to the ſame in their own. Hearts, as they come to meditate in what they Read and Hear may come to have their Underſtandings opened at the time of Hearing or Reading; for the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Faith comes by Hearing, and Hearing by the Word Preached<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>But mark, if there be not a ſeed of Faith in the Hearts of thoſe that Hear, it will not profit, and it was the manner, and is of Chriſt's Miniſters, to Preach Faith in Chriſt Crucified, his Reſurrection and Aſcenſion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heaven being a Mediator and Advocate with the Father for us, and Juſtification by his Blood, or by the Blood of his Croſs, to wit, that Blood which was ſhed on the Croſs, and let out of his bleſſed ſide with a Spear by the Souldier, as it is written, <hi>one of the Souldiers pierced his ſide, and forthwith came there out Water and Blood;</hi> and this brings to mind what I have further Read, <hi>there are three which bare record in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghoſt, and theſe three are one;</hi> and three <hi>which bare record on Earth, the Water, the Spirit, and the Blood, theſe three agree in one,</hi> and are not to be divided, though they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed, ſo I ſay the Apoſtles and Miniſters Preached Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Doctrine of Salvation by him, and whoever brought any other Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, were to be denyed, and the Chriſtians were to ſeparate from them, and ſo I think they ought to do now.</p>
            <p>Some there were that denyed the Lord that bought them, and the great Doctrine of the Reſurrection, and ſo ſome do ſtill, and the Man Chriſt his coming to Judge the World, at the laſt day of Judgment; that great and notable day of the Lord, as the Scriptures ſay, <hi>And he</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:35681:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>ſhall gather all Nations together before him, then ſhall our dead Bodies be raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> as the Scripture ſaith, <hi>He ſhall change our vile or low Bodys,</hi> viz. <hi>The Bodys of the Saints, and ſhall make them like unto his Glorious Body: Then God will Judge the World by that Man whom he hath ordained,</hi> whereof he hath given us aſſurance, in that he hath raiſed him from the dead. Pray Friends let us Read the Scriptures, and the Lord give us an underſtanding, and help us againſt the corruptions of our Nature, and the defilements of Sin, which we derived from our firſt Parents; for as the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>by Nature we are Children of VVrath;</hi> and as <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>I was born in Iniquity, and in Sin did my Mother conceive me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh! what cauſe have we to be humbled, and lye at the feet of our bleſſed Lord Jeſus Chriſt and ſay, Lord help us and forgive us our treſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and this we beg and ask not for our Holineſs, or any Works of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs that we have done or can do; though helped by the Spirit of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt's ſake; for although the Spirit of God is a Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and undefiled Spirit, and we have a manifeſtation of it; yet ſuch is the frailty of our Nature, that we keep not to it at all times. So I ſay, it is not for any thing that we can do, or do do; as the Merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious cauſe of our Salvation, or acceptance with God, but it is the Righteouſneſs and Obedience of Chriſt, and a Living Faith in what he did and ſuffered for us, without us, and what he is now doing for us in Heaven without us, and what he will do for us at the laſt and great day, as hath been ſaid, and that without us.</p>
            <p>I ſay again, it is not our good Works that is the Meritorious caſue of our acceptance, but God's free Love in his Son; and our good Works are the effect of God's Love in Chriſt, and Chriſt's Love in giving him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to dye for us, and thereby hath purchaſed and procured theſe Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Gifts and Graces of Faith, Repentance, and Obedience; and he only is worthy of all Honour and Praiſe, who with a Victorious Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence indured for poor Sinners the Croſs, and deſpiſed the ſhame, and is ſate down at the Right Hand of God, and is there an ever-living High-Prieſt, who is touched with a feeling of our Infirmities, our bleſſed Mediator and Advocate.</p>
            <p>Oh! how ſad is it, that any ſhould make light, or ſlight theſe great Truths, as too many do, and have done, to my Knowledge, and to my
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:35681:4"/>
great grief, and the grief of many; to wit, as I have heard ſome ſay, <hi>What good can a Chriſt without do us? Let us mind the Light within, that is ſufficient to our Salvation without any thing elſe:</hi> and much more that I have omitted for brevity ſake.</p>
            <p>But I ſay, this is lamentable that our Meetings are clog'd with ſuch ſtuff; nay, I cannot yet ſee how it will be otherwiſe, notwithſtanding the fair pretences ſome have made; but inſtead of ſuppreſſing and ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping them, they are rather tollerated and incouraged, and have their Liberty to Preach and Pray in Meetings, without hindrance; but thoſe that bring the Doctrine of our bleſſed Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and he to be the object of our Faith, the Man Chriſt as in Heaven without us; I ſay, theſe cannot have the ſame Liberty, but muſt be oppoſed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted; and yet at the ſame time, theſe that thus oppoſe and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict the Faith of Chriſt, ſhall ſay, they have it, and had it, before they came amongſt Friends, and yet wanted Peace and were in their Sins; the which if they had had it, the leaſt grain of it, to wit, a living Faith, it would cleanſe them from their Envy, and Malice, and other Sins. Oh! but the wicked have it not, though they pretend to it, yet they are without the evidence of it, which is good Works; for as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Faith without Works is dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſay again, It is ſaid that people ſhould run into ſuch extreams, one fort laying all without, and others laying all within<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now I ſay, we ought not to divide Chriſt, or to exclude him from being within Men and Women, and to be without alſo; within as he is God, for as God he is Omnipreſent, every where in all and over all; but as he is both God and the glorified Man in our Nature; he is now in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven without us, in him the fullneſs dwells; and out of his fulneſs as a rich Fountain do we all receive Grace and Glory, and no good thing will be withheld from them that believe and Love, and manifeſt their love to him by their obedience to him: as he ſaid, <hi>If ye love me keep my Commandments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lord help us, and haſten that the choſen of God in Chriſt may be gathered, and that thoſe Sheep which are not yet gathered, may be gathered. Oh! ſurely ſaith the true Sheep and Church of Chriſt; <hi>give us whole Chriſt, not divided.</hi> Oh! for we wanted him every way, we wanted him to dye for us, to ſpeak and ſatisfie Divine Juſtice, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:35681:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to riſe again for our Juſtification. And we wanted him inwardly, to give us the Faith and Comfort of what he hath done and ſuffered for us outwardly; and by his holy Spirit and Grace, to renew and Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie us throughout, in Spirit, Soul and Body; who is our Juſtice and perfect Saviour and Sanctifier, as he is both God and Man, and with reſpect both to his outward and inward Coming.</p>
            <p>And Friends, leaſt any ſhould Imagine or ſay, this is not her Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, nor would ſhe have put to Print, without being put on or advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by ſome; In anſwer, I tell you, it was my own Act, without the perſwaſion of any; and if it were needful, I could produce ſufficient Witneſſes, who have heard me ſay often, I ſhall not be eaſie, until I have written ſomething, that all that have any true love to me, might underſtand how it is with me, and the Reaſon of the diſturbance which hath been. But ſome may further object and ſay, it looked bad, and contrary to Friends Order, and that I ſhould have ſent it at firſt to the Meeting at <hi>London,</hi> that Friends might have given their approbation, and might have Printed it by Friends Printer.</p>
            <p>I readily confeſs according to ſuch Order I ſhould, and it would have pleaſed me beſt, but I could not perſwade my ſelf it ſhould ever have been Printed: To me it appears it would be caſt out, for I remember a paper ſent to the Meeting from a Woman Friend living in <hi>Notting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamſhire</hi> or <hi>Darbyſhire,</hi> whoſe paper was rejected by them, ſo would mine: ſome may ſay, thou might have tryed, but I was not willing to give them trouble, or my ſelf the diſappointment. Well, I have done it, and am ſatisfied, and hope it may ſatisfie ſome others, for whoſe ſake chiefly I did it. And as for thoſe, or ſuch as will not be ſatisfied, I cannot help it, it is no diſappointment to me, for I never did nor can propoſe to ſatisfie all, nor can I tell who ever did. Some that loves me ſay, keep Meetings, and ſpeak or teach thoſe things, that is, <hi>The Doctrine of Chriſt Crucified,</hi> together <hi>with the Light within,</hi> &amp;c. But I find it will not be endured, except I could be a Hypocrite, and jumble and confound things as ſome have done and yet do, as I my ſelf Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly have done; and ſometimes to pleaſe others, or rather for fear of open oppoſition; but I pray God forgive me for Jeſus Chriſt his ſake, and preſerve me and all the ſincere towards him for time to come; for I am well aſſured the words of our bleſſed Lord Jeſus are true, and ſhall be fulfilled in the time appointed, to wit, <hi>Whoever is aſhamed of</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:35681:5"/>
               <hi>me, and of my Words, of him will the Son of Man be aſhamed, when he comes in the Glory of his Father.</hi> And Friends, I have ſeen great hurt in openly oppoſing each other; Oh! ſurely I have reaſon to ſay ſo; I ſay ſome have been much offended, and others have gone out of the way for the preſent, but the Lord my God for his Son Jeſus Chriſt his ſake, bring them again to himſelf, that by a Living Faith in Chriſt, they may obtain forgiveneſs, and know the work of Regeneration and Sanctification, in and by the Power and Spirit of Chriſt in their Hearts.</p>
            <p>So with my dear Love to all that Love our Lord Jeſus Chriſt in Truth, and ſincerely believe in him, and manifeſt their Truth and Love to him, by obedience to his Commands; I ſay to all theſe, I deſire that Grace, Mercy, and Peace from God our Father, and from our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, may be multiplyed and abound in them. Farewell.</p>
