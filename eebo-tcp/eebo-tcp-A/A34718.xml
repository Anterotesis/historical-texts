            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>The sword decides the difference, and gave the two Kings, and their eldest Sonnes Prisoners. The person now as well as the regall power, thus

                  <p>Thus equall Authority with the same power, is ever fatall (wee see) to all great actions: For to fit minds to so even a temper, that they should not have some motions of dissenting is impossible.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mountford</hi> having thus broken all faith with his confederates, and duty to his Soveraigne, left the path of moderation and wisedome, to come to the King, by that of pride and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust. To him, he telleth, that his armes and ends had no other object ever

but order of the State, and ease of the people, that hee did not in this, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry affection against duty, but well knew how to reine his desires, to his just power, and so no lesse to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties content, if hee would bee ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; which was to command the Fortes and Castles of his now oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site <hi>Glocester,</hi> and the rest into his hands. It was hard to this King thus to take a Law from his inferiour, but necessity in Soveraigne affaires doth often force away all formality; and therefore this poore Prince, who now at the Victors discretion, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to have beene onely raised to shew the inconstancy of fortune and vanity of man, suited himselfe with incomparable wisedome according to the necessity of the time; Neither did humility wrong Majesty, when there was no other meanes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Spirits so insolent, but dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling. Hee therefore summoneth in his owne person the forts of his fastest friends, to yeeld to his greatest ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. This hee enters in shew as his

lodging, but in effect his prison, and saw himselfe forced to arme against his friends, and to receive now Law from him, to whom hee lately thought to give it. Thus <hi>Leycester</hi> is become a darling of the Common rout, who easily change to every new Master, but the best durst not saile along his fortune, by the light of his glory: Christall that fairely glistereth doth easily breake, and as the ascent of usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping royalty is slippery, so the top is shaking, and the fall fearefull. To hold this man then at the entry of his false felicity fully happy, was but to give the name of the Image, to the mettle that was not yet molten, for by this, the imprisoned Prince was escaped, and fast assured of <hi>Glocester,</hi> by the knot of his great mind, and discontent, and both with the torne remainder of the loyall Army united, and by speedy march arrived unloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for, neere <hi>Evesham,</hi> to the unar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med troupes of the secure Rebels, whom they instantly assailed, for it was no fit season to give time, when

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mong all sorts of humane Writers, there is none that have done more profit, or deserved greater praise, then they who have committed to faithfull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of Histories, either the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of mighty States, or the lives and acts of famous men: for by describing the order and passages of these two, and what events hath followed, what coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sailes they have set forth unto us, not onely precepts, but lively patternes, both for private dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
<pb facs="tcp:51490:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and for affaires of State: whereby in short time young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men may be instructed; and old men more fully furnished with experience then the longest age of man can afford. And therefore <hi>Cicero</hi> reporteth that <hi>L. Lucullus,</hi> when hee went from <hi>Rome</hi> to make warre against <hi>Mithridates,</hi> was altogether unskilfull in Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary services: yet in the time of his Navigation hee so exercised himselfe, what with conference, and what with reading of Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, that when hee came into <hi>Asia,</hi> by the judgement and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of that great King, hee was preferred before all the Commanders that were before him. Hereupon when <hi>Alexander Severus</hi> did deliberate of any weighty matter, hee would espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially take advise of men skilfull
<pb facs="tcp:51490:28"/>
in Histories, and not without good cause: for if (as <hi>Afranius</hi> saith) experience hath begot wisedome, and memory as a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath brought it forth; who are to bee better accompted then they whose memory is as it were a rich store house, of the experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces not of one age or Countrey, but of all times and of all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And therefore it is no great marvaile that <hi>Zenobia,</hi> who after the death of her Husband <hi>Odo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus</hi> tooke upon her the State, not onely insulted upon the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines,</hi> but held the <hi>Arabians,</hi> the <hi>Sarizens,</hi> the <hi>Armenians,</hi> and other fierce and intractible people, in such obedience, that although shee were both a woman and a <hi>Barbarian,</hi> yet they never stirred against her: for shee had perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly read the <hi>Romaine</hi> History in

Greeke, and also had her selfe abridged the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> and all the <hi>Orientall</hi> Histories, whereby shee attained the highest pitch both of wisedom and authority: for examples are of greater force to stirre unto vertue, then bare precepts, insomuch as <hi>Cicero</hi> said, that nothing could bee taught well without example. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> (as <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> writeth) did use upon festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall dayes to present unto their Sonnes certaine d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:51490:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Countrey-woman, who being hard favoured, and fearing least shee should bring forth children like her selfe, got many faire and beautifull pictures, which shee did dayly and stedfastly behold: the meaning whereof is, that by setting before us the acts and lives of excellent men, it is the readiest way to fashion our qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities according to the same.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon <hi>Cicero</hi> doth rightly call History the witnesse of times, the light of truth, the life of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, and the messenger of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity. Hereby wee are armed against all the rage and rashnesse of Fortune: and hereby wee may seeme (in regard of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of things) to have travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in all Countries, to have lived in all ages, and to have beene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant in all affaires. Neither
<pb facs="tcp:51490:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is that the least benefit of Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that it preserveth eternally, both the glory of good men, and shame of evill. Some Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers doe deny, that glory is to bee desired: for vertue (say they) is a reward unto it selfe, and must not bee respected for the vaine and titular blastes of glory: yet in writing these things, they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect that especially, which they especially deprave. And indeed there is no man hath so horny hart-strings, (as <hi>Persius</hi> speaketh) who is not tickled with some pleasure of praise, againe there is no man of so flinty a forehead, who is not touched with some feare of infamy and shame. Doe wee thinke that the valiant soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier thinketh no toile too tough, but boldly adventureth the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of all happes, because hee is
<pb facs="tcp:51490:30"/>
weary of his life? death commeth by nature to all men alike, onely with difference of memory with posterity.</p>
                  <p>And I would thinke that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties at the first were builded, Lawes made, and many things invented for the use of men, chiefly for desire of glory: which humour except the old Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of Common-wealths, had thought necessary, they would never have fostered it as they did, with Garlandes, Statutes, Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies and Triumphes, in which notwithstanding it is but tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary and short; but in Histories of worth it is onely perpetuall. This <hi>Cicero</hi> perceiving hee dealt with <hi>Lucejus</hi> to commit his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the monuments of his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings: and <hi>Plinie</hi> the younger did wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

in the Histories of <hi>Cornelius Tacitus,</hi> because hee did foresee that they should never decay.</p>
                  <p>But these are such as are not led away with a lust, either to slatter or to deface, whereby the credite of History is quite over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne. Yet the endeavour to curry favour, is more easily disliked, as bearing with it an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen note of servility; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Alexander</hi> when hee heard <hi>Aristobulus</hi> read many things that hee had written of him farre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove truth, as hee was sailing the floud <hi>Hidaspis,</hi> he threw the booke into the River, and said, that hee was almost moved to send <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulus</hi> after for his servile dealing; but envious carping carrieth a counterfeit shew of liberty, and thereby findeth the better accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51490:35"/>
of good strength and agility of body, skilfull in armes, and of a ready dispatch: joyntly shewing himselfe both earnest and advised in all his actions. Hee was quick and present in conceit, forward in attempt, coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious in execution, and most times fortunate in event. There was no great place of imployment and charge, which hee would not rather affect for glory, then refuse either for perill, or for paines; and in service hee often proved himselfe not onely a skilfull Commander by giving dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: but also a good Souldier in u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing his weapon, adventuring further in person sometimes, then policy would permit; his expences were li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall and honourable, yet not excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the measure of his receipts; hee was very courteous and familiar re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectively towards all men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereby hee procured great reputation and regard, especially with those of the meaner sort: for high humilities take such deepe roote in the mindes of the multitude, that they are more

strongly drawne by unprofitable cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesies then by churlish benefits. In all the changes of his estate, hee was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most one and the same man: in adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity never daunted, in prosperity never secure: retaining still his Majesty in the one, and his mildnesse in the other: neither did the continuance of his raigne bring him to a proud po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To some men hee seemed too greedy of glory, making small difference of the meanes whereby hee attained it: and indeed this honour in noble minds is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> most hardly over-ruled, and oftentimes it draweth even the wisest awry. But before I proceed any further in descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:51490:36"/>
either the qualities, or acts of this Earle, I must write something of the Raigne of King <hi>Richard</hi> the second, his Cosin <hi>Germaine:</hi> so farre forth as the follies of the one, were either causes or furtherances of the fortunes of the other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Richard</hi> Sonne to <hi>Edward</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> a little before deceased, was after the death of King <hi>Edward</hi> the third, crowned King over this Realme of <hi>England,</hi> in the eleventh yeare of his age: at which yeares the mind of man is like to the potters earth, apt to bee wrought into any fashion, and which way soever it hardneth by custome, it will sooner breake then bend from the same. Now the governance of the King at the first was committed to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Bishops, Earles, Barons, and Iustices. But either upon nicenes to discontent the King, or negligence to discharge their duty, every one was more ready with pleasant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits to delight him, then with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable counsaile to doe him good:
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:51490:37"/>
for smooth and pleasing speeches need small endeavour, and alwayes findeth favour: whereas to advise that which is meet, is a point of some paines, and many times a thanklesse office. Hereupon two dangerous e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils did ensue; flattery brake in, and private respects did passe under pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like pretences.</p>
                  <p>In the third yeare of his Raigne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it was thought meete that this charge should bee committed to one man, to avoid thereby the unnecessary wast of the Treasure of the Realme, by allowing yearely stipend unto many. So by the whole consent of the Nobility and Commons assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled together in Parliament, this of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice was deputed to Lord <hi>Thomas Beauchampe</hi> Earle of <hi>Warwick,</hi> and a competent pension was assigned him, out of the Kings Exchequer for his paines. But the King being now plunged in pleasure, did immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately bend himselfe to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring and advancing of certaine persons, which were both reprovea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51490:37"/>
in life, and generally abhorred in all the Realme, and this was the cause of two great inconveniences: for many young Noble-men and brave Courtiers, having a nimble eye to the secret favours and dislikes of the King, gave over themselves to a dissolute and dishonest life, which findeth some followers when it findeth no furtherancers, much more when it doth flourish and thrive: the King also by favouring these, was himselfe little favoured and loved of many: for it is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times as dangerous to a Prince, to have evill and odious adherents, as to bee evill and odious himselfe. The names of these men were <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander Nevill,</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Yorke, Robert Veere,</hi> Earle of <hi>Oxford: Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael Delapoole</hi> afterwards Earle of <hi>Suffolke, Robert Trisilian,</hi> Lord chiefe Iustice, <hi>Nicholas Brambre,</hi> Alderman of <hi>London</hi>; and certaine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of no eminency, either by birth or desert, but obsequious and pliable to the Kings youthfull humour.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51490:38"/>
These were highly in credit with the King: these were alwayes next unto him, both in company and counsell: by these hee ordered his private actions: by these hee managed his affaires of state: hee spared nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the dignity nor death of any man, whose authority and life with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood their preferment. In so much as in the fifth yeare of his raigne, hee removed Sir <hi>Richard Scroope,</hi> from being Lord Chancellour of <hi>England,</hi> (to which office hee was by autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Parliament appointed,) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause hee refused to set the great Seale, to the grant of certaine Lands, which had wantonly passed from the King: alleaging for his deniall, the great debts of the King, and small demerites of the parties, upon whom the King might cast away and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume, but spend in good order hee could not; advertising him also to have respect, that riote did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him under the terme and shew of liberality: and that gifts well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered procure not so much love,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:51490:38"/>
as placed without discretion, they stirre envy. This Chancelour was a man of notable integrity and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in his office, not scornefully turning away from the ragged coate of a poore suppliant, or pale face of a sickly and feeble limmed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>In the eight yeare of this Kings raigne, the destruction of the Duke of <hi>Lancaster</hi> was intended likewise upon the like dislike: the plot was laied by Iustice <hi>Trisilian,</hi> offences were devised, Appellours appointed, and Peeres named; hee should have beene put under arrest suddenly, and forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with arraigned, condemned, and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted. But the Duke upon privy intelligences of these contrivances, fled to his Castle at <hi>Pomfret,</hi> and there made preparation for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence against the King. So this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:51490:39"/>
beganne to grow to a head of division, which the Common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at that time very busily, desired and fought: but the Kings Mother travelling incessantly betweene the King and the Duke; (notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding shee was both corpulent and in yeares) laboured them both to a reconcilement: the King, with regard of the dangerous and discontented times: the Duke, with respect of his duty and faith: and so partly by her entreaty and advise, partly by their inclination bending to the safest course, all apparancy of displeasure on the one part, and distrust on the other, was for that time layed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side.</p>
                  <p>The same yeare, <hi>Michael Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poole</hi> was made Chancellour of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and created Earle of <hi>Suffolke:</hi> and <hi>Robert Veere</hi> Earle of <hi>Oxford,</hi> was created Marquesse of <hi>Dublin,</hi> being the first man within the Realme that was enobled with that title. But as they grew in honour, so did they in hate: for many Noble-men
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:51490:39"/>
did infinitely stomack their undeserved advancements, and with these the favour of the People ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally went: but the Kings intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate affection was peremptory and violent, not regarding envy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till hee could not resist it.</p>
                  <p>The yeare next following, <hi>Robert Veer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>
                     </hi> the new Marquesse, was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Duke of <hi>Ireland.</hi> This yeare, the Knights and Burgesses of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, put up many complaints a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Earle of <hi>Suffolke,</hi> upon which they desired his answers and triall: namely, how hee had abused the King in taking of him to farme all the profits and revenues of the Crowne: how wantonly hee wasted the treasure of the land in riotous liberality, and unnecessary charges: how deepe hee had dived into the Kings debt: how carelesse and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt hee was in his office: how great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hee had both deceived and discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited the King in certaine dealings and accounts particularly expressed: with divers other imputations
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:51490:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>
touching dishonour and dishonesty, both in private action and in office. This Earle was a Merchants Sonne in <hi>London,</hi> and growing mighty on the sudden, hee could not governe himselfe in the change: but prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity layed open the secret faults of his mind, which were suppressed and cloaked before: and serving a weake Ruler in great place, with an ill mind, hee made open sale of his Princes honour. Yet the King was willing, either secretly to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble, or openly to remit these offences: and so passed them over with a short audience (as his manner was in matters of greatest weight) and without examination, shewing himselfe neither grieved at the faults, nor well pleased with the complaint. Afterwards a Subsidy was required: but answer was made that this needed not, since the Kings wants might bee furnished with the debts which were owing him from his Chancelour: neither was it to any purpose, so long as the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:51490:40"/>
should bee ordered by such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons as before it had beene, and that that time was like. Then were the matters against the Lord Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour againe set on foote, and the King perswaded that it was neither hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable nor safe to beare him out; that to private men it was sufficient if themselves abstaine from wrong, but a Prince must provide that none doe wrong under him: for by main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining, or wincking at the vices of his Officers, hee maketh them his owne, and shall surely bee charged therewith when first occasion doth serve against him. At the last, upon instant importunity of both Houses, the King did consent, that a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission should goe forth to certaine Noble-men, giving them authority to heare and determine all matters which were objected against the Lord Chancellour: and then was a Subsidie granted, with exception, that the money should bee expended by the Lords, to the benefit and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe of the Realme. The King did
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:51490:41"/>
further demand, that the Heires of <hi>Charles Bloyes,</hi> who made claime to the Dutchy of <hi>Britaine,</hi> should bee sold to the <hi>French-men</hi> for thirty thousand markes, and the money granted to the Duke of <hi>Ireland,</hi> for recovery of those possessions which the King had given him in <hi>Ireland:</hi> this was likewise assented unto, upon condition, that before Easter the next ensuing, the Duke should depart into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and there remaine: at so high a price did they value the rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of him out of the Realme.</p>
                  <p>The charge of the Subsidie mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, was committed to <hi>Richard</hi> Earle of <hi>Arundell.</hi> Commissioners for the Earle of <hi>Suffolke</hi> were appointed, <hi>Thomas</hi> Duke of <hi>Glocester</hi> the Kings Vncle, and the said Earle of <hi>Arun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell:</hi> but during the time of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, the King kept all off, in places farre distant: either to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest thereby the discent of his mind, or to avoid the griefe which his neerenesse would encrease: And now was the Chancellour left unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:51490:41"/>
to answere to those demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, wherein hee made the Kings blind favour his priviledge and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, supposing never to see the same either altered or over-ruled. In the end, being convict of many crimes and abuses, hee was deposed from his office, his goods were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiscated to the Kings Exchequer, and himselfe was adjudged worthy of death: Yet was execution submitted to the Kings pleasure, and under sureties hee was permitted to goe at large. At the same time, <hi>Iohn Foorde</hi> Bishop of <hi>Duresme,</hi> another of the Kings dainties, was removed also from being Lord Treasurer of <hi>England,</hi> hee was a man of little depth, either in learning or wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, but one that had the Art of seeming, in making the best shew of whatsoever hee spake or did: and rising from meane estate to so high a pitch of honour, hee exercised the more excessively his riot, avarice, and ambition, not able to moderate the lusts and desires which former want had kindled.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:51490:42"/>When this businesse was blowne over, the King returned againe to <hi>London,</hi> and did presently receive the Earle of <hi>Suffolke,</hi> with the Duke of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the Archbishop of <hi>Yorke,</hi> to greater grace and familiarity then at any time before. These <hi>Triumvirs</hi> did not cease to stirre up the Kings stomack against those Noblemen, whose speciall excellency had made matter of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

proceeding, and your person as a cipher, to make them great, and bee your selfe nothing. Looke to the duty of your Subjects, and it is at their devotion: so that you can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther command nor demand any thing, but with such exceptions and limitations as they please to impose: come now to your private actions, your liberality (the greatest vertue in a Prince) is restrained, your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences measured, and your affections confined, to frowne and favour as they doe prescribe. What Ward is so much under government of his Gardian? Wherein will they next, or can they more abridge you? Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they should take from you the place, as they have done the power of a Prince: and in this wee thinke, they may justly bee feared, having so great might joyned with so great aspiring minds. For power is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver safe when it doth exceed: and ambition is like the Crocodile which groweth so long as hee liveth: or like the Ivie, which fastning on the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:51490:43"/>
foote of the tallest Tower, by small, yet continuall rising, at length will climbe above the top, it is already growne from a sparke to a flame, from a twig to a tree, and high time it is, that the increase were stayed: oftentimes such over-ruling of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces have proceeded to their over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing, and such cutting them short hath turned to cutting them off, their minds are suspicious, their power dangerous, and therefore the oportunity must bee preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                  <p>The Kings owne weakenesse made him apprehensive, and framed his mind to a vaine and needlesse feare: but chiefly hee was moved at the removing of his Chancellour and Treasurer out of their offices, and of the Duke of <hi>Ireland</hi> out of the Realme, supposing it a restraint to his Princely power, that hee might not absolutely and in things give or forgive as his pleasure ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. When these privy incensers perceived the Kings humour once
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51490:43"/>
sharpned, they so plied him with plausible perswasions, that (although hee was naturally of no cruell dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, as wanting courage) yet they drew him to many violent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct courses, partly upon negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to search out the truth, partly upon delight to bee flattered and smoothly used, neither did they long deferre their devises: and first it was appointed, that the Duke of <hi>Glocester,</hi> and certaine others of that part, should bee invited to a supper within <hi>London,</hi> and there suddainly surprised and made away. Sir <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas Brambre,</hi> who the yeare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had beene Major of <hi>London,</hi> and in whom aboundance of wealth supplied the want of honest quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, was a busie agent in this but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherly businesse: but <hi>Richard Extone</hi> the Major of the City, that yeare, discovered the practise by whom the Duke was warned both to avoid the present perill, and afterwards to bee wary of the like.</p>

Earle of <hi>Arundel,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Mow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bray</hi> Earle of <hi>Nottingham,</hi> had the conduct of a Navy committed to their charge: in this voyage they tooke above a hundred saile of the enemies ships, fraughted with wines, and well appointed for fight: they also relieved and fortified <hi>Brest,</hi> and tooke two forces which the <hi>French-men</hi> had raised against it. The Earles so behaved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in this service, that they grew to a very great estimation, both for courtesie among their Souldiers, and for courage against their enemies: and their actions were the more famous, by reason of the infortunate sufficiency of other Commanders, by whose either rashnesse or cowardise, many good Souldiers were dayly defeated, and every yeare made notorious, by one losse or other. Yet notwithstanding all their good labour and luck, they were at their returne, entertained by the King, with great strangenes, both of countenance and speech.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:51490:44"/>
Who was so unable to dissemble his dispight, that hee could hardly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre it, untill the heat of the honour and love which they had wonne, were somewhat abated. So much are men more inclinable to revenge displeasure, then reward desert: for it is troublesome to bee gratefull, and many times chargeable: but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge is pleasant, and preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore gaine.</p>
                  <p>About the same time, <hi>Robert</hi> Duke of <hi>Ireland</hi> forsooke the company of his lawfull wife, whose Mother Lady <hi>Isabel,</hi> was Daughter to King <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and insteed of her, hee tooke unto him a base <hi>Bohemian,</hi> a Taverners Daughter. The King little regarded this indignity done unto his Cosin, and in so great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion of the state, let it passe unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, as overshadowed with greater vices: but the Duke of <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester</hi> her Vncle, tooke it in high disdaine, as injurious to the Royall bloud, and did attend upon occasion to worke revenge, this was not se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:51490:45"/>
from the Duke of <hi>Ireland,</hi> who likewise bent all his devises to bring the Duke of <hi>Glocester</hi> to his over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw. The Duke of <hi>Glocester</hi> did prosecute his enmity openly and manlike: the Duke of <hi>Ireland</hi> closely, and therefore the more dangerously. The Duke of <hi>Glocester</hi> was greater in bloud, the Duke of <hi>Ireland</hi> in favour; hee being Vncle to the King, this bearing himselfe as the Kings fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. The Duke of <hi>Glocester</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for the State, the Duke of <hi>Ireland</hi> for the King: and much pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate malice did passe under these publike shewes: but in opposition of such equall powers, there is many times small difference in harme.</p>
                  <p>And now was Easter past, the Tearme assigned to Duke <hi>Robert Vicere</hi> for his departure into <hi>Ireland:</hi> and least his stay might breed some stirre within the Realme, hee still busied himselfe in preparation for his journey, and at last (although it were long) made a solemne shew of setting forth. The King went in
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:51490:45"/>
great state to accompany him to his shipping; and the Earle of <hi>Suffolke</hi> with Iustice <hi>Trisilian,</hi> and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidue of that faction, either for favour followed, for or feare durst not stay behind. So they passed together in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Wales,</hi> and (whether upon levity the Kings mind changed; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was so contrived at the first to draw themselves more separate from the Lords,) there the Dukes journey was at an end. Then they entred into Counsell which way the Lords might best bee suppressed: ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny devises were deeply debated, all pleased without respect either of danger or disgrace: but few stood with likelihood of event to their desires, and therefore none was final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concluded. After long time thus frivolously spent, they left <hi>Wales,</hi> and came to the Castle of <hi>Notting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> where the King caused the high Sheriffes of all the Shires in the Realme to bee called before him, and demanded of them, what strength they could make on his part against
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:51490:46"/>
the Lords, if need should require: their answer was, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people did so favour the Lords, and were so well resolved of their love and loyalty towards the King, that it was not in their power to raise any great power against them Then they were commanded that no Knights nor Burgesses should afterwards bee chosen to any Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, but those whom it pleased the King to appoint: whereto they said that it was a hard matter in those times of jealousie and suspition, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reave the people of their ancient li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, in chosing Knights and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesses for the Parliament, some few other matters being either unreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably required, or obtained to small end, the Sheriffes were licensed to depart. Then were assembled <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Trisilian,</hi> chiefe Iustice of the Kings Bench, <hi>Robert Belknape,</hi> chiefe Iustice of the Common Pleas, <hi>Iohn Holte, Roger Stilthrope, William Burgh,</hi> Knights and Iustices also of the Common Pleas, men learned in

one rule chiefly, without difference of truth or falsehood, to please those in highest places, intituling that wisedome, which indeed was but basenesse and feeblenesse of mind: these were charged by the King upon their faith and legeance, to make true and full answers to those questions following.</p>

                  <p>These questions, or rather quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels were drawne by <hi>Iohn Blake</hi> a

Councellour at the Law, by dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Iustice <hi>Trisilian,</hi> whilest the King made his stay in <hi>Wales:</hi> to the which the Iustices afore-named, some in discharge of their owne ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, and some to satisfie the minds of other, made answer as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
                  <p>To the first, that they did dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate from the Prerogative of the King, because they were against his will.</p>
                  <p>To the second and third: that they are to bee punished by death, except it pleaseth the King to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don them.</p>
                  <p>To the fourth and fifth: that they are worthy to bee punished as Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours.</p>

                  <p>To the seventh, that the King may at his pleasure dissolve the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and whosoever shall after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards proceed against the Kings

mind, as in a Parliament, hee is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to bee punished as a Traytour.</p>
                  <p>To the eighth, that they cannot, and whosoever doth the contrary hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serveth to be punished as a Traytour.</p>
                  <p>To the ninth, that as well the Motioner as also the Bringer of the said statute to the Parliament, are worthy to be punished as Traytours.</p>
                  <p>To the tenth, they answered: that the said judgement seemed to them erronious and revocable in every part. <hi>In witnesse whereof, the Iustices aforesaid, with</hi> Iohn Locktone, <hi>the Kings sergeant at Law, have subscribed and set their seals to these presents, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When these bloudy sentences of death &amp; treason, were under generall and large Tearmes thus fastened upon the Lords, the King supposed his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts against them, whether by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, or by colour of law sufficiently warranted: but his power both wayes, as it was terrible against weak resistance, so against such mighty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants it was of smal force to effect that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> he so much affected. Yet he
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:51490:49"/>
did not omit his first indeavour: and first accounting the Lords as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned persons, hee made division of their Lands and goods among those that hee favoured. Then hee waged Souldiers to bee in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse for his assistance, and sent the Earle of <hi>Northumberland</hi> to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest the Earle of <hi>Arundel,</hi> at his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle in <hi>Reygate,</hi> where hee then lay. But the Earle of <hi>Arundel,</hi> either upon advertisement, or suspition of the Kings mind, banded himselfe so strong, that when the Earle of <hi>Northumberland</hi> came unto him, hee dissembled his intent, and left his purpose unperformed. Thus were these proceedings of the King, as now in Councell, so afterwards in event, not much unlike that which the Fable telleth of a certaine hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who first sold the skinne of the beare, and then went about to take her: but when hee came within the forrest, either by unskilfulnesse or misadventure, hee not onely missed his pray, but fell himselfe into dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the beast.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="35" facs="tcp:51490:49"/>The Duke of <hi>Glocester</hi> having secret intelligence of the Kings dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure, and of his drift, sent the Bishop of <hi>London</hi> to perswade the King to entertaine a more favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble opinion of him: making faith to the Bishop, with a solemne oath, that hee never intended any thing to the prejudice of the King, either in person or state. The Bishop not unskilfull to joyne profitable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion, with honest, declared to the King, that his displeasure against the Lords was not grounded upon just desert, but either upon false sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions of their enemies, or erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The King seemed to give good <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>are and credit to the Bishops speech:
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:51490:50"/>
but <hi>Michael Delapoole,</hi> a turbulent man, and against quiet counsell ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinately contentious, standing then by the King, soone stiffened his mind against all impression of friendship. Hereupon contention did arise betweene the Bishop and the Earle, and brake forth violently into heat of words. The Earle ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the Lords those objections wherewith great men are usually charged: sparing no spight of speech, and using all art to aggravate mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters against them. The Bishop re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, that the Earle was thus fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bent, not upon his owne neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, nor love to the King; but onely to satisfie his bloudy and ambitious humour, wherein hee was so immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate that rather then the Lords should not bee destroyed, hee would overwhelme them with the ruines of the State, for tumults might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed bee raised by men of little cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, but must bee maintained with the hazard, and ended with the losse of the most valiant; that neither his
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:51490:50"/>
Counsell in this matter was to bee followed, being the principall fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brand of the disturbance, nor his complants against any man to bee any thing regarded, being him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe a condemned person, and one that held both his life and honour at the pleasure of the King. At these words the King was exceedingly wroth, and charged the Bishop with menacing and threats to avoid his presence. When the Duke of <hi>Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester</hi> had knowledge hereof, hee signified the danger to the Earles of <hi>Arundel, Warwick,</hi> and <hi>Derby,</hi> advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing them to take armes, and unite themselves for their common de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence: for in so doubtfull and suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted peace, open warre was the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way of safety. These three Earles were the chiefest strength to the side, but the Duke bare the most stroke, because hee was most bold, and his greatnesse almost obscured the names of the rest. On the other side, the King thinking separate dealing the onely way to weaken a
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:51490:51"/>
confederacy, endeavoured to prevent the Lords in joyning of their forces<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to that end hee sent a strength of men with charge, either to set upon the Earle of <hi>Arundel</hi> where hee did lie: or to intercept him in his passage towards the Duke. But the Earle had travelled all the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their comming, and so happily escaped to <hi>Haringey</hi> parke, where hee found the Duke, and the other Earles, with a sufficient company, as well to make attempt, as to stand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on resistance.</p>
                  <p>When the King heard hereof, hee was disturbed and distracted in mind, being now in choise either to relent, or to resist, whereof hee much disdained the one, and distrusted the other. His followers also was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided in Counsell: some fretting at the disgrace, and some fainting at the danger. The Archbishop of <hi>Yorke</hi> perswaded the King, that occasion was now offered to shew himselfe a King indeed, if hee would muster a Royall army, and by maine might
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:51490:51"/>
beate downe the boldnesse of this presumption. <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>hil dictu facilius,</hi> said another: <hi>This is more readily devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed then done:</hi> the army against us is mighty, and the Commanders are great men, both for courage and skill, and greatly favoured of the Common people: whereby that which is accompted so ready pay, may chance to prove a desperate debt. Therefore it were better with some yeelding to enter into condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of quiet, then by standing upon high points of honour to hazard the issue of a battaile, wherein the King cannot winne without his weakning, nor loose without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of his undoing. There was then in presence, a certaine old Knight, called Sir <hi>Hugh Linne,</hi> a good soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, but a very mad-cap, and one that lived chiefely upon the libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Noblemen; by vaine jestes, affecting the grace of a pleasant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit: of him the King demanded in mirth, what hee thought best to bee done? Sir <hi>Hugh</hi> swore, swownes and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:51490:52"/>
snailes, let us set upon them, and kill every man and mothers child; and so wee shall make riddance of the best friends you have in the Realme, this giddy answer more weighed with the King then if it had beene spoken in grave and sober sort: and thus it often happeneth, that wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is the more, sweetly swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed when it is tempered with folly, and earnest is the lesse offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive, if it bee delivered in jest. In the end, the devise of raising armes was laid aside, not as displeasing (being so agreeable to former pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, but as despairing to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile thereby; and the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> with the Bishop of <hi>Ely</hi> being Lord Chancellour, were sent unto the Lords, to understand the cause of their assembly: answer was made, that it was for the safety of themselves; the honour of the King, and the overthrow of them which sought the overthrow of both. At the last it was concluded by mediation of the Bishops, that
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:51490:52"/>
the Lords should come before the King at <hi>Westminster,</hi> upon promise of his protection, and there have au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience concerning their griefes: the Bishop of <hi>Ely</hi> also making private saith, that hee would discover any danger that hee could discrie, a little before the time they should come, the Bishop of <hi>Ely</hi> sent word of an await that was purposed to bee laid for them, at a place called the Mewes, neere <hi>London</hi>; advising them either to make stay, or to come pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared: but rather to make stay, least further provocation might make reconcilement more hard, hereupon they came not at the time appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the King marvailing at their sailance, enquired the cause of the Bishop of <hi>Ely:</hi> who answered, that the Lords found want of true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and that they neither did, nor durst repose assurance to the Kings word, which they saw to bee used as a meanes to entrap them, the King made the matter very strange unto him, affirming with an oath
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:51490:53"/>
that hee was free from deceit, both in consent and knowledge: and in a great rage, hee commanded the Sheriffes of <hi>London</hi> to goe to the place, and slay all those whom they found there in wait. Whether this was but a countenance of his, or whether hee was not privy to the practice, it is not assuredly knowne, and indeed, the matter was not false, but the place mistaken: for Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Trivet,</hi> and Sir <hi>Nicholas Bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre</hi> had assembled many armed men at <hi>Westminster,</hi> with direction to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault the Lords at their best advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage: but perceiving their deceit to bee discovered, they dissolved the company, and sent them secretly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to <hi>London.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then the Lords, upon new faith for their security, came to the King at <hi>Westminster,</hi> and yet in faith they brought security with them, such troupes of men, as in a place where they were so intirely favoured, was able to defend them, in any suddaine tumult or danger: the King upon
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:51490:53"/>
their comming entred into <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster-Hall,</hi> apparelled in his Royall robes: and when hee was placed in his seat, and had composed himselfe to Majesty and State, the Bishop of <hi>Ely,</hi> Lord Chancellour, made a long Oration to the Lords in the Kings name. Wherein hee declared the heinousnesse of their offence, the greatnesse of their perill, how easie a matter it had beene for the King to have levied a power sufficient to destroy them; and yet for the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall spare of his Subjects bloud, and in particular favour to the Duke and other Lords, hee made choyce to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter and overcome them, rather by friendship then by force: and therefore was willing, not onely to pardon their riot, but also to heare their griefes, and in a peaceable and quiet manner to redresse them. The Lords alleadged for causes of their taking armes, first the necessity of their owne defence: secondly the love both of the King and of the Realme, whose fame and fortune
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:51490:54"/>
did dayly decline, by meanes of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Traytours, who lived onely by the dishonours of the one, and decayes of the other, those whom th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The King replied, that oftentimes the causes of actions being good, yet, if the meanes want moderation, and judgement, the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents prove pernitious: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, though these complaints were true, yet were these courses not tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable, which did beare an open face of rebellion, and by licentiousnesse of the multitude, might soone have sorted to such an end: for it is more easie to raise the people, then to rule them: whose fury once stirred, will
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:51490:54"/>
commonly bee discharged some wayes. But (said hee) since wee have broken this broile, wee will not by combating give occasion of a new: but at the next Parliament (which hee appointed should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne the third day of <hi>February</hi> then next ensuing) as well you, as they,<note place="margin">

Then hee caused the Duke and the Earles, which all this time kneeled before him, to arise, and went with them into his private Chamber, where they talked a while, and drunke fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly together, and afterwards, with a most friendly farewell hee licensed them to depart. They of the contrary faction were not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent at this meeting, and if they had,

it was thought, that the presence of the King should little have protected them.</p>
                  <p>This act of the King was divers wayes taken: some judged him fearefull; others moderate, rather in sparing the bloud of his Subjects. The Lords were very joyfull of his good will and favour, which as by base or bad meanes they would not seeke, so being well gotten, they did highly esteeme. Yet they thought it the safest course, not to separate themselves, suspecting the mutabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the King, and the malice of their enemies, of whom they knew neither where they were, nor what they did intend: and being men of great wealth, and great power, and greatly bent to hurtfull practices, they were feared not without a cause: for the Duke of <hi>Ireland,</hi> either by setting on, or sufferance of the King, was all this time mustering of Souldiers out of <hi>Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

sufficient, if another had beene ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, to have maintained the side.</p>
                  <p>When the Lords were advertised hereof, they devided themselves, and beset all the wayes by which the Duke should passe to <hi>London</hi>; deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining to encounter him, before hee did increase his power, and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance his actions with the puissance or name of the King. At the last hee was met by the Earle of <hi>Derby,</hi> at a place called <hi>Babbelake</hi> neere to <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford:</hi> and there the Earle put his men in array, resolving with great bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to hazard the battail<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There was then in the army a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Commander, one Sir <hi>Thomas Molineux,</hi> Constable of <hi>Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

man of great wealth, and of good proofe in service, upon whose lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all that Countrey did depend: hee perswaded the Duke, that this was but a part of the forces that were against them, and led onely by the Earle of <hi>Derby,</hi> a man of no spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall name (at that time) among the Lords, and if they could not beare through that resistance, it was but in vaine to attempt any great at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chevement by armes. Hereupon the Duke stayed his steps, but his faint Spirits were moved by this speech, rather to desire victory then to hope it: his souldiers also were dull, silent, and sad, and such as were readier to interpret, then to execute the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines commandement. So they joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned battell, but scarce tenne ounces of bloud was lost on both sides, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Duke of <hi>Ireland</hi> set spurres to his horse, and forsooke the field.

the honour of the field. Sir <hi>Thomas Molineux</hi> in flying away, was forced to take a River which was neere, and as hee was comming foorth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, a certaine Knight, whose name was Sir <hi>Thomas Mortimer,</hi> pulled off his helmet, and stabbed him into the braines with his dagger. The rest submitted themselves to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of the Victorers, making them Lords over their life, and death: but their yeelding was no soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner offered, then it was accepted, the Earle presently commanding that none should bee harmed, but those that did make resistance, or beare ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour: The souldiers also being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to shew favour towards their Countrey-men, as led into this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, partly upon simplicity, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to accompany these which came upon feare. Then the Gentlemen were still retained in the Earles company, the common Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours were dispoiled of their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour onely, and so returned againe to their peaceable businesse at home.

And this was the first act whereby reputation did rise to the side, and the greatnesse beganne, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the Earle afterwards attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Ireland,</hi> at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his flight, was desirous to have passed the River which ranne by: and comming to a bridge, hee found the same broken: from thence hee posted to another bridge, which hee found guarded with Archers. At the last, his fearefulnesse being feared away (as nothing maketh men more desperate upon a doubtfull danger, then feare of that which is certaine) hee adventured to take the streame; in the midst whereof hee forsooke his horse and swam to the other side, and so by benefit of the night es<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

His horse was taken with his brest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate,

his helmet and his gauntlets, whereupon it was generally suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed that hee was drowned; and (as in great uncertainties it often happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth) some affirmed that they saw his death, which men either glad to heare, or not curious to search, did easily beleeve: whether this were thus contrived of purpose, or fell so out by chance, it was a great meanes of his escape, by staying the pursute after him, which otherwise had beene made. His coach also was taken, and certaine of the Kings let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters found, wherein hee desired the Duke to come to <hi>London</hi> with all the speed and power hee could make, and hee would bee ready to dy in his defence; so unskilfull was hee in matter of government, that to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure a few, hee regarded not the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentment of all the rest.</p>
                  <p>The Earle of <hi>Suffolke,</hi> upon this accident, shaved his beard, and in base and disguised artire fled to <hi>Calis,</hi> and either for feare, or for shame, never af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter returned into <hi>England:</hi> he was a

cruell spoiler, and a carelesse spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, in Warre contemptible, in peace in-supportable, an enemy to all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saile of others, and in his owne conceit obstinately contentious; of a good wit, and ready speech both which hee abused, to the cunning commending of himselfe, and crafty depraving of others: hee was lesse loved but better heard of the King, then the Duke of <hi>Ireland:</hi> the more hurtfull man and the more hatefull: the Duke being charged with no great fault: but onely the Kings ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive favour, in their course of good and bad fortune, both of them were famous alike. Also the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of <hi>Yorke,</hi> Iustice <hi>Trisilian,</hi> and others of that faction, ranne eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man, like connies to their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert; Yea, the King betooke himselfe to the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> and there made provision for his Winter aboad; having all his courses now crossed, first rashnes in taking armes, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards by cowardise in maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them.</p>

                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:51490:58"/>The Earle of <hi>Darby</hi> signified this successe to his associates by letters, yet without any vanting or enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Tearmes: his speeches also were moderate, rather extenuating his fact then extolling it, but by stopping his fame, it much encreased when men esteemed his high thoughts by his lowly words, and his conceit in great exploits, by his contempt of this. Then the Lords met, and marched together towards <hi>London,</hi> whither they came upon Saint <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phens</hi> day, having almost forty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand men in their army, and first they shewed themselves in battaile array, in the fields neare unto the Tower, within the view of the King: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, they tooke up their lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings in the Suburbs, the Major and Aldermen of the City came forth, and gave liberall allowance of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall to the souldiers, offering unto the Lords entertainement with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the City, but they did not accept it.</p>

The Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and certaine others of the neutrality, fearing the sequele, perswaded the King to come to a treaty with the Lords: but hee made shew of very light regard of all these dealings; let them stay (said hee) untill they have wearied themselves with maintaining this multitude, and then I will talke fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with them. When the Lords understood the drift of his devise, they beset the <hi>Thames,</hi> and all other passages, and protested, that they would not depart untill they had talked with him to his face The King having neither strength to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist; nor scope to scape, consented to a treaty, and to that end desired the Lords to come to him into the Tower: but they refused that place of meeting, upon feare of false mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:51490:59"/>
untill the King permitted them to search as diligently, and come as strongly, as they thought it meet. So they came unto the King well guarded, and after a few could kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

What should the King then have said or done? all these matters were so evident, and so evill, that there was no place left either for deniall or defence. Therefore ingenuously, first with silence and patience, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards with teares hee confessed his errours. And certainely, the stiffe stomack of the Lords relented more to these luke warme drops then

                  <p>Then it was agreed, that the next day the King should meet with them at <hi>Westminster,</hi> and there treat further, both of these, and other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary affaires of the Realme. So the Duke, and the rest of the Lords departed, except the Earle of <hi>Darby,</hi> who stayed supper with the King, and all that time stayed him in his promised purpose: but when hee was also gone, some of the secret Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sailours, or Corrupters rather, and Abusers of the King, whistled him in the eare, that his going to <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster</hi> was neither seemely nor safe, and would cause not onely to his person present danger and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, but also both abasement and abridgement to his authority after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then was an oath exacted of the King, to stand to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lords: and also a note was taken of all the Subjects within the Realme, to bee true and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full unto the King.

                  <p>All this was done in the 11. yeare of the Kings raigne,<note place="margin">1389.</note> hee being yet under age, and in Government of others. But the yeare following, hee beganne to take upon him more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and rule: and upon extreame disdaine, that both his pleasure and his power were by the Lords thus restrained, hee did ever after beare a hard mind against them. And first hee assembled them in the Councell Chamber, and there demanded of what yeares they tooke him to bee: they answered, that hee was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what above one and twenty; then (said hee) I am of lawfull age to
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:51490:63"/>
have the regiment in mine owne hand, and therefore you doe mee wrong to hold mee still under go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as though the condition of a King were harder then of a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. This the Lords were neither willing to grant, nor able to deny, and therefore they either kept si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, or spake little to the purpose. Well (said the King,) since I am no longer an infant, I heere renounce your rule, and take upon mee such free administration of the Realme, as the Kings thereof my Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours heretofore have lawfully used. Then presently hee began his Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons flourish, and commanded the Bishop of <hi>Ely,</hi> being Lord Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, to resigne his Seale; which the King received, and put up, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with departed out of the Chamber: but soone after hee returned againe, and delivered the same to <hi>William Wickam</hi> Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituting him Lord Chancellour thereby. Many other officers hee likewise deposed; and placed new in

their roome; partly to manifest his authority, and partly to satisfie his displeasure. Also hee removed the Duke of <hi>Glocester,</hi> the Earle of <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi> and many others from his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Councell, and tooke those in their places, which more regarded the humour of the King, but lesse his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
                  <p>Soone after, it was suggested to the King, that the Duke of <hi>Gloce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester</hi> was gathering forces against him: but upon examination there was found not onely no truth, but no shew or colour of any such matter.

sharply set in, and seconded the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish:</hi> and so whilest both companies contended, the one to bee accompted a helpe, and the other to seeme to need no helpe, the enemies were forced to flie, and leave the shoare unto the Christians. In this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, three Dukes of the Barbarians and above three hundred Souldiers were slaine, and in the flight, foure Dukes were taken, and a great, yet uncertaine, number of Common people. Then the Christians mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched directly towards <hi>Tunis,</hi> the head City of that Countrey: this they besieged, and in short time tooke; chiefely by the prowesse of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> souldiers, who first scaled the <hi>Wales,</hi> and reared thereon the Earles banner. When they were entred the Towne, the <hi>Englishmen</hi> bent their endeavour, to the housing of their enemies, and beating downe of such as made resistance, but the <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> straight wayes turned to their lascivious pleasures: so that there was presented a spectacle, both pitifull
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:51490:65"/>
and shamelesse: in one place butche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of men, in another rioting with women: here streames of bloud, and heapes of slaughtered bodies, hard by dissolute and licentious wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses in some, all the miseries of a cruell warre, and the loosenesse of a secure peace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Here were slaine and taken above foure thousand Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians: the Kings brother also was slaine: but the King himselfe fled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Castle, which was strongly scited, and well fortified and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with men. The Christians laid siege to this Castle the space of five weekes, during which time, they lost many of their men, yet not by sword, but by sicknesse: the Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians also were distressed with want of victuall, having but little provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and many unprofitable mouths to consume it: hereupon they sent unto the Christians, to desire peace, offering them a great summe of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, to depart out of their Countrey: this the Christians accepted, upon condition that they might also freely
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:51490:65"/>
carry with them, all their pray and Prisoners; and that the Barbarians should from thence forth surcease from making spoile, upon any of the coasts of <hi>Italy,</hi> or <hi>France.</hi> Thus had this voyage a prosperous and spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy end: the onely service (as I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose) which the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> performed together, without jotte of jarre. And yet the Earle abused not the fortune of this suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse, to vaine vanting, or braving in words, but moderately imparted to the rest, the honour of the exploit: so by valiantly performing his charge, and sparingly speaking there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, his glory encreased, without bit of envy.</p>
                  <p>In the fifteenth and sixteenth yeares of the raigne of King <hi>Richard,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1392. 1393.</note> certaine causes of discontentment did grow, betweene the King and the <hi>Londoners,</hi> which set the favour of the one, and the faith of the other, at great separation and distance: One was, for that the King would have borrowed of them a thousand
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:51490:66"/>
pounds: which they feeling much, and fearing more the Kings dayly exactions, did not onely deny, but evill intreated a certaine Lumbard, who offered to lay out the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</p>
                  <p>Another griefe was thus occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: One of the Bishop of <hi>Salis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buries</hi> servants, named <hi>Romane,</hi> mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in <hi>Fleet-street</hi> with a Bakers man, bearing horse-broad, tooke a loafe out of his basket: and by rude demand of the one, and rough deniall of the other, chollar so kindled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, that <hi>Romane</hi> brake the Bakers head. Hereupon the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours came forth, and would have ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rested the Bishops lusty yeoman: but hee escaped, and fled to this Bishops house. The Constable followed peaceably, and demanded a quiet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery of the Offendour: but the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops men shut the gates against him, that no man could come neere. Then much people flocked together, threatning to breake open the gates, and fire the house, unlesse <hi>Romane</hi>
                     <pb n="69" facs="tcp:51490:66"/>
were brought forth unto them: What (said they) are the Bishops men priviledged? or is his house a San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary? or will hee protect those whom hee ought to punish? if wee may bee shuffled off in this sort, not onely our streets, but our stops and our houses shall never bee free from violence and wrong. This wee will not endure: wee cannot: it standeth not us in hand. Herewith they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached the gates, and beganne to use violence: but the Major and Sheriffes of the City, upon advertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this tumult, came amongst them, crying out, that it was not courage, but out-rage which they shewed: whereby they would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, both danger to themselves and displeasure against the whole City; that although wrong had beene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, yet they were not in the men, nor this the meanes to redresse the same: So partly by their perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, partly by their presence and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, they repressed the riot, and sent every man away, with streight
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:51490:67"/>
charge to keepe the peace. Here was yet no great harme done, and the quarrell might have beene quieted without more adoe, had not the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops stirred therein, and kindled the coales of unkindnesse a fresh. For the <hi>Londoners</hi> at that time, were not onely suspected secretly, but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly noted to bee favourers and followers of <hi>Wickliffes</hi> opinions: for which cause, they were much maliced of the Bishops; and many of their actions interpreted, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from another mind, and tend to a worse end, then was outwardly borne in countenance and shew: and some matters of chance, were taken as done of purpose. Therefore the Bishop of <hi>Salisbury</hi> called <hi>Iohn Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham,</hi> who was also Treasourer of <hi>England,</hi> made a grievous complaint of this attempt, to <hi>Thomas Arundel</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Yorke,</hi> and Lord Chancellour; affirming, that if upon every light pretence, the Citizens might bee suffered in this sort to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult upon the Bishops, without pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:51490:67"/>
without reproofe and blame, they would bring into a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, not onely the dignity and state, but the liberty also of the whole Church: did they not lately take upon them the punishment of adulteries, and other crimes appertaining to Ecclesiasticall jurisdiction? ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciously alleaging, that the Bishops and their Officers, either being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous for those vices themselves, did winck at the same in others: or else by covetous commutation, did rather set them to sale, then carefully represse them. Did they not rudely and unreverently breake open the doores upon the Archbishop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi> and interrupt his procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings against <hi>Iohn Astone,</hi> an open follower of <hi>Wickliffe</hi>? and doe wee thinke that this is the last indignity that they will offer? no surely, nor yet the least: and if this boldnesse bee not beaten downe, our authority will fall into open contempt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and scorne, and bee made a common foote ball, for every base Citizen to

spurne at. Hereupon they went to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to the King, and so incensed his displeasure against the <hi>Londo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> (being prepared thereto by former provocations) that hee was in the mind to make spoile of the City, and utterly to destroy it. But being perswaded to some more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration: in revenge, first hee caused the Major and Sheriffes, and many of the chiefe Citizens to bee appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, and committed to divers severall Prisons: then hee ceazed all the liberties of the City into his hands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ordained, that no Major should any more bee elected, but that the King should at his pleasure ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point a Warden and Governour over the City. This office was first com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Sir <hi>Edward Darlington:</hi> who for his gentlenesse towards the Citizens, was shortly after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and Sir <hi>Bauldwike Radington</hi> placed in his roome. Also the King was induced, or rather seduced by the Archbishop of <hi>Yorke</hi> Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour, to remove the Tearmes and
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:51490:69"/>
Courts: to wit, the Chancery, the Exchequer, the Kings bench, the hamper, and the Common pleas, from <hi>London,</hi> to bee kept at <hi>Yorke,</hi> where the same continued from Mid-sommer in the yeare 1393. un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till <hi>Christmasse</hi> next following, to the great hinderance and decay of the City of <hi>London.</hi> At the last, the King upon earnest intreaty of the Duke of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester,</hi> called the <hi>Londoners</hi> before him at <hi>Windsore:</hi> where having first terrified them with the presence and shew of a great number of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med men) hee caused all the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of the City, both old and new, to bee brought forth, whereof hee restored some, and restrained the rest: yet the <hi>Londoners</hi> were not fully restored to favour; neither recovered they at that time, either the person or dignity of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor. Shortly after, the King went to <hi>London:</hi> at whose comming the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens changed all their griefe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to gladnesse (as the common sort
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:51490:70"/>
is without measure in both) enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining him with such joyfull tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphes and rich presents, as if it had beene the day of his coronation. They supposed with these great curtesies and costs to have satisfied his displeasure; but they found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves farre deceived: for they were not fully restored to their liberties againe, untill they had made fine to pay unto the King tenne thousand pounds. Thus did the <hi>Londoners</hi> manifest in themselves, a strange di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity of disposition, both licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiously to commit offence, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently to endure punishment; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving rashnesse and rage so tempered with obedience, that they were easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly punished, who could not possibly be ruled. Yet for this cause, so soone as first occasion did serve against the King; they shewed themselves, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his earnest enemies, or faint friends.</p>
                  <p>King <hi>Richard</hi> in the nineteenth yeare of his raigne, passed the Seas to <hi>Calis:</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King also came
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:51490:70"/>
downe to <hi>Ard:</hi> betweene which two Townes, a place was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and tents erected for both the Kings to meet. After large expences on both sides, and great honour done by the one King to the other: a surcease of armes was concluded betweene them for thirty years: and King <hi>Richard</hi> tooke to wife Lady <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sabel,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Kings Daughter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not above seven or eight yeares old. The Duke of <hi>Glocester</hi> was so offended; both with this friendship, and affinity, that hee lost all manner of patience: exclaiming, that it was more meet to bee in armes, then in amity with the <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> who being inferiour to the <hi>English</hi> in courage, did alwayes over-reach them in craft, and being too weake for Warre, did many times prevaile by peace: that now they had got into their hands, many Townes and Holds, appertaining to the Crowne of <hi>England,</hi> they were willing to conclude a peace, to exclude the King thereby from his possessions:
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:51490:71"/>
but whensoever occasion should change for their advantage, they would bee then as ready to start from the friendship, as at that present they were to strike it: that the <hi>French</hi> Kings Daughter, being but a child, was very unmeet for the marriage of King <hi>Richard,</hi> as well for dispari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of age, as for that the King had no issue by his first wife, and was not like to have any by this, except (perhaps) in his old and whithe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red yeares. When the Duke saw, that with these motives hee did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing prevaile, hee subordned the <hi>Londoners,</hi> to make petition to the King, that seeing there was peace with <hi>France,</hi> hee would release them of the Subsidy which they had gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him in regard of those warres. This suite was instantly followed, and much perplexed the King, untill the Duke of <hi>Lancaster</hi> declared to the people, that the King had beene at the charge and dispence of three hundred thousand pounds in his voyage into <hi>France,</hi> for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:51490:71"/>
of this peace: whereupon they were pacified, and desisted from their demand.</p>
                  <p>The yeare following,<note place="margin">1397.</note> 
                     <hi>Guido</hi> Earle of Saint <hi>Pauls,</hi> was sent into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan</hi> by <hi>Charles</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site and salute in his name, King <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard,</hi> and Queene <hi>Isabel</hi> his wife, the <hi>French</hi> Kings Daughter. To this Earle, the King did relate, with what fervency the Duke of <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester</hi> contended to make distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance of the peace betweene <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> how, because his mind was not therein followed, hee moved the people to seditious attempts, bending himselfe wholly to maintaine discord and disquiet, rather in his owne Countrey then not at all. Hee further reported what stiffe strifes, in former times, the Duke had stirred<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever they were done, yet as they were declared, they sounded very odious and hard. When the Earle heard this, hee presently answered, that the Duke was to dangerous a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:51490:72"/>
to bee permitted to live: that greatnesse was never safe, if it grow excessive and bold: that the King must not affect the vaine commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of clemency, with his owne perill: and that it touched him both in honour to revenge the disgraces which hee had received, and in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy to prevent the dangers which hee had cause to feare. These words so sharpened the Kings displeasure, that from thenceforth hee busied his braines in no one thing more, then how to bring the Duke to his end. Now hee beganne to pry more narrowly into his demeanour: to watch his words: to observe actions: and alwayes to interpret them to the worst, framing himselfe to many vaine and needlesse feares. Often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times hee would complaine of him to the Duke of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Yorke,</hi> how fierce and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent hee was in his speeches, and crosse to him in all matters. The Dukes would make answer that the Duke of <hi>Glocester</hi> their brother, was
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:51490:72"/>
indeed more hot and vehement then they did commend: yet his fiercenesse was joyned with faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse, and his crossenesse procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from a care, least the Common-wealth should decrease either in honour, or in possessions: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King had neither need to feare, nor cause to dislike.</p>
                  <p>About that time, the Dukes of <hi>Lancaster</hi> and of <hi>Yorke</hi> withdrew themselves from the Court, to their private Houses, the Duke of <hi>Gloce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> also went to ly at <hi>Plashey,</hi> neere <hi>Chelmsford</hi> in <hi>Essex:</hi> upon advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of which seperation, the King stood distracted in mind, betweene feare to defer, and shame to avow the destruction of the Duke, least hee might happily bee disappointed by the one, or dishonoured by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Hereupon hee entred into counsaile with <hi>Iohn Holland,</hi> Earle of <hi>Huntington,</hi> his halfe brother: and <hi>Thomas Mowbray,</hi> Earle of <hi>Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham,</hi> how the Duke of <hi>Glocester</hi> might, be suppressed or oppressed
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:51490:73"/>
rather, the cruelty which was but wavering in the King, yea wanting by nature, was soone confirmed by evill advise: and being once inclined to bloud, hee did not faile, either of examples of lewd action to follow, or direction of cruell Counsaile what to doe: so the plot was contrived, and according thereto, the King and the Earle of <hi>Nottingham</hi> rode together into <hi>Essex,</hi> as though it were to disport themselves in hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: when they were in the midst of the Forrest, the Earle made stay and the King passed forth with a small and unsuspitious company to the Duke lying at <hi>Plashey:</hi> there hee stayed dinner: and then pretending occasion of present returne, hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired the Duke to accompany him to <hi>London,</hi> the faire intreaty of a Prince, is a most forcible command: therefore the Duke supposing that onely to bee inte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>When the King came to <hi>London,</hi> hee caused the Earle of <hi>Warwick</hi> also to bee arrested and sent to prison, the same day that hee had invited him to dinner, and shewed good countenance, and promised to bee a gracious Lord unto him. Vpon the like dissembled shew, the Earle of <hi>Arundel,</hi> and his Sonne, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine others were arrested also, and
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:51490:74"/>
committed to prison in the Ile of <hi>Wight.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The common people upon the apprehending of these three Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, whom they chiefely, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most onely favoured, were in a great confusion and tumult; and there wanted but a head to draw them to sedition: every man sorrowed, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured, and threatned, and daring no further, stood waiting for one to lead them the way: all being ready to follow that, which any one was loath to beginne. The Duke of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caster</hi> and of <hi>Yorke</hi> gathered a strong army, and came therewith to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> where they were readily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the Citizens, although the King had commanded the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: but this seemed to bee done, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for guard to themselves, then regard to any others.</p>
                  <p>The King all this time, kept at a Village called <hi>Helhame,</hi> within foure miles of <hi>London,</hi> having about him a great power of armed men, which hee had gathered out of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:51490:74"/>
                     <hi>Cheshire</hi> and <hi>Wales:</hi> and to pacifie the common people, hee caused to bee proclaimed, that the Lords were not apprehended upon old displeasures, but for offences lately committed, for which they should bee appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by order of Law, and receive o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen triall, in the Parliament next following: the like message was sent to the Duke of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Yorke,</hi> lying at <hi>London:</hi> to whom the King made faith, for the safety of their persons, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnity of their goods, and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing should bee attempted without their privity and advice: all this was as rashly believed, as it was craftily given out: whereupon the Dukes dissembled their feares, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved their forces, and remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in expectancy what would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue.</p>
                  <p>A little before the feast of Saint <hi>Michael,</hi> the Parliament beganne at <hi>London,</hi> wherein Sir <hi>Iohn Bushie,</hi> Sir <hi>William Bagot,</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry Greene,</hi> were principall agents for
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:51490:75"/>
the Kings purpose. These were then in all the credites and authority with the King, and his chiefest Schoole-masters both of cruelty and deceit: they were proud, arrogant, and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious, and upon confidence of the Kings favour, professed enemies to men of ancient Nobility; to the end, that being lately start up, they might become more famous by maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning contention with great persons. And first, by their importuned tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile, all the Charters of pardon, granted by the King, were in this Parliament annulled and revoked. Then the Prelates did constitute Sir <hi>Henry Percie</hi> their Procuratour, and departed the house, because they might not bee present in judgement of bloud. Lastly, the Earle of <hi>Arun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del,</hi> and the Earle of <hi>Warwick</hi> were arraigned; and for the same offences, for which they had beene pardoned (namely for encroaching to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Royall power in judging to death <hi>Simon Burly, Iohn Berneis,</hi> and others, without the Kings consent)
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:51490:75"/>
were condemned to bee hanged, drawne, and quartered: but the King so moderated the severity of this sentence, that the Earle of <hi>Arundel</hi> was onely beheaded, and the Earle of <hi>Warwick</hi> committed to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall imprisonment in the Ile of <hi>Man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Glocester,</hi> was so greatly favoured, that it was thought a point both of policy and peace, not to bring him to his open answer, but to put him to death secretly: so hee was strangled under a feather bed at <hi>Calis</hi> by the Earle of <hi>Nottingham,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then Earle Marshall: which death, howsoever he deserved; yet dying as hee did not called, nor heard, he died as guiltlesse.</p>
                  <p>In this same Parliament, <hi>Thomas Arundel</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> was also accused, for execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the commission against <hi>Michael De-la-poole,</hi> Earle of <hi>Suffolke:</hi> for which cause, his temporalties were seazed; his lands and goods forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as well in use as in possession<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and hee himselfe was adjudged to exile, and charged to depart the Realme, within six weekes then next ensuing. So hee went into <hi>France,</hi> where afterwards, hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a principall meane of the revolt which followed. Also the Lord <hi>Cobham</hi> was exiled into the Ile of <hi>Gernsey:</hi> and Sir <hi>Reinold Cobham</hi> was condemned to death, not for entring into any attempt against the King, but because he was appointed by the Lords to bee one of his Governours, and of his Counsaile, in the 11. yeare of his raigne.</p>
                  <p>Now the King falsely supposing, that hee was free from all dangers, and that the humour against him, was cleane purged and spent, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived more secret contentment, then hee would openly bewray; as more able to dissemble his joy, then conceale his feare: being so blinded and bewitched with continuall cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of flatteries, that hee percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not, that the state of a Prince is never stablished by cruelty and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:51490:76"/>
craft<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> On the other side, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people were much dismayed, having now lost those whom they accompted their onely helpes, and their onely hopes, both for their private affaires, and for supporting the state: and because these mishaps happened unto them, for maintaining a cause of common dislike, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples stomack was stirred thereby to much hate and heart-burning against the King. And to make their deaths the more odious, the Earle of <hi>Arun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del</hi> was reputed a Martyr, and Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimages were dayly made to the place of his buriall: the rumour also was current but without either au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour or ground, that his head was miraculously fastened againe to his body: this whilest all men affirmed, and no man knew, the King caused the corps to bee taken up, and view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, tenne dayes after it was interred: and finding the same to bee fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, hee caused the ground to bee paved where the Earle was laid, and all mention of his buriall to
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:51490:77"/>
bee taken away, forbidding publikely any such speeches of him afterwards to bee used. But this restraint raised the more: and they, who if it had bin lawfull, would have said nothing, being once forbidden, could not forbeare to talke. It was also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly reported, that the King was much disquieted in his dreames with the Earle, who did often seeme to appeare unto him, in so terrible and truculent manner, that breaking his fearefull sleepe, hee would curse the time that ever hee knew him.</p>

The King likewise created the Countesse of <hi>Norfolke,</hi> Dutchesse of <hi>Norfolke:</hi> the Earle of <hi>Sommerset,</hi> Marquesse of <hi>Sommerset:</hi> the Lord <hi>Spencer,</hi> Earle of <hi>Glocester:</hi> the Lord <hi>Nevill,</hi> Earle of <hi>Westmerland:</hi> the Lord <hi>Scroupe,</hi> Earle of <hi>Wiltshire,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Thomas Darcy</hi> his Steward, Earle of <hi>Worcester.</hi> Among these, hee made division of a great part of the lands of the Duke of

Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the safety of his state might bee endangered; for extraordinary favour to men apparently of weake or bad desert, doth breed insolency in them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and discontentment in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, two dangerous humours in a Common-wealth. Thirdly, the dignity of the Realme was much empaired: whose fortune and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour

being guided by the ill chance of such unlucky leaders, stood ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in the like Tearmes of doubt and distresse; so that matters of peace were tumultuous and uncertaine, and atchievements of warre were never brought to honourable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion: that <hi>Alexander Severus</hi> would have smoaked such sellers of smoake; that <hi>Xerxes</hi> would have pulled their skinne over their eares; and high time it was, that the King should looke unto them: for the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility grew out of heart, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons out of hope, and all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple fell to a discontented murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. And this hee said (as hee said) not for any grudge, but for griefe and good will: and therefore desired the Duke, who was one of the privy Councell, and well heard with the King, to discover unto him these de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formities and dangers, that by repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the one, hee might happily repell the other.</p>
                  <p>These words procured to the Duke of <hi>Hereford</hi>

cunningly too: with many lies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixing some truths, or making the truth much more then it was. Againe, the King not enduring the search of his soares, did bend his mind rather to punish the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, then examine the truth of these reproofes: his eares being so distempered with continuance of flattery, that hee accompted all sharp that was sound, and liked one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that which was presently plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant, and afterwards hurtfull. Thus wee may dayly observe, that no strange accident doth at any time happen, but it is by some meanes fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shewed, or foretould: but because these warnings are oftentimes ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not marked, or misconstrued, or else contemned, the events are accompted inevitable and the admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions vaine.</p>
                  <p>The King being in this sort touched by the one Duke, and tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the other, was not resolved upon the suddaine, what to doe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore hee assembled his Councell
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:51490:82"/>
and called the two Dukes before him, and demanded of the Duke of <hi>Norfolke,</hi> if he would openly avouch that which hee had suggested in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret. The Duke seeing it was now no time for him, either to shrinke or shuffle in his tale, with a bold and confident courage repeated all that before hee had reported. But the Duke of <hi>Hereford</hi> could not bee borne downe by countenance, where his cause was good: and therefore after a short silence, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by hee seemed rather amazed at the strangenesse of this matter, then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bashed at the guilt, hee made low obeysance to the King, and greatly both thanked and commended him, that hee had not given hasty credite to matters of such tender touch, as his griefe might have borne out the blame of rashnesse in revenge; desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him to continue yet a while, the respite of his displeasure, and to reserve his judgement free for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different audience. Then he declared in order, what speech had passed
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:51490:83"/>
from him, upon what occasion, and to what end: all the rest hee stoutly denied, affirming, that it was falsely surmised by his Adversary, either upon malice to pick a quarrell; or upon sycophancy to pick a thanke, and that thereupon hee was untrue, unjust, a forger of slanderous and seditious lies, whereby hee treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously indevoured to seduce the King to destroy the Nobility, and to raise disturbance within the Realme: and this hee offered to prove upon him (if the King would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit) by the stroake of a speare and by dint of sword. The Duke of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folkes</hi> stomack not used to beare scorne; could not disgest these Tearmes of disgrace: whereupon hee stiffely stood to his first imputation: &amp; for maintenance thereof, he accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and also desired the combate. The King would some other wayes have quieted this contention, but the Dukes would agree to no other kind of agreement: and thereupon threw downe their gloves one against the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:51490:83"/>
other for gages. The King seeing their obstinacy, granted them the battaile, and assigned the place at the City of <hi>Coventry,</hi> in the Moneth of <hi>August</hi> then next insuing: where in the meane time, hee caused a sump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Theater, and Lists royall to bee prepared.</p>
                  <p>At the day of combate, the two Dukes came, well handed with No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen and Gentlemen of their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage. The Duke of <hi>Aumerle</hi> for that day high Constable, and the Duke of <hi>Surrey</hi> for the same time and action, high Marshall of <hi>England,</hi> entred into the Lists, with a great troupe of men apparelled in silke sondale, embroide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with silver, every man having a tipped staff to keep the field in order. About the time of prime, the Duke of <hi>Hereford</hi> came to the Barriers of the Lists mounted upon a white courser, barbed with blew and greene velvet, embroidered gorgeously with Swans and Antilops of Goldsmiths worke, armed at all points, and his sword drawne in his hand. The Constable
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:51490:84"/>
and Marshall came to the barriers, and demanded of him, who hee was? Hee answered: I am <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Hereford,</hi> and am come to doe my devoire against <hi>Thomas Mowbray</hi> Duke of <hi>Norfolke,</hi> as a Traytour to God, the King, the Realme, and mee. Then hee sware upon the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists, that his quarrell was right, and upon that point desired to enter the lists, then hee put up his sword, pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led downe his beavier, made a crosse on his fore-head, and with speare in hand, entred into the Lists, and there lighted from his horse, and sate downe in a chaire of greene velvet, which was set in a traverse of greene and blew velvet at the one end of the listes: and so expected the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of his enemy: soone after King <hi>Richard</hi> entred the field with great pompe both in bravery and traine: hee had in his company, the Earle of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who came purposely out of <hi>France</hi> to see this combate tried; he was attended with all the Noble Peeres of the Realme, and guarded
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:51490:84"/>
with tenne thousand men in armes, for feare of any suddaine or intended tumult.</p>
                  <p>When hee was placed on his stage, which was very curiously and richly set forth, a King at armes made proclamation in the name of the King, and of the high Constable, and of the Marshall, that no man, except such as were appointed to order and marshall the field, should touch any part of the listes, upon paine of death. This proclamation being ended, another Herald cried: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold here, <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Lancaster</hi> Duke of <hi>Hereford,</hi> appellant, who is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the listes Royall, to doe his devoire, against <hi>Thomas Mow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bray</hi> Duke of <hi>Norfolke</hi> defendant, upon paine to bee accompted false and recreant. The Duke of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folke</hi> was hovering on horseback at the entry of the listes, his horse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing barbed with crimson velvet, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broadered richly with lions of silver; and mulbery trees: and when hee had made his oath, before the Constable
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:51490:85"/>
and Marshall, that his quarrell was just and true, hee entred the field boldly, crying aloud, God aid him that hath the right: then hee lighted from his horse and sat downe in a Chaire of crimson velvet, curtained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with red and white Damaske, and placed at the other end of the Lists. The Lord Marshall viewed both their speares, to see that they were of equall length: the one speare hee carried himselfe to the Duke of <hi>Hereford,</hi> and sent the other to the Duke of <hi>Norfolke</hi> by a Knight. This done a Herrald proclaimed, that the traverses and chaires of the combat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants should bee removed, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them in the Kings name, to mount on horseback, and addresse themselves to the encounter, the Dukes were quickly horsed, and clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed their beavieres, and cast their speares into the rests. Then the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets sounded, and the Duke of <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> set forth towards his enemy, about six or seaven paces; but before the Duke of <hi>Norfolke</hi> beganne to put
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:51490:85"/>
forward, the King cast downe his Warder, and the Herralds cried ho: then the King caused the Dukes speares to bee taken from them, and commanded them to forsake their horses, and returne againe to their chaires: where they remained above two long houres, whilst the King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberated with his Councell what was fittest to bee done. At last, the Herralds cried silence: and Sir <hi>Iohn Borcy</hi> a Secretary of State, with a loud voice, read the sentence and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the King and his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell out of a long roule: wherein was contained, that <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Lancaster</hi> Duke of <hi>Hereford,</hi> appellant, and <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Mowbray</hi> Duke of <hi>Norfolke,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant, had honourably appeared that day within the Lists Royall, and declared themselves valiant and hardy Champions; being not only rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but forward and desirous to dare in the battell: but because this was a matter of great consequence and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, the King with the advice of his Councell, thought it meet to take the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:51490:86"/>
same into his owne hands: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon had decreed, that <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Hereford,</hi> because hee had displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the King, and for divers other considerations, should within 15. dayes next following, depart out of the Realme, and not to returne du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Tearme of tenne yeares, without the Kings especiall licence, upon paine of death.</p>
                  <p>When this judgement was heard, a confused noise was raised among the people, some lamenting either the desert, or the injury of the Duke of <hi>Hereford,</hi> whom they exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly favoured: others laughing at the conceit of the King: first in cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, and afterwards in frustrating so great an expectation: wherein hee seemed to doe not much unlike <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligula</hi>; who lying in <hi>France</hi> with a great army neere the Sea shoare, gave the signe of battell, set his men in array, marched forth as if it had beene to some great piece of service and suddenly commanded them all to gather cockles.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="103" facs="tcp:51490:86"/>Then the Herralds cried againe, ô Yes: and the Secretary did read on, how the King had likewise or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, that <hi>Thomas Mowbray</hi> Duke of <hi>Norfolke,</hi> because hee had sowen sedition, by words whereof hee could make no proofe should a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the Realme of <hi>England,</hi> and never returne againe, upon paine of death: and that the King would take the profits and revenues of his lands, untill hee had received such summes of money as the Duke had taken up, for wages of the garrison of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi> which was still unpaid: and that the King prohibited, upon paine of his grievous displeasure, that any man should make suit or intreaty to him, on the behalfe of either of these two Dukes.</p>
                  <p>Those sentences being in this sort pronounced, the King called the two exiles before him, and tooke of them an oath, That they should not converse together in forraine Regions, nor one willingly come in place where the other was: fearing
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:51490:87"/>
(as it was like) least their Common discontentment should draw them, first to reconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and afterward to revenge. But this policy was over weake for this purpose: for oaths are commonly spurned aside, when they lye in the way, either to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour or revenge: and if their u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited forces was so much to bee regarded, their seperate pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers was not altogether to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, the latter Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of this Realme, have with more safety wholly abolished the use of abjuration and exile: and doe either by death extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish the power, or by pardon alter the will of great Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, from entring into despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and dangerous attempts: which men in misery and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, have more vehemency to beginne, and more obstinacy to continue.</p>
                  <p>When the <hi>Samnites</hi> had once
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:51490:87"/>
so enclosed the Romane Legions within certain streights, that they left them neither space to fight, nor way to fly: but without force enforced them to yeeld: they sent to <hi>Heren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius Pontius,</hi> an aged Ruler of their state, for his advise, what were best for them to doe: his answer was, that the Romans should be permitted to dep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rt, without any hurt, losse or scorne. This pleased not such as were either covetous for spoyle, or cruell for blood: and therefore they sent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him the second time, who then returned answer, that the Romans should be put to the sword, and not one man suffered to escape. The contrariety of these two counsels, brought the old man into suspition of dotage: but he comming in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to the Campe, maintained both to be good: the first whereof (which he thought best) would by unexpected favour, provoke the Romans to a perpetuall friendship: the second would deferre the warres for many yeares, wherein the enemies should
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:51490:88"/>
hardly recover strength: third coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saile there was none that safely might be followed. Yes (said the <hi>Samnites</hi>) to grant them their lives, yet with such conditions of spoyle and shame, as the lawes of victory doe lay upon them. This is the way (answered <hi>Herennius</hi>) which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther winneth friends, nor weakneth enemies: but will much encrease the fury against us, and nothing diminish the force. And even so, in matters of more particularity, that course of punishment is out of course, which doth neither reclaime the mind of men, nor restraine the might from mischievous endeavours. But again to our purpose.</p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Norfolke,</hi> having now got a fall, where he thought to take his rest, repented his enterprise, and utterly condemned his light conceit of the Kings lightnesse, and so with extreame griefe and anguish of mind, hee departed out of the Realme into <hi>Almaine,</hi> and from thence travelled to <hi>Venice</hi>; where

And this infortunate adventure hee neither bare out vain gloriously, nor yet tooke impatiently: but in the midst of his misery, retained still his reputation and honour; shewing no signe of sorrow or submisnesse in his countenance, nor letting fall any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate and unseemly word. The people as he departed, by heaps floc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked about him, some to see, and some to salute him: lamenting his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in such sort, as though their on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly light and delight did then forsake
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:51490:89"/>
them: not sparing to exclaime, that it was against the Law of Armes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the custome of the Realme, and against all right whatsoever, that he should be exiled, who had done his honourable endeavour for the maintenance of his appeale. This affection was the more excessive, for that the Duke was driven into exile by occasion of his liberall speeches, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the most hatefull persons in all the Realme: and being the only no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man then alive, of the popular fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, the love was wholly accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated upon him, which was before divided among the rest. And thus the Duke leaving <hi>England,</hi> tooke shipping and passed the Seas to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, and from thence went into <hi>France</hi>: where he was honourably entertained by <hi>Charles</hi> the French King, and found such favour, that hee should have taken to wife the onely daughter of <hi>Iohn</hi> Duke <hi>Berrie,</hi> Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle to the King of <hi>France,</hi> but King <hi>Richard</hi> fearing the sequel, if the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour which was borne to the Duke
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:51490:89"/>
of <hi>Hereford</hi> within the Realme, should be strengthned with so great affinity in <hi>France,</hi> cast such stops in the way, that the marriage did not proceed.</p>
                  <p>This yeare the Lawrell trees withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, almost throughout the Realme, &amp; afterwards against all expectation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered life and flourished againe.

she had no sooner set foot within this Land, but such a tempest did forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with arise, as had not beene seene many yeares before: whereby di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ships within the haven were quashed to peices, but especially, and first of all, the ship wherein the Queene was carried, this was the rather observed, because such stiffe stormes were likewise stirring, when the King brought his second wife out of <hi>France:</hi> wherein many ships perished, and a great part of the Kings fardage was lost. At New-castle upon Tine, as two shipwrights were squaring a piece of Timber, wheresoever they hewed, blood issued forth in great abundance. At one of the Kings palaces, flyes swar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med so thicke, that they obscured the ayre: these fought together most fiercely, so that sackfuls lay dead upon the ground, and this continued so long, that scarce the third part of them (as it was thought) remained alive, many like accidents are recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of that time; but I will maine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine

neither the truth of them, nor what they did pretend: being a matter wherein most men are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther superstitious, then not credulous, and doe oftentimes repute common occurrences to be ominous, when any strange event doth ensue. Yet as I am loath to avouch any vaine and trifling matter, so dare I not detract all truth from things anciently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported; although done in an age wherein was some delight in lying, many doe suppose, that those things which are fatally allotted, though they never be avoyded, yet some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times are foreshewen: not so much that we may prevent them, as that wee should prepare our selves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them.</p>
                  <p>In the two and twenty yeare of the raigne of K. <hi>Richard, Iohn</hi> of Gaunt, Duke of <hi>Lancaster</hi> dyed, and was buried, on the north-side of the high altar, of the Cathedrall Church of S. <hi>Paul</hi> in London, he was a man advised and wary in his passages of life, liking better safe courses with
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:51490:91"/>
reason, then happy by chance: of his owne glory, hee was neither negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, nor ambitiously carefull: to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the King hee carried himselfe in termes honourable enough for a moderate Prince, and yet not so plausible as a vaine man would desire; whereby there never happened to him any extraordinary matter, either in prejudice or preferment. After his death, the Duchie of <hi>Lancaster</hi> did in right devolue to the Duke of <hi>Hereford,</hi> his eldest sonne: but the King (as the nature of man is inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to hate those whom he hath har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med) seazed all the Lands and goods which appertained to the Duke of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> into his owne hands, and determined to perpetuate the banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Duke <hi>Henry</hi> his sonne: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking the Letters Patents, which were graunted to him at his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: whereby his generall Attur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies were enabled to prosecute his causes, and sue Liverie of any inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: which during his exile might fall unto him, his homage being respi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:51490:91"/>
for a reasonable fine. The King supposed his estate more safe, by the weaknesse and want of the Duke, whom he had now in some jealousie and doubt: but these violent deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were meanes rather to provoke his mischiefes, then to prevent them; for by injurious suppressing of the Dukes greatness, he greatly augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the same.</p>

fame was held suspected, and a good life more in hazard then a bad: pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testing that none of these practises, were either devised by his counsaile, or done by his consent.</p>
                  <p>At this time, the whole frame of the state was much shaken, and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of great weight and moment did hang by a very slender thred. The King was plunged in pleasure and sloath: after whose example, others also (as men doe commonly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme their minds according to the Princes disposition) gave over themselves to delicacy and ease: whereby cowardise crept in, and shipwracke was made, both of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and glory. The chiefest af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of state had been ordered for a long time, according to private respects, whereby the Common-wealth lost both the fat and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and seemed not at seasons and by degrees, but with a maine course, and at once to ruinate, and fall. The north parts were many times can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vased, and by small, yet often losses,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:51490:92"/>
almost consumed by the <hi>Scots:</hi> who had there taken many townes and castles, and defaced all the countrey with slaughter and spoyle. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the south parts were often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times wasted by the Frenchmen: and in <hi>France</hi> many strong holds were lost. It was also constantly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, that the King made agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to deliver unto the King of <hi>France,</hi> the possession of <hi>Calice,</hi> and of other townes which hee held in those parts; but the performance thereof was resisted by the Lords: whether this were true o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and the people by rudenesse became intractible: so that the holding ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of charged the King, with the yearly dispence of thirty thousand markes.

The King made some expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in his owne person, with great preparation and charge: but being once out of credit, whatsoever fell out well, was attributed to others; misfortunes were imputed onely to him. If any thing were happily at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieved by some of the Nobility, it was by the Kings base hearted Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites, to whom military vertue was altogether unpleasant, so extenuated or depraved, or envied, that it was seldome rewarded, so much as with countenance and thankes: yea sometimes it procured suspicion and danger, the King being informed by a cunning kind of enemies, Com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:51490:95"/>
vertue peculiar to a Prince; and that it was a perillous point, to have the name of a man of private estate, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for the same in every mans mouth. Hereupon, few sought to rise by vertue and valour, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier way was, to please the pleasant humour of the Prince. Likewise matters of peace, were managed by men of weakest sufficiency, by whose councell either ignorant or corrupt, the destruction of the best hearted Nobility, was many times attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and at the last wrought. The profits and revenues of the Crowne were said to bee let to farme, the King making himselfe Landlord of his Realme, and challenging no great priviledge by his Raigne, but only a dissolute and uncontrouled life. Great summes of money were yearely ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther exacted from the subjects, then by them voluntarily granted: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of no good did ensue, but the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the Kings private delights, &amp; the advancement of his hatefull fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorites. To these he was somewhat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:51490:96"/>
his power liberall: for which cause, hee was faine to borrow, beg, and extort in other places: but hee purchased not so much love by the one, as hate by the other. Besides the ordinary tearmes of tenths and fifteenths, which were many times paid double in one yeare, divers new impositions were by him devised and put in use: sometimes exacting xii. d. of every person throughout the Realme: sometimes of every religious man and woman vi. s. viii. d. and of every secular Priest as much, and of every lay person married or sole, xii. d. Vnder the favourable tearme of benevolence, he wiped a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from the people such heaps of money, as were little answerable to that free and friendly name. He bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed in all places of the Realme great summes of money upon his privy Seals, so that no man of worth could escape his loane: but he sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and to few, returned payment againe.</p>
                  <p>This present yeare, he sent certain
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:51490:96"/>
Bishops, and other personages of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, to all the shires and Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions within the Realme, to declare unto the people the Kings heavy dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasures against them, for that they had beene abetters and complices of the Duke of <hi>Gloucester,</hi> and of the Earles of <hi>Arundell</hi> and <hi>Warwicke</hi>: and that the King was minded to make a roade upon them, as common enemies, except they would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge their offence, and submit themselves to his mercy and grace. Hereupon, all the men of worth in every shire, and Towne-corporate, made their acknowledgement and submission in writing under their seales: and afterwards were faine to graunt unto the King such impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table summes of money, to purchase againe his favour, as the land being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready greatly impoverished, they were hardly able to endure. Then were exacted of them strange and unaccustomed oathes, vvhich vvere put likevvise in vvriting under their seale. They vvere also compelled to
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:51490:97"/>
set their hands and seales to blancke charts; wherein the King might af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards cause to be written what he would: so that all the wealth of the Realme was in a manner at his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion and pleasure. These and such like violences, were farre wide from the moderate government of King <hi>Henry</hi> the second: who maintaining great warres, and obtayning a larger dominion, then pertained at any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time to this Realme of <hi>England,</hi> never demanded subsidie of his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: and yet his treasure after his death, was found to be nine hundred thousand pounds, besides his Iewels, and his plate.</p>
                  <p>In this sort the King bearing a heavie hand upon his subjects, and they againe a heavie heart against him, and being<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> withall a Prince weake in action, and not of valour sufficient to beare out his vices by might, the people at length resolved to revolt, and rather to runne into the hazard of a ruinous rebellion, then to endure safety joyned with
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:51490:97"/>
slaverie: so they attended occasion, which shortly after was thus offered. The King received Letters of adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement out of <hi>Ireland</hi> (which being priviledged from other venimous beasts, hath alwayes beene pestered with traytors) how the Barbarous Irish had cut in pieces his Garrison, and slaine <hi>Roger Mortimer</hi> Earle of <hi>March,</hi> (who had beene declared heyre apparent to the Crowne) exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cising all the cruelty in wasting of the countrey, which wrath and rage of victory could incite a barbarous people to practise. This losse being great in it selfe, the hard affection of the people did much augment by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port: whereupon the King delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, whether it were requisite that hee should undertake the warre in person, or commit it to Commanders of lower degree? Some perswaded him, that wholly to subdue <hi>Ireland,</hi> stood neither with policie, nor yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most with possibility: for if it were ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly &amp; quietly possessed, some governor might hap to grow to that greatnesse,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:51490:98"/>
as to make himselfe absolute Lord thereof; and therefore it was better to hold it certaine by weake enemies, then suspected by mighty friends, and yet by what meanes should those bogges and those woods be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, which are more impregnable, then the walled Townes of other countries? then if the purpose were, only to represse the savage people, the warre was of no such weight, as should draw the King to stand in the field: and therfore he might stay in the West parts in <hi>England,</hi> and from thence make shew of the Princely puissance and state; neither ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his person without cause, and already at hand if need should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. Others were of opinion, that to subdue and replenish <hi>Ireland,</hi> was a matter neither of difficulty nor danger: but both profitable and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable to the King, and to God very acceptable. For if credit might be given to ancient Histories, this Realme of <hi>England</hi> was once as insuperable with bogs and woods,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:51490:98"/>
as <hi>Ireland</hi> was then: but the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Conquerors kept not their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidiarie Souldiers in idle garrison, whereby many times the mind grew mutinous, and the body diseased, and both unable for the labour and hardnesse of the field: but they held as well them, as the subdued Britains continually exercised, either in build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of townes in places of best ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; or in making of high wayes: or else in drayning and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of bogs: by which meanes the countrey was made fruitfull and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable, and the people learned the good manners, not rudely to repulse the flattering assaults of pleasure; preferring subjection with plenty, before beggerly and miserable liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. That the same <hi>Romans</hi> also kept many larger Countries in quiet obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, (so long as they were quiet among themselves) without either feare or danger of any Governours; first by dividing them into small Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces: Secondly by constituting in every province divers officers, as Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:51490:99"/>
and Procurators, whereof one was able to restraine the other; the first having power over the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the subjects, the second over their goods: thirdly, by changing these officers every yeare: which was too short a time to establish a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty: Lastly, by retaining at <hi>Rome,</hi> their wives and children, and whole private estate, as pledges for their true demeanour. That the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger was rather to bee feared, least a weake enemy whilest he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned, should gather strength, and be able to stand upon termes of with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing: example here of happened when the <hi>Romans</hi> overcame this I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land: for many Britaines, who upon no conditions would abide bondage, withdrew themselves into the North parts of the land, and by maintaining their ancient custome of painting their bodies, were called of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, Picti</hi>: these were neglected along time, and held in scorne, as neither of force, nor of number to be thought worthy the name of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies:
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:51490:99"/>
but afterwards they confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated themselves with other people, and so sharpely assaulted the subdued Britaines, that being unable to resist, and the Romans shrinking from them, they were constrained to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire helpe of the Saxons, and so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene their enemies and their aids, (being set as it were betwixt the bee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>le and the blocke) they lost the possession of the best part of their land. That it was a pittifull policy for assurance of peace, to lay all waste as a wildernesse, and to have dominion over trees and beasts, and not over men. That hereby the King did loose the revenue of a fruitfull countrey, and the benefit of wealthy subjects, which are the surest treasure that a prince can have. That hereby al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the majesty of his estate was much impaired: for (as <hi>Salomon</hi> saith) <hi>The honour of a king consisteth in the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of subjects.</hi> That the country be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unfurnished of people, was open to all opportunity of forrain enemies. That if none of these respects would
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:51490:100"/>
move: yet the King was bound in duty to reduce those savages to the true worship of God, who did then either prophanely contemne him, or superstitiously serve him.</p>
                  <p>These reasons so weighed with the King, that hee gathered a mighty Army, determining to goe in person into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and to pacifie the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey before his returne: but all his provision was at the charge of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: and whereas in time of sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a wise Prince will least grieve his people: as seeming to stand in some sort at their courtesie, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to imploy their bodies beside; the King in peace no storer for war, was forced to offend, when he should have beene most carefull to winne favour. So about Whitsontide, hee set forth on his voyage with many men, and few souldiers; being a dissolute and untrained company, and out of all compasse of obedience, hee carried with him his whole treasure, and all the goods and ancient Iewels appertaining to the Crowne. In
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:51490:100"/>
his company went the Duke of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merle,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Exeter,</hi> and divers other noble men, and many Bishops, and the Abbot of <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</hi> Hee also tooke with him the sonnes of the Duke of <hi>Gloucester,</hi> and of the Duke of <hi>Hereford</hi>; whose favourers he chiefely feared.</p>
                  <p>When he came to Bristow, he was put into suspicion, (whether upon some likelihood, or meere malice) that <hi>Henry Piercy</hi> Earle of Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland, and certaine others, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended some disloyall enterprise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him: and for that cause did not follow him into <hi>Ireland,</hi> but had fastned friendship with the King of <hi>Scots,</hi> upon purpose to retire them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into his countrey, if their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts should faile. Hereupon the King sent message that the Earle should forthwith come unto him with all the power, that he could conveniently make. The Earle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned answer, that it was unnecessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in respect of that service, to draw men from such distant places: for
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:51490:101"/>
the Irish rebels were neither so many nor so mighty, but the King had strength at hand sufficient to suppresse them: that it was also dangerous to disfurnish the North-parts of their forces, and to offer opportunity to the Scottish Borderers, who were alwayes uncertaine friends in their extremities, and assured enemies upon advantage. The King seeing his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement in these termes, both contemned and controuled, would not stand to reason the matter with the Earle, neither had he the reason to defer revenge, untill hee had full power to worke it: but presently in the violence of his fury, caused the Earle and his confederates to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed traytors, and all their Lands and goods to be seized to his use. The Earle tooke grievously this disgrace, and determined to cure and close up this harme with the disturbance of the common state. And thus the King having feathered these arrowes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his owne brest, passed forth in his Iourney into <hi>Ireland.</hi>

Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the Noble men (the principall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of cruelty) beganne to discourse both their private dangers, and the deformities of the State: and upon opportunity of the Kings absence, some of them did conspire to cut off

that authority which would not bee confined, and to cast it upon some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who was most like to repaire that which King <hi>Richard</hi> had ruined: or if (said they) our power shall come short of so good a purpose, yet will wee sell him both our lives and lands with glory in the field, which with certainty in peace wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enjoy: The onely man upon whom all men resolved, was <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Hereford</hi> (whom since the death of his Father they called Duke of <hi>Lancaster</hi>) not at his owne mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or desire, but because hee was generally esteemed meet: as being of the Royall bloud, and next by descent from males to the succession of the Crowne: one that had made honourable proofe of his vertues and valour: the onely man of note that remained alive, of those that before had stood in armes against the King for the behoofe of the Common-wealth: for which cause hee was deepely touched at that time both in honour and in state.

pleased as possible to prove, and of necessity to be followed: whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they secretly dispatched their let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the Duke, solliciting his spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy returne into <hi>England,</hi> and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that as well for the benefit of the Realme, as for their owne particular safety, they were forced to use force against King <hi>Richard:</hi> that if it would please him to make the head, they would furnish him the body of an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble army, to expell the King from his unfortunate government, and to set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle the possession of the Crowne in him, who was more apt and able to sustaine the same: that they would not provide him a base multitude onely, and they themselves helpe in bare wish<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

These letters were conveyed by men crafty and bold, yet of sure credit, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in trust with the Duke: who passing into <hi>France,</hi> first associated

unto them, <hi>Thomas Arundel</hi> late Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and at that time (whether deservedly or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cause) an exile in <hi>France:</hi> then they travelled by severall wayes, and in counterfeit attire to <hi>Paris,</hi> where all met at the House of one <hi>Clugney,</hi> where the Duke then sojourned. After some courtesies of course, with welcome on the one side, and thanks on the other, and joy of both: the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> having obtained of the Duke privacy and si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, made unto him a solemne ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in these words, or to this sense following.</p>
                  <p>Wee are sent unto you (right high and Noble Prince) from the chiefe Lords and States of our land, not to seeke revenge against our King upon private injury and displeasure: nor upon a desperate discontentment to set the State on fire: nor to procure the ambitious advancement of any particular person: but to open unto you the deformities and decayes of our broken estate, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:51490:103"/>
your aid, in staying the ruinous downefall of the same. The remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the honourable reputation that our Countrey hath borne, and the Noble acts which it hath atchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, doth nothing else, but make the basenesse more bitter unto us, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into it is new fallen. Our victorious armes have heretofore beene famous and memorable not onely within the bounds of our Ocean-Sea, and in the Ilands adjoyning unto us; but also in <hi>France,</hi> in <hi>Spaine,</hi> and in other parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> yea in <hi>Asia</hi> and in <hi>Africk,</hi> against the Infidels and Barbarians: so that all Christian Princes have beene either glad to imbrace our friendship or loath to provoke us to hostility. But now the rude <hi>Scots,</hi> whose spirits we have so many times broken &amp; brought on their knees, do scornefully insult upon us: the naked and fugitive <hi>Irish,</hi> have shaked oft our shackles, and glutteth themselves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, with massacres and spoiles: with these wee dayly fight, not for glory, but to live: insomuch as we are
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:51490:104"/>
become a pitty to our friends, and a very jeast to our most base and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible enemies. Indeed the King hath both sent and led great armies into these Countries, but in such sort, that they have much wasted the Realme with their maintenance: but neither revenged nor relieved it with their armes: and no mervaile, for all our diligent and discreet lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders (the very sinewes of the field) are either put to death, or banished, or else ly buried in obscurity and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace: and the marshalling of all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires is committed (without any respect of sufficiency or desert) to the counsaile and conduct of those who can best apply themselves to the Kings youthfull delights. Among these ancient Nobility is accompted a vaine jeast; wealth, and vertue are the ready meanes to bring to destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                  <p>It grieves mee to speake, but it helpeth not, to hide that which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man seeth: our Ancestours lived in the highest pitch and perfection of
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:51490:104"/>
liberty, but wee of servility; being in the nature not of subjects, but of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and flat slaves; not to one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractable Prince onely, but to many proud and disdainefull favorites<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not alwayes the same, but ever new: and no sooner have wee satisfied some, but fresh hungry Masters are streight wayes set upon us, who have more endammaged us by extortion and bribes, then the enemy hath done by the sword. What unusuall kinds of exactions are dayly put in practise? without either measure or end, &amp; of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes without need; or if any be, it proceedeth rather upon riotous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penses, then any necessity of honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable charge: and great summes of money are pulled and pilled from good subjects, to bee throwne away amongst unprofitable unthrifts. And if any man openeth his mouth against these extorted taxations, then either by feined imputation of capitall crimes, or by small matters aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or else by open cruelty and force, his life or liberty is forth with
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:51490:105"/>
hazarded. It were too tedious, too odious, too frivolous to put you in mind of particular examples, as though your owne estate, and the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable losse of your Vncle, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Noble friends, could bee forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea I suppose that there is no man of quality within the Realme, who either in his owne person, or in his neerest friends, doth not plainely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that no man enjoyeth the safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his goods, and suerty of his body; but rich men in the one, and great men in the other are continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endangered. This then is our case; but what is our remedy? we have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured, and we have entreated: but our patience have drawne more heavy burthens, and our complaints procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red more bitter blowes: by the one, our livings, and our lives by the other are dayly devoured. And therefore we are now compelled to shake off our shoulders this importable yoke, and submit our selves to the sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty of some more moderate and worthy person: not so much for the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:51490:105"/>
griefe of our miseries which are past, nor for the paine of our present di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresses, as for feare of such dangers as are most like to ensue; for the King hath cut away the chiefe of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and the Commons he hath pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the quick, and still he harrieth us as a conquered Country: whereby we are laid bare to the havock of all our enemies, and utterly disabled, not only to recover that which is lost, but also to retain even that which is left. But to whom should we complaine? what succour, whose aid should we desire? you are the onely man, who in right should, and in wisedome can, and in goodnesse will (we hope) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve us. For you are neerest to the King in bloud and therefore ought to have the rule of that which his weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse cannot wield. Your yeares are well stayed from the light conceits of youth, and so spent, that all your a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions have made proofe of ability in government of greatest charge: no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing past needeth excuse, and feare is vain for any thing to come. The pains
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:51490:106"/>
and perils which heretofore you have undertaken for the benefit of your Countrey, putteth us also in good hope, that in these extremities you will not forsake us; wee are all as in a ship that is ready to sinke, as in a house that is ready to fall, and doe most humbly crave and call for your helpe, now or else never shew your selfe in favour of your Countrymen, to free us, to free your selfe, to free the whole State from these dangers and decayes, by taking into your hands the scepter and diademe of the Realme, and reducing againe the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment thereof to a Princely free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; in combining the Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of one with the liberty of all. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit not this occasion, to set forth to the view of the World, as in a large field, and at free scope your vertue and courage, by relieving miserable wretches from their Oppressours: which action hath bin so highly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, that many Heathen men for the same, have beene accompted as Gods. This we are constrained to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:51490:106"/>
and intreat: this is both honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for you to accept, and easie to bee performed: and so much the more, in that no Prince, by any people have beene desired with greater affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, nor shall bee with more duty obeyed.</p>
                  <p>The Duke entertained this speech with great moderation of mind, shewing himselfe neither disturbed thereat, nor excessive in joy. His answer concerning the King, was respective and well tempered; rather lamenting his weakenesse then bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming his malice. Concerning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe hee spake so modestly, that hee seemed rather worthy of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, then desirous. The life (quoth hee) which hitherto I have led, hath alwayes beene free from ambitious attempts: and the stayednesse of my yeares, hath now setled my mind from aspiring thoughts: &amp; experience of former dangers hath bred in mee a wary regard in such weighty pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings; for to cast a King out of state, is an enterprise not hastily to be
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:51490:107"/>
resolved upon, nor easily affected: but suppose that matter not impossible; and perhaps not hard, yet the rate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of that like precedents, will make the action seeme injurious to most men: and hee that shall attaine a Kingdome upon opinion of desert, doth charge himselfe with great expectation, and how honourably soever hee carry himselfe, shall never want his deadly Enviers: besides this, in civill dissentions the faith of the whole people is fleeting, and danger is to bee doubted from every particular person: so that it is possible that all may fall away, and impossible to beware of every one. Therefore I could rather wish to spend the course of my yeares which yet remaine in this obscure, yet safe and certaine state, then to thrust my selfe upon the pikes of those perils, which being once entred into, are dangerous to follow, and deadly to forsake: for in private attempts, a man may step and stop when hee please: but hee that aimeth at a Kingdome, hath no mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:51490:107"/>
course betweene the life of a Prince, and the death of a Traytour.</p>
                  <p>The Archbishop hearing this, did as vainely persist in importuning the Duke, as hee vainely seemed unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and strange. The state (said hee) wherein now you stand, is not so safe and certaine as you doe conceive. Indeed, by rejecting our request you shall avoid certaine dignity, and therewith uncertaine and contingent dangers; but you shall procure most certaine destruction both to your selfe and us. For this secret cannot bee kept long secret from the King: and even good Princes are nice in points of soveraignty, and beare a nimble care to the touch of that string: and it more hurteth a subject to be esteemed worthy of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, then it will profit him to have refused the offer. What then will he doe, who putteth the chiefest surety of his raigne in the basenesse &amp; bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his subjects? whose head be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing possessed with eternall jealousy, maketh every presumption a proofe,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:51490:108"/>
and every light surmise a strong suspition against them. Surely since the generall favour and love which the people beareth you, hath bereaved you of your liberty, this their generall desire will not leave your life un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched. As for us, if wee either faint in our intent, or faile in the interprise, <hi>actum est:</hi> we shall be as lambs among lions: and no conquest can be so cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell as the Kings raigne will bee over us. Certainely we have gone too far, for to goe back; and the time is past, when you for ambition and wee for envy might seeme to attempt against the King: the attainment of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome must now bee a Sanctuary and refuge for us both. The like examples are not rare (as you affirme) nor long since put in practise, nor farre hence to be fetched. The Kings of <hi>Denmarke</hi> and of <hi>Swedland,</hi> are oftentimes banished by their Subjects; often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times imprisoned and put to their fine; the Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> about an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>undred yeares past, deposed <hi>Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> their Emperour, and are now in
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:51490:108"/>
hand to depose their Emperour <hi>Wenceslaus.</hi> The Earle of <hi>Flanders</hi> was a while since driven out of his Dominion by his owne people, for usurping greater power then apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to his estate. The ancient <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines</hi> chased away their owne King <hi>Carecious,</hi> for the lewdnesse of his life, and cruelty of his rule. In the time of the <hi>Saxon Heptarchy, Bernre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> King of <hi>Mercia,</hi> for his pride and stoutnes towards his people, was by them deposed. Likewise <hi>Aldre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> and <hi>Ethelbertus</hi> Kings of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland,</hi> were for their disorders expelled by their subjects. Since the victory of the <hi>Normains,</hi> the Lords endeavoured to expell King <hi>Henry</hi> the third, but they were not able: yet were they able to depose King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> the second, and to constitute his young Sonne <hi>Edward</hi> King in his stead: these are not all and yet enough to cleare this action of rarenesse in other Countries; and novelty in our. The difficulty indeed is somewhat, because the excellency is great:
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:51490:109"/>
but they that are afraid of every bush, shall never take the bird: and your selfe had once some triall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, when without battaile, without bloud or blowes, you had the King at such a lift, as hee held his Crowne at your courtesie, even at that time when his grievances were, neither for greatnesse nor continuance, so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable as now they are growne: and by reason of his tender yeares, not out of all compasse, both of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse for the fault, and of hope for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment. And as concerning the lawfulnesse.</p>
                  <p>Nay (said the Duke) where neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity doth inforce, it is superfluous to use speech, either of easinesse or of lawfulnesse: necessity will beate thorow brasen walles; and can bee li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited by no lawes. I have felt very deeply my part in these calamities, and I would you knew with what griefe I have beheld yours: for what other reward have I received, of all my travailes and services, but the death of my Vncle &amp; dearest friends,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:51490:109"/>
my owne banishment, the imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my Children, and losse of my inheritance? and what have beene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to you, for your bloud so often shed in his unfortunate warres, but continuall tributes, scourges, gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, and slavery? I have made suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient proofe both of patience in my owne miseries, and of pitty in yours: remedy them hitherto I could not: If now I can, I will not refuse to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine that part, which your impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity doth impose upon mee, if wee prevaile, we shall recover againe our liberty: if we loose, our State shall bee worse then now it is: and since we must needs perish, either deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly, or without cause, it is more honourable to put our selves upon the adventure either to winne our lives, or to dye for desert: and although our lives were safe, which indeed are not, yet to abandon the State, and sleepe still in this slavery; were a point of negligence and sloath. It remaineth then, that wee use both se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy and celerity, laying hold upon
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:51490:110"/>
the oportunity which the Kings ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence hath now presented unto us: for in all enterprises which never are commended before they bee at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieved, delayes are dangerous, and more safe it is to bee found in action, then in counsaile: for they that deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate onely to rebell, have rebelled already.</p>
                  <p>So the Messengers departed into <hi>England,</hi> to declare the Dukes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, and to make preparation against his arrivall, both of armour, and of subjection, and desire to obey. Presently after their departure, the Duke signified to <hi>Cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>les</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> that hee had a desire to goe into <hi>Britaine,</hi> to visite <hi>Iohn</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Duke of <hi>Britaine</hi> his friend and kinsman. The King suspecting no further fetch, sent letters of commendation in his favour, to the Duke of <hi>Britaine:</hi> but if hee had surmised any dangerous drift against King <hi>Richard,</hi> who not long before, had taken his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to wife; in stead of letters of safe conduct, hee would have
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:51490:110"/>
found letts to have kept him safe from disturbing his Sonne in lawes estate.</p>
                  <p>As soone as the Duke was come into <hi>Britaine,</hi> hee waged certaine souldiers, and presently departed to <hi>Calis,</hi> and so committed to Sea for <hi>England</hi>; giving forth, that the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cause of his voyage, was to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Dutchy of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> and the rest of his lawfull inheritance, which the King wrongfully detained from him. In this company was <hi>Thomas Arundel</hi> the Archbishop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> and <hi>Thomas</hi> the Sonne and Heire of <hi>Richard</hi> late Earle of <hi>Arundel,</hi> who was very young, and had a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before escaped out of prison, and fled into <hi>France</hi> to the Duke. The residue of his attendants were very few, not exceeding the number of fifteene lances<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so that it is hard to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme whether it was greater mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile, either that he durst attempt, or that he did prevaile with so small a company: but his chiefest confidence was in the favour and assistance of
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:51490:111"/>
the people within the Realme. So he did beare with <hi>England,</hi> yet not in a streight course, but sloated along the shoare, making head sometimes to one coast, and sometime to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to discover what forces were in a readines either to resist or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him.</p>
                  <p>As he was in this sort hovering on the Seas, Lord <hi>Edmund</hi> Duke of <hi>Yorke,</hi> the Kings Vn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>le, to whom the King had committed the custody of the Realme during the time of his absence, called unto him <hi>Edmund Stafford</hi> Bishop of <hi>Chichester,</hi> Lord Chancellour, and <hi>William Soroupe</hi> Earle of <hi>Wiltshire,</hi> Lord Treasurour of of the Realme, also Sir <hi>Iohn Bushy,</hi> Sir <hi>Henry Greene,</hi> Sir <hi>William Bagot,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Russell,</hi> and certaine others of the Kings Privy Councell; and entred into deliberation what was best to be done. At the last it was concluded, deceitfully by some, unskilfully by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and by all perniciously for the King; to leave the Sea coasts, and to leave <hi>London,</hi> the very Walles and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:51490:111"/>
Castle of the Realme, and goe to S. <hi>Albons,</hi> there to gather strength suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to encounter with the Duke. It is most certain that the Dukes side was not any wayes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oore furthered, then by this dissembling and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveable dealing: for open hostility and armes, may openly and by armes be resisted: but privy practises as they are hardly espied, so are they seldome avoided. And thus by this meanes the Duke landed about the feast of S. <hi>Martin,</hi> without let or resistance, at <hi>Ravenspur</hi> in <hi>Houldernesse,</hi> as most Writers affirme.</p>
                  <p>Presently after his arrivall, there resorted to him Lord <hi>Henry Pearcy</hi> Earle of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and Lord <hi>Henry</hi> his Sonne, Earle of <hi>Westmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> Lord <hi>Radulph Nevil,</hi> Lord <hi>Rose,</hi> Lord <hi>Willoughby,</hi> and many other personages of honour, whose compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny encreased reputation to the cause, and was a great countenance and strength to the Dukes further pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses. And first they tooke of him an oath, that he should neither procure
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:51490:112"/>
nor permit any bodily harme to bee done unto King <hi>Richard</hi>; whereupon they bound themselves upon their honours to prosecute all extremities against his mischievous Counsailors. And this was one step further then that which the Duke pretended at the first, when hee tooke shipping at <hi>Calis,</hi> which was onely the recovery of his inheritance: but that was as yet not determined, nor treated, and of some perhaps not thought upon; which afterwards it did ensue: and so was that place easily insinuated into by degrees, which with maine and direct violence would hardlier have beene obtained. Then the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people desperate upon new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, and without head, head-long to matters of innovation, flocked very fast to these Noble men, the better sort for love to the Common-wealth, some upon a wanton levity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and vaine desire of change, others in regard of their owne distressed and decayed estate, who setting their chlo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e hopes and devices upon a
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:51490:112"/>
generall disturbance, were then most safe when the common state was most unsure. So betweene the one and the other, the multitude did in short time increase to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of threescore thousand able soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.</p>
                  <p>The Duke finding this favour not onely to exceed his expectation, but even above his wish, hee thought it best to follow the current whilst the streame was most strong, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing right well, that if fortune be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, as the first doe fall out, the rest will commonly succeed: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cutting off unnecessary delayes, with all possible celerity hee hastned towards <hi>London:</hi> to the end that pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessing himselfe thereof as the chiefe place within the Realme, both for strength and store, hee might there make the seat of the warre. In this journey no signe nor shew of hostili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty appeared, but all the way as hee passed, the men of chiefest quality and power adjoyned themselves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, some upon heat of affection,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:51490:113"/>
some for feare, others upon hope of reward after victory; every one upon causes dislike; with like ardent desire contending, least any should seeme more forward then they: In every place also where hee made stay, rich gifts and pleasant devises were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented unto him, with large supply both of force and provision, farre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove his need: and the Common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple which for their greatnesse take no care of publique affaires, and are in least danger by reason of their base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, with shouts and acclamations gave their applause: extolling the Duke, as the onely man of courage, and saluting him King; but spending many contumelious termes upon King <hi>Richard,</hi> and depraving him as a simple and sluggish man, a da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stard, a m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ycock, and one altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unworthy to beare rule; shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves as much without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in railing upon the one, as they were in flattering the other. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, the Duke for his part was not negligent to uncover the head, to
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:51490:113"/>
bow the body, to stretch forth the hand to every meane person, and to use all other complements of popular behaviour: wherewith the minds of the common multitude are much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted and drawen; taking that to be courtesie, which the severer sort account abasement. When he came to the Citie, hee was there likewise very richly and royally entertained, with processions and pageants, and vers other triumphant devises and shewes: the standing in all the streets where hee passed, were taken up to behold him; and the unable multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, who otherwise could not, yet by their good words, wishes, and wils, did testifie unto him their loving affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: neither did there appeare in any man at that time, any memory of faith and allegiance towards King <hi>Richard,</hi> but as (in seditions it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes hapneth) as the most swayed all did goe.</p>
                  <p>On the contrary side, the Duke of <hi>Yorke</hi> with the rest of his counsaile, fell to mustering of men at S. <hi>Albones</hi>
                     <pb n="154" facs="tcp:51490:114"/>
for the King: but as the people out of divers quarters were called thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, many of them protested, that they would doe nothing to the harme and prejudice of the Duke of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caster,</hi> who they said was unjustly expelled, first from his countrey, and afterwards from his inheritance. Then <hi>W. Scroupe</hi> Earle of Wiltshire, Lord Treasurer, S. <hi>I. Bush,</hi> Sir <hi>W. Bagot,</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry Greene,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the stiffe resolution of the people, forsooke the Duke of <hi>Yorke,</hi> and the Lord Chancellor, and fled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Bristow</hi>; intending to passe the seas into <hi>Ireland</hi> to the King. These foure were they upon whom the common fame went, that they had taken of the King his Realme to farme: who were so odious unto the people, that their presence turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the hearts of many subjects; yea it was thought that more for dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure against them, then against the King, the revolt was made. For being the only men of credit and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority with the King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> under false co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:51490:114"/>
of obedience, they wholly go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned both the Realme and him; to many mischiefes corrupting his mind, and in many abusing his name, either against his will, or without his knowledge, insomuch as hee was innocent of much harme which passed under his commandement: but the patience of the people could not endure that two or three should rule all: not by reason they were sufficient, but because they were in favour: and the King in that he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them whom hee might have bridled, or was ignorant of that which he should have knowne, by tollerating and wincking at their faults, made them his owne, and opened thereby the way to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction. So often times it falleth out to be as dangerous to a Prince to have hurtfull and hatefull officers in place and services of weight, as to be hurtfull and hatefull himselfe.</p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Yorke</hi> either amazed at this sudden change, or fearing his adventure if hee should proceed in
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:51490:115"/>
resistance, gave over the cause, and preferred present security, before du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with danger; giving most men occasion to misdeeme by his dealing, that hee secretly favoured the Dukes Enterprise, likewise all the other Counsellors of that side, either open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared for the Duke, or secretly wished him well: and abandoning all private direction &amp; advise, adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themselves to the common course, presuming thereby of greater safety.</p>
                  <p>Duke <hi>Henry</hi> in the meane time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>London,</hi> entred into delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with his friends, what way were best to be followed. At the last; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving considered the forwardnesse of the people, the greatnesse of the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill whereinto they had already plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and the Kings irreconcilable nature, whereof hee made proofe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Duke of <hi>Glocester,</hi> and the Earles of <hi>Arundell</hi> and <hi>Warwicke:</hi> they finally resolved to expell him from his dignity, and to constitute Duke <hi>Henry</hi> King in his stead: and to that end open warre was denounced
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:51490:115"/>
against the King, &amp; against all his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers, as enemies, to the quiet &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity of the Realme; and pardon al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so promised to all those that would submit themselves to follow the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent course, otherwise to looke for no favour, but all extremities. None of the Nobility durst openly oppose himselfe to these designes: some un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to play all their state at a cast, kept themselves at liberty, to be dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by successe of further event: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers consented coldly, and in tearms of doubtfull construction, with intent to interpret them afterwards, as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion should change; but the most part did directly and resolutely enter into the cause, and made their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes common with the Duke, in danger of the attempt, but not in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: among whom, the Duke stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding up, used speech to this purpose.</p>
                  <p>I am returned here as you see, at your procurement, &amp; by your agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment have entred into armes for the common liberty: wee have hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to prosperously proceeded, but in
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:51490:116"/>
what tearmes wee now stand, I am altogether uncertaine. A private man I am loath to be accounted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing designed to be King by you; and a Prince I cannot be esteemed, whilst another is in possession of the Kingdome. Also your name is in suspence, whether to be termed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels or subjects, untill you have made manifest that your alleageance was bound rather to the state of the Realme then the person of the Prince. Now you are the men who have both caused this doubtfulnesse and must cleare the same; your parts still remaineth to be performed; your vertue and valour must adde strength to the goodnesse of this action. Wee have already attempted so farre, that all hope of pardon is extinct; so that if we should shrinke back, and break off the enterprise, no mercy is to bee expected, but butchery and gibbets, and all extremities: if we drive off and delay the accomplishment ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, wee shall loose the opportunity which now is offered, and open to
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:51490:116"/>
our enemies occasion of advantage. For the peoples blood is up now on our side, and nothing is wanting but our owne diligence and care: let us not therefore trifle out the time of doing, in talking and deliberating: it is best striking whilst the iron is hot: let us set forth roundly, and possesse our selves with speed of all the parts of the Realme: and so we shall be able either to keepe out our concurrent, or else to entertaine him little to his liking. So troops of men were sent into every quarter of the Realme, to secure them for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king strength on the part of King <hi>Richard:</hi> but the people in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as men broken with many bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, did easily entertaine the first Commer, and were not curious to side with the stronger. The Duke pursued those of the Kings Privie Councell, which fled away from the Duke of Yorke; bearing himselfe with great cheare and courage, as confident in the cause, and secure of the event. When he came at <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow</hi>
                     <pb n="160" facs="tcp:51490:117"/>
hee found the Castle fortified against him; but in short time hee forced it, and tooke therein Sir <hi>Iohn Bushy,</hi> Sir <hi>Henry Greene,</hi> and <hi>W. Scroupe, L. Treasurer,</hi> a joyfull prey to the common people: who (fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that if execution should be defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, Petitions for pardon might hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to prevaile, and so their cruelties and injuries should be answered with the vaine title and commendation of clemency) did violently require them unto death, no respite could be obtained, no defence admitted, no answer heard: yea their humble and submisse intreaty was interpreted to argue a weake and broken courage upon a guilty conscience, which more incensed the rage of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, crying out that they were tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, blood-suckers, theeves, and what other hainous tearmes insulting fury did put into their mouthes: at which clamorous and importunant instance, the day following they were beheaded, Sir <hi>VVilliam Bagot</hi> came not with them to <hi>Bristow</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:51490:117"/>
turned to <hi>Chester:</hi> and the pursuit being made after the most, hee alone escaped into <hi>Ireland.</hi> This execution, partly because it pleased the people, and partly because it excluded all hope of the Kings pardon, caused them to cleave more closely to the Duke; which greatly increased both his glory, and his hope<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> having offers of so large aid &amp; need of so little.</p>
                  <p>In the meane time this newes of the Dukes arrivall, and of other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences, part true, part false, &amp; part enlarged by circumstance, (as fame groweth in the going) was blowne over to the King, being then entang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with other broyles in <hi>Ireland,</hi> at the receipt whereof, he caused the sonnes of the Duke of <hi>Glocester,</hi> &amp; of the Duke of <hi>Lancaster</hi> to be impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned in the strong Castle of <hi>Trim,</hi> which is in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and for dispatch to returne into <hi>England,</hi> le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t many matters unfinished, &amp; most of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision behind, hasting and shuffling up, as present necessity did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force. So being both unskilfull
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:51490:118"/>
and unfortunate himselfe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void of good direction; with more haste then good hap, hee tooke ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, with the Duke of <hi>Aumerle, Exceter,</hi> and <hi>Surry,</hi> the Bishops of <hi>London, Lincolne,</hi> and <hi>Caerliele,</hi> and many other men of quality: and crossing the seas, landed at <hi>Milford-Haven</hi> in Wales, in which coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimen he alwayes reposed his chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est surety and trust, but then he saw contrary to his expectation, that as well there as in all other places, the people by plumps flocked to the Duke, &amp; fled from him: yea they that came with him began for to waver, no man encouraging them to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, but many to revolt. This sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine change not looked for, not thought upon, disturbed all the Kings devises, &amp; made him irresolute what he should doe: on the one side hee saw his cause and quarrell to be right, and his conscience (he said) cleare from any bad demerite: on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side he saw the great strength of his enemies, and the whole power
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:51490:118"/>
of the Realme bent against him: and being more abashed by the one, then emboldned by the other, hee stood perplexed in uncertaine termes, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther where to stay, or whither to stir, having neither skill nor resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion himselfe in cases of difficulty, and obnoxious to hurtfull and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull counsaile. Some advised him to martch forward, and pierce deeper into the land, before his own forces fell from him: affirming that valour is seconded by fortune: that this courage of his, would confirme the constancy of his souldiers: and his presence put the people in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of their saith, that in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces he should find some, who for fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, or for hire, or else for duty, would adhere unto him: whereby hee should soone gather strength suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to joyne issue with his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in the field. Others perswaded him to retire againe into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and then if succour failed him in <hi>England,</hi> to wage souldiers out of other countries. But the King
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:51490:119"/>
being no man of action in military affaires, rejected both the counsailes, as neither venturous enough with the one, nor warie enough with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and taking a middle course (which in cases of extremity of all is the worst) hee determined to make stay in <hi>Wales,</hi> and there to attend to what head this humour would rise.</p>
                  <p>The Duke upon advertisement that the King was landed in <hi>VVales,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved with a strong Army from <hi>Bristow</hi> towards <hi>Chester,</hi> using the first opportunity against him, and which indeed was the fittest. When Lord <hi>Thomas Pearcy</hi> Earle of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester,</hi> and Steward of the Kings Houshold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> heard of the Dukes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, he brake forth into shew of that displeasure, which before he had conceived a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ainst the King, for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming his brother, the Earle of <hi>Northumberland</hi> traytor, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon openly in the Hall, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the Kings servants, he brake his white rod, the ensigne of his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:51490:119"/>
and forthwith departed to the Duke, willing every man to shift for himselfe in time: by which act hee lost reputation, both with the Haters and Favourers of King <hi>Richard</hi>; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accounted of the one a Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, of the other a Forsaker, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayer of the King. After this exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, almost all the rest, more fearefull then faithfull, scattered themselves every one his way: and they who in the Kings flourishing time, would have contended to be formost, now in his declining estate equally draw backe, and like swallowes, forsooke that house in the winter of fortunes boysterous blasts, where they did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but feed and foyle in the sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of her sweet sun-shine. And thus betweene faint souldiers, and false friends, the King was abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and forsaken, and left almost unto himselfe: looke on he might, but let it, hee could not, as not of force to punish that, which hee never forced to prevent: his only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy was patience: (a cold comfort)
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:51490:120"/>
his onely revenge was complaint: (a weake weapon) betweene which two, his bitternesse did in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner breake from him.</p>
                  <p>And doe these also (said he) for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake me? doth their faith and my fortune end together? well, if I had forsaken them in time, I had not been forsaken of others, who once loved me better, and now are able to harme me more. But now I see the blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of my judgement: I plainely see, that there is no friendship in flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, nor treachery in plaine truth: and I would I had as much time to reforme this error: as I am like to have to repent it, but they would not suffer mee to bee wise when I might, and now they have made me wretched they runne from me: they could be the causes, but they will not be companions of my miseries: such attendants are Crowes to a carcasse, which flocke together, not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, but to devoure it, and no soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner have they laid the bones bare, but straight-wayes they are gone.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="167" facs="tcp:51490:120"/>Thus the King having lost both the feare and love of his subjects, disturbed and distracted in thoughts, without comfort, councell, or cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, remained still in <hi>Wales,</hi> as a stranger at home, as an exile in his owne Kingdome, not daring to goe to <hi>London,</hi> nor any man desirous to come to him, shifting still from place to place, and (as it fals out to men distressed and amazed) fearing all things, but most disliking the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent. The Duke continually pursued him with a mighty Army: but the Kings company was too small to do any thing by force, and yet too great to remaine in secret: neither were they in any sort assured unto him, but such as shame and reverence retained a while; bands of small countenance with men fearefull of danger, and carelesse of credit. At the length he came to the Castle of <hi>Conweye</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and there being utterly destitute both of helpe and hope, he stood divided in mind what way to bend his course, all his followers were more
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:51490:121"/>
ready to impugne the opinions of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then to give direction them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, as seeing better what to shun then what to follow: and as it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes chanceth in desperate causes, that way was commonly preferred, whereof the opportunity was alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy past. Some advised him that it was then time to think, rather of saving his life, then recovering his estate. You see (said they) how greatly, and how wholly your subjects are set against you: it is but in vaine to look for a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain change, or without a change to hope that your purposes may prevail, give place for a time to the current of this fury: let it have the full sway; and when it is at the highest pitch, it will turne againe; and then you shall have the tide as strong on your side, as it is now against you. This motion or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther commotion of the people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and against nature: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (as a stone forced upward) is most strong at the beginning, and the further it passeth, the more it weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, untill at last it returne to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:51490:121"/>
course againe. Therefore give a little space for the bad to draw back, for the good to put forward: treasons prevaile on the suddaine, but good counsailes gather forces by lea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sure. You have example in your no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Progenitor, King <hi>Henry</hi> the third, against whom the Lords set up <hi>Lewis</hi> the French Kings son<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> conditions were concluded, and faith was made that he should be their King; but this purpose lasted not the pulling on: for before they had possessed him of the kingdome, they joyned together in armes against him, and were as fierce to drive him out of the Realme, as they had beene found to draw him in. The like alteration may you likewise not only hope, but assuredly expect: for the minds of men are constant in nothing but inconstancy, &amp; persevere only in change, in dislike of things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent they desire new, wherwith they rest not long contented, but are many times glutted even with the first sight. And indeed how can they long endure the Raigne of him,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:51490:122"/>
who attayning the Kingdome onely by their favour and might, shall hold the same in a manner, at their cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie and will? for every unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant command, shall be deemed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude: every suit rejected, shall charge him with unkindnesse; Yea, if honour be not offered, they will be discontented: and upon any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of displeasure, thinke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves as able to displace him, as they were to set him up: therefore you may for a time, returne againe into <hi>Ireland</hi>; or else passe the seas to your Father in law, the King of <hi>France:</hi> you may assure your selfe of his as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance, to set upon your side, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover your losses. Times have their turnes, and fortune her course too and fro like the sea, and magnanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is shewne by enduring, and not relinquishing, when she doth crosse, only loose no point of courage, and keepe your person at large: reserving your selfe to that good hope, which never dyeth whilst life endure.</p>
                  <p>Others, who were enemies to all
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:51490:122"/>
counsaile, whereof themselves were not Authors, perswaded the King, that the Nobility and Commons of the Realm had attempted so far, that they would rather dye, then desist; not so much for hatred to you, as for feare to themselves; having so deadly incensed your displeasure against them. For it is a hard matter to forgive, and impossible to forget those injuries and indignities which they have offered. And to omit what some Princes have done, what all will promise to doe, they will soone find fresh and bleeding exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples what you are like to doe. The Duke of <hi>Gloucester,</hi> and the Earle of <hi>Arundell,</hi> and of <hi>Warwicke</hi> did rise in armes against you, not to remove you from your Crowne: but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move certaine persons from your company, an action more displeasing then prejudiciall unto you: at the last, a friendship was made, and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of free pardon granted unto them: but what followed? was ever the breach perfectly made up?
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:51490:123"/>
did displeasure dye? or was it only dissembled? ah, it grieveth us to thinke, how the present want of their lives, hath fully revenged their deaths: for if they had lived, their countenance and authority would easily have stayed these stirs; and the manner of their deaths doth strike an obstinate persistance into all your enemies. As for refuge to forraine Princes, you shall surely receive of them entertainment and allowance, and yet may grow burdensome, and at last perhaps faile: but it is very hard to draw any Prince into so dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous a quarrell: and more hard by that meanes to prevaile: or if you should, it is to be feared that the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorers will hold to themselves the benefit of their conquest, and not yeeld it over unto you. Few coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries but have beene under pretence of ayde by forrainers subdued: and this was the onely cause which first drew the Saxons into this land: who so assisted the Britaines against their enemies, that themselves could not be
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:51490:123"/>
resisted from possessing their king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Yet we do not altogether con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the helpe of strangers, in cases of extremitie; but doe account it a remedy, least to be trusted, and last of all to be tryed. What then if first you should procure a treaty, to see in what termes the people stand against you? It may be that upon some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions they will submit themselves unto you, as heretofore they have done. Or if they will needs deforce you from your kingdome, yet if an honourable maintenance may be assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, what shall you lose therby? What shall you lack? You have no child to be disinherited; the chiefest motive which maketh men so greedy to get, and so carefull to keepe. And as for your selfe, you shall bee removed from a steep and slippery hill to a smooth and pleasant plain; from tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pestuous seas to a calme haven; from dangerous travaile to secure rest, &amp; if there be no solace without safety, no felicity without firmnesse; you shall find the private life not onely more
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:51490:124"/>
sweet, but more high and happy, then your princely state. The tallest trees are weakest in the tops; in widest fields are greatest tempests; and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy alwayes aimeth at loftiest marks: so that to be placed on high, is a false felicity, and a true misery in shew a rule, but indeed a subjection to all the subjects; having least stay to stand, and most danger in the fall: and therefore if you come downe safely, you are therein priviledged above many other. But you shall lose (you will say) the credit and the countenance of a King: so you shall the cares; and so you shall the casual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. The Crowne and Scepter are things most weighty to weld: if a Prince be good, he is laden with la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, if evill, with infamy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach: if either, with perils: on every side hee is beset with dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Rocks, with deadly Gulfes, and continually tossed with strong and sturdy tempests: so that to be freed from these feares, is to be esteemed an escape, and not a losse. This did

the Stoick Philosopher perceive, who seeing <hi>Dionysius</hi> sit merily and freely conceited in the Theater, being a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before expelled his Kingdome; greatly condemned the error of his people, who had banished him to such liberty, and so preferred him by his punishment. These are the dreams of Philosophers (you will say) who usually deprave and contemne honour, and yet never lie from ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable mens tables. Let passe then Philosophers: go to vaine and sottish men. <hi>Seleuchus</hi> being a King, was wont to say, that if a man knew with what cares the Diadem was clogged, hee would not take it up, although it lay in the street. You will say per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure, that like the Boat-man, hee looked one way, and pulled ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; or like the Lapwing, he cryed most when hee was furthest from his Nest, vainely dispraysing that which hee was loathest to loose. What say you then to <hi>Antiochus?</hi> whom when the <hi>Romans</hi> had dispoyled him of all <hi>Asia</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he sent unto them great
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:51490:125"/>
thankes, that they had rid him of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit and importable cares, and set him at a moderate quiet: you will say that hee made a vertue of his necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Well then, wee are somewhat neere your case: and they that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not frame their wils to this wisdome, let them thanke their enemies for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcing them to it. But what say you to <hi>Dioclesian?</hi> who did voluntarily relinquish, not a small and corner Kingdome, but the greatest Empire that the world did ever beare, and found so sweet contentment in that exchange, that when hee was impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuned by the Senate, to resume his estate, hee utterly rejected their suite. But what need we travell in externe Histories for those examples, whereof wee have so large supply in our own? the ancient Saxon Kings: <hi>Kingilsus, Ina, Ceolulpus, Fadbertus, Ethelre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus, Kenredus, Offa, Sebbi,</hi> and <hi>Sige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertus</hi> did of their owne accord lay downe their Diadems and Scepters, and betake themselvs to solitary &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious lives. Now many Princes have
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:51490:125"/>
held their estate with better fortune, but none did ever with greater ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour leave it, then you should at this present: for others have abandoned their rule, either for desire of case, or for avoidance of dangers, or upon some sluggish or superstitious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion: but you for love to your Countrey, shall forbeare to seeke your uttermost remedy, in setting up a most cruell warre: wherein much <hi>English</hi> bloud should bee spilt, and the Realme deprived of many worthy armies. Let others bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to forsake their Kingdomes, when they had no longer pleasure to hold them: but your praise shall bee for giving over, when it is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test benefit unto the people; and the more hope you have to prevaile, if you list to contend, the greater com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations will it bee to yeeld, as being rather voluntary then by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint.</p>
                  <p>The King commended the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of the first, but this last Counsell best agreed with his faint and feeble
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:51490:126"/>
Spirit, more yeelding to feare then forward in hope; apt by the one to despaire, unable by the other to hold out in any hard adventure, preferring alwayes abject and base safety, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hazard with honour. Yet were many ready to reply, that all speech of conditions and yeelding was both dishonourable, and also dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous: for even in hardest haps, said they, a Noble nature will not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently relinquish; but first endeavour either by courage to repell the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, or by wisedome to decline it: and why should you so little esteeme your glory and fame, as without bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, or blow striken to bind your hands, and yeeld up your weapons, and put y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:51490:126"/>
you may assure your selfe that faire words will bee given, and large offers made: but the performance shall consist in the courtesie of the Conquerour: and nothing will bee thought unlawfull to him that hath power. King <hi>Edward</hi> the second was too heavy to bee indured, even of his owne Sonne: and many have used violence to themselves, rather then they would fall into the power of their concurrents: and doe not you expect more favour or greater fortun then other have found: let never that senselesnesse possesse your mind, to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine that a Prince may live safely in private estate: for in this case there is no meane betweene <hi>Caesar,</hi> and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing betweene the highest honour &amp; the deadliest downefall. Therefore o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit neither all, nor any one meanes unassayed, to maintaine your side by armes: no greater harme can happen at the hardest, then that which wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly you runne into: you can but die if you bee vanquished, and die you shall if you doe yeeld: but by the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:51490:127"/>
one you shall end your life with glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, by the other with shame and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall reproach. And although you doe now esteeme equally of both, yet when you shall see your selfe pent in prison; in dayly feare and expectancy of a bloudy Messenger; you shall then perceive a difference in death, and find the weakenesse and fault of the Councell which you are about to follow. Many like speeches were with great vehemency often repeated, but the Kings eares were stopped against all impression of manhood: and as hee was unable to governe himselfe in his prosperous estate, so was hee much lesse sufficient to wind out of these intricate trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. Therefore perceiving himselfe so straitly beset, that hee could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly either escape away, or shift any longer, hee desired speech with <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Arundel</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi> and Lord <hi>Henry Pearcy</hi> Earle of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> of whom, the one hee had banished, the other hee had proclaimed Traytour not
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:51490:127"/>
long before. These two came unto him, and the King upon short confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, understanding what stiffe sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macks they bare against him, was content not to demand that which he saw hee could not obtaine: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon agreed that hee would relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish his estate, upon condition that an honourable living might be assig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him, and life promised to eight such persons as hee would name: the greatest number whom adversity did not alter. This was then both readily and faithfully promised by the Archbishop and the Earle, and afterward solemnely ratified by the Duke. The King ceased not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat submisly, and promise largely, and (as the nature is of men per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed with feare) above his ability, and without measure, the Earle encouraged him, and declared that the Duke before he had obtained any aid, secured by his oath the safety of the Kings person. Then the King desired to talke with the Duke, which was likewise promised; and so the
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:51490:128"/>
Archbishop and the Earle departed, and the King removed to the Castle of <hi>Flint</hi> about eight miles distant from <hi>Chester,</hi> to which place the Duke came to him. Here the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances and words of both were noted, by them that were present; the King seemed abject and base: the Duke neither insulting nor relen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, but comforting and promising friendly. The King repeated many benefits and kindnesses that hee had shewed: how in former time hee had spared the Dukes owne life, and late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his Sonnes: in regard whereof he desired him, with such submisnes as was agreable rather with his necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty then his honour: that hee would shew some pitty where hee had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived such pleasure: and permit him to enjoy his life, with such private maintenance as was convenient for his estate. The Duke put him in good comfort, promising him assuredly, that he would provide for his safety: for which hee suffered himselfe to be solemnly thanked, and thought it
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:51490:128"/>
not much to have it accounted a great benefit. Indeed from that time the King was kept safe and sure enough, from binding any of the Dukes pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses, neither could it so easily have beene discerned what had beene best for him to doe, as that this which he did was the very worst: for the same night he was brought by the Duke &amp; his army to <hi>Chester,</hi> and from thence secretly conveyed to the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> there to be kept safe untill the Parliament, which was appointed shortly after to be holden.</p>
                  <p>Thus the King yeelded himselfe: the 20. day of <hi>August,</hi> being the 47. day after the Dukes arrivall: so that his journeyes considered, from <hi>Houl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse</hi> in the <hi>North</hi> to <hi>London:</hi> from thence to <hi>Bristow,</hi> and so into <hi>Wales,</hi> and back againe to <hi>Chester:</hi> a man shall not easily travaile over the land in shorter time then he conquered it. So friendly was fortune unto him, that he either found or made a ready passage through all hinderances and lets: and it seemed that hee needed
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:51490:129"/>
onely, to open his armes, to meet and receive her, as shee offered her selfe unto him. All the Kings treasure and Iewels, with his horses, and all his fardage came to the Dukes hands; and many that were in his company, were afterwards also despoiled by the soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of <hi>Northumberland</hi> and <hi>Wales.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some Writers affirme, that the King did not yeeld himselfe, but was forelaid and taken, as he was secretly passing from <hi>Flint</hi> to <hi>Chester:</hi> but the authority of others who lived in that time, either in the plain view, or cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine intelligence of these affaires, who for their place could not but know, &amp; for their profession would not but deliver the very truth, hath drawne mee to follow their report: which I find also received by some late Writers, of as great deapth in judgement and choyce, as any (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception) that this age hath brought forth.</p>
                  <p>As the King was carried towards <hi>London,</hi> certaine Citizens conspired to lay themselves in a wait by the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:51490:129"/>
way, and sodainly to slay him; partly, for private grievances, and partly, for the cruelty that he had used towards the whole City: but the Major upon intelligence prevented the practice, &amp; rod forth in person with a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient company, to conduct him safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unto the Tower. Shortly after the Duke came to <hi>London</hi> in solemne e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, and sent forth summons in the Kings name, for a Parliament to bee holden at <hi>Westminster,</hi> the last day of <hi>September,</hi> in the same yeare: in the meane time he deliberated with his kindred, &amp; kind friends, concerning the order of his proceedings. The Duke of <hi>Yorke</hi> (who a little before had beene Governour of the Realme for the King, &amp; then was the chiefest Directour of the Duke) thought it best that King <hi>Richard</hi> should both voluntarily resigne, and also solemne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be deposed, by consent of all the States of the Realme: for resignation onely would be imputed to feare, and deprivation to force: whereof the one is alwayes pitied, &amp; the other en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied:
<pb facs="tcp:51490:130" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but if both concurre, and his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire be combined with his desert, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing willing to forsake that which he is adjudged worthy to forgoe, then shall it appeare, that he neither is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled his Kingdome by meere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint, nor leaveth it without just cause. This advice pleased the rest, and for executing thereof upon the day of S. <hi>Michael</hi> (which was the day before the Parliament should begin) there assembled at the Tower, <hi>Thomas Arundel</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Richard Scroupe</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Yorke Iohn</hi> Bishop of <hi>Hereford, Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaster, Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland, Radulph</hi> Earle of <hi>Westmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> Lord <hi>Hugh Burnel,</hi> Lord <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Barkly,</hi> Lord <hi>Rose,</hi> Lord <hi>Willough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,</hi> Lord <hi>Abergeiny</hi>; The Abbot of <hi>Westminster,</hi> the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

others either not noted, or not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred. When all were set in their places, King <hi>Richard</hi> was brought forth, apparelled in his Royall robe, the diademe on his head, &amp; the Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in his hand; and was placed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them in a Chaire of estate. Never was Prince so gorgeous, with lesse glory and greater griefe: to whom it was not disgrace sufficient, to lose both the honour and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of a King, but hee must openly to his greater scorne, renounce the one, and deliver the other. After a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle pause and expectation, the King a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose from his seat, and spake to the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly these words, or the very like in effect.</p>
                  <p>I assure my self that some at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, &amp; many hereafter, will accompt my case lamentable; either that I have deserved this dejection, if it be just; or if it be wrongfull, that I could nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void it. Indeed I do confes that many times I have shewed my selfe both lesse provident &amp; lesse painful for the benefit of the Common-wealth, then
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:51490:131"/>
I should, or might; or intended to doe hereafter; and have in many actions more respected the satisfying of my owne particular humour, then either justice to some private persons, or the common good of all, yet I did not at any time either omit duty or commit grievance, upon naturall dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes or set malice; but partly, by abuse of corrupt Counsellors, partly, by er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of my youthfull judgement. And now the remembrance of these o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versights, is so unpleasant to no man, as to my selfe; and the rather because I have no meanes left, either to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence the injuries which I have done, or to testifie to the World my reformed affections, which expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience and stayednesse of yeares had already corrected, and would dayly have framed to more perfection. But whether all the imputations, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with I am charged be true, either in substance, or in such quality as they are laid, or whether being true, they be so heinous, as to inforce these extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or whether any other Prince,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:51490:131"/>
especially in the heate of youth, and in the space of two and twenty yeares (the time of my unfortunate raigne) doth, not sometimes either for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, or upon displeasure in as deepe manner grieve some particular subject; I will not now examine: it helpeth not to use defence, neither booteth it to make complaint: there is left no place for the one, nor pitty for the other: and therefore I referre it to the judgement of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and your lesse distempered considerations.</p>
                  <p>I accuse no man, I blame no for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, I complaine of nothing: I have no pleasure in such vaine and need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse comforts; and if I listed to have stood upon termes, I know I have great favourers abroad; and some friends (I hope) at home, who would have beene ready<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea forward on my behalfe to set up a bloudy and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full warre: but I esteeme not my dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity at so high a prize, at the hazard of so great value, the spilling of so much <hi>English</hi> bloud, and the spoile &amp; wast of so flourishing a Realme, as
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:51490:132"/>
thereby might have beene occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Therefore that the Common-wealth may rather rise by my fall, then I stand by the ruine thereof, I willingly yeeld to your desires, and am heere come to dispossesse my selfe to all publike authority and title, and to make it free and lawfull for you to create for your King, <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaster</hi> my Cousin <hi>Germaine,</hi> whom I know to be as worthy to take that place, as I see you willing to give it to him.</p>
                  <p>Then he read openly and distinctly the forme of his cession, wherein he did declare, that he had discharged his subjects, from their oaths of fealty and homage, &amp; all other oaths what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever; and of his owne will and free motion, did abdicate the title digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and authority of a King: and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred up the possession of the Realm, with the use and title thereof, and all the rights thereunto appertaining. To this the King subscribed and was sworne: and then he delivered with his owne hands the Crowne, the
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:51490:132"/>
Scepter, and the Robe to the Duke of <hi>Lancaster</hi>; wishing unto him more happinesse therewith, then had ever happened unto himselfe. Then he did constitute the Archbishop of <hi>Yorke,</hi> and the Bishop of <hi>Hereford</hi> his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curatours, to intimate and declare this his resignation to all the States of the Realme, which should be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled together in Parliament. Lastly hee gave all his riches and goods, to the summe of three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand pounds in coine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides his Iewels and plate, for satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the injuries that hee had done, desiring the Duke, and all the rest that were present severally by their names, not altogether to forget that he had beene their King, nor yet too much to thinke upon the same; but to retaine of him a moderate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance; and in recompence of the case that he had done them by his voluntary yeelding, to permit him to live safely, in a private and obscure life: with the swetnesse whereof he was so possessed, that from thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:51490:133"/>
he would preferre it, before any preferment in the World. All this was delivered and done by the King, with voyce and countenance so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to his present heavinesse, that there was no man too unminde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of humane instability<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which was not in some measure moved thereat: in so much as a few secret teares mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the eyes of many that were present, in whose minds a confused and obscure alteration gan to begin.

<pb n="193" facs="tcp:51490:133"/>
one generall voice, did expresly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept and admit the same. Then it was thought meet that certaine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and misdemeanures concerning matters of government, should bee objected against the King: for which he should be adjudged as unworthy, as hee seemed unwilling to retaine the Kingdome. To this purpose cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine articles were engrossed, and openly read: in which was contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, how unprofitable the King had beene to the Realme; how unjust and grievous to the Subjects: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary both to his honour, and to his oath. The chiefest of which Articles are these that follow.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 FIrst, that King <hi>Richard</hi> did wastfully spend the Tresure of the Realme, and had given the possession of the Crowne, to men unworthy, by reason whereof, new charges were dayly laid on the necks of the poore Comminalty.</p>

were appointed by the High Court of Parliament, to commune and treat of matters concerning the State of the Realme, and the Common-wealth of the same, they being busied about the same commission he with with others of his affinity went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to impeach them of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Item, that by force and menace, hee compelled the Justices of the Realme at <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> to condiscend to his opinion for the destruction of the said Lords: Insomuch as he beganne to raise warre, against <hi>Iohn</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaster, Thomas</hi> Earle of <hi>Arundel, Richard</hi> Earle of <hi>Warwick,</hi> and other Lords contrary to his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and promise.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Item, that he caused his Vncle the Duke of <hi>Glocester,</hi> to be arrested without law, and sent him to <hi>Calis,</hi> and there without judgement mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered him: and although the Earle of <hi>Arundel</hi> upon his arraignement, pleaded his charter of pardon, he could not bee heard, but was in

whereby the said aged per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons fearing the sequell of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, submitted themselves to his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, whom hee fined and ransomed unreasonably at his pleasure.</p>
                  <p n="27">27 Item, he craftily devised cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caine privy oathes, contrary to Law, and caused divers of his subjects, first to be sworne to observe the same, and after bound them in bands for surer keeping the same, to the great undoing of many honest men.</p>
                  <p n="28">28 Item, where the Chancellor according to law, would in no wise grant a prohibition to a certaine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, the King granted it unto the same person under his privie Seale, with great threatnings if it should be disobeyed.</p>

statutes made at <hi>Shrewsbury, Anno</hi> 21. and the statutes made, <hi>Anno.</hi> 22. at <hi>Coventree.</hi>
                  </p>

Foure other Articles were laid, which particularly did concerne the said Archbishop, by whose doing chiefly the King was utterly undone.</p>
                  <p>Then was demanded of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and Commons of the Realme, what they judged both of the truth and desert of these Articles? who all agreed that the crimes were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious, and that King <hi>Richard</hi> was worthy for the same to be deposed from his princely dignity. The no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men gave their voyces, part corrupted by favour, part awed by feare: and the Commons are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly like a flocke of Cranes, as
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:51490:138"/>
one doth fly all will follow. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Commissioners were appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by both the Houses; who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced sentence of deposition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst King <hi>Richard,</hi> in manner and forme as followeth.</p>

<pb n="204" facs="tcp:51490:139"/>
considering the articles which were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly exhibited and read before the said States, which were so publike, notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, manifest, and famous, that they could nor can by no avoydance and shift bee concealed: also considering the confession of the said King, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging and reputing, and truly upon his certaine knowledge judging himselfe, to have beene, and to be altogether insuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient and unskilfull, for the rule and government of the Realmes and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions aforesaid, and of any parts of them, and not unworthy to bee deposed for the notorious demerits, by the said</hi> Richard <hi>first acknowledged, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward by his will and mandate, before the said States published, and to them opened and declared in the English tongue. Vpon these and other matters which were done concerning the same busines, before the said States and us, by the diligent place, name and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to us in this part committed, in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance and for a cautele wee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce, decree, and declare, the said</hi> Richard, <hi>to have beene, and to be unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:51490:139"/>
and unable, and altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient and unworthy for the rule, and government of the said Realmes, and of the Dominions, Rights, and parts of them: and in regard and respect of the premises, worthily to bee deposed from all kingly dignity and honour (if any such dignity and honour remaineth in him) and for the like cautele wee doe depose him by our sentence definitive, in this writing: inhibiting from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth expresly, all and singular Lords, Archbishops, Bishops, Prelates, Dukes, Marquesses and Earles, Barons, Knights, Vassalles, and all other per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sons whatsoever, of the said Realmes and Dominions, and other places to the said Realmes and Dominions appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the subjects and liege people of the same, and every of them, that from henceforth none obey, or intend to obey the aforesaid</hi> Richard, <hi>as King or Lord of the Realmes and Dominions afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then the same Commissioners were by the consent and suffrages of both houses, constituted Procura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:51490:140"/>
joyntly and severally for all the States of the Realme; to resigne and surrender unto King <hi>Richard,</hi> for them and all other homages of the Realme, all the homages and feal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which were both due and done unto him, as King and Soveraigne, and also to declare unto him all the premises, concerning his deposition. Now <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> that hee might bee reputed, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported at the least, not to attaine the Kingdome by intrusion and wrong, was counsailed by his friends, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend some lawfull challenge and claime thereunto: and being in power, it was no sooner advised what was to bee done, but it was presently devised how to doe it. So a title was drawne from <hi>Edmund,</hi> sonne to King <hi>Henry</hi> the third, whom they surnamed Crouch-backe: affirming that hee was the eldest sonne of King <hi>Henry,</hi> and that for his deformity, hee was put from his right of succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in the Kingdome; which was for that cause given to his younger bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:51490:140"/>
King <hi>Edward</hi> the third; to this <hi>Edmund</hi> the Duke was next of blood by his mother <hi>Blanche,</hi> sole daughter and heyre to <hi>Henry</hi> the first Duke of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> and sonne to the said <hi>Edmund.</hi> This cunning con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit was perceived of all men, but seeming not to perceive it, was a point of friendship in some, and of obedience in the rest: therefore the Kingdome of <hi>England</hi> being then thought vacant, both by the resigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and also by the deposition of King <hi>Richard:</hi> Duke <hi>Henry</hi> arose from his seat, and standing in the view of the Lords, crossed himselfe on the fore-head, and on the brest, and spake as followeth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In the name of God, Amen: I</hi> Henry <hi>of Lancaster, claime the realme of</hi> England, <hi>and the Crown, with all the appurtenances, as I that am descended by right line of the blood royall, comming from that good Lord K.</hi> Henry <hi>the third, &amp; through the right that God of his grace hath sent me, with the helpe of my kindred,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:51490:141"/>
and of my friends, to recover the same: Which kingdome was in point to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, for default of good government and due justice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After these words, it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in both houses, of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and of the Commons which were assembled, whether they did consent, that the Duke should raign? who all with one voyce acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and accepted him for their King: then the Archbishop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi> tooke him by the hand, and placed him in the Throne of estate, the Archbishop of <hi>Yorke</hi> assisting him, and all the assembly testifying their owne joy, and wishing his. Then the Archbishop made an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and tooke for his theame, this place of Scripture: <hi>See; this is the man whom I spake to thee of, this same shall raigne over my people,</hi> 1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 9.17. After all this hee was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claymed King of <hi>England,</hi> and of <hi>France,</hi> and Lord of <hi>Ireland:</hi> and the common people which is void of cares, not searching into sequels, but
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:51490:141"/>
without difference of right or wrong inclinable to follow those that are mighty, with shoutes and clamours gave their applause, not all upon judgement, or faithfull mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but mostionly upon a received custome to flatter the Prince what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever he be. Yet least the heat of this humour should allay by delay, it was forthwith proclaimed in the great Hall, that upon the 13. day of September next ensuing, the Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the King should be celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at <hi>Westminster,</hi> These matters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus dispatched, the K. proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, arose from his seat, and went to <hi>White-Hall:</hi> where hee spent the rest of day in royall feasting, and all other complements of joy: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding there appeared in him no token of statelinesse or pride, nor any change in so great a change.</p>
                  <p>Vpon Wednesday next follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Procurators, before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, went to the presence of King <hi>Richard,</hi> being within the Tower; and declared unto him the admission
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:51490:142"/>
of his resignation, and also the order and forme of his deposition: and in the name of all the States of the realm, did surrender the homage and fealty which had bin due unto him; so that no man from thenceforth would bear to him faith and obedience, as to their King. The King answered that he no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing regarded these titular circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, but contented himselfe with hope, that his cousen would be a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Lord, and good friend unto him.</p>
                  <p>So upon the 13. day of October, which was the day of the translation of <hi>Edward</hi> the Confessor, the Duke was with all accustomed solemnities, by the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> sacred, annoynted, and crowned King at <hi>Westminster,</hi> by the name of King <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth: upon the very same day, wherein the yeare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had bin banished the Realme. Hee was annoynted with an oyle, which a certain religious man gave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Henry</hi> the first, Duke of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> (Grandfather to the King by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers side) when he served in the wars
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:51490:142"/>
of King <hi>Edward</hi> the third, beyond the seas; together with this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie; that the Kings which should bee annoynted therewith, should bee the Champions of the Church. Duke <hi>Henry</hi> delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red this oyle in a golden violl to Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> the eldest sonne of King <hi>Edward</hi> the third; who locked up the same in a barred Chest within the Tower, with intent to be annoynted therewith, when he should be crowned King: but the Prince dying before his Father, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned there, either not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, or not regarded, untill this present yeare; wherein the King, being upon his voyage into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and making diligent search for the Iewels and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of his Progenitors, found this Violl and Prophesie: and understanding the secret, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to bee annoynted againe with that oyle: but the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> perswaded him, that both the fact was unlawfull, and the
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:51490:143"/>
precedent unseen, that a King should be annoynted twice: whereupon he brake off that purpose, and took the violl with him into <hi>Ireland:</hi> and when he yeelded himselfe at Flint, the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded it of him againe, and did receive and reserve the same, untill the coronation of King <hi>Henry</hi>; who was the first King of this Realme, that was annoynted therewith.</p>
                  <p>I am not purposed to discourse, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the authority, or of the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of these prophesies: but wee may easily observe, that the greatest part of them, either altogether fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, or were fulfilled in another sense, then as they were commonly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strued and taken. During the raigne of King <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by fire was first put in practise within this Realme, for controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies in points of religion: in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther extraordinary matter, hee did as much make the Church Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion, as shew himselfe a Champion of the Church: but afterwards his
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:51490:143"/>
successors were intitule, <hi>Defendars of the faith:</hi> and how in action they ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified the same, I refer to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, and report of later times.</p>
                  <p>Now it had beene considered, that the title which was derived to King <hi>Henry,</hi> from <hi>Edmund,</hi> whom they surnamed <hi>Crouchbacke,</hi> would be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken but for a blind and idle jest: for that it was notorious that the said <hi>Edmund</hi> was neither eldest sonne to King <hi>Henry</hi> the third (as it was plainely declared by an act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) nor yet a mishapen and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed person: but a goodly Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, and valiant Commander in the field, and so favoured of the King his Father, that hee gave him both the heritages and honours of <hi>Simon Mountfort</hi> Earle of <hi>Leicester,</hi> of <hi>Ferrare,</hi> Earle of <hi>Darby,</hi> and of <hi>Iohn</hi> Baron of <hi>Monmuth,</hi> who to their owne ruine and destruction, had displayed seditious ensignes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the King. And further to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance him to the marriage of <hi>Blanch</hi> Queene of <hi>Naverne,</hi> hee created him
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:51490:144"/>
the first Earle of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> and gave unto him the County, Castle, and Towne of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> with the Forrests of Wiresdale Lounsdale, New-castle, beneath Linne, the Manner, Castle, and Forrest of Pickering, the Manner of Scaleby, the Towne of <hi>Gome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester,</hi> of <hi>Huntendone,</hi> &amp;c. with many large priviledges, and high titles of honour.</p>
                  <p>Therefore King <hi>Henry</hi> upon the day of his Coronation; caused to bee proclaymed, that hee claymed the kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> first by right of conquest: Secondly, because King <hi>Richard</hi> had resigned his estate, and designed him for his successour: Lastly, because hee was of the blood royall, and next heyre male unto King <hi>Richard.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Haeres malus</hi> indeed (quoth <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund Mortimer,</hi> Earle of March, unto his secret friends) and so is the Pyrate to the Merchant, when hee despoyleth him of all that he hath. This <hi>Edmund</hi> was sonne to <hi>Roger Mortimer;</hi> who was not long before
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:51490:144"/>
slaine in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and had beene open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared heyre apparent to the Crowne, in case King <hi>Richard</hi> should dye without issue, as descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by his Mother <hi>Philip,</hi> from <hi>Lio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell,</hi> Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> who was elder brother to <hi>Iohn</hi> Duke of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caster,</hi> King <hi>Henries</hi> Father: and therefore the said <hi>Edmund</hi> thought himselfe, and indeed was, neerer heyre male to the succession of the Crowne, then hee that by colour of right, clayming it, carried it by dint of force.</p>
                  <p>But such was the condition of the time, that hee supposed it was vaine, for him to stirre, where King <hi>Richard</hi> could not stand: Whereupon hee dissembled, either that hee saw his wrong, or that hee regarded it; and chose rather to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse his title for a time, then by untimely opposing himselfe, to have it oppressed and depressed for ever: to this end hee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew himselfe farre from <hi>London,</hi> to his Lordship of <hi>Wigmore,</hi>
                     <pb n="116" facs="tcp:51490:145"/>
in the West parts of the Realme, and there setled himselfe to a private and close life: Idlenesse and vacancy from publike affaires, he accounted a vertue, and a deepe point of wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to meddle with nothing, whereof no man was chargeable to yeeld a reckoning. In revenues hee was meane, in apparell moderate, in company and traine not excessive, (yet in all these honourable, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his degree) so that they which esteemed men by outward appearance only, could see in him no great shew, either of wit and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage in his mind to be feared; or of wealth and honour in his estate to bee envied. And thus whilest a greater enemy was feared, hee passed unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded; making himselfe safe by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, where nothing was so dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous as a good opinion; and taking up those coales in obscurity for a time, which shortly after set all the Realme on fire.</p>

<pb n="217" facs="tcp:51490:145"/>
Lord <hi>Henry,</hi> being then about xiii. yeares of age, Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> Duke of <hi>Cornewall,</hi> and Earle of <hi>Chester,</hi> and soone after he created him also Duke of <hi>Aquitaine.</hi> After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it was enacted, by consent of all the states of the Realme, assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled together in the Parliament, that the inheritance of the Crownes and Realmes of <hi>England,</hi> and of <hi>France,</hi> and of all the Dominions to them appertaining, should bee united and remaine in the person of King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and in the heires of his body lawfully begotten: and that Prince <hi>Henry</hi> his eldest sonne, should be his heyre apparant, and successor in the premises: and if hee should dye without lawfull issue, then they were entayled to his other sonnes successively in order, and to the heyres of their bodies lawfully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten.</p>
                  <p>The inheritance of the Kingdome being in this sort setled in King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> and in his line, it was moved in the parliament what should be done with
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:51490:146"/>
King <hi>Richard.</hi> The Bishop of <hi>Caer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liel,</hi> who was a man learned and wise, and one that alwayes used both liberty and constancy in a good cause; in his secret judgement did never give allowance to these pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings: yet dissembled his dislike untill hee might to some purpose declare it: therefore now being in place to be heard of all, and by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the house, to be interrupted by none, hee rose up and with a bold and present spirit, uttered his mind as followeth.</p>
                  <p>This question (right honourable Lords) concerneth a matter of great consequence and weight: the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining whereof will assuredly procure, either safe quiet, or dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous disturbance, both to our particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar consciences, and also to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon state. Therefore before you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve upon it, I pray you call to your considerations these two things: Frist, whether King <hi>Richard</hi> be sufficiently deposed or no: Secondly, whether King <hi>Henry</hi> bee with good judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:51490:146"/>
or justice chosen in his place. For the first point we are first to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, whether a King, being law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and fully instituted by any just title, may upon impution either of negligence, or of tyrannie, be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by his subjects: Secondly, what King <hi>Richard</hi> hath omitted in the one, or committed in the other, for which hee should deserve so heavy judgement. I will not speake what may be done in a popular state, or in a Consular; in which although one beareth the name and honour of a Prince, yet hee hath not supreme power of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie; but in the one, the people have the highest Empire; in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Nobility, and chiefe men of estate; in neither, the Prince. Of the first sort was the common-wealth of the Lacedaemoans, who after the form of government w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> 
                     <hi>Licurgus</hi> framed, oftentimes fined, oftentimes fettered their kings, and sometimes condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them to death: such were also in <hi>Caesars</hi> time, the petty Kings
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:51490:147"/>
of every Citie in <hi>France</hi>; who were many times arraigned upon life and death, and (as <hi>Ambiorix</hi> Prince of the <hi>Leodienses</hi> confessed) had no greater power over the people, then the people had over them. Of the second condition were the Roman Emperours at the first; of whom some, namely, <hi>Nero</hi> and <hi>Maximinus</hi> were openly condemned, others were suddenly surprized by judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Tranquil. in Caligu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la. Tacitus in Proaemio.</hi>
                     </note> and authority of the Senate: and such are now the Emperors of <hi>Germany,</hi> whom the other Princes by their Aristocraticall power, doe not only restraine, but sometimes also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move from their Imperiall state: such are also the Kings of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> and <hi>Sweveland,</hi> who are many times by the Nobility dejected, either into prison, or into exile: such likewise are the Dukes of <hi>Venice,</hi> and of some other free states in <hi>Italy:</hi> and the chiefest cause for which <hi>Lewes</hi> Earle of <hi>Flaunders</hi> was lately expelled from his place, was for drawing to himselfe cognisance in matters of life
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:51490:147"/>
and death, which high power never pertained to his dignity.</p>
                  <p>In these and such like govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the Prince hath not regall rights, but is himselfe subject to that power which is greater then his, whether it bee in the Nobility or in the common people. But if the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne Majesty be in the Prince, as it was in the three first Empires, and in the Kingdome of <hi>Iudea,</hi> and <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi>; and is now in the kingdomes of <hi>England, France, Spaine, Scotland, Muscovia, Turky, Tartaria, Persia, Ethiopia,</hi> and almost all the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of <hi>Asia,</hi> and <hi>Africke</hi>: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though for his vices he be unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the subjects, yea hurtfull, yea intollerable: yet can they lawfully neither harme his person, nor ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard his power, whether by judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or else by force: for neither one, nor all Magistrates have any authority over the Prince, from whom all authority is derived, and whose only presence doth silence, and suspend all inferiour jurisdiction
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:51490:148"/>
and power. As for force, what subject can attempt, or assist, or counsaile, or conceale violence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his Prince, and not incurre the high and hainous crime of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son?</p>
                  <p>It is a common saying, thought is free: free indeed from punishment of secular lawes, except by word or deed it breake forth into action: Yet the secret thoughts against the sacred Majesty of a Prince, without attempt, without endeavour, have beene adjudged worthy of death: and some who in auriculer confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, have discovered their treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous devises against the person of their Prince, have afterwards been executed for the same. All Lawes doe exempt a mad man from punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: because their actions are not governed by their will and purpose: and the will of man being set aside, all his doings are indifferent, neither can the body offend without a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt or erronious mind: yet if a mad man draw his sword upon his King,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:51490:148"/>
it hath beene adjudged to deserve death. And lest any man should surmise that Princes, for the maintenance of their owne safety and soveraignety, are the onely Authors of these judgements; let us a little consider the Patternes and Preceprs of Holy Scripture. <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar</hi> King of <hi>Assyria,</hi> wasted all <hi>Palestine</hi> with fire and sword, oppugned <hi>Hierusalem</hi> a long time, and at the last expugned it: sl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Concerning the title from <hi>Edmund Crouchback,</hi> I will passe it over, seeing the authours thereof are become ashamed of so absurd abuse, both of their owne knowledge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and our credulity, and therefore all the claime is now made, by right of conquest; by the cession and grant of King <hi>Richard</hi>; and by the generall consent of all the people.

it selfe, and therewithall the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
                  <p>Neither have wee any custome, that the people at pleasure should elect their King: but they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes bound unto him, who by right of bloud is right successour; much lesse can they confirme and make good that title, which is before by violence usurped: for nothing can then be freely done, when liberty is once restrained by feare.

<pb n="233" facs="tcp:51490:153"/>
yet the Kingdome was not then ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the lawfull successour. But if we looke back to times lately past, we shall find that these titles were more strong in King <hi>Stephen,</hi> then they are in the Duke of <hi>Lancaster.</hi> For King <hi>Henry</hi> the first being at large liberty, neither restrained in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, nor constrained in mind, had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed him to succeed: (as it was upon good credit, certainely affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med;) The people assented to this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signement; and thereupon without feare, and without force, he was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed King, and obtained full pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of the Realme.

The mildnesse of King <hi>Richard</hi> hath bred in us this scorne, interpreting it to bee cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise and dulnesse of nature: the next Heire is likewise rejected: I will not say that with greater courage we shall find greater cruelty; but if ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of these shall hereafter bee able to set up their side, and bring the matter to triall by armes, I doe assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly say, that which part soever shall carry the fortune of the field, the
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:51490:155"/>
people both wayes must goe to wrack. And thus have I declared my mind concerning this question, in more words then your wisedom, yet fewer then the weight of the cause doth require: and doe boldly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that we have neither power nor policy, either to depose King <hi>Richard,</hi> or to elect Duke <hi>Henry</hi> in his place; that King <hi>Richard</hi> remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth still our Soveraigne Prince, and therefore it is not lawfull for us to give judgement upon him; that the Duke whom you call King, hath more offended against the King and the Realme, then the King hath done, either against him or us; for being ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished the Realme for tenne yeares by the King and his Counsaile (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst whom his owne Father was chiefe) and sworne not to returne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine without speciall license: hee hath not onely violated his oath, but with impious armes disturbed the quiet of the Land, and dispossessed the King from his Royall estate, and now demandeth judgement against
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:51490:155"/>
his person, without offence proved, or defence heard. If this injury and this perjury doth nothing move us, yet let both our private and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon dangers somewhat withdraw us from these violent procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings.</p>
                  <p>This speech was diversly taken, as men were diversly affected be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene feare, hope, and shame: yet the most part did make shew for King <hi>Henry,</hi> and thereupon the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop was presently attached by the Earle Marshall, and committed to prison in the Abbey of Saint <hi>Albones,</hi> whose counsaile and conjecture then contemned, was afterwards better thought upon; partly in the life time of King <hi>Henry,</hi> during whose raigne, almost no yeare passed without great slaughters and executions: but more especially in the times succeeding, when within the space of 36. yeares, twelve set battailes upon this quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell were fought within the Realme by <hi>English</hi> men onely: and more then fourescore Princes
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:51490:156"/>
of the Royall bloud slaine one by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</p>
                  <p>Then it was concluded, that King <hi>Richard</hi> should bee kept in a large prison, with all manner of Princely maintenance: and if any persons should conspire to reare warre for his deliverance, that hee should bee the first man who should suffer death for that attempt. Then the Acts of the Parliament holden at <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> in the 11. yeare of King <hi>Richard,</hi> were revived; and the Parliament holden the 21. yeare of King <hi>Richard</hi> was wholly repealed: and they who were attainted by that Parliament, were restored againe to their fame and honour, and to their Lands, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out suing livery, and to such goods whereof the King was not answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, except the rents and issues which had beene received out of their lands in the meane time. Hereupon, <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> Earle of <hi>Warwick</hi> was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered out of prison, and the Earle of <hi>Arundels</hi> Sonne recovered his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance: many others also that
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:51490:156"/>
were banished or imprisoned by King <hi>Richard,</hi> were then fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored againe, to their Countrey, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and Estate.</p>
                  <p>It was further provided, that none of those which came in aid of King <hi>Henry</hi> against King <hi>Richard,</hi> should for that cause bee impeached or troubled. Also the King gave to the Earle of <hi>Westmerland</hi> the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Richmond</hi>; and to the Earle of <hi>Northumberland</hi> hee gave the Ile of <hi>Man</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to bee houlden of him by the service of bearing the sword, wherewith hee entred into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> Divers other of his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers he advanceth to offices of high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est place and charge, some upon judgement and for desert, but most part to winne favour, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps projecting a plot for friends, if times should change: for in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny actions men take more care to prevent revenge, then to lead an innocent and harmelesse life.</p>
                  <p>It was further agreed, that the Procurers of the death and Murther
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:51490:157"/>
of <hi>Thomas</hi> late Duke of <hi>Gloucester,</hi> should bee searched out and severe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly punished. And judgement was given against the appellants of the Earle of <hi>Warwick</hi> and the Earle of <hi>Arundel,</hi> that the Dukes of <hi>Aumerle, Sussex,</hi> and <hi>Exceter,</hi> the Marquesse of <hi>Dorset,</hi> and the Earle of <hi>Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester</hi> who were present, should loose their degree of honour for them and their Heires: that they should likewise loose all the Castles, Mannours, Lordships, &amp;c. then in their hands which sometimes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertained to those whom they did appeale, and that all the letters pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents and charters which they had concerning the same, should bee sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred into the Chancery, and there bee cancelled: that for all other their Castles, Mannours, Lordships, Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions, and Liberties, they should bee at the grace and mercy of the King: that they should give no li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries, nor keepe any retinue of men, but onely such Officers as were meerely necessary for their
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:51490:157"/>
degree: that if any of them should adhere to <hi>Richard</hi> the deposed King, in giving him aid or encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, against the judgement of his deposition, then hee should incurre the paines and forfeitures of high treason. And because it was a clamorous complaint a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Common people, that many Officers had committed grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous extortions and wrongs, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the open maintenance or secret connivence of these Lords: First, those Officers were remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and that corruption taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with integrity, which bribe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry had wrought, in placing (for money) men of bad quality, in high degrees of office and service: then Proclamations were made, that if any man had beene oppressed by these Lords, or by any Officers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them, he should prove his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, &amp; receive recompence. It was made a question whether it was not meet that these Noble men should be put to death: the importunity of the
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:51490:158"/>
people, and the perswasion of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great men drew that way, but policy was against it, and especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the opinion of clemency, which seemed needfull to the setling of a new risen state.</p>
                  <p>In this Parliament also the Lord <hi>Fitzwater</hi> appealed the said Duke of <hi>Aumerle,</hi> Sonne to the Duke of <hi>Yorke,</hi> upon points of High trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: likewise the Lord <hi>Monley</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed <hi>Iohn Montacu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="243" facs="tcp:51490:158"/>
the other part hee desired to bee more regardfull of their actions af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, and for the time past, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to forget that ever they were in fault, then to remember that they were pardoned. No punishment was laid upon any, save onely the Earle of <hi>Salisbury</hi> and the Lord <hi>Morley,</hi> who had beene in espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall grace and favour with King <hi>Richard<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi> these two were commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to prison, but at the sute of their friends they were soone released: the rest the King received freely to favour, but most especially the Duke of <hi>Aumerle,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Excester,</hi> Lord Governour of <hi>Calis.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Aumerle</hi> was cousen germane to both the Kings: <hi>Iohn Holland</hi> Duke of <hi>Exeter,</hi> was halfe brother to King <hi>Richard,</hi> and brother in law to King <hi>Henry</hi>; whose Sister, the Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> hee had taken to wife. The greatest mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that was enforced against them, was their loialty unto King <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard:</hi> (a grievous crime among re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels)
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:51490:159"/>
because they did not onely sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack and storme at his dejection, but stirre also more then others, and assay to raise forces on his behalfe. The Dukes boldly confessed the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation, that they were indeed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately faithfull to King <hi>Richard</hi>; but as those who once are false, doe seldome afterwards prove soundly firme, so they that have shewed themselves true to one Prince may the better bee trusted by any other. The King did rather admit this as a defence, then remit it as a fault: affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, that such examples were not to bee misliked of Princes: so hee entred with them into great termes of friendship, and put them in place neerest his person, endeavouring by courtesie and liberalty, to make them fast and faithfull unto him: this fact was diversly interpreted, according to mens severall dispositions, some admiring the Kings moderation, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers disliking and disallowing his confidence; and indeed, although these meanes have to this purpose
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:51490:159"/>
prevailed with some, yet the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon course may move us common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to conjecture, that there is little assurance in reconciled enemies: whose affections (for the most part) are like unto Glasse; which being once cracked, can never bee made otherwise then crazed and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sound.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, to qualifie all prejudice and hard opinion which other Princes might chance to conceive, King <hi>Henry</hi> dispatched Embassadours to divers Countries neere unto him, to make it knowne by what title, and by what fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and desire of all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple hee attained the Kingdome. To the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> hee sent <hi>Iohn Trevenant</hi> Bishop of <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Cheyney</hi> Knight, and <hi>Iohn Cheyney</hi> Esquire: into <hi>France</hi> hee sent <hi>Walter Sherlow</hi> Bishop of <hi>Durham,</hi> and Lord <hi>Thomas Pearcy</hi> Earle of <hi>Worcester:</hi> into <hi>Spaine,</hi> hee sent <hi>Iohn Trevor</hi> Bishop of S. <hi>Assaphes,</hi> and Sir <hi>William Parre,</hi>
                     <pb n="246" facs="tcp:51490:160"/>
and into <hi>Almaine</hi> hee sent the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Bangor,</hi> and certaine other. Most of these Princes (as in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which little concerned either their honour or their harme) see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med either not to regard what was done, or easily to bee perswaded that all was done well. But <hi>Charles</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> was so distempered at this dishonourable dealing with his Sonne in law King <hi>Richard</hi>; that by violence of his passion, hee fell into his old panges of phrensie: and at the last by helpe of physick returning to the sobriety of his sences, hee purposed to make sharpe warre upon that disloyall people (as hee termed them) for this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury against their lawfull and harme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse Prince. Many Noble men of <hi>France</hi> shewed themselves very forward to enter into the service, but especially the Earle of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who had married King <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards</hi> halfe Sister. So letters of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance were sent into <hi>England,</hi> and great preparation was made for the warre.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="247" facs="tcp:51490:160"/>Likewise the newes of these no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties much abashed the <hi>Aquitanes</hi> (who were at that time under the <hi>English</hi> subjection) and plunged their thoughts in great perplexities. Some were grieved at the infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous blemish of the <hi>English</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who had destained their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour with the spot of such disloyall dealing: others feared the spoile of their goods, and oppression of their liberties by the <hi>French-men</hi>; against whose violence they suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted that the Realme of <hi>England,</hi> being distracted into civill factions, either would not attend, or should not bee able to beare them out: but the Citizens of <hi>Burdeaux</hi> were chiefely anguished in respect of King <hi>Richard,</hi> partly fretting at his injury, and partly lamenting his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunity; because hee was borne and brought up within their Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And thus in the violence, some of their anger, some of their griefe, and some of their feare, in this sort they did generally complaine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="248" facs="tcp:51490:161"/>O good GOD (said they) where is the World become? Saints are turned to Serpents, and Doves into Divels. The <hi>English</hi> nation which hath beene accompted fierce onely against their foes, and alwayes faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to their friends; are now become both fierce and faith lesse against their lawfull and loving Prince, and have most barbarously betrayed him. Who would ever have thought that Christians, that civill people, that any men, would thus have vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated all Religion, all Lawes, and all honest and orderly demeanure? And although the Heavens blush at the view, and the Earth sweat at the burthen of so vile a villany, and all men proclaime and exclaime upon shame and confusion against them: yet they neither feele the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour; nor shrinke at the shame, nor feare the revenge; but stand upon tearmes, some of defence for the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse of their dealing, and some of excuse for the necessity. Well, let them bee able to blind the

world, and to resist mans revenge; yet shall they never be able to escape either the sight or vengeance of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God; which we daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, and earnestly desire to bee powred upon them. Alas good King <hi>Richard,</hi> thy nature was too gentle, and thy government too mild for so stiffe and stubborne a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: what King will ever repose any trust in such unnaturall subjects, but fetter them with Lawes, as theeves are with Irons?

opinion, and confirmed them in their alleageance; the graver sort with respect of duty and faith, the rest with regard and feare of danger. Then hee received oaths of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence unto King <hi>Henry,</hi> and planted certaine strong garrisons in places of chiefe import, without molestation if they remayned quiet, and yet of force to represse them, if they should rebell.

                  </p>
                  <p>This Abbot called to his remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, a speech which hee heard once fall from King <hi>Henry,</hi> when hee was but Earle of <hi>Derby,</hi> and not yet come to any great stayednesse, either in yeares or judgement; that Princes had too little, and religious men too much.</p>
                  <p>At that time the riches of the Church were growne so great, that many began to looke upon them with an envious eye; but lest cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse should shew it selfe with open face, policie was pretended, and the excesse thought dangerous,

both to the King and also to the Clergy; as very like to cause want to the one, and wantonnesse in the other.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon many bils had been put up in the Parliaments holden in the raigne of King <hi>Richard,</hi> that provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion might bee made to represse the increase of riligious possessions; namely, that inquisition and redresse might be had against such religious persons, as under the licence to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase ten pounds yearly, did purchase fourescore, or a hundred pounds: and also against such religious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons as caused their villaines to take to their wives free-women, inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, whereby the Lands came to those religious mens hands: yea it was moved in open Parliament, that the King should seaze into his hands, all the temporall Livings of religious houses, as being rather a burthen, then a benefit unto re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>

                  <p>So partly upon love to King <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard,</hi> and partly upon feare, least K. <hi>Henry</hi> would be as ready to invade, as he was to inveigh against the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of religious houses: this Abbot was the first man that blew the coales and put fewell to the fire of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy.

<pb n="258" facs="tcp:51490:166"/>
feasted by the Abbot: and after dinner they withdrew themselves, into a secret Chamber to counsaile: here the Duke of <hi>Exceter,</hi> who was most hotly bent, either to restore, or to revenge the cause of his depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed brother, declared unto the rest, the allegeance that they had sworne unto King <hi>Richard</hi>: the honours and preferments whereunto they were by him advanced: that therefore they were bound both in conscience by the one, and in kindnesse by the other, to take his part against all men: that King <hi>Henry</hi> contrary to both, had dispoyled him of his royall dignity, and unjustly pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed himselfe thereof, whilest they stood looking on, and shewed neither the obedience of subjects, nor love of friends, as though they were men who, knew to doe any thing, better then to defend, and if need were to dye for their lawfull Prince and loving Patron: that King <hi>Henry</hi> by violent invading, or frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulent insinuating himselfe, into
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:51490:166"/>
the kingdom of his naturall &amp; liege Prince, was but a tyrant &amp; usurper, &amp; such aone as it was lawful for any man, by any means to throw down, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out respect whether hee were a good man or evill, for it is lawfull for no man upon pretence &amp; shew of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, to draw soveraignty unto himself; that the laws &amp; examples of best go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned common-wealths, did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly permit this action, but highly hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it with statues &amp; garlands, &amp; title<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of Nobility, &amp; also rewarded it with al the wealth of the suppressed tyrant: that this enterprize would be very profitable, &amp; almost necessary to the Common-wealth, by extinguishing those wars which the Scots menaced<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the French-men prepared, &amp; the Welshmen had already begun upon this occasion and quarrell: that he did not distrust but it might be accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed by open armes, but he thought it more sure for them, and for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth more safe, to put first in proofe some secret policy: and to that purpose hee devis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>This devise was no sooner utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, then allowed and applauded of the rest of the confederates: and so resolving upon the Enterprize, they tooke an oath upon the Evangelists, the one to bee true and secret to the other, even to the houre and point of death: the Lords also made an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denture sextiparti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>When all things were thus contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and their hungry ambitious minds were well filled with the vain winds of hope and desire: the Duke of <hi>Exeter</hi> came to the King at <hi>Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sore,</hi> &amp; desired him for the love that he bare to the noble feats of Chevalry, that hee would vouchsafe to honour with his presence the martiall exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise, that was appointed betweene him and the Earle of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> and to be the Iudge of their performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, if any controversie should arise.</p>
                  <p>The King supposing that to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended indeed, which was pretended in show, easily yeelded to his request.

Herewith such a shower of teares streamed downe her cheekes, that it drowned her speech, and stopped
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:51490:168"/>
the passage of further complaint: which when the Duke espyed, hee stepped unto her, and seazing softly upon her hand, used these words. What <hi>Besse?</hi> is it kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to me, or kindred to your bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that thus hath set your eyes on sloate?

When he had thus said, hee kissed her, and so leaving her to the torture of a thousand thorny thoughts, hee tooke his journey towards <hi>Oxford,</hi> with a
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:51490:169"/>
great company both of Archers and Horsemen. There hee found all the re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </p>
                  <p>The King also hearing that both the Challengers and Defendants were in a readinesse, determined the day following to ride to <hi>Oxford,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his promise and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>Now the confederates much mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled at the stay of the Duke of <hi>Aumerle,</hi> some onely blamed his slacknesse, others began to suspect it, every man conjectured as he was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versly affected betweene confidence and feare: and in this confusion of opinions, they sent unto him in poste, to know the certaine truth. Before the Messenger came to the Duke, he was departed from <hi>Westminster</hi> towards <hi>Oxford,</hi> not the direct way, but went first to see his Father the Duke of <hi>Yorke,</hi> and carried with him the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpane of the Indenture of confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy. As they sate at dinner, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:51490:169"/>
espied it in his bosome, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded what it was, the son hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly craved pardon, and said that it no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing touched him; by Saint <hi>George,</hi> (quoth the Father) but I will see it: and so whether upon precedent jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie, or some present cause of sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition he tooke it away from him by force. When hee perceived the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, he suddenly arose from the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and with great fiercenesse, both of countenance and speech, uttered to his Sonne these words.</p>
                  <p>I see traytor, that idlenesse hath made thee so wanton and mutinous, that thou playest with thy saith, as children doe with slicks: thou hast beene once already faithlesse to King <hi>Richard,</hi> and now againe art false to K. <hi>Henry,</hi> so that like the fish <hi>Sopia,</hi> thou troublest all the waters where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thou livest. Thou knowest that in open Parliament I became surety and pledge for thy allegeance, both in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and goods: and can neither thy duty, nor my desert restraine thee, from seeking my destruction? in
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:51490:170"/>
faith, but I will rather helpe forward thine. With that hee commanded his Horses to be made ready, and presently tooke his journey towards <hi>Windsore,</hi> where the King then lay.</p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Aumerle</hi> had no time either to consult with his friends, or to consider with himselfe what was best to be done: but taking advise upon the sodaine hee moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted likewise on horse-backe, and posted towards <hi>Windsore</hi> another way. It was no need to force him forward, his youthfull blood, and his sodaine danger were in steed of two wings, to keepe his horse in <hi>Pegasus</hi> pace: so that hee came to <hi>Windsore,</hi> and was alighted at the Castle, before his stiffe aged Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could come neere. Then he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the gates, and caused them to be surely locked, and tooke the keyes into his owne hands, pretending some secret cause for which hee would deliver them unto the King. When hee came in presence
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:51490:170"/>
hee kneeled down and humbly craved of the King mercy and forgivenesse. The King demanded for what of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence? Then with a confused voice and sad countenance, casting downe his eyes as altogether abash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, partly with feare of his dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and partly with shame of his discredit; hee declared unto the King all the manner of the conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. The King seemed neither rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to beleeve, nor negligently to distrust the Dukes report; neither stood it with pollicie to entertaine the discovery with any hard and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent usage: therefore with gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious speeches hee comforted the Duke; and if this bee true, said hee, wee pardon you: if it bee feined, at your extreame perill bee it.</p>
                  <p>By this time the Duke of <hi>Yorke</hi> was rapping at the C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="270" facs="tcp:51490:171" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the King had read it, and was thereby perswaded of the truth of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, hee was not a little disquieted in mind, complayning of the unconstant disposition of those men, whom nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cruelty (hee said) could make firme to King <hi>Richard,</hi> nor clemency to him, but upon dislike of every pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent government, they were desirous of any change. So being possessed with deeper thoughts, then to gaze upon games, hee layd his journey a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, and determined to attend at <hi>Windsor,</hi> what course his enemies would take, and which way they would set forward: knowing right well, that in civill tumults, an advised patience, and opportunity well ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken are the onely weapons of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; and that it is a speciall point of wisdome, to make benefit of the enemies folly. In the meane time he directed his Letters to the Earle of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> his high Constable, and to the Earle of <hi>Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland,</hi> his high Marshall, and to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers his most assured friends, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

these sodain and unexpected ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents.</p>
                  <p>The confederates all this time hearing nothing of the Duke of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merle,</hi> and seeing no preparation for the Kings comming, were out of doubt that their treason was betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And now considering that once before they had beene pardoned, the guilt of this their rebellion, excluded them from all hope of further mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie: whereupon they became des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, and so resolved to prosecute that by open armes, wherein their privie practises had fayled. And first they apparelled <hi>Magdalen</hi> (a man very like to King <hi>Richard,</hi> both in stature and countenance, and of yeares not disagreeable) in princely attire; and gave foorth that he was King <hi>Richard,</hi> and that either by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour or negligence of his Keepers, hee was escaped out of prison, and desired the faith and ayde of his lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving subjects. Then they deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to dispatch messengers to <hi>Charles</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> to desire
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:51490:172"/>
his helpe and assistance on the behalfe of his sonne in law, if need should require.</p>
                  <p>The common people which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly are soone changeable, and on the sodaine, as prone to pitty, as they were before excessively cruell, most earnestly wished the enlargement of King <hi>Richard,</hi> and earnestly wishing, did easily beleeve it: in which ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary conceit, being otherwise men of no deepe search, the presence of <hi>Magdalene</hi> most strongly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed them, and so either upon ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of truth, or delight in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, they joyned themselves in great troops to the Lords: desiring no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more then to bee the meanes whereby King <hi>Richard</hi> should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored, as in a manner resuming their first affections and humours towards him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Then the Lords of this asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation with great force, but with greater fame, as the manner is of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters unknowne, advanced forward in battell array towards <hi>Windsore,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst King <hi>Henry,</hi> as against an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:51490:172"/>
of the common state; having in their company above forty thousand armed men. The King upon intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of their approach, secretly with a few horse, the next sunday night after New-yeares day, depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from <hi>Windsore</hi> to the Tower of London, and the same night before it was day, the confederates came to the Castle of <hi>Windsore:</hi> where mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing their expected prey, they stood doubtfull and divided in opinions, which way to bend their course. Some advised them with all speed to follow the King to <hi>London,</hi> and not to leave him any leave and liberty, to unite an Army against them: that Winter was no let but in idle and peaceable times: that in civill dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions nothing is more safe then speed, and greater advantage alwayes groweth by dispatching then defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring: that whilest some were in feare, some in doubt, and some igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, the Citie, yea the Realme might easily be possessed: and that many Armies whose fury at the first rush
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:51490:173" rendition="simple:additions"/>
could not be resisted by delayes, did weare out, and waste to nothing. Others who would seeme to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderate and wise, but in very deed were no better then dastards, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded rather to set King <hi>Richard</hi> first at liberty; for if their counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting should be discovered before they possessed themselves of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, the people undoubtedly would fall from them to the certaine confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of them all. Hereupon they gave over the pursuit, and retyred to <hi>Colebrooke,</hi> and there delayed out the time of doing, in deliberating, being neither coutagiously quicke, nor considerately stayed, but faintly and fearefully shrinking backe: and when they once began to relent, they decreased every day more and more both in power and in hope.</p>
                  <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> the next morning af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he was come to the Tower, sent to the Major of the Citie to put Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers in armes for his assistance, who presently presented unto him three thousand Archers, and three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:51490:173"/>
bill-men, besides those that were appointed for defence of the Citie. The King spent upon him many good speeches, and liberally loaded him with promises and thankes: and soone after hee issued out of <hi>London,</hi> with twenty thousand tall men, and came to <hi>Hounslow</hi> Heath, abiding there, and as it were daring his enemies to joyne issue in the field: contemning their disorderly multitude, as a vaine terrour of names without forces. But the confederates, either for feare of the Kings power, or for distrust of their owne, or else ling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, perhaps, after some succour out of <hi>France,</hi> refused the encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and doubtfull it is, whether they shewed greater courage in setting up the danger, or cowardise, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining it when it was presented un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them.</p>
                  <p>So they departed from <hi>Colebrooke</hi> to <hi>Sunnings,</hi> a place neere <hi>Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</hi> where Queene <hi>Isabell,</hi> King <hi>Richards</hi> wife did then abide:
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:51490:174"/>
to whom upon the plain truth before declared fame had falsly descanted, that K. <hi>Richard</hi> was escaped out of prison, and did lye at <hi>Pomfret</hi> with a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand armed men; and that King <hi>Henry</hi> for feare of him, was fled with his children and friends to the Tower of <hi>London.</hi> All which was as lightly beleeved as it was vainely told: whereupon she defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced King <hi>Henries</hi> armes, and plucked away his cognisance from those his servants that attended upon her; and having in some sort satisfied her womannish anger, with this harme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse spight, shee and the Lords de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted together first to <hi>Wallingford,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Abington,</hi> stirring the people by the way to take ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and to rise in ayde of King <hi>Richard,</hi> who was (said they) and is, and should be their Prince.</p>
                  <p>At the last they came to <hi>Chichester</hi> and there the Lords tooke their lodgings, the Duke of <hi>Surrey,</hi> and the Earle of <hi>Salisbury</hi> in one Inne; the Duke of <hi>Exeter,</hi> and the Earle
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:51490:174"/>
of <hi>Gloucester</hi> in another; and all the hoast encamped in the fields. But the Bayliffe of the Towne, suspecting all this countenance, to bee but the vaine flash of a false fire, did in the night with about fourescore Archers, beset, and set upon the house where the Duke of <hi>Surrey,</hi> and the Earle of <hi>Salisbury</hi> lay; who were men but of weake resistance by nature, but being put upon necessity, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed great man-hood and resistance in defending themselves against the Townsmen. The Duke of <hi>Exeter,</hi> and the Earle of <hi>Gloucester</hi> being in another Inne, were not able by force to rescue their associates; whereupon a certaine Priest of their company set divers houses in the Towne on fire, supposing thereby to divert the townsmen from their assault, to the saving of their houses and of their goods: but this fire greatly inflamed their fury, and made them more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate in their attempt, crying out that they would never labour to res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue their losses, but to revenge them,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:51490:175"/>
and that with the blood of the Lords, vvhose flames should be quenched. Then there arose con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused clamours, and noyses, all the towne being in an uproare, and in armes, shooting fiercely, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning upon the Lords with a rash and desperate rage; not caring to loose ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, whereof they had many to spare.</p>
                  <p>When the Earle of <hi>Exeter,</hi> and they that were with him, perceived the force of the assaylants dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously to encrease, and that it was impossible for a few to sustaine the fury of so many so obstinately bent: they fled out of the back-side to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Camp, intending to bring the whole Armie to the rescue: but the souldiers having heard a tumult, and seeing fire within the towne, supposed that the King was entred with all his puissance: whereupon being strooke with a sodain and false feare, and wanting a Commander of courage to confirme them, they ran away, and dispearsed themselves without measure; and so whilst every

                  <p>Thus the Duke of <hi>Surrey,</hi> and the Earle of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> and the Lords, and Gentlemen which were in their company, were left to defend themselves against the townes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men as they could: who man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully maintained the fight with great bloodshed of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, from midnight untill three of the clocke the next day in the afternoone: at the last, being inferiour both in number and fortune, the Duke and the Earle were wonded to death and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and the same Evening their heads were striken off and sent to <hi>London:</hi> there were also taken Sir <hi>Bennet Shelley,</hi> Sir <hi>Barnard Brokas,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Blunt,</hi> and twenty eight other Lords, Knights, and Gentlemen, who were sent to <hi>Oxford,</hi> where the King then lay, and there were put to execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

the Army dispersed and fled, fled likewise with Sir <hi>Iohn Shelley</hi> into <hi>Essex,</hi> lamenting the certaine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction which his rashnesse had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured to himselfe, and to his friends, but most especially to King <hi>Richard</hi>; if not as a party, yet as a cause of this unhappy tumult; many times hee did attempt to have escaped by Sea into <hi>France,</hi> but hee was alwayes driven backe by distresse of weather; and so wandring and lurking in secret places, hee was at the last attached as hee sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

An excellent exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for all those which measure their Actions either by their pleasure, or by their power: that revenge of injurious dealing, although it be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed, yet doth never fayle, but
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:51490:176"/>
commeth surely, although perhaps slowly. This Duke was a man of high parentage, of a franke mind, and wealth answerable thereunto: openly praise worthy, but his secret actions were hardly spoken of: hee was of consent to all his brothers vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and of counsaile to many, yet somewhat the more close and vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant man: and not so much partaker of his prosperity, as violently carried with the current of his misery.</p>
                  <p>The Earle of <hi>Gloucester</hi> fled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Wales</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but was forelayed and taken, and beheaded at <hi>Bristow: Magdalen</hi> the counterfeit of King <hi>Richard,</hi> flying into <hi>Scotland,</hi> was apprehended and brought to the Tower, and afterward hanged and quartered, with <hi>W. Ferby,</hi> another of King <hi>Richards</hi> Chaplaines. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other Lords and Knights, and Gentlemen, and a great number of meane and base persons, were in other places put to death; insomuch as the King, though otherwise of a very temperate, and intreatable na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:51490:177"/>
seemed to shew too hard and haughty dealing in revenging his owne injury, or rather maintaining the injury that hee had done: the heads of the chiefe conspirators, were pitched upon poles, and set over <hi>London</hi> Bridge: in all other parts of the Realme a spectacle both lamentable and ugly was presented to the view and terrour of others: bodies hewen in peices, heads and quarters of unfortunate dismembred wretches putrifying above ground: not all for desert, but many to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie, either the malice, or want of King <hi>Henries</hi> friends; insomuch as many grave men openly gave forth, that in short time there would be cause to wish King <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> againe, as being more tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to endure the cruelty of one, then of many, and to live where nothing, then where any thing might bee permitted.</p>
                  <p>The Abbot of <hi>Westminster</hi> in whose house, and in whose head the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy began, hearing of these ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:51490:177"/>
as hee was going betwene his Monastery and his Mansion fell sodainely into a palsie, and shortly after without speech ended his life; and although in this enterprise for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune gave policie the check, and by a strange accident, which wisdome could not foresee, overturned the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise, yet is it certainely affirmed, that this Abbot first stirred the stone, which rowling along, was like to have turned King <hi>Henry</hi> out of his seate. The Bishop of <hi>Caerliel,</hi> was condemned upon this treason, but the extremity of his feare, and griefe, closed up his dayes, and prevented the violence and shame of publike execution. And now King <hi>Richard</hi> after he had abdicated his dignity, did but short time enjoy that sweet security, which hee did vainely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, and first all his goods which he did give in satisfaction of the injuries that he had done, were brought to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision &amp; share amongst his enemies: shortly after he was removed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the tower, to the castle of leeds in <hi>Kent,</hi>
                     <pb n="282" facs="tcp:51490:178"/>
and from thence to <hi>Pomfret,</hi> to the end that by often changing he might either more secretly be dispatched, or more uncertainely found: here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kept in streight prison, both inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and ignorant of this offence, hee was notwithstanding made a party in the punishment. For King <hi>Henry</hi> perceiving that the Lords so farre prevailed with their late strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem, that if their stomack had beene answerable to their strength, and their bold beginning had not ended in faintnesse and sloath, they might have driven him to a hard hazard; caused King <hi>Richard</hi> to bee put to death, intending to make sure, that no man should cloak open rebellion, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the colour of following sides, nor countenance his conspiracy, either with the perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or name of K. <hi>Richard</hi>: whether he did expresly command his death, or no, it is a question; out of question he shewed some liking and desire to the action, and gave allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance thereto when it was done.</p>
                  <p>The most current report at that
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:51490:178"/>
time went, that he was princely ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved every day at the Table, with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of costly meats, according to the order prescribed by Parliament, but was not suffered to taste or touch any one of them; and so perished of famine; being tormented with the presence of that, whereof hee dyed for want, but such horrible and unnaturall cruelty, both against a King and a kins-man, should not proceed from King <hi>Henry</hi> (mee thinke) a man of a moderate and mild disposition, nor yet from any other mind, which is not altogether both savage in humanity, and in religion prophane. One writer who would seeme to have the perfect intellgence of these affayres, maketh report, that King <hi>Henry</hi> sitting at his Table sad and pensive, with a deepe sigh brake forth into these words: Have I no faithfull friend that will deliver mee of him, whose life will breed destruction to mee and disturbance to the Realme, and whose death will bee a safety and quiet to both? for how
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:51490:179"/>
can I be free from feare, so long as the cause of my danger doth conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue? and what security, what hope shall we have of peace, unlesse the seed of sedition bee utterly rooted out.</p>
                  <p>Vpon this speech a certain Knight called Sir <hi>Pierce</hi> of <hi>Extone,</hi> presently parted from the Court, accompanied with eight tall men, and came to <hi>Pomfret,</hi> and there commanded, that the Esquire, who was accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to sewe, and take the assay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore King <hi>Richard,</hi> should no more use that manner of service: and let him (quoth hee) now eat well, for he shall not eat long<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> King <hi>Richard</hi> sate downe to dinner, and was ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved without courtesie or assay, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at hee marvelled; and demanded of the Esquire, why he did not his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? the Esquire answered, that hee was otherwise commanded by Sir <hi>Pierce</hi> of <hi>Extone,</hi> who was lately come from King <hi>Henry.</hi> The King being somewhat moved at his act and answer, tooke the carving knife

Well, this is right for me to suffer, but not for you to doe: your King for a time may joy at my death, and enjoy his desire; but let him qualifie his pleasures with expectation of the like justice: for God who measureth all our actions by the malice of our minds, will not suffer this violence unrevenged.</p>
                  <p>Whether these words proceeded from a distempered desire, or from the judgement of his fore sight<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, they were not altogether idle and vaine. For Sir <hi>Pierce</hi> expecting great favour and rewards for his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracious service, was frustrated of both, and not onely missed that countenance for which hee ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, but lost that which before he
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:51490:180"/>
had: so odious are vices even where they are profitable.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon he grew at the first discontented, and afterwards mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly turmoyled and tormented in conscience, and raging against himselfe would often exclayme, that to pleasure one unthankefull person, hee had made both him selfe and his posterity, hatefull and infamous to all the world.</p>
                  <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> with great discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment and disquiet held the Kingdome during his life: and so did his sonne King <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth: in whose time by continuall warres against the <hi>French-men,</hi> the malice of the humour was otherwise exercised and spent.

                  <p>And thus was king <hi>Richard</hi> brought to his death, by violence and force, as all Writers agree, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:51490:181"/>
al agree not upon the manner of the violence. He was a man of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonage, rather wel proportioned then tall, of great beauty, and grace, and comelinesse in presence; hee was of a good strength, and no abject spirit; but the one by ease, the other by flattery were much abased. Hee deserved many friends, but found few, because hee sought them more by liberality, then vertuous dealing Hee was marvellous infortunate in all his actions, which may very well be imputed to his negligence and sloath; for he that is not provident can seldome prosper, but by his loosenesse will lose, whatsoever fortune, or other mens labours doe cast upon him. At the last hee was driven to such distresse, that hee accounted it as a benefit, to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burdened of his royall dignity, for which other men will not sticke, to put their goods, and lives, and soules in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="290" facs="tcp:51490:182"/>Hee lived three and thirty yeares, and raigned two and twenty. His dead body was embalmed, and sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and covered with Lead all save his face, and carried to <hi>London,</hi> and in all the chiefe places by the way, his face was uncovered and shewen, that by view thereof no doubt should bee made concerning his death. At <hi>London</hi> hee had a solemne obse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quie kept in the Cathedrall Church of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> the King being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and all the chiefe men of the Citie.</p>
                  <p>Then hee was conveyed to <hi>Lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley Abbey</hi> in <hi>Buckinghamshire,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout twenty miles from <hi>London,</hi> and there obscurely enterred by the Bishop of <hi>Chester,</hi> the Abbot of S. <hi>Albones,</hi> and the Abbot of <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham,</hi> without presence of noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, without confluence of the common people, and without the charge of a dinner for celebrating the Funerals: but afterwarward at the commandement of King <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth, his body was taken up, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved

to <hi>Westminster,</hi> and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably entombed amongst his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors, with Queene <hi>Anna</hi> his wife, in expiation (as it is like) of his Fathers violent and unfaithfull dealing. So hee whose life was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies tumultuous and unquiet, could not readily find rest for his bones, even after death. It was not amisse in regard of the Common-wealth that hee was dead; yet they who caused his death had small reason to reckon it among their good deeds.</p>
                  <p>And thus doe these and the like accidents daily happen to such Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as will bee absolute in power resolute in will, and dissolute in life.</p>
                  <p>This yeare <hi>Humfrey,</hi> the sonne and heyre of the Duke of <hi>Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester,</hi> dyed of the plague; as hee returned out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> where King <hi>Richard</hi> had left him prisoner and shortly after the Dutchesse his Mother with violence of griefe ended her dayes: this yeare also

dyed <hi>Thomas Mowbray</hi> the Exiled Duke of <hi>Norfolke,</hi> whose death would much have beene lamented, if hee had not furthered so many la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable deaths: but he over-lived his honour, and saw himselfe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a person infamed and of no estimation. Likewise about this time, <hi>Iohn</hi> Duke of <hi>Brittaine</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased, who had taken to wife <hi>Mary</hi> daughter to King <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and by her had no issue, but by <hi>Ioan</hi> his second wife, hee left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him three sonnes, <hi>Iohn, Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard,</hi> and <hi>Arthur:</hi> this <hi>Ioan</hi> was afterwards married to King <hi>Henry:</hi> as hereafter shall appeare. Also this yeare <hi>Edmund</hi> Duke of <hi>Yorke</hi> departed this life, his honour not slayned, his fame not touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: he was a man very circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect and wary in his carriage, not carelesse of a good fame, nor greedy after a great: of other mens wealth not desirous, liberall of his owne, and of the common, sparing: hee did not by obstinate opposing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:51490:183"/>
against the current of the time, rashly hasten, either his fame, or his fall; but by moderation attained safe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly that degree of prayse, and honour, which others aspiring unto by des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate courses, wanne with ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious death, without any other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit at all. He left behind him two no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble sons, expresse resemblancers of his integrity: <hi>Edward,</hi> who succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in his dignity, and before was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Duke of <hi>Aumerle,</hi> and <hi>Richard</hi> Earle of <hi>Cambridge.

                     <hi>Charles</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> lost no time all this while in making prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to invade <hi>England:</hi> and to that end had now raysed an Army royall, which was brought downe into <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cardie,</hi> and in a readinesse to have beene transported. But it is very like that this haste for the deliverance of King <hi>Richard</hi> did the more hasten his death: upon newes whereof the <hi>French-men</hi> perceiving their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose for his restitution to bee to no purpose, gave over the enterprise; some being grieved that the occasion was lost of making spoyle of so plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull a countrey, others being well content to be discharged of that hope, together with the hazard whereupon it depended. Shortly after the French King sent a solemne Embassage into <hi>England,</hi> to treate, or rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate, that Lady <hi>Isabel</hi> his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who had beene espoused to King <hi>Richard,</hi> might with her dowrie bee restored to him againe. King <hi>Henry</hi> most honourably recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved these Embassadors, and gave in
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:51490:184"/>
answer, that he would speedily send his Commissioners to <hi>Calice,</hi> which should fully commune and conclude with them, both of this and other weighty affayres concerning both the Realmes.</p>
                  <p>Not long after hee sent <hi>Edward</hi> Duke of <hi>Yorke,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> Earle of <hi>Northumberland</hi> to <hi>Calice</hi>: Also the French King sent the Duke of <hi>Burbone,</hi> and certaine others to <hi>Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leine.</hi> These Commissioners did often meet, sometimes at one place, and sometimes at another: the French-men especially required, that Lady <hi>Isabell</hi> should be restored, shewing that King <hi>Charles</hi> her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had given in charge, that this before all matters, and without this nothing should be concluded. On the other side the Englishmen desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that shee might bee married to <hi>Henry</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> eldest sonne, a man answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to her in equall degree, both of blood and of yeares: but the French King denyed that hee
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:51490:185"/>
would any more joyne affinity with the English nation, whose aliance had once so unfortunately succeeded: then they entred into speech of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall peace, but hereto the Frenchmen would not agree. In the end it was concluded that Lady <hi>Isabell</hi> should be delivered to King <hi>Charles</hi> her Father, but without Dower; because the marriage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene King <hi>Richard</hi> and her, was never consummate: by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son whereof shee was not dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by the very treaty of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. Also the surcease of armes which foure yeares before had beene made with King <hi>Richard,</hi> for the terme of thirty yeares, was conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued and confirmed for the time then unexpired. Some Authors affirme, that a new truce was taken, but these also are at diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence: for some report that it was during the life of both the Kings; others, that it was but for a short time, which hath the more apparance of truth, by reason of the

open hostility which the yeare fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing did breake forth betweene the two Realmes.</p>
                  <p>Shortly after King <hi>Henry</hi> sent the Lady <hi>Isabel</hi> under the conduct of Lord <hi>Thomas Piercy</hi> Earle of <hi>Worce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> in Royall estate to <hi>Calis:</hi> she was accompanied with a great troupe of honourable personages, both men and women; and carried with her all the Iewels and Plate which shee brought into <hi>England,</hi> with a great surplu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of rich gifts bestowed upon her by the King: at <hi>Calis</hi> shee was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the Earle of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant for the <hi>French</hi> King in <hi>Picar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> and by him was conducted to King <hi>Charles</hi> her Father, who after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards gave her in marriage to <hi>Charles</hi> Sonne to <hi>Le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>For within the Realme, the fire and fury of the late sedition was scarcely quenched and quiet, but (that
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:51490:186"/>
the Common-wealth should not cease to bee torne, by multiplying of divisions, one streight succeeding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother) the <hi>Welshmen,</hi> upon advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the doubtfull and unsetled e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state of King <hi>Henry,</hi> resolved to break and make a defection; before either the King could ground his authority, or the people frame themselves to a new obedience: and having lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that common causes must bee maintained by concord, they sought by assemblies to establish an associa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and to set up their owne princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality againe.</p>
                  <p>To this purpose they created for their Prince, <hi>Owen Glendor</hi> an Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of <hi>Wales,</hi> a factious Person, and apt to set up division and strife: and although hee was of no great state in birth; yet was hee great and stately in stomack: of an aspiring Spirit: and in wit somewhat above the ordinary of that untrained people: bould, craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, active, and as he listed to bend his mind, mischievous or industrious in equall degree, in desires immoderate,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:51490:186"/>
and rashly adventurous, in his young yeares he was brought up to the stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Common law of the Realme, at <hi>Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>don:</hi> and when hee came to mans estate, besides a naturall fiercenesse and hatred to the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> name, he was particularly incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by a private suite, for certaine lands in controversie, betweene the Lord <hi>Gray</hi> of <hi>Ruthen</hi> and him; wherein his title was overthrowne; and being a man by nature not of the mildest, by this provocation he was made savadge and rough; determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning either to repaire or to revenge his losse, by setting the whole state on fire. Also his expence and liberality had beene too excessive for a great man to endure, which brought him to barenesse, too base for a meane man to beare: and therefore he must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity doe and dare somewhat, and more danger there was in soft and quiet dealing, then in hazarding rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Herewith oportunity was then likewise presented: for trouble some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times are most fit for great attempts,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:51490:187"/>
and some likelihood there was, whilest the King and the Lords were hard at variance, that harme might easily bee wrought to them both. Vpon these causes his desire was founded, and upon these troubles his hope. But that his aspiring and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious humour might beare some shew of honest meaning, hee preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to his Countreymen the recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of their free estate, the desire whereof was so naturally sweet, that even wilde birds will rather live hardly at large in the aire, then bee daintily dieted by others in a Cage; and oportunity was at that time fitly offered, or else never to bee expected, to rid them of their thraldome, false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and colourably intituled a peace, whilest the one Kings power was waining, and the other not yet fully wexen, and either of them grew weake by wasting the other: neither was their any difference which of them should prevaile, sith the warre touched both alike, insomuch as the overthrow would ruine the one, and
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:51490:187"/>
the victory the other; So he exhorted them to take courage and armes: and first to kill all the <hi>English</hi> within their territories, for liberty and Lords could not endure together: then to resume their ancient cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes and lawes, whereby more then armes, Common-wealths are established and enlarged: so should they be a people uncorrupt, without admixion of forraigne manners of bloud; and so should they forget ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude, and either live at liberty or else perhaps, be Lords over other.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon many flocked unto him, the best for love of liberty, the basest for desire of booty and spoile, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as in short time hee became Commander of competent forces to stand openly in the field. And being desirous to make some proofe of his prowesse, hee sharply set upon his old adversary <hi>Reignold</hi> Lord <hi>Grey</hi> of <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,</hi> whose possessions hee wasted and spoiled; slew many of his men, and tooke himselfe prisoner; yet gave him faire and friendly entertainment,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:51490:188"/>
and promised him releasement, if he would take his Daughter to wife. This he desired, not so much for need of his ability or aid, as supposing that the name and countenance of a Lord, would give reputation to the house that was then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ut in rising: but the Lord <hi>Grey</hi> at the first did not so much refuse as scorne the offer: affirming that hee was no ward, to have his marriage obtruded upon him. Well (said <hi>Owen Glendore</hi>) although you bee not my ward, yet are you in my ward: and the suing your livery will cost double the marriage money that elsewhere you shall procure. The Lord <hi>Grey</hi> being not very rich to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge his ransome, and seeing no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meanes of his deliverance, at the last accepted the condition, and tooke the Damosell to wife; notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his deceitfull Father in law, trifled out the time of his enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment untill hee died.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Welshmen</hi> being confident upon this successe, beganne to breake into the borders of <hi>Hereford-shire,</hi> and
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:51490:188"/>
to make spoile and prey of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey: against whom Lord <hi>Edmund Mortimer</hi> Earle of <hi>March,</hi> who for feare of King <hi>Henry</hi> had withdrawne himselfe (as hath beene declared) to <hi>Wigmore</hi> Castle, assembled all the Gentlemen of the Countrey, and meeting with the <hi>Welchmen,</hi> they joyned together a sharpe and cruell conflict<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not in forme of a loose skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish, but standing still and maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their place, they endeavoured with maine might to breake and beare downe one another. The cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and resolution of both sides was alike, but the <hi>Welshmen</hi> were supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour both for number and direction: for they were conducted by one knowne <hi>Leader,</hi> who with his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence every where assisted at need, enflaming his souldiers, some with shame and reproofe, others with praise and encouragement, all with hope and large promises: but the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish-men</hi> had no certaine generall, but many confused Commanders, yea e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man was a Commander to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:51490:189"/>
pressing forward or drawing back, as his owne courage or feare did move him. Insomuch as no doubt they had taken a great blow that day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by their ill governed boldnesse, had not <hi>Owen Glendor</hi> presently upon the breaking up of the field, ceased to pursue the execution, and shewed himselfe more able to get a victory, then skilfull to use it. But even to his side the victory had cost bloud, and many of those which remained, were either wounded or weary: the night was neere also, and they were in their enemies Countrey; by which meanes our men had liberty to retire rather then runne away, no man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hot to follow the chase. They lost of their company about a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand men, who sold their lives at such a price, that when manhood had done the hardest against them, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine mannish, or rather devilish wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, whose malice is immortall, exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised a vaine revenge upon their dead bodies; in cutting off their privy parts and their noses, whereof the one they
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:51490:189"/>
stuffed in their mouths, and pressed the other betweene their buttocks; and would not suffer their mangled carcasses to bee committed to the earth, untill they were redeemed with a great summe of money. By which cruell covetousnesse, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction lost reputation and credite with the moderate sort of their own people; suspecting that it was not liberty but licentiousnesse which was desired: and that subjection to such unhumane minds would bee more insupportable then any bondage.</p>
                  <p>In this conflict, the Earle of <hi>March</hi> was taken prisoner and fettered with chaines, and cast into a deepe and vile dungeon. The King was solicited by many Noble men, to use some meanes for his deliverance; but he would not heare on that eare; hee could rather have wished him and his two sisters in Heaven, for then the onely ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish to his title had beene out of the way: and no man can tell whether this mischance did not preserve him from a greater mischiefe.</p>
                  <p>

                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the prosperous successe of his actions, was growne now more hard to be dealt with, and hautely minded, and stood even upon termes of equality with the King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereupon he proceeded further to invade the Marches of <hi>Wales</hi> on the West side of <hi>Severne</hi>; where he burnt many Villages and Townes, slew much people, and returned with great prey, and praises of his adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. Thus he ceased not this yeare to infest the borderers on every side, amongst whom he found so weake resistance, that he seemed to exercise rather a spoile then a warre. For King <hi>Henry</hi> was then detained with his chiefest forces, in another more dangerous service, which besides these former vexations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and hazards, this first yeare of his raigne happened unto him.</p>
                  <p>For the <hi>Scots</hi> knowing that changes were times most apt for attempt, and upon advantage of the absence of all the chiefe <hi>English</hi> borderers, partly by occasion of the Parliament, and
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:51490:190"/>
partly by reason of the plague which was very grievous that yeare in the North parts of the Realme: they made a road into the Countrey of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and there commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted great havock and harme. Also on a certaine night, they sodainly set upon the Castle of <hi>Werke,</hi> the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine whereof Sir <hi>Thomas Gray,</hi> was then one of the Knights of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament: and having slaine the watch partly a sleepe, partly amazed with feare, they brake in and surprised the place: which they held a while, and at the last spoiled and ruinated and then departed. Whilest further harmes were feared, this passed with light regard. But when great perils were past, as if no worse misfortune could have befallen, then was it much sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed and lamented. And in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge thereof, the <hi>Englishmen</hi> inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and spoiled certaine Ilands of <hi>Orkney:</hi> and so the losse was in some sort repaired: yet (as in the reprisals of warre it commonly falleth out) neither against those particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:51490:191"/>
which committed the harme, nor for those which suffered it: but one for another were both recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced and revenged. Againe, the <hi>Scots</hi> set forth a fleet, under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Sir <hi>Robert Logon,</hi> with dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to attempt as occasion should bee offered: his first purpose was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst our Fishermen; but before he came to any action, hee was incoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred by certaine <hi>English</hi> ships, and the greatest part of his fleet taken. Thus peace still continuing between both the Realmes, a kind of theevish hostility was dayly practised, which afterwards brake out into open warre upon this occasion.</p>

                     <hi>George</hi> of <hi>Dunbarre</hi> Earle of the <hi>Marches</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> had betrothed <hi>Elizabeth</hi> his Daughter to <hi>David,</hi> the Sonne and Heire apparent of <hi>Robert</hi> King of <hi>Scots,</hi> and in regard of that marriage to be shortly celebrated and finished, hee delivered into the Kings hands a great summe of money for his Daughters dowry. But <hi>Archibald</hi> Earle <hi>Dowglasse</hi> disdaining that the
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:51490:191"/>
Earle of <hi>Marches</hi> bloud should bee preferred before his, so wrought with King <hi>Robert,</hi> that Prince <hi>David</hi> his Son refused the Earle of <hi>Marches</hi> Daughter, and tooke to wife <hi>Mariell</hi> Daughter to the Earle <hi>Dowglasse:</hi> Earle <hi>George</hi> not used to offers of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, could hardly enforce his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to endure this scorne: and first hee demanded restitution of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, not so much for care to obtaine, as for desire to pick an occasion of breaking his allegeance. The King would make to him neither payment nor promise, but trifled him off with many delusory and vaine delayes: Whereupon hee fled with all his family into <hi>England,</hi> to <hi>Henry</hi> Earle of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> intending with open disloyalty both to revenge his indignity, and recover his losse. The <hi>Englishmen</hi> with open armes enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the oportunity; with whose helpe and assistance, the Earle made divers incursions into <hi>Scotland,</hi> where hee burnt many Townes, and slew much people, and dayly purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

<pb n="311" facs="tcp:51490:192"/>
it were an impeachment to his honour, without just cause to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the same. Vpon this answer the King of <hi>Scots</hi> did presently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime open warre against the King of <hi>England,</hi> with bloud, fire, and sword.</p>
                  <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> thought it policy, rather to beginne the warre in his enemies Countrey, then to expect it in their owne, because the Land which is the seat of the warre, doth commonly furnish both sides with necessary supply; the friend by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution, and the enemy by spoile<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Therefore sending certaine Troopes of horsemen before him, both to espy and to induce an uncertaine ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour upon the enemy, hee entred into <hi>Scotland</hi> with a puissant army; wherewith hee burnt many Villages and Townes, cast downe diverse Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, and ruined a great part of the Townes of <hi>Edenborough</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>Lith,</hi> sparing nothing but Churches &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious houses: so that in all places as hee passed, the spectacle was ougly
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:51490:193"/>
and grisly which he left behind him; bodies torne in pieces, mangled and putrified limmes, the aire infected with stinck, the ground imbrued with corruption and bloud, the Countrey wasted, the Grasse and Corne troden downe and spoiled; insomuch as a man would have said that warre is an exercise not of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, but of inhumanity. They that fled before the army, filled all places with feare and terrour, extolling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove truth the <hi>English</hi> forces, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minish thereby their shame in run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from shame.</p>
                  <p>In the end of <hi>September,</hi> the King besieged the Castle of <hi>Maydens</hi> in <hi>Edenborough</hi>; wherein were <hi>David</hi> Duke of <hi>Rothsay</hi> Prince of the Realme, and <hi>Archibald</hi> Earle <hi>Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glasse</hi>; the inconstancy of the one, and ambition of the other, were prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall causes of all this warre.</p>
                  <p>During this siege, <hi>Robert</hi> Duke of <hi>Albony,</hi> who was appointed Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Realme, because the King was sick and unable to rule, sent an
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:51490:193"/>
Herauld unto <hi>Henry</hi>; assuring him upon his honour that if hee would abide but six dayes at the most, hee would give him battaile; and either remove the siege, or loo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The King was well pleased with these tidings, and rewarded the Herauld with a gowne of silke, and a chaine of gould, and promised him in the word of a Prince, to abide there and expect the Governour, during the time by him prefixed.</p>
                  <p>The six dayes passed almost six times over, and no more newes was heard of the Governour, either by presence, or by messenger. Winter came on, and victuaile failed, the Countrey was cold and fruitlesse, and it rained every day in great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance; so that partly by hunger, partly by distemperature of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Souldiers be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="314" facs="tcp:51490:194"/>
want, two forceable foes had given the charge upon his enemies: certaine it is, that they moved the King to remove his siege, and to depart out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> without any battaile or skirmish offered.</p>
                  <p>Both the Wardens of the <hi>Marches</hi> were all this time in <hi>Scotland</hi> with the King: upon which advantage the <hi>Scots</hi> did breake into <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland,</hi> and burnt certaine Townes in <hi>Bamborough</hi> Shire. The <hi>English-men</hi> were speedily up in armes; but the <hi>Scots</hi> more speedily made their returne, or else no doubt they had beene mette with, and encounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
                  <p>Againe when King <hi>Henry</hi> had discharged his army, the <hi>Scots</hi> being desirous not so much of life as of revenge, made a sudaine road into <hi>England,</hi> under the conduct of Sir <hi>Thomas Halibarton</hi> of <hi>Dirle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> and Sir <hi>Patrick Hebburne,</hi> of <hi>Hales:</hi> but all the harme which they wrought did rather waken then weaken the <hi>English-men:</hi>
                     <pb n="315" facs="tcp:51490:194"/>
and they themselves were some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what encouraged, but nothing enriched, by that which they got.</p>
                  <p>Not long after, Sir <hi>Patrick Heb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne,</hi> being lifted up in desire and hope, resolved to undertake a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enterprize: the people, which are easily led by prosperous suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse, in great Companies resorted to him; but hee was loath to have more fellowes in the spoile, then hee thought should need in the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: therefore with a competent army of the men of <hi>Loughdeane,</hi> hee invaded <hi>Northumberland,</hi> where hee made great spoile, and loaded his Souldiers with prisoners and prey. There was no question made what perill might bee in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne: Therefore they marched loosely and licentiously as in a place of great security, not keeping them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to their ensignes and order: but the Earle of <hi>Northumberlands</hi> Vice-warden, and other Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the borders in good array, set
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:51490:195"/>
upon them at a Towne in <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland</hi> called <hi>Nesbit.</hi> The <hi>Scots</hi> rallied as well as the suddainnesse did serve, and valiantly received the charge; so that the battaile was sharp and cruell, and continued a good time, with great mortality. In the end, the enemies rankes grew thinne, as being rather confusedly shuffled together, then orderly and firmely compacted: and when the Vice-warden felt them weake in the shock, and yeelding under his hand, with a company which hee purpose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly retained about him for suddaine dispatches and chances of warre, hee fiercely charged and disordered them. Sir <hi>Patrick Hebburne</hi> being cleane destitute both of Counsaile and courage ranne up and downe from one place to another, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding many things, and presently for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding them againe; and the lesse of force his directions were, the oftner did hee change them: anon (as it happeneth in lost and desperate cases) every man became a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander,
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:51490:195"/>
and none a putter in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution: so the rankes loosed and brake, and could not bee reunited, the victour hotly pursuing the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. Then might you have seene a grievous spectacle, pursuing, kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, wounding, and taking, and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling those that were taken, when better were offered: every where weapons, and dead bodies, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled limmes lay scattered: and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in those that were slaine, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared at their death both anger and valour.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Patrick Hebburne</hi> thought of nothing lesse then either fleeing or yeelding, but thrusting among the thickest of his enemies, honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably ended his life.
