         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

EDWARD, Lord Denny,
Baron of Waltham.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas (right noble Lord) I haue
beene much, and am daily called
vpon for the performance of my
promise in my <hi>Grammar-schoole,</hi>
concerning the Gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maticall tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slating
of our lower schoole Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
and that by those who
haue made due triall, and found by good experience
the benefit of such like translations; I haue presumed,
to send forth vnto them this <hi>Essay,</hi> vnder your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
patronage, not onely for your Lordships most
honourable affection to some vnto whom God hath
very neerly linked mee, and your vndeserued fauour
vnto my selfe, but more specially for your singular
curtesie, and desire of the aduancement of all good
learning, which beeing conioyned doe so-much grace
true Nobility. The rather also haue I done this, for
that full assurance which God hath giuen mee, of a
rich blessing to accompany the right vse of these tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slations
<pb facs="tcp:21687:3"/>
for the generall good of schooles. And first,
for all the ruder places of the Land, wherein there is
not any thing vsually to be found, which may afford
the least content or comfort to parents, children, or
any other. Chiefly, for the poore ignorant countries
of <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Wales;</hi> of the good whereof wee ought
to be carefull aswell as of our owne: vnto which I
haue principally bent my thoughts in all my Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical-translations
of our inferiour classicall schoole-authors.
For that as in all such places, so especially in
those barbarous countries, the hope of the Church of
God is to comp rimarily out of the grammar-schools,
by reducing them first vnto ciuility thorough the
meanes of schooles of good learning planted amongst
them in euery quarter;<note place="marg2">Adde, quod ingenuas di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicisse fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter artes, Emollit mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, nec sinit esse feros. <hi>Ouid.</hi>
               </note> wherby their sauage and wilde
conditions may be changed into more humanity; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the right iudgement of our <hi>Pöet,</hi> which
the experience of all ages hath confirmed.</p>
            <p>To which purpose, what can be imagined to bee
more effectual, then if together with the Latine tongue
they shall attaine withall vnto our owne Language,
and both get and keepe the Latine farre more easily
and surely in each respect, by the meanes of these tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slations,
without any inconuenience. Yet haue I not
so writtten them for our ruder places alone, but that
euen our head Grammar-schooles may sundry waies
receiue their benefit by them, and make their profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
vse of them for their great furtherance for Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar,
true sense and meaning of the Authors, propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety,
purity of stile, and variety of phrase, both in our
owne and the Latine tongue, &amp; in many other things;
especially, when the Lord shall bee pleased that they
<pb facs="tcp:21687:3"/>
may be brought to that perfection, which we hope &amp;
pray for, daily labouring and striuing thereunto. As
for euills and inconueniences of such Grammaticall
translations surmised by some who neuer saw any true
triall of them, nor euer considered of them aright,
what can they be? when the schollars that vse them
are caused to seeke out according to their rules, and to
render a reason euen of euery word why it must be so,
&amp; not otherwise. But for all imagined euils by such like
translations, I haue fully answered in my <hi>Ludus lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarius,</hi>
in the eight chapter, and in my other translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
and haue moreouer there giuen directions for the
right vse of them; as I shall heere also more fully in
the <hi>Preface to the Reader,</hi> and for the benefit hereof.
Concerning the matter of this booke, I need not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
it vnto your Lordship, or vnto any other: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,
as I can neuer sufficiently admire the diuine wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
(that I may so speake) of <hi>Tully</hi> in his <hi>Offices,</hi> in
prescribing most morall duties amongst men, as if he
had been directed by the sacred Scriptures; so nor here
the rare vnderstanding of this our <hi>Poet,</hi> in setting forth
vnto vs the creation in that wonderfull manner, and so
alluding to the Flood, as if he had seen and read that
part of holy story in <hi>Genesis.</hi> Also for the Latine and
stile vsed in it, who knoweth not, that as in all <hi>Ouids</hi>
works, so chiefly in his <hi>Metamorphosis</hi> his singular wit
and eloquence doe appeare: that wee may truely say,
that neuer heathen <hi>Poet</hi> wrote more sweetly in such
an easie and flowing veine, than hee in this.</p>
            <p>Thus desiring through the assistance of our blessed
God to creep forward by little and little in accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:21687:4"/>
my promised seruice to our Grammar-schooles,
which I haue so much longed for, &amp; wherein he hath

and is still with me graciously, humbly crauing pardon
I commend your Lordshippe with your honourable

reape the fruit of this, and the like
Grammaticall translations with mee,
without inconuenience, doe these
things; at least make triall that you
may be able to iudge truely hereof.</p>
            <p>1. Cause all your schollars, who
take construction to bee very perfect in the rule of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struing,
as it is set downe in the <hi>Ludus Literarius</hi> Chapt.
8. or more shortly in the <hi>Posing of the Accidence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. To be able to say perfectly without book, or to turne
vnto presently any of the rules of Grammar which are vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
learned.</p>
            <p>3. For taking of their lectures, direct them in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
following, and see that they can doe it.</p>
            <p>1. That one of the two Seniors of the forme which is
to vse the help hereof, hauing the translation, doe in all
more hard places reade vnto the rest of the forme either the
lecture in English first, as it is translated, or at least the brief
summe &amp; sense of it out of the inmost columnes, ouer against
the translation of the lecture, to giue them some light and
vnderstanding of the meaning of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:21687:5"/>
2. That one or both of the Seniors looking vpon the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation
together with the Author in Latine, cause the rest,
each in his order, first to reade his peece, and in reading to
obserue all things according to the direction in the said rule
of construing, and then to construe and giue a reason accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the same rule, why it must be so construed, and not
otherwise. And where any sticke or goe amisse, varying
from the translation, to recall them to the rule, demanding
of them what the rule teacheth to be taken first, and what
in the next place; so to help them by the translation, where
none of their fellowes can finde it out, to giue both Grammar,
sense and variety of phrase in English, according to the text
in the translation and to the third columne compared toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
by the helpe of the markes.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, when they haue construed twice or thrice ouer,
and that the very lowest and worst can construe, that they
cause them likewise to parse according as they construed, <hi>viz.</hi>
each his peece, giuing the reasons of euery word.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, afterward let them direct them to be able to
giue each thing obserued in the vttermost columne for nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
history or otherwise. And this for taking their lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
            <p>Secondly, for preparing their lectures herein;</p>
            <p>First, cause each to study and make their lectures per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
by the helpe of the translation and their Grammar, to
be able, so soone as they shall be called to say, First, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer
the English, secondly, the Latine both in prose and
verse, <hi>viz.</hi> first, in a pure Latine stile in prose, and then
turning that into the <hi>Poets</hi> verse. Which practice will be
both a good helpe for making Latine, and also a most plaine
way to enter them in making a verse. And afterwards to
be able to construe and parse without booke, rendering a
<pb facs="tcp:21687:5"/>
reason of euery thing; to giue the phrases, to vary them,
and to doe whatsoeuer the translation directs vnto. Thus
let them doe in all the Authors thus translated, so farre as
the Author and translation afford them helpe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Cause them at their leasure, oft to construe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
amongst themselues all which they haue learned in the
Author, the two seniors onely, or one of them directing the
rest by the translation that they construe truely. And espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
make them to construe it oft out of the translation, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
only on it, each his peece, all the rest looking vpon their
Latine books: which will be a helpe to cause them to keep all
most perfectly, and chiefly if they obserue phrase and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
as they proceed. And much more if they be warned
to construe them oft ouer, priuately at home, and sometimes
be examined of a sodaine in seuerall places.</p>
            <p>By these meanes (vnlesse daily experience can deceiue)
these translations will prooue worthie the accept<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nce and vse
of our chiefe Schooles; when hereby all the middle formes
of the schoole may both take and each waies prepare their
owne lectures of themselues, at least with very little helpe
or trouble of the master; &amp; that as profitably and surely in
euery respect, as if the master gaue, or heard the giuing of
them himself: vvhen they are caused hereby to search out
and giue a reason of each word why it must be so construed,
parsed, and vsed in that place, that the master ordinarily
shall need but onely to examine them, when they are prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
Thus to auoid not onely that common toyle to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
in giuing each lecture, but also that he may saue all that
time which is so spent, to imploy much of it with his highest
formes in the chiefe Authors Latine or Greeke in giuing
their lectures, or hearing them to take their owne lectures
of themselues, for their greater furtherance &amp; better fitting
<pb facs="tcp:21687:6"/>
for the Vniuersity, and likewise for the credit of the school,
and in examining and posing, which is the best quickner of
their wittes, and spurre to all good learning. Hereby, more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
shall the children be fitted with vnderstanding and
iudgement, how many waies to make their benefit of their
Authors. Or else that the Master may bestowe the more
time and paines, amongst the lowest and first formes, for
the better entring and grounding of them, which beeing
rightly performed makes all their proceeding afterwards ful
of certainty and pleasant delight. In this one thing (and
that by meanes of these helps, there may bee many moe of a
forme, and euery one able to prepare his owne lecture, and
also that all of them may so easily and surely by oft repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and their owne priuate paines keepe all which they haue
