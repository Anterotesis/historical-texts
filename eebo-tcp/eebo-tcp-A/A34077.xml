         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>IN the following <hi>Dialogue</hi> (though
not All, yet) the moſt Material
Points wherein the <hi>Roman</hi> Church
differs from the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
are briefly and plainly diſcourſed:
So that while by their little <hi>Tracts</hi>
and ſhort <hi>Catechiſms,</hi> daily Printed
and ſent abroad, the <hi>Romiſh Emiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries</hi>
do labour to Seduce the Weaker
ſort of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> They may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
with ſhort and ſatisfactory An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
to their moſt uſual Fallacies.
Their Aſſaults are generally in the
Dark<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and becauſe it is impoſſible al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
to ſtand by thoſe particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
whom they labour to Draw-in, it is
<pb facs="tcp:61078:3"/>
thought fit to publiſh this little <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual,</hi>
to enable thoſe that are Attacked
readily to defend themſelves: To
which end the <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> is here
recommended as the beſt <hi>Touch-Stone</hi>
to juſtifie our Doctrines, and
diſcover their Corruptions; And the
more their Guilt makes them fly
from it, the more our Sincerity ſhould
make us cleave to it. For this is in
every <hi>Proteſtants</hi> Hand; and there
are ſo many and ſo plain Places of it
which condemn the Opinions and
Practices of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi>
that it requires no great Skill nor Art
to diſcern how different they are from
<hi>Gods Word;</hi> And all the Learning
and Artiſice of their greateſt Doctors
will not be able to hide it from a
plain and honeſt Enquirer, that will
take but the Pains to read this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,
Vnalterable, Vniverſally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
<pb facs="tcp:61078:3"/>
and Infallible <hi>Book of God.</hi>
I know they pretend (eſpecially to the
Vnlearned) That all <hi>Antiquity</hi> is
clearly for them; but it is beſt for
thoſe who are not Read in Ancient
Authors, to leave that Province to the
<hi>Clergy</hi> of the <hi>Church of England,</hi>
who have hitherto always worſted
them at that Weapon alſo. And ſince
we can prove both by <hi>Scripture</hi> and
<hi>Antiquity,</hi> That all their Additional
<hi>Articles of Faith</hi> are Falſe and
Erroneous; and yet they do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
all thoſe <hi>Articles of Faith</hi>
which we hold as neceſſary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
to be True: Doubtleſs, Ours
muſt be the ſafer <hi>Religion,</hi> in which
both Sides do agree. Again, The plain
Words of <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> prove Our
Religion; but all thoſe Points where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they differ from us, cannot be
proved but by pretended <hi>Traditions,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:61078:4"/>
ſome of which are expreſly contrary
to Gods <hi>Written Word.</hi> The <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
was not made by us, but by the
<hi>GOD of Truth;</hi> and it is owned
not by us alone, but by them and all
Chriſtians to be the <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Will
of God,</hi> and this is clearly on Our
Side: But thoſe <hi>Traditions</hi> which
they fly to for their Evidence, are of
their own Making, and in their own
Keeping; No other <hi>Chriſtians</hi> do
allow them, and We have nothing but
their own Word in their own Cauſe,
to prove them to be Genuine: Which
being the Caſe, I hope none will ever
be perſwaded to leave a certain, plain
and evident <hi>Religion</hi> of Gods own
preſcribing, for an uncertain, obſcure
and Ill-proved <hi>Religion,</hi> which is no
more but a meer <hi>Human Invention,</hi>
as the enſuing Pages will more fully
declare.</p>

we do not kneel to good Men, and put their

ſo are joynt Petitioners with us, not joynt

               <p>No doubtleſs, not where your Church
expreſly contradicts God and his holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle.
The Spirit of God by S. <hi>Paul</hi> commands
Men to pray with underſtanding, and forbids
any to uſe an unknown Tongue in Chriſtian
Aſſemblies, enjoyning the Prieſt ſo to make
his Prayers and Praiſes, that the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned

them, and ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xiv. 14, 15,
16, 17. and 26. and your Church bids men
pray without underſtanding, and preſcribes
an unknown Tongue for the Prieſt to Pray
and Praiſe God in, wherein the People can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
joyn, and whereby they are not edified,
yea, to which they cannot with underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſay <hi>Amen:</hi> In ſuch a caſe to obey the

               <p>You muſt know <hi>Latin</hi> was the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of the ancient Chriſtians at <hi>Rome,</hi>
and we have not altered our Prayers, but
only kept them in that Tongue in which
they were made at firſt by the Apoſtles,

               <p>Now you have yielded the Cauſe, for
if the Apoſtles who were <hi>Jews,</hi> did not ſet
up the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Prayers at <hi>Rome,</hi> but <hi>Latin,</hi>
becauſe that was the Language which the
People then underſtood; if you were of
their Spirit, or followed their ſteps, you ought
now to turn them into other Languages, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the People do not underſtand <hi>Latin,</hi>
and becauſe it is neceſſary they ſhould pray
with underſtanding. Is this your Apoſtolical
Church which acts contrary to the Writings
and Example of the Apoſtles, or could the
Apoſtles leave you any Tradition to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
their own Commands and Practice?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Po.</speaker>
               <p>May not the People think of God

               <p>They may think of God and good
things at home, and ſo need not come to the
Publick Service at all, if this be ſufficient: We
think Publick Prayers were deſigned for the
People to come and unite their particular and
hearty deſires to the Petitions made by the
Prieſt; and this praying with one accord,
<hi>Acts</hi> i. 14. makes them more prevalent than
private Prayer, S. <hi>Math.</hi> xviii. 20. But your
People are thinking of one thing when the
Prieſt is ſaying another, and cannot deſire the
particular things asked by the Prieſt, becauſe
they do not know them: So that this turns the
publick Prayers into private, and the Prieſt
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61078:18"/>
might as well pray without a Congregation.</p>

your People are robbed of all that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort

May they not wreſt your Sermons, as well as

You muſt confeſs there is a Figure in this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
or elſe you muſt affirm the Wine is
Tranſubſtantiated into the New Teſtament;
and if there be a Figure in one Verſe, why
may there not be one alſo in the other, in

            <sp>
               <speaker>Po.</speaker>
               <p>However we have much the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of you, becauſe we take the Literal
ſenſe, which is both the more common and
the more eaſie ſenſe, whilſt you are forced
to fly to Tropes and Figures.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>You muſt conſider this Sacrament is
a Myſtery, and in diſcourſing of Myſteries, it
is more common in Scripture to ſpeak Figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively
than Literally; yea, what is more
uſual there, than to call the Sign by the name
of the thing ſignified, and the thing ſignified
by the name of the Sign? So the <hi>Rock</hi> is ſaid
<hi>to be Chriſt, 1 Cor.</hi> x. 4. and <hi>Christ</hi> is ſaid <hi>to be
Bread, John</hi> vi. 48. yet none are ſo abſurd to
ſay, the <hi>Rock</hi> is ſubſtantially changed into
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> or <hi>Chriſt</hi> into <hi>Bread:</hi> And when the
Church is called, <hi>The Body of Chriſt, Coloſ.</hi> i. 24.
your ſelves do not affirm that there is any
change made of the Church into Chriſts
Fleſh and Blood, though there be more ſaid
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:61078:19"/>
of this than of the Sacramental Bread, <hi>viz
That we are Members of his Body, of his Fleſh,
and of his Bones, Epheſ.</hi> v. 30. So when Chriſt
is called a <hi>Vine,</hi> a <hi>Door,</hi> a <hi>Way,</hi> a <hi>Branch, &amp;c.</hi> it
is very certain the Expreſſions are Figurative,
and there are a thouſand places in the Holy
Bible which cannot be otherwiſe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Po.</speaker>
               <p>Well, but the Literal ſenſe is not to
be left, unleſs where the words cannot be
taken otherwiſe than Figuratively, which
is not the caſe here.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, that is the very caſe here; for the
Literal ſenſe is impoſſible and full of Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions,
but the Figurative is natural, plain
and eaſie: For if we take theſe words Lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,
Chriſt's Body was whole and ſitting at
the Table, and broken into pieces on the
Table at the ſame time; it muſt be entire
now in Heaven, and yet all of it in ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
different and diſtant places on the Earth.
We muſt believe the ſubſtance of Fleſh hath
none of its proper Accidents, and that the
Accidents of Bread can ſubſiſt without their
proper ſubſtance: We muſt think that to be
real Fleſh and Blood, which we ſee, ſmell, taſte
and feel to be real Bread and Wine: We muſt
believe there is a Miracle, when all our Senſes
which are witneſſes to all other Miracles,
give Evidence there is no Miracle at all here.
In ſhort, we muſt contradict our Reaſon, and
deny our Senſes without any need, unleſs it
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:61078:20"/>
be to uphold an unintelligible Literal ſenſe,
when the Figurative is far more plain.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Po.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis ſtrange how Prejudice may
blind Men; ſurely you cannot be in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
when you ſay, a Figurative Speech is
plainer than a Speech without a Figure;
This only ſhews how deſperate your
Cauſe is, which drives you to theſe Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>I will prove it is no Abſurdity to
maintain, that in this caſe the Figurative ſenſe
is eaſier: For that is the eaſieſt ſenſe of any
words, which the Mind firſt apprehends
when we hear them. For Example, if one
point to an Houſe and Land, and ſay, <hi>This is
my Eſtate,</hi> there the plain ſenſe is the Literal
ſenſe; But if one hold a Writing ſealed in
his Hand, and ſay, <hi>This is my Eſtate,</hi> the eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
and plaineſt ſenſe then is, <hi>This is that
which conveys my Eſtate, and all the benefits of
it to me:</hi> So if Chriſt had pointed to himſelf
ſitting at Table, and ſaid, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> the
Apoſtles would, and we muſt have taken it
Literally: but ſince he points to Bread, and
ſaith, <hi>This is my Body;</hi> the firſt and moſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
ſenſe of the words is, <hi>This is that which
ſignifies my Body, and communicates all the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
of my Incarnation and Paſſion to you:</hi> and
thus S. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſly doth expound it when
he ſaith, it is <hi>the Communion of his Body and
Blood, 1 Cor.</hi> x. 16.</p>

               <p>What then do you believe that

Chriſt is in this Sacrament no otherwiſe

               <p>We believe that Chriſt is here verily

though it be real, yet is ſpiritual and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended

               <p>From one abſurdity granted many

               <p>Dare you ſeriouſly deny this, which
you call a ridiculous aſſertion? Is not Chriſt
really with his Church to the end of the
World by his Spiritual Preſence? Is not the
Holy Ghoſt really with every Regenerate
Man by his Spiritual Preſence? The effects
and benefits of Chriſt's Death, which we ſeek
in this Sacrament are Spiritual; ſuch as Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
Peace, Grace and hopes of Glory, yet
they are very real, and therefore we think
it fitteſt to expect them in a Spiritual man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
eſpecially ſince our Lord hath told us,
<hi>It is the Spirit that quickneth, the Fleſh profiteth
nothing, John.</hi> vi. 63. And the Apoſte ſaith,

we, in a myſtical way: For <hi>they did all Eat

that Spiritual Rock that followed them, and that
Rock was Chriſt:</hi> We ſee it was Spiritual
Meat and Drink which they had, yet it was

               <p>Well, I will inform you of one very
ill conſequence of your denying Chriſts
Fleſh and Blood, to be ſubſtantially in
this Sacrament, that is, you make it to
be only a Commemoration of the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
on the Croſs; but we give it far more
honour, believing it to be a Propitiatory
Sacrifice for the ſins of quick and dead.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>Neither you nor we ought to make
the Sacrament what we pleaſe, we muſt take
our Notions of it from Scripture and from
Chriſt, who inſtituted it, and he bids us
<hi>Do this in Remembrance of Him, Luk.</hi> xxii. 19.
And S. <hi>Paul</hi> doth not ſay <hi>it is the Lords Death,</hi>
but <hi>the ſhewing forth of his Death, 1 Cor.</hi> xi. 26.
Yea he makes this the main difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the legal Sacrifices and that of Chriſt
on the Croſs, that they were often Offered,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:61078:22"/>
but he was only to be Offered once, and by
that one Offering hath perfectly ſatisfied for
the Sins of the whole World, <hi>Hebr.</hi> ix. 25, 26.
And Chap. x. 14. So that this Sacrament is
certainly a Commemoration, as we ſay, but
it cannot be a Sacrificing of Chriſt again, as
you ſay, if we refer the matter (as we ought)
to be judged by Scripture; wherein there
is nothing to ſhew that is a Propitiatory Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
for the Sins of the Living, much leſs
for the Sins of the Dead, whoſe eſtate can
never be altered after this Life, <hi>Luk.</hi> xvi. 26,

               <p>It is not for want of Merit in Chriſts
Paſſion, but for want of Capacity in thoſe
who have not Repented in their Life Time,
that hinders theſe Deceaſed Perſons from
receiving the benefits of Chriſts Death;
Chriſt hath declared he will pardon none but
them that do repent; and if Men do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
before they die, they cannot repent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,
and ſo cannot receive any benefit
of Chriſts Paſſion; and if living Men be
taught, they may get a Pardon after Death,

before we leave this Subject, will you tell me,
How the making only ſome (that is the

the true meaning of Chriſts Words, <hi>Drink ye

            <sp>
               <speaker>Po.</speaker>
               <p>Why, it is plain the Apoſtles were
Prieſts and not Lay Men, and it was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the Apoſtles that Chriſt ſpake theſe
Words; and though we forbid the People
to Drink of this Cup, yet we Command
the Prieſts to do it.</p>

               <p>Was it not alſo only to the Apoſtles
that Chriſt ſaid then, <hi>Take Eat, this my Body,
Ver.</hi> 26. and will it not follow by your way of
arguing, that none but Prieſts muſt Eat of the
Bread, and that the People muſt receive nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Bread nor Wine? You know the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
ſtood then in the place of Lay-Men and
repreſented the Congregation as Chriſt did
the Prieſt, ſo that S. <hi>Paul</hi> plainly applies
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:61078:23"/>
to the People, the Commands both of Eating
and Drinking, which Chriſt gave at firſt on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to his Apoſtles. And nothing is more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
than that all the People at <hi>Corinth</hi> did
Drink of the Cup, and ſome of them too
largely, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> x. 21. Chap. xi. 21. and <hi>Ver.
27,</hi> 28, 29. Chap. xii. 13. So that I wonder
how you dare call the contradicting Chriſts
Commands and the Precepts and Practice of
the Apoſtles, the true ſenſe of Scripture, and
why you rob the People of one half of the

               <p>We do not forbid Men at any time

But we dare not lay ſuch a Snare on our

God hath not declared it is ſo. And thoſe

and ſo doth that place in S. <hi>James,</hi>
for it orders us to Confeſs not to the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
Man alone, but one to another, that
ſo the Righteous Man and all the reſt may
pray for Mercy for the Penitent; and I
have heard this was the Primitive way of
Confeſſing Sins, and is ſtill here in our

not compel us under pain of Damnation to

they are to do for Satisfaction to the Church,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> ii. 7. And we hold it neceſſary in more

               <p>But after God hath pardoned the

And true Penitents have voluntarily put on
Sackcloth and laid in Aſhes, and Faſted and

of their Repentance, and the reality of

ſuch Acts purely to ſatisfie Gods

            <sp>
               <speaker>Po.</speaker>
               <p>Well, you cannot deny it is more
for the honour of Gods Iuſtice to enjoyn
the Offenders to make him ſome ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
rather than to teach them he will

               <p>But it is not much for Gods Honour,
that when your Church pretends God will
not remit theſe remaining temporal Pains
without men do their Pennance; yet ſhe
will remit the Pennance it ſelf for a certain
Price, and ſo Money will buy off that which
you ſay Chriſts Death doth not ſatisfie for:
And indeed none but the Poor almoſt do
any Pennance, with you, the Rich who can
gratifie the Prieſt well are Abſolved and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged;
and however you order it in your

and Payments, as any where elſe: yea, they
ſin with leſs fear and regret than others, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they foreſee a Pilgrimage, or a little
Faſting; a few Laſhes, or a Sum of Money
will make their Peace with the Prieſt,

Amendment to make their Peace with

of that Power of remitting Sins which
Chriſt gave to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and in him to the

               <p>S. <hi>Peter</hi> never ſold this Power, <hi>Acts</hi>

1 Pet.</hi> i. 8. Had he uſed the ſame gainful
Trade which the Pope drives, he could not

holy Apoſtle as your Patron till you follow
his Example, and grant Pardons to none but
them, that upon a ſtrict ſearch are found
truly Penitent; and upon theſe terms (which
Chriſt makes neceſſary) the Poor muſt have
them as ſoon as the Rich, and both freely:
But while your Church makes a meer Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize
of them, and grants them out to
raiſe Money to enrich a Nephew, to marry
a Niece of the Popes, or to aggrandize a

               <p>You are quite miſtaken; the Church
deſigns nothing by theſe Indulgences but
the Penitents Salvation; the Money is
a voluntary Offering, and can you blame
Holy Church for receiving the Oblations
of the People?</p>

               <p>It is no Crime to receive voluntary
Oblations, provided they be diſpenſed to the
Poor: But here is a certain Price ſet, and
the Money received goes in part to the
Popes Coffers, and in part to the wealthy

appears that Money is the main thing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
Poor Men cannot get them, nor will

Article of Faith upon: But the plaineſt
Senſe of it is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That Chriſt by his Spirit in
<hi>Noah</hi> did Preach to thoſe Wicked ones be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Flood, whoſe Souls and Spirits were
as it were Impriſoned in their Bodies; and
thoſe who were ſaved by this Preaching
were but a few, and thoſe were ſaved by
Water, and not by Fire. And as far as we
can gather from this Text, and 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> ii. 3, 5.
theſe Perſons who were Preached to, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:61078:28"/>
diſobedient, and were not ſaved at
all; ſo that you have no ſhadow of ground
to fix <hi>Purgatory</hi> on this place.</p>

               <p>What think you of that Priſon<hi>into which if we be caſt by God, who is the
Sinners Adverſary, they ſhall by no means
come out thence till they have paid the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt
Farthing, </hi>Math.<hi> v. 26. </hi>Is not this
Purgatory?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>I think it is nothing to your pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
for Chriſt uſeth it as an Argument
why we ſhould Repent and make our Peace
with God while we live; whereas Purgatory
gives Men pretences to put off their Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
till Death, and fills them with falſe
Hopes to be delivered afterwards: And out
of this Priſon there is no means to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
but by the Perſons own ſatisfying the
whole Debt, whereas you think the Prayers
and Alms of others may get Men out of
Purgatory: Nor doth the Text ſay, that the
Sufferer can pay the utmoſt Farthing, but
rather ſuppoſe it impoſſible, and ſo his lying
there <hi>till he pay the utmoſt Farthing,</hi> muſt be
meant of his lying in Hell for ever. And
Chriſt mentions <hi>Hell</hi> in that Chapter,
<hi>Ver.</hi> 22, 29, 30. But there is no word of
<hi>Purgatory</hi> here, or any where in Scripture,
and therefore pray try if you can prove
it from Reaſon, ſince Gods Word is not for
you.</p>

               <p>Is there not great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
ſome ſins and others; and if God
be a Righteous Iudge, he will make dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
puniſhments, ſo that it is very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
to believe that Venial Sins ſhall
only be puniſhed with temporary fire, not
with eternal Flames.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>If we conſider the Holineſs of the
Law, or the infiniteneſs of the Majeſty of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended,
all Sin, even the leaſt, deſerves Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
as its juſt Wages, <hi>Rom.</hi> vi. 23. and the
leaſt Sin unrepented of may prove Mortal,
becauſe it is not ſo much (now under the
Goſpel) the Sin, as the final impenitence which
Damns Men; and he that will not repent,
ſhews he would Eternally Sin; ſo that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the inſtance be, he deſerves Eternal Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation:
Yet alas! no Man that repents not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
while he lives, is only guilty of theſe leſſer
Sins, which in ſuch perſons never go alone,
they are always guilty of greater Sins which
merit Eternal Flames. And that place of
S. <hi>John</hi> on which you ground your diſtinction
of Mortal and Venial Sin, ſpeaks of the event
of Mens Sins, not of the nature of them; So
that if we ſee Men ſin without any ſigns or
hope of their Repentance, he doth not oblige
us to pray for ſuch, 1 <hi>John.</hi> v. 16.</p>

               <p>But is it not ſaid, that nothing

reaſon teacheth, that they who are Defiled

               <p>Surely poor Catholics are hardly uſed,
to pay ſo much Money, and endure ſo many
Pennances, on pretence of purging away
their Venial Sins; and yet after all their
Faſtings, Whipping, and Pilgrimages, their
Abſolutions, Holy Water, Alms and Extreme
Unction, ſtill they are to endure a Torment
as grievous, though not as long, as Hell Fire,
for theſe light Tranſgreſſions: Beſides, we
cannot imagine how Fire can purge a Soul
unbodyed, nor why Purgatory ſhould be
needful to cleanſe us from ſome Sins, when
Scripture declares, <hi>the Blood of Chriſt cleanſeth
us from all Sin, 1 John.</hi> i. 7. Or how Men who
are to be Saved by Chriſt ſhould be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to Purgatory, when St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>There is
no Condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus,
Rom.</hi> viii. 1. 'Tis evident, it hugely derogates
from Gods Mercy and Chriſts Merits, to
teach Men, That after all Gods Promiſes <hi>to
justify us freely by his Grace,</hi> Rom. iii. 24. And
after Chriſts <hi>blotting out the Hand-writing of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
that was againſt us, Coloſſ.</hi> ii. 14. they

               <p>You are miſtaken again, for we hold,
that becauſe of the Communion of Saints,
one man may ſatisfy for another, and that
the Alms and Prayers of the Living, and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:61078:30"/>

               <speaker>Prot.</speaker>
               <p>You may hold what you pleaſe, but
Scripture tells us, <hi>Every one ſhall bear his own
burden,</hi> Galat. vi. 5. and, <hi>that no Man can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem
his Brother, nor make agreement to God for
