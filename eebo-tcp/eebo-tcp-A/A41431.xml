            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>SInce Printing of Conferences ſeems now in Vogue, I will venture to be in the new Mode; I have ſo good an Example of it before me, that I hope no body will take it ill if I follow it. In the Year <hi>1676.</hi> there happen'd a Conference about Points of Religion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ſome Proteſtant Divines, and ſome Roman-Catholic Gentlemen, which after a long ſilence, has been now lately ſet out the <note place="margin">

further into thoſe Matters, and meeting accidentally with a Copy of another Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference held in <hi>1671.</hi> wherein ſome of the ſame Perſons were concern'd, I thought good to preſent you with it.

               <p>1. <hi>Schiſm</hi> is a wilful Separation from the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Church, without cauſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cath.</speaker>
               <p>Tho' we know very well there can be no cauſe of Schiſm, yet we will admit (to come quickly to the Queſtion) your notion of <hi>Schiſm</hi> with theſe words <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe</hi> in your Definition of it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr.</speaker>
               <p>2. Another Principle is, Men may without Crime ſeparate from a Communion, in which they cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue without Sin.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cath.</speaker>
               <p>Agreed.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr.</speaker>
               <p>3. There are certain Laws antecedent to Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:102856:4"/>
by which every particular perſon ought to judge what Communion he ought to be of, or forſake.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cath.</speaker>
               <p>We do admit, that there are <hi>external Motives</hi> antecedent to Communion, which do induce and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige a particular perſon to chooſe the Communion of which he ought to be a Member, and to which he ought, being a Member, to ſubmit in Faith and Government, of which every particular perſon may and ought to judge: But we do deny, that the interior Doctrins or general Practices of a Communion are ſubject to the Judgment of every particular Man; ſo that every private perſon judging this or that Doctrin or Practice to be Falſe, Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, or Idolatrous, (tho' the Communion, of which he is a Member, judges it Catholic and Orthodox,) has lawful cauſe to ſeparate himſelf from that Communion, without being guilty of Criminal Schiſm; for without this Diſtinction there could be no ſuch thing as <hi>Schiſm</hi> in the World.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr.</speaker>
               <p>You muſt prove us guilty of <hi>Criminal Schiſm.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cath.</speaker>
               <p>We will. In the year 1517, you wilfully ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the Communion of the Church, without cauſe; <hi>Ergo</hi> you are Criminal Schiſmatics.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr.</speaker>
               <p>I do deny that the Separation in the year, 1517, do's concern us; nor do we think our ſelves oblig'd to defend or juſtifie it; we do only maintain, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> is not guilty of Criminal Schiſm.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cath.</speaker>
               <p>The ſame Argument preſſes the <hi>Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, as the <hi>Lutherans;</hi> Let it be therefore put thus. In King <hi>Hen.</hi> the <hi>8th. Ed.</hi> the <hi>6th.</hi> or Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Days (date the Birth of your Church from what time you pleaſe) you wilfully ſeparated from the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Church without cauſe; <hi>Ergo</hi> you, the Church of <hi>England,</hi> are guilty of <hi>Criminal Schiſm.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr.</speaker>
               <p>I deny your Antecedent, we did not ſeparate without cauſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:102856:4"/>
               <speaker>Cath.</speaker>
               <p>I prove it. If you had lawful cauſe, you can aſſign it; but you cannot aſſign any lawful cauſe; <hi>Ergo</hi> you did ſeparate without cauſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr.</speaker>
               <p>I will aſſign the cauſe, It was thus. In the—Year of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>8th.</hi> the Parliament declared, That the Right of Reforming the Church of this Kingdom was in the King; upon which the King did reform, and upon this Reformation the Pope did Excommunicate the King and Kingdom, which Excommunication was confirm'd by another Pope in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> days; ſo that the Pope by Excommunicating made the Schiſm, and not we by Reforming.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cath.</speaker>
               <p>The Declaration above mentioned, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation thereupon, were antecedent to the Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication; ſo that you muſt prove that the Parliament had juſt Power and Authority to make that Declaration, and to Reform upon it, and that they did indeed Reform, and not ſpoil the Doctrin they undertook to mend; for if it had not, all its Proceedings were unjuſt and criminal; and Excommunication was but the juſt and proper Puniſhment for that Crime: And then ſure it would be reckoned very ſtrange, to ſay, That a lawful Authority puniſhing an Offender, is made guilty of the Crime it puniſhes, by inflicting that Puniſhment.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr.</speaker>
               <p>The Parliament did not aſcribe any new Power to the King; but only declar'd that the ſame was in him, which all Ages appropriated to their Kings, and was allow'd by all; And I can ſhew from time to time, that the Popes Authority has been refus'd, and his Legats forbid entrance into the Kingdom ſeveral times.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cath.</speaker>
               <p>I pray ſhew ſubſtantially (if you can) that the Church of <hi>England</hi> before the Reformation, did never at any time accept, or (which is poſitive) did at all times refuſe the Pope all ſort of Authority and Superiority over them; elſe to quarrel ſometimes with his Authority, or
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:102856:5"/>
ſome part of it, or ſtop his Legats, might be juſt: For that it is poſſible for a Power which has lawful Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, to challenge and demand ſome ſort of Authority which is more than what is lawfully his; and in ſuch caſe the Inferiors may at leaſt remonſtrate to their Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors, if not oppoſe them in ſuch unlawful Demands; and this might be the caſe between the Pope and the King of <hi>England</hi> at ſome particular time: At other times In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriors might be ſtubborn and diſobedient, and for a time deny that to their Superiors which is really due. Therefore to ſay, that the Kings of <hi>England</hi> did for a time oppoſe the Pope in ſome things, is not enough to prove the Declaration aforeſaid (which was univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, denying him all Authority whatſoever,) to be no aſcribing of new Power, but only a Declaration, that the ſame Power was in That King, which all Ages ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to their Kings, and was allow'd by all; but the contrary, to what is now demanded to be prov'd (and muſt be prov'd before that Declaration can excuſe the Declarers from the guilt of cauſeleſs Separation, and conſequently Criminal Schiſm, and conſequently of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving juſtly Excommunication) is ſo evident, that I appeal to theſe preſent worthy perſons, who are to judge in this point, whether this be not ſufficiently ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt from the Hiſtories which they themſelves have read, and the general Confeſſions, which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have met withal from very many even learned Proteſtants, That the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> was at leaſt Patriarch of the Weſt, and, as ſuch, had Patriarchal Authority, at leaſt over the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and therefore was allow'd to be the proper Judge of Eccleſiaſtical Matters, the very day before the foreſaid Declaration was made; and therefore was the only proper Judge of the ſaid Declaration, and the Authors of it, whether it were well and legally made: And this ſaid Judge having judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:102856:5"/>
determin'd the ſaid Declaration to be Schiſmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, condemned it legally, and juſtly Excommunicated the Authors. Moſt certainly a Declaration made by every one, that pretends Power to make one, is not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently lawful, becauſe it is pretended to be ſo. The late long Parliament pretended to declare, That the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Power of <hi>England</hi> was in the People, and that the ſaid People might Judge and Depoſe the King when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he miſuſed that Power, which the People entruſted him withal; and we know what followed upon it. I hope the Doctor will not juſtifie that Declaration, nor can he ſhew a diſparity between this and the other, both being made by thoſe, who were univerſally e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem'd, at the time they made them, Subjects and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriors to thoſe againſt whoſe Authority they made them, in thoſe very Points, concerning which they did then declare.</p>

               <p>Sirs, we do not doubt, but that the Pope was allow'd ſome Authority in <hi>England</hi> before the Separation, we do not therefore deſire to diſpute that; but ſuppoſing he had not, you ſeparated your ſelves from the great Body of

               <p>We had cauſe to ſeparate, for that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion from which we ſeparated, taught falſe Faith, and were guilty of Idolatry; I inſtance particularly in their Doctrin of Tranſubſtantiation, and their Adoring the Hoſt.</p>

               <p>Tho' you may be pleas'd to remember, that we did at firſt deny, that any particular perſon, (and the ſame holds of particular Dioceſſes, Provinces, and Nations, all which United make but one Catholic Church, and therefore the biggeſt of them all to be conſider'd only as a Member of the whole Body) has Power to judge, and condemn the Doctrins and Practices of the whole Church as falſe or Idolatrous, when the Body againſt this Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſays, that the ſaid Doctrins or Practices are Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox and Catholic, ſo as to have lawful cauſe to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from the ſaid whole Communion, without being guilty of criminal Schiſm; That what we ſaid of a particular Perſon, holds to a Nation, or any Inferior Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to a Superior, is evident, upon ſuppoſition, that God has requir'd and commanded, that his Church be one, which could not be, if a Secular Sovereign Power has Authority to break its Unity, upon pretence of judging any one of it's Doctrins or Practices falſe or I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrous: For if one may, another may; and then <hi>Swiſſerland</hi> may have as many Religions and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, as Cantons, and the World as many Churches as Secular Sovereigns, tho' God has ſaid he will have but One: And here in <hi>England</hi> the Biſhops may as well wave the Arch-biſhops Authority, private perſons pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to Judge and Cenſure the Biſhops Power and Authority, or any one Man controul the Authority of his Paſtor. Tho' this we deny'd at firſt, and might there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:102856:6"/>
well refuſe to proceed, till the Doctors had prov'd, that a ſingle Perſon might condemn a whole Church's Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin legally, or a leſſer Authority, judge and cenſure a greater; yet becauſe perhaps this Method may have been propos'd by your ſelves, we are content to do any thing for your ſatisfaction: but then you muſt be pleas'd (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering our Communion at the time of the Separation was infinitly greater than the Reformers, as Learned and as Holy, for ought any body knows, and in poſſeſſion for many hundred years of the Doctrins and Practices now condemn'd by theſe Reformers) to demand <hi>more clear</hi> and <hi>evident proofs</hi> againſt our Doctrins than we bring for them: for upon but equal proof, we that are forty to one (and every whit as learned as the others, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally having receiv'd, what we profeſs, from our Fore-fathers, from Chriſts time, for ought any body knows; for no body can ſay when what we hold and practiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun) have no reaſon to ſubmit to ſo much a leſs number, at the charge of ſo great a confuſion, as muſt needs hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, and God's Command of Unity be broke into the bargain. You muſt therefore demand the moſt evident proofs that Nature can admit of, to prove thoſe Doctrins of theirs, upon which they ground their Separation, or elſe it will be <hi>criminal</hi> Schiſm, and you muſt deſert their Communion. If they attempt to prove it from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, they muſt not bring obſcure paſſages out of it, to oppoſe or interpret clear ones; for that is not to explicate, but to confound; not to draw Light and Truth out of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, but to caſt more Darkneſs upon it. Neither can an obſcure and doubtful Title lawfully or reaſonably caſt any Body out of the poſſeſſion of a belief, for which he has clear and evident ones to ſhew. They muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bring Texts that prove their Points in Terms; for their interpretation is no more to be allow'd of than ours, and Scripture ought to be taken literally,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:102856:7"/>
where the literal ſenſe does not imply a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</p>

               <p>It may be reaſonably ſuppos'd, that theſe unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable Principles were the cauſe, why the Doctors (as it will appear in all this Conference) would never ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon any citation of the Scripture to prove their Doctrin, for which they ſeparated from the Roman Church, acknowledged then univerſally for the true Church, but were forc'd to fly to ſome obſcure Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of the Fathers, even which will yet appear to make more for the Roman Church, than for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers.</p>

               <p>All Scriptures ought not to be expounded literally, which do not imply a Contradiction in a literal ſenſe: <hi>I am a Vine,</hi> ought not to be expounded literally, yet it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies no Contradiction, or at leaſt no more than this, <hi>Chriſt is Bread.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>I am a Vine</hi> does imply a Contradiction, for Chriſt cannot be <hi>Chriſt</hi> and a <hi>Vine</hi> at the ſame time; <hi>Chriſt is Bread,</hi> is alſo a Contradiction; but where is that Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Scripture? or what Catholic in the World holds it? We ſay, <hi>that which was Bread ceaſes to be Bread, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the Body of Chriſt,</hi> which is no more a Contradiction than to ſay, that which was Water, ceaſes to be Water, and becomes Wine.</p>

               <speaker>Drs.</speaker>
               <p>That Text you build your Faith upon, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> implies a Contradiction; for it muſt ſignifie, <hi>This Bread is my Body,</hi> which is as much a Contradiction, as <hi>Chriſt is a Vine,</hi> or <hi>Chriſt is Bread,</hi> which you have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd already for a Contradiction; or elſe it muſt be an identical enuntiation, and ſignifie, <hi>This my Body is my Body.</hi>

            <sp>

               <p>
                  <hi>This Bread is my Body,</hi> is a Contradiction, but cannot be meant in the Text; for in all Languages (but Engliſh) where the <hi>word</hi> which ſignifies <hi>this</hi> is alter'd
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:102856:7"/>
according to the different Gender the Antecedent is of, to which this word ſhould relate, it is always put in the Neuter Gender, <hi>hoc</hi> in Latin, and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in Greek, which it could not be, if it were to agree with <hi>Bread,</hi> or have relation to it, that being always Maſculin, as <hi>panis</hi> in Latin, and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in Greek; therefore to ſay, <hi>this Bread</hi> in the Latin or Greek Language, would be falſe Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; and Engliſh, I ſuppoſe, has no reaſon to govern the other Languages, but they it, they being more and old, againſt one and new. Nor need it be, <hi>This Body is my Body;</hi> the Particle <hi>this</hi> is a Pronoun demonſtrative, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying only ſome exterior Object undetermind'd, as to its Nature or Name, without ſome other additional Word, as <hi>this is a Horſe, this is a Hat,</hi> are, I hope, proper Speeches, and therefore no Identical Enuntiations. <hi>This</hi> only ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes an Object exiſting and expos'd to Senſe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd by the following word <hi>Hat</hi> or <hi>Horſe,</hi> of what Nature and Quality it is. Beſides, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> is an Efficient Propoſition, and is the cauſe of the change, which is not wrought till the Propoſition be compleated, and therefore <hi>this</hi> is not determin'd till the whole be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd.</p>

               <p>It is impoſſible it ſhould be taken in your ſenſe, for Tranſubſtantiation cannot be without a Miracle; and no Miracle can be without appearing ſo to Senſe; Nay, it would deſtroy all poſſibility of judging of any other Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, they being not to be diſcern'd but by Senſe, which cannot be rely'd upon, if it may be deceiv'd in this.</p>

               <p>A Miracle may be, and yet not appear to Senſe to be ſo, yet ought to be believ'd: For the hypoſtatical Union was never diſcern'd by Senſe, yet is believ'd a true Miracle; ſo that your firſt Propoſition is falſe. To your ſecond, I pray ſay, whether it be poſſible for God to make a thing appear to Senſe to be, what it is not: Then ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing it poſſible, may not God diſcover to Man that he
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:102856:8"/>
has made a thing to appear one thing, and to be another, as well as he has diſcover'd, that the Divinity was uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Chriſts Humanity, tho' no ſuch thing appear'd? If he may and do's, ought I to believe Gods Word againſt my own Senſes, or my Senſes againſt Gods Word? Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this, my Senſes ſhall judge of a Miracle at all times, unleſs when God aſſures me upon his Word, that his Omnipotency has interpos'd between my Senſes and their Natural Object.</p>

               <p>Tho' that can never juſtifie your ſeparation, or make your Communion ſafe; for if it were not ſafe to ſtay in the Roman Communion, becauſe a Doctrin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd by them, was in one Age ſince Chriſts time, not believ'd, it can never be ſafe to abide in yours, where many Doctrins are now believ'd, which you acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge were not believ'd by the true Church for many Hundred years together: Yet let us hear your proofs.</p>

               <p>Truly the Homily we did never ſee before, nor never heard of it, nor do we know what credit it bears, nor can I remember the words exactly; but in the firſt place the Doctor quoted, for he produc'd two, the ſenſe was, that the Bread and Wine which the Prieſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated at Maſs, was turn'd into the True Body and Blood of Chriſt; which Text we pray'd the Doctor to read in Engliſh, which he did; and after a little ſtumble at the word <hi>Miſſam,</hi> he told us, he car'd not tho' he render'd it <hi>Maſs,</hi> which he did; This very Quotation we urg'd againſt him; but he told us this muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd by another, in which he brought us the ſame, or like words again concerning the change, but at the end of the Sentence were theſe words in a diſtinct re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Character, <hi>not Corporally but Spiritually.</hi> Where, or by whom this Book was Printed, we could not learn, or what Authority it was of; but it might very well be Authentick, for all that diſtinction, it being fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently us'd by Modern Catholics, who are not deny'd to hold the Doctrin of Tranſubſtantiation; They com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſay, that it is not chang'd <hi>Corporally,</hi> taking <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally</hi> to ſignifie <hi>carnally;</hi> as the Capharnaits under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood our Bleſſed Lord, when he ſpoke of this Myſtery; but <hi>Spiritually,</hi> taking that to ſignfie, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> uſes the word <hi>Spiritual,</hi> ſpeaking of the Reſurrection, where he ſays, it is ſown a <hi>natural Body,</hi> it riſes a <hi>Spiritual Body.</hi> there is a natural Body, and there is a Spiritual Body; Now if this way of ſpeaking be frequently us'd by thoſe who are, notwithſtanding ſuch an expreſſion, confeſs'd to hold Tranſubſtantiation; why muſt it ſignifie more evidently the contrary Doctrin in this Author, than it do's in others, eſpecially when this Author delivers the Roman Doctrin in this point, in his other expreſſions, as
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:102856:9"/>
evidently and plainly as can be, and cites the <hi>Maſs</hi> as the Doctor confeſſes? But he ſtood not much upon this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, but laid his whole ſtreſs upon two others.</p>

               <p>I will prove now evidently, that your Doctrin was contradicted in the fifth Age, both by the Greek and Latin Church; nay by a <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> himſelf: For <hi>Gelaſius</hi> diſputing againſt the <hi>Eutychians,</hi> who main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd, that the Human Nature of Chriſt was <hi>chang'd</hi> into the Divine Nature, ſo that there was but one nature in Chriſt; confuted their Hereſie, by ſhewing, that the Human Nature was no more chang'd into the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, than <hi>Bread</hi> was <hi>chang'd</hi> into the <hi>Body</hi> of Chriſt; that is, not at all; for <hi>Gelaſius</hi> has theſe expreſs words: <hi>Certe Sacramenta, quae ſumimus, corporis &amp; ſanguinis Chriſti, divina res eſt, propter quod &amp; per eadem efficimur divinae conſortes naturae; &amp; tamen eſſe non deſinit ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia vel natura panis &amp; vini; &amp; certe imago &amp; ſimilitudo corporis &amp; ſanguinis in actione myſteriorum celebrantur;</hi> which is in Engliſh thus, <hi>Truly the Sacraments of the Body and Blood of Chriſt which we take, is a Divine thing, and by them we are made partakers of the Divine Nature; and yet the Subſtance or Nature of Bread and Wine, do not ceaſe to be; and truly the Image and Similitude of the Body and Blood of Chriſt are celebrated in the action of the Myſteries:</hi> Where it is evident, that the ſubſtance of Bread and Wine, is not chang'd into the Body and Blood of Chriſt. <hi>Theodoret</hi> proves the ſame thing; for he ſays, the Myſtical Signs after Conſecration do not recede from their Nature, but do remain in their former Subſtance, Figure and Form, and may be ſeen, and touch'd as before; this evidently contradicts Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation.</p>

               <p>I pray be pleas'd to ask the Doctor whether this whole Diſcourſe now cited be not built and founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Suppoſition of Tranſubſtantiation.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Drs.</speaker>
               <p>I do acknowledge the Argument is founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Suppoſition; but it is brought by an Heretic, an <hi>Eutychian,</hi> which is not much for the credit of your Doctrin.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cath.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, we account it much for the credit of our Doctrin, that you cannot name any Age, in which you are not forc'd to allow, that it was Profeſs'd. You ſay it was Profeſs'd in this Age only by Heretics: Make that out, if you can, more clear than I will the contrary; I do aſſure you, your two Quotations will not do it, as I will ſhew you preſently; but the contrary ſeems evident, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Heretics did not differ from the Catholics in this Point: For <hi>Eutyches,</hi> who was Condemn'd at a General Council, for maintaining one Nature only in Chriſt, would certainly have been Condemn'd at the ſame time for holding Tranſubſtantiation, had it been eſteem'd an Error by that Age, eſpecially ſo Abſurd, Monſtrous, and Idolatrous an one, as Doctor—calls it in his new Book; but he was not Condemn'd, nor ſo much as Accus'd of Error in this Point, either by Council, or any particular Writer of thoſe many, which have wrote againſt him, and yet you do acknowledge, that he and his Adherents held Tranſubſtantiation: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, you confeſs that his Argument was againſt an
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:102856:10"/>
Orthodox Catholic, founded upon this Suppoſition; therefore moſt certainly he took it for granted, that the Catholics allow'd the Suppoſition; for it would have been ridiculous to diſpute upon a Suppoſition, which he knew his Adverſary deny'd. I ſhould account it abſurd for me to argue againſt a Proteſtant upon ſuppoſition of Tranſubſtantiation, which I know they deny; and ſo it would have been in <hi>Eraniſt,</hi> if he had not known that his Adverſary own'd that Doctrin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which he made the Foundation of his Argument. Beſides, <hi>Theodoret</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, an Orthodox Catholic, making this Diſcourſe by way of Dialogue, would make himſelf ridiculous to frame it upon a Suppoſition which he deny'd. After all this, the place now cited, is ſo far from being ſo clear againſt us, as it ought to be to vanquiſh our ſtanding Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the Century-Writers of <hi>Magdeburg,</hi> who were <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Magd</hi> Cent. 5. cap. 4. <hi>de Inclinatione Doct. tit. de Coena Domini.</hi>
                  </note> great Enemies of Popery and Tranſubſtantiation, do condemn <hi>Theodoret</hi> of <hi>that Doctrin</hi> from this very place, and do ſay he ſpeaks dangerouſly of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, in ſaying, <hi>that after Conſecration the Symbols of our Lords Body and Blood are changed and made another thing.</hi> And the words next after theſe, which you quote as ſuch clear ones againſt our Doctrin, muſt either import Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry according to the aforeſaid new Book, or Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe, if they do not imply the Actual Preſence of Chriſts Perſon by Tranſubſtantiation; for he ſays, <hi>they</hi> (the Myſtical Signs) <hi>are underſtood what they are made and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd, and are Ador'd as being the ſame things they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd:</hi> So that the whole Senſe is thus; The Symbols of our Lord's Body and Bloud are one thing before, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other after Conſecration; yet they continue ſo in their Nature, Subſtance, Figure, and Form, as to be ſeen and touch'd as before; but are underſtood to be what they are made by Conſecration, and are Believ'd, and are Ador'd as being the ſame thing they are believ'd, <hi>i. e.</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:102856:11"/>
they are chang'd, they appear to our Senſe (as to their Nature, Subſtance, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> to be ſeen and touch'd as before: but are believ'd to be ſomewhat elſe, <hi>i. e.</hi> what they are made: And this Belief is not Chimerical or Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary, but the things are really what they are believ'd to be, and for that they are ſo, are Ador'd; ſo that they muſt be really chang'd into Chriſt's Body, for elſe they could not be Ador'd without Idolatry: The very Words, as they lay, convinc'd the <hi>Magdeburgenſes,</hi> that <hi>Theodoret</hi> held <hi>Tranſubſtantiation;</hi> and, I ſuppoſe, had not theſe two Words <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Subſtance</hi> been in the Quotation but only <hi>Figure</hi> and <hi>Form,</hi> we had never heard of it at this time. If therefore I ſhew you, that <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Subſtance</hi> are frequently taken to ſignifie that which is as conſiſtent with our Expoſition, and the Catholic meaning of <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret,</hi> as <hi>Figure</hi> and <hi>Form</hi> in this place are, I ſhall not only make it ceaſe to be clear againſt us, but alſo ſhew that it will be clear for us. <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> do ſometimes ſignifie what the Philoſophers call properly <hi>Subſtance,</hi> as diſtinguſh'd from Accidents, <hi>i. e.</hi> Matter and Form. And thus taken it can be no Object of Senſe, can neither be ſeen nor touch'd. Sometimes it ſignifies the Properties, natural Qualities, and Accidents with which thoſe Subſtances are cloathed. Phyſicians frequently ſay, that they have the Subſtance of Herbs in their Medicins, when they have only the Vertue of thoſe Herbs, and not all the Matter and Form: So we ſay of Meat, that it has but little Juice or <hi>Subſtance,</hi> when it has but little Vertue or good natural Qualities. The Fathers ſay, that the <hi>Subſtance</hi> of Man was deprav'd by Original Sin, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Inclinations and natural Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, that by <hi>Nature</hi> we are the Children of Wrath, that the Gentiles by <hi>Nature</hi> perform the Law: In all which Speeches, and a hundred other, <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Subſtance</hi> do not ſignifie ſtrictly, as Philoſophers uſe
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:102856:11"/>
thoſe Words, when they are oppos'd to <hi>Accidents,</hi> but Popularly and Vulgarly, and ſignifie no more than Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, Conditions, Qualities, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now ſuppoſing <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret</hi> to take <hi>Subſtance</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi> in this place, in the latter Senſe, and to mean by them no more than the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior Subſtance,</hi> or viſible and ſenſible <hi>Qualities</hi> of Bread and Wine, the Text is evidently for us. And that the Father muſt take the Words in this popular Senſe, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from the whole Diſcourſe: For he ſays firſt, That before Conſecration they are <hi>one thing,</hi> and after Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration they are chang'd and made <hi>another thing:</hi> Now if they be chang'd and made another <hi>thing,</hi> the change muſt be either in the Interior or Exterior Subſtance; but it is moſt plain, they are not chang'd in the Exterior Subſtance, for as to that, they remain viſibly the ſame, and do not recede from their Nature, as Senſe aſſures us; <hi>Ergo,</hi> it muſt be in their Interior Subſtance, which is not liable to Senſe; and therefore, as the Father in this very place ſays, <hi>They are ſeen and touch'd as before, but are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd to be another thing,</hi> i. e. <hi>what they are made, and are ador'd as being what they are believ'd.</hi> The Doctor has told you in the late Book I mentioned, the danger of adoring any thing but God; therefore, according to him, this Father muſt hold theſe Symbols he here ſpeaks of, to be chang'd into the Body of our Lord, before they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Object of Adoration, or elſe he muſt be guilty of Idolatry, in teaching that ſomething beſides God ought to be Ador'd, <hi>i. e.</hi> Worſhip'd with Divine Honor. As to the place quoted out of <hi>Gelaſius,</hi> the ſame diſtinction above of the ſenſe of the Words, <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Subſtance,</hi> ſolves that; And that there muſt be ſuch a diſtinction in the Words of this Father, is moſt evident; for without that, he contradicts himſelf in the Words quoted; for he has two Words five times in ten lines; and if in all theſe Places they muſt ſignifie ſtrictly, the Father talks Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:102856:12"/>
and ſo, far enough from being a good Authority to juſtifie a Separation. But if the Words muſt be taken in divers Senſes, and it not being evident which Senſe is applicable to this or that place, then it is at leaſt uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and dark, and conſequently not fit (as not being ſo clear as it ſhould) to juſtifie a Separation. But if the Place it ſelf, from its own terms, diſpoſes us to apply the ſtrict Senſe in this or that Part, and the popular Senſe in this or that other, ſo as to countenance Tranſubſtantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then this Quotation will be very far from doing them any Service. Now let us conſider the Words: He ſays, <hi>By the Sacrament we are made Partakers of the Divine Nature, yet the Subſtance or Nature of Bread and Wine do not ceaſe to be.</hi> If <hi>Nature</hi> muſt be taken ſtrictly and philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally in both places, then we are made Partakers of the Divine Nature ſtrictly and philoſophically, and not only effectually or virtually: then the Divine Nature muſt be actually there, and yet the Nature of Bread and Wine will not ceaſe to be there; ſo that this perhaps thus far might favour Lutheraniſm, but can no way help the Church of <hi>England:</hi> Then follow theſe words, <hi>And ſurely the Image and Similitude of the Body and Blood of Chriſt are celebrated in the Action of thoſe Myſteries.</hi> We do own this Expreſſion, and do acknowledge it is frequent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Fathers to ſay, that the bleſſed Sacrament is a Figure of Chriſt's Paſſion, and that the Exterior Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, which we ſee, are a Figure to us of the Interior Subſtance of Chriſt's Body and Blood, which we ſee not, but are to believe to be contain'd under thoſe Species: Then he goes on and ſays, <hi>Therefore it appears evidently enough to us, that that is to be underſtood by us in our Lord Chriſt himſelf, which we profeſs in the Image of him,</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that <hi>Image</hi> is here us'd, as we ſaid above, <hi>We ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate and take them, and even as they paſs into this, to wit, the Divine Subſtance, by the Power of the Holy Spirit, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining</hi>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:102856:12"/>
                  <hi>notwithſtanding in the Property of their Nature,</hi> &amp;c. We ſpoke to the ſignification of the Word <hi>Nature</hi> above, ſpeaking to the foregoing Words of this Father: Now let us conſider the Word <hi>Subſtance,</hi> which the Proteſtants muſt have to ſignifie ſtrictly and philoſophically in the Words before, or elſe this Quotation proves nothing: But that being ſuppos'd, they muſt ſhew us, that it ſignifies o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therways in theſe laſt Words, <hi>They paſs into the Divine Subſtance,</hi> or elſe they muſt grant, that it ſignifies ſtrictly here alſo; and then it is Nonſenſe, for it amounts to thus much, The Elements of Bread and Wine paſs into <hi>the Divine Subſtance</hi> ſtrictly and philoſophically, and we are made partakers of the Divine Nature ſtrictly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet <hi>the Subſtance and Nature of Bread and Wine do not ceaſe to be ſtrictly and philoſophically.</hi> Can any Body un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand this? What does paſs into the Divine Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance? Nothing ſure, if the Nature and Subſtance of Bread and Wine taken ſtrictly and philoſophically do remain: But the Internal Subſtance of Bread and Wine may well paſs into the Divine Subſtance, and yet the Exterior Nature and Subſtance of Bread and Wine, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying the Properties and Accidents of Bread and Wine, may well remain. And that this muſt be the Senſe of the Father, is plain enough from his own words; for he ſays abſolutely, and without any limitation, <hi>That they paſs into the Divine Subſtance,</hi> which muſt be meant of the Interior Subſtance of Bread and Wine, if any; for 'tis clear, the Exterior remains, and does not paſs. But then again, he qualifies too the Nature, which he ſays remains, and calls it the <hi>Property of their Nature remaining:</hi> Which Expreſſion does, as we think, clear the diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and determins to which ſide the <hi>ſtrict,</hi> and to which the <hi>popular</hi> Senſe ought to be apply'd: At leaſt, we are ſure there can be no clear Evidence from hence againſt us, which yet we muſt have before we can be remov'd

               <p>The Expoſition now given, cannot be poſſibly the Fathers meaning, for that that Senſe would quite enervate the force of the Anſwer; for the Anſwer muſt be proper to the Argument, which it is intended to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, and to the Point which the Argument was made uſe of to prove: Now the Point to be prov'd was the Doctrin of the <hi>Eutychians,</hi> viz. <hi>That the Human Nature of Chriſt was chang'd into the Divine;</hi> to prove which, the <hi>Eutychians</hi> urg'd the change in the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> and from thence urg'd to the change of the <hi>Natures;</hi> to which the Father anſwer'd, that there was <hi>no change</hi> in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, nor <hi>no more</hi> change in the Natures, than there was in the other: This muſt needs be the meaning of the Father.</p>

And this being ſufficient to retort the <hi>Eutychian</hi>'s Argument upon himſelf, by ſhewing him there was not <hi>ſuch a change</hi> in the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> as he vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imagin'd in the <hi>Incarnation,</hi> it was all that was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary

               <p>I will, it is thus. <hi>Wavering I turn my ſelf to Chriſt, becauſe I ſeek him here, and I find how the Earth may be Ador'd without impiety; without impiety his Foot-ſtool may be Ador'd; For of Earth he took Earth, becauſe Fleſh is of Earth, and he took Fleſh of the Fleſh of the Virgin</hi> Mary; <hi>and becauſe he walked here in that Fleſh, and gave that Fleſh to us to Eat for our Salvation; but no Man Eats that Fleſh, unleſs he firſt Adores; we have found out how ſuch a Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtool of our Lord may be Ador'd, and not only not ſin by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doring, but we ſin by not Adoring,</hi> This is the Engliſh of the words quoted, which makes nothing againſt us, for we in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> do always Adore when we do receive.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cath.</speaker>
               <p>What do you Adore when you receive? Do you Adore that which you do receive? If you do, then that which you receive is the Fleſh of Chriſt, or you are Idolaters, as lately great pains has been taken to prove. If you do not Adore that which you receive, as the Object of your Adoration, but ſomething elſe, then you will find that St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> is againſt you, for that he Ador'd the <hi>Footſtool,</hi> that is, <hi>the Fleſh i. e.</hi>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:102856:14"/>
that Fleſh which is eaten; for it were impoſſible to think, that the Father could be in that <hi>doubt</hi> and <hi>trouble</hi> which he expreſſes, about the Queſtion, <hi>whether Chriſt were to be Ador'd or no?</hi> He is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd about the Footſtool, which he endeavors to make ſo plain, that he repeats the ſame thing over and over again, and tells his fear of Adoring or not Adoring: At length he ſays, By <hi>Footſtool,</hi> (becauſe Earth is the Footſtool) is meant <hi>Chriſts Fleſh,</hi> in which <hi>Fleſh</hi> he walk'd here, which very <hi>Fleſh</hi> he gave to us to Eat, which very Fleſh no Man Eats, but he firſt Adores, what? The Fleſh of Chriſt ſure: And if <hi>that Fleſh</hi> he gave to Eat, be the ſame <hi>Fleſh</hi> he took from our Bleſſed Lady, and in which he walk'd, as the Father ſays here moſt abſolutely, then ſurely <hi>Fleſh to be</hi> Eaten, is as much the Object of Adoration, as <hi>that</hi> he took and walked in, which I hope the Doctor will not deny, but was to be Ador'd. So that now, ſays the Father (having juſt before ſpoken of the Fleſh which Chriſt gave us to Eat, and which no Man Eats without firſt Adoring) <hi>I have found out how ſuch a Footſtool ought to be Ador'd, and that we do not only not ſin by Adoring, but we ſin by not Adoring ſuch a Footſtool,</hi> to wit, <hi>Fleſh,</hi> which was given us to Eat. Beſides the Adoration the Doctor ſpeaks of, may be given at any time, and before any thing, as well as <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> in the Sacrament; for if it be only the perſon of Chriſt ſitting in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which ought to be Ador'd, and is Ador'd when we are put in mind of him by ſuch Inſtruments; we might as well fall down and Adore the Perſon of Chriſt in Heaven, when we ſee an <hi>Image</hi> of him, becauſe that puts us in mind of him (which yet the above named Doctor ſays is Idolatry) or take a piece of <hi>common Bread</hi> at ones Houſe, remembring
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:102856:15"/>
by it what <hi>Chriſt</hi> once did with Bread, fall down and Adore before that Bread.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>When therefore Chriſt himſelf affirms and ſays of Bread,</hi> THIS IS MY BODY; <hi>Who afterwards will dare to doubt? And the ſame alſo confirming and ſaying,</hi> THIS IS MY BLOOD; <hi>Who, I ſay, may doubt and ſay, That it is not his Blood? He once chang'd Water into Wine, which is next to Blood, in</hi> Cana <hi>of</hi> Galilee, <hi>by his only Will; and ſhall he not be worthy that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him that he chang'd Wine into his Blood? For if being invited to a corporal Wedding, he wrought ſo won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful a Miracle, ſhall we not much more confeſs, that he gave his Body and Blood to the Sons of his own Spouſe? Wherefore let us take the Body and Blood of Chriſt with all aſſurance; for under the Species (or Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance) of Bread, the Body is given thee; and under the Species of Wine, the Blood is given: ſo that the Body</hi>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:102856:16"/>
                  <hi>and Blood of Chriſt being taken, thou art made to him a Fellow-partaker of his Body and Blood. We are made</hi> Chriſtophori, i. e. <hi>Bearers of Chriſt, when we take his Body and Blood into our Members. So as bleſſed St.</hi> Peter <hi>ſays, We are made Partakers of the Divine Nature,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Knowing this, and holding it for moſt certain, that the Bread which we ſee is not Bread, though our Taſt judges it to be Bread, but the Body of Chriſt: And the Wine which we ſee, though it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear Wine to our Senſe of Taſting; yet is not Wine, but the Blood of Chriſt.</hi> Doctor, Is this plain Engliſh, and is the Father faithfully Tranſlated?</p>

               <p>We do not deny, but the Fathers now cited, have the Words quoted in their Writings; nor do we deny but that they are well enough Engliſh'd: but we do confeſs all they ſay; for we of the Church of <hi>England</hi> do own and acknowledge a very great Change and Alteration in the Sacrament, and do not deny, but that the Fathers do frequently make mention of ſome wonderful Change; but we do not undertake to determin Magiſterially, and ſay what manner of Change this is, nor does our Church impoſe ſuch a Determination, as a necceſſary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Communion with us, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does; and ſuch a one as the Fathers contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, as we have ſhewn out of <hi>Theodoret</hi> and <hi>Gelaſius.</hi> And this very Father quoted here, <hi>viz.</hi> St. <hi>Cyril,</hi> calls it <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> at the ſame time that he calls it the <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood of Chriſt:</hi> For the firſt Words of his Quotation are, <hi>When Chriſt affirms of Bread,</hi> &amp;c. You muſt ſhew that the <hi>Subſtance</hi> of Bread ceaſes.</p>

               <p>The Evidence you pretend to from <hi>Theodoret</hi> and <hi>Gelaſius,</hi> we think we have ſpoke to ſufficiently already. If the Fathers do mention ſome wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Change in the Sacrament, and the Proteſtants do
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:102856:16"/>
agree with them in allowing that there is ſuch a Change, but cannot ſay what a one it is, what cauſe have they to ſeparate from a great Communion, even the whole viſible Catholic Church upon Earth; when, for ought they know, this <hi>Change</hi> which they grant, may be <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> which they deny, and make the Cauſe of their Separation, as being falſe? For they acknowledge they <hi>know not how</hi> it is chang'd, and in ſuch Caſes as this, I cannot imagine how they can attain a Negative Knowledge without a Poſitive, <hi>i. e.</hi> how they can be certain it is not <hi>Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> when the whole Catholic Church ſaid it was; and not to be able to know Certainly what it is; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when to believe right of this Point, is an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Faith, conditional of Man's Salvation; and therefore neceſſary to be believed in its true Senſe; eſpecially when the Conſequence of believing wrong will be <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> or <hi>Idolatry</hi> in the Practice. For if <hi>Tranſelementation</hi> in St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> and <hi>Tranſmuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> in St. <hi>Cyril,</hi> both which terms the Doctor owns and allows, ſhould mean as much as <hi>Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> then are the Proteſtants guilty of Hereſie, in believing the wrong ſide of a Propoſition, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in it an Article of Faith; and of <hi>Blaſphemy in practice,</hi> in robbing God of his Honor, and uſing him like a Creature. Now what ſhould make them think (for know, I am ſure they cannot) that <hi>Tranſelemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> ſignifies leſs than <hi>Tranſubſtantiation?</hi> For ſure by <hi>Elements</hi> are meant <hi>Subſtances.</hi> Moreover, in all Changes, there muſt a Term from which, and a Term to which. In this Change I deſire to know the Term from which, and to what it is chang'd: From <hi>Bread</hi> to <hi>Chriſt's Body,</hi> were an Anſwer intelligible, and agreeable to the Terms by which the Change is expreſs'd: But to ſay from Common Bread to San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:102856:17"/>
Bread, is to talk very unintelligibly, and very unanſwerably to the expreſſion you uſe to this Change; for this would not be at all <hi>wonderful.</hi> We ſee Churches and Church-yards thus chang'd every day, from <hi>Common</hi> to <hi>Conſecrated</hi> or <hi>Sanctified</hi> Places, and yet we think it no Wonder, or account it no Miracle; yet we ſhould wonder to hear one ſay, after conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crating a Church or a Churchyard, it were Tranſele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentated or chang'd wonderfully <hi>by the Word of God,</hi> as St. <hi>Gregory</hi> ſays; or <hi>By the power of the holy Spirit,</hi> as <hi>Gelaſius</hi> has it; or <hi>By the Omnipotency of God,</hi> as St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſays, and many other Fathers in ſuch like Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions. You ſay, you do <hi>not determin</hi> the Change, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the more to blame you. For if it be neceſſary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, to believe right in this Point, <hi>i. e.</hi> to believe that the Object preſent to you after Conſecration, is the Body of Chriſt, if it be ſo; and to believe it it is not, if it be not ſo; then ought you at leaſt to determin whether it be ſo or no, and make a firm Aſſent to that your Determination a neceſſary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Communion with you (a firm and actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Belief of one of theſe two Propoſitions, <hi>It is really the Body of Chriſt,</hi> or <hi>it is not,</hi> being a neceſſary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Mans Salvation.) For ſure you will hold, that that which is a neceſſary Condition of Salvation, ought to be made a neceſſary Condition of Communion; therefore if you do not determin at leaſt ſo far, as to ſay, <hi>It is,</hi> or <hi>it is not the Body of Chriſt,</hi> and require that this your Determination be believ'd as a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Communion with you, you do by the firſt, <hi>i. e.</hi> not <hi>determining,</hi> leave all People in your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in a very great uncertainty, as to the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Salvation: For how can private perſons have any kind of certainty in a diſputed Point, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome judicial Determination of that diſpute?
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:102856:17"/>
After which indeed, they may have Certainty, or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability anſwerable to the Authority of the Determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which will be infallible, if the Authority be infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible; or only a Probability; and that greater or leſs, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Degrees of Credit, which the Authority may challenge, if that Authority be but able to give a probable Determination. By the ſecond, <hi>viz.</hi> not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring the belief of your Determination, as a Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Communion, in caſe you do determin, you do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs that <hi>Heretics</hi> and <hi>Blaſphemers,</hi> or <hi>Heretics</hi> and <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters,</hi> may be of your Communion, tho' profeſſedly ſuch, <hi>i. e.</hi> you do allow your Communion to them who obſerve not the Condition of their Salvation. For if de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining it <hi>not to be the Body of Chriſt,</hi> you do not make the belief of this Determination, a Condition of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, you do allow thoſe that believe contradictori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>(i. e.</hi> that <hi>it is the Body Chriſt,</hi> and in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of that belief make it the formal Object of Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,) to be of your Communion; and yet if your De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination be true, theſe laſt, who believe and adore, as a aforeſaid, are <hi>Idolaters,</hi> and do break thereby the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of their Salvation. Now I leave to the judgment of the Company, whether this undetermined Doctrin of yours be a lawful cauſe for you to ſeparate from the Church you were once Members of, and was acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd the true Church, to believe you know not what your ſelves; for I am ſure you cannot determin what change it is.</p>
               <p>As to the Term <hi>Bread</hi> uſed by the Father, it can create no difficulty; for when we ſaid, as we did at firſt, that all Scripture was to be expounded Literally, if the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral Senſe did not imply a Contradiction; we did ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that in caſe it did imply a Contradiction, it ought to be expounded otherwiſe. Inſtance was given in this, <hi>I am a Vine:</hi> What we ſuppos'd of the Scripture, muſt
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:102856:18"/>
hold of all Speeches, if the literal Senſe implies a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, they muſt be expounded otherwiſe. Now mark the Father, he ſays, Chriſt affirming of Bread, <hi>this is my Body, &amp;c.</hi> This Bread is my Body is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, therefore Bread or Body muſt not be taken Literally. At the latter end of this Quotation, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſays, the <hi>Bread</hi> which we ſee is <hi>not Bread,</hi> but the Body of Chriſt; there cannot be a plainer Contradiction than <hi>is,</hi> and <hi>is not;</hi> therefore <hi>Bread</hi> the Subject in this Propoſition, of which ſo palpable a Contradiction is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated, muſt needs be under ſome other Signification beſides it's Literal one, becauſe this Predicate ſo pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily Negative, <hi>is not Bread,</hi> and ſo determin'd poſitively, <hi>but Chriſts Body,</hi> are ſo evident and plain, that they are not capable of being miſconſtrued, eſpecially being Predicates, which always limit and determin the Subject. So that <hi>Bread</hi> is ſo call'd, becauſe it once was Bread (as <hi>Moſes</hi> his Rod, tho' chang'd into a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, was notwithſtanding call'd a Rod, becauſe it had been ſo) and ſtill appears to the Senſes to be Bread, as the Father here tells us, with this Reduplication for fear of miſtake, <hi>yet it is not Bread.</hi> I cannot uſe plainer words to explicate the Father, than his own. He that can make Proteſtantiſm out of theſe Texts, may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound <hi>Bellarmin</hi> and the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> when they pleaſe, and make them <hi>Proteſtants</hi> too.</p>
               <p>As to your Demand, that we ſhould ſhew that the <hi>Subſtance</hi> of Bread ceaſes; I think you never need have it ſhewn plainer than in the words before you, which ſay, <hi>that that which ſeems Bread is not Bread;</hi> I ſuppoſe by <hi>Subſtance</hi> of Bread, you mean the <hi>Being</hi> of Bread; therefore the <hi>Being</hi> ceaſing, the <hi>Subſtance</hi> muſt ceaſe; but the <hi>Being</hi> ceaſes according to this Text; <hi>for that which was Bread is not Bread,</hi> therefore the Subſtance ceaſes, and there is a change, which you grant <hi>wonderful;</hi> and what
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:102856:18"/>
can this change be, but this Subſtance ceaſing to be is chang'd into another Subſtance, which we call Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation? And yet</p>

               <p>It was not ſo General, but that ſome oppos'd it, as the <hi>Waldenſes;</hi> but it is not ſtrange that an Error ſhould be general and long maintain'd; for the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſays, that the <hi>Greek Church</hi> err'd generally and long, in teaching that the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> proceeds not from the Son.</p>

living in the World take notice when this was done, nor upon what occaſion, or give it the leaſt Oppoſition, is a Miracle ten times greater (if there be any Degrees in Miracles) than this, which you cannot believe for its diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, <hi>viz. Tranſubſtantiation;</hi> eſpecially when we can ſhew in every Age, when any Oppoſition was made to this Doctrin, who they were that did it, and what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came of them. <hi>Berengarius</hi> was above a hundred years before the <hi>Lateran Council;</hi> yet we can ſhew that he was oppos'd by Biſhops and Fathers of almoſt all Countries, as by <hi>Lanfranck</hi> of <hi>Canterbury, Durandus Troaernenſis, Guitmundus,</hi> four Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> and by the Paſtors of all Countries, how he recanted three times, and how he died. <hi>Joannes Scotus Erigena,</hi> who lived about two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years before, and had laid ſome Grounds for <hi>Beren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garius</hi> his Error, was treated as an <hi>Innovator</hi> by <hi>Hincma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> and others, himſelf forced to retire out of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>his Book</hi> not heard of again till two hundred years after; and no Man living can tell us, when this abſurd Doctrin (as the Doctor calls it) which has had ſuch Succeſs in the World, as to obtain Belief univerſally, for ſeveral hundred years, ever had any Beginning, or any conſiderable Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. For though the Word <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> was not commonly us'd before the Council of <hi>Lateran,</hi> it matters not, nor makes any new Belief, ſince it has always been the conſtant practice of the Church in the General Councils, when it did condemn Heretical Opinions, or decide any Point in debate, to expound the true Senſe of Scripture, upon that very Point, by ſome very ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant Word, to leave no occaſion of Cavilling or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting upon its Deciſions, declaring by an explicit Act and poſitive Definition, what was the true Senſe of Soripture, and what implicitly all the whole Catholic Church did believe before, as it appears in ſeveral other Councils, as in that of <hi>Nice</hi> againſt the <hi>Arians,</hi> where the

               <p>Suppoſing, Sir, that the Roman Doctrin in this Point be falſe, and their practice <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and yet both were Univerſal for ſeveral Ages together, which way can the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> pretend to good and lawful Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation? for they pretend to none, but what they receiv'd from <hi>Idolaters, i. e.</hi> the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>

               <p>All Mortal Sins may not hinder a Biſhop from executing his Function, or giving good and lawful Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, yet ſome may: For if a Biſhop ſhould become a <hi>Jew,</hi> (and the ſame thing may be ſaid if he becomes an <hi>Idolater)</hi> you ſurely will not allow him to give good and lawful Chriſtian Ordination: For that which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys the Eſſence of a Church or a Chriſtian, muſt needs diſable thoſe it falls upon, from giving <hi>legal</hi> Commiſſions at leaſt, to others to govern the Church, or to adminiſter the Sacraments of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
