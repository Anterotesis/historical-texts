            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Religion of the Hypocritical Presbyterians.</head>
            <lg>
               <l>TEdious have been our Fasts, and long our Prayers;</l>
               <l>To keep the Sabbath such have been our cares,</l>
               <l>That <hi>Cisly</hi> durst not milk the gentle Mulls,</l>
               <l>To the great damage of my Lord Mayors Fooles,</l>
               <l>Which made the greazie Catch poles swear and curse</l>
               <l>The Holy-day for want o'th'second course;</l>
               <l>And men have lost their body's new adorning</l>
               <l>Because their cloathes could not come home that morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</l>
               <l>The sins of Parlament have long been bawl'd at,</l>
               <l>The vices of the City have been yawl'd at,</l>
               <l>Yet no amendment; Certainly, thought I,</l>
               <l>This is a Paradox beyond all cry.</l>
               <l>Why if you ask the people, very proudly</l>
               <l>They answer straight, That they are very godly.</l>
               <l>Nor could we lawfully suspect the Priest,</l>
               <l>Alas, for he cry'd out, <hi>I bring you Christ:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And trul' he spoke with so much confidence,</l>
               <l>That at that time it seem'd a good pretence:</l>
               <l>Then where's the fault? thought I: Well, I must know,</l>
               <l>So putting on clean cuffs, to Church I go.</l>
               <l>Now 'gan the Bells to jangle in the Steeple,</l>
               <l>And in a row to Church went all the People.</l>
               <l>First came poor Matrons stuck with Lice like Cloves,</l>
               <l>Devoutly come to worship their white loaves;</l>
               <l>And may be smelt above a German mile,</l>
               <l>Well, let them go to fume the Middle-Ile.</l>
               <l>But here's the sight that doth men good to see't,</l>
               <l>Grave Burghers, with their Posies, sweet, sweet, sweet,</l>
               <l>With their fat Wives. Then comes old <hi>Robin</hi> too,</l>
               <l>Who although write or read he neither do,</l>
               <l>Yet hath his Testament chain'd to his wast,</l>
               <l>And his blind zeal feels out the proofs as fast,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:104655:3"/>And makes as greasie Dogs-ears as the best.</l>
               <l>A new-shav'd Cobler follows him, as it hapt,</l>
               <l>With his young <hi>Cake-bread</hi> in his cloak close wrapt;</l>
               <l>Then panting comes his Wife from t'other end</l>
               <l>O'th' Town, to hear Our Father and see a friend;</l>
               <l>Then came the shops young fore-man, 'tis presum'd,</l>
               <l>With hair rose-water'd, and his gloves perfum'd,</l>
               <l>With his blew shoo-strings too, and besides that,</l>
               <l>A riband with a sentence in his hat:</l>
               <l>The Virgins too, the fair one, and the Gypsie,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Spectatum veniunt, venient spectentur ut ipsae.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And now the silk'n Dames throng in, good store,</l>
               <l>And casting up their noses, to th' pew dore</l>
               <l>They come, croud in, for though the pew be full</l>
               <l>They must and will have room, I, that they wull;</l>
               <l>Streight that she sits not uppermost distast</l>
               <l>One takes; 'Tis fine that I must be displac't</l>
               <l>By you, she cries then, Good Mistris Gill Flurt;</l>
               <l>Gill Flurt, enrag'd cries t'other, Why ye dirt-</l>
               <l>tie piece of Impudence, ye ill-bred Thief,</l>
               <l>I scorn your terms, good Mistris Thimble-mans wife.</l>
               <l>Marry come up, cries t'other, pray forbear,</l>
               <l>Surely your Husband's but a Scavenger,</l>
               <l>Cries t'other then, and what are you I pray?</l>
               <l>No Aldermans wife for all you are so gay.</l>
               <l>Is it not you that to all Christenings frisk it?</l>
               <l>And to save bread, most shamefully steal the bisket,</l>
               <l>At which the other mad beyond all law,</l>
               <l>Unsheaths her talons, and prepares to claw.</l>
               <l>And sure some gorgets had been torn that day,</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Now what a wardrobe could I put to view,</l>
               <l>The cloak-bag-breeches, and the sleek-stone shoe,</l>
               <l>The Gallimafry cloak that looks like nonsence,</l>
               <l>Now wide, now narrow, like his Master's conscience:</l>

               <l>Down comes the Priest, when a grave Brother meets him,</l>
               <l>And putting off his narrow-brim'd hat, thus greets him:</l>
               <l>Deare Sir, my Wife and I do you invite</l>
               <l>O'th' Creature with us to partake this night:<note place="margin">A great sign of grace.</note>

               <l>The City-dame, whose faith is in the belly</l>
               <l>Of her cramm' Priest, had all her cates in order,</l>

               <l>Then a Sur-loyne came in, as hot as fire,</l>
               <l>Yet not so hot as was the Priests desire.</l>
               <l>Next came a shoulder of Mutton rosted raw,</l>
               <l>To be as utterly abolisht as the Law.</l>
               <l>The next in order was a Capon plump,</l>

               <l>Then came a Turky cold, which in its life</l>
               <l>Had a fine tail, just like the Citizens wife.</l>
               <l>But now by'r leave and worship too, for hark ye,</l>

               <l>How he leans ore the cheer toward his first mover!</l>

               <l>This Pastie had Brethren too, like to the Mayors,</l>

               <l>And preach us down, Sub pondere crescit virtus.</l>
               <l>Apple-tarts, Fools, and strong cheese to keep down</l>
               <l>The steaming vapours from the Parsons crown.</l>
               <l>Canary too, and Claret eke also,</l>

               <l>Yet I was foolish, and would oft resist,</l>

               <l>Streight he reply'd, there is a time for all things,</l>

               <l>We eate him up. A Turkie's very gay,</l>
               <l>Like wordly people clad in fine array;</l>
               <l>Yet on the Spit it looks most piteous,</l>

               <l>Like Goths and Vandalls all Religion:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:104655:12"/>Every <hi>Mechanick</hi> either wanting stock</l>
               <l>Or wit to keep his trade must have a flock:</l>
               <l>The Spirit, cryes he, moveth me unto it,</l>
               <l>And what the Spirit bids, must I not do it?</l>
               <l>But having profited more than his flock by teaching,</l>
               <l>And stept into authority by preaching</l>
               <l>For a lay Office, leaves the Spirits motion</l>
               <l>And streight retreateth from his first devotion.</l>
               <l>But this he does in want, give him preferment,</l>
               <l>Off goes his gown, God's call is no determent.</l>
               <l>Vain foolish people, how are ye deceiv'd?</l>
               <l>How many several sorts have ye receiv'd</l>
               <l>Of things call'd truths, upon your backs lay'd on</l>
               <l>Like saddles for themselves to ride upon?</l>
               <l>They rid amain, and hell and <hi>Satan</hi> drove,</l>
               <l>While every Priest for his own profit strove.</l>
               <l>Can they the age thus torture with their lyes,</l>
               <l>Low'd bellowing to the world Impieties,</l>
               <l>Black as their coats, and such a silent fear</l>
               <l>Lock up the lips of men, and charm the ear?</l>
               <l>Had that same holy Israelite been dumb,</l>
               <l>That fatall day of old had never come</l>
               <l>To <hi>Baals</hi> Tribe, and thrice unhappy age</l>
               <l>While zeal and piety like mask'd in rage</l>
               <l>And vulgar ignorance. How we do wonder</l>
               <l>Once hearing, that the heavens were fir'd to thunder</l>
               <l>Against assailing Gyants, surely men,</l>
               <l>Men thought could not presume such violence then:</l>
               <l>But 'twas no Fable, or if then it were,</l>
               <l>Behold a sort of bolder mortals here,</l>
               <l>Those undermining shifts of knavish folly,</l>
               <l>Using alike to God and men most holy;</l>
               <l>Infidels who now seem to have found out</l>
               <l>A suttler way to bring their ends about</l>
               <l>Against the Deity then op'nly to fight</l>
               <l>By smooth insinuation and by slight:</l>
               <l>They close with God, seem to obey his Lawes,</l>
               <l>They cry alowd for him and for his cause.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:104655:13"/>But while they do their strict injunctious preach,</l>
               <l>Deny in actions what their words do teach.</l>
               <l>O what will men not dare, if thus they dare</l>
               <l>Be impudent with Heaven, and play with Prayer!</l>
               <l>Yet if they can no better teach than thus,</l>
               <l>Would they would onely teach themselves, not us:</l>
               <l>So while they still on empty out-sides dwell,</l>
               <l>They may perhaps be choakt with husk and shell;</l>
