            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>You shal haue but two parts out of these <note place="margin">Diuision.</note> words; And to make these two parts, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the Text, as the two <hi>Hemispheres</hi> of the world, laid open in a flat, in a plaine Map. All those parts of the world, which the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients haue vsed to consider, are in one of those <hi>Hemispheres;</hi> All <hi>Europe</hi> is in that, and in that is all <hi>Asia,</hi> and <hi>Afrike</hi> too: So that when we haue seene that <hi>Hemisphere,</hi> done with that, we might seeme to haue seene all, done with all the world; but yet the other <hi>Hemisphere,</hi> that of <hi>America</hi> is as big as it; though, but by occasion of new, and late discoueries, we had had nothing to say of <hi>America.</hi> So the first part of our Text, will bee as that first <hi>Hemisphere;</hi> all which the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:23801:6"/>
ancient Expositors found occasion to note out of these words, will be in that: but by the new discoueries of some humors of men, and rumors of men, we shall haue oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to say somewhat of a second part to. The parts are, first, the Literall, the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall sense of the words; And then an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mergent, a collaterall, an occasionall sense of them. The <hi>explication</hi> of the wordes, and the <hi>Application, Quid tunc, Quid nunc,</hi> How the words were spoken then, How they may be applied now, will be our two parts. And, in passing through our first, wee shall make these steps. First, God can, and sometimes doth effect his purposes by himselfe; intirely, immediatly, extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily, miraculously by himselfe: But yet, in a second place, we shall see, by this story, That he lookes for assistance, for concurrence of second causes, and subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate meanes: And that therefore, <hi>God</hi> in this Song of <hi>Deborah,</hi> hath prouided an honourable commemoration of them, who did assist his cause; for, the Princes haue their place, <hi>The Princes of Issachar were</hi>

            <p>And into those I passe with this protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Part</hi> 1.</note> That in all which I shall say this day, beeing to speake often of <hi>God,</hi> in that <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> as he is <hi>Lord of Hostes,</hi> and fights his owne battailes, I am farre from giuing fire to them that desire warre. <hi>Peace</hi> in this world, is a pretious <hi>Earnest,</hi> and a faire and louely <hi>Type</hi> of the euerlasting peace of the world to come: And warre in this world, is a shrewd and fearefull <hi>Embleme</hi> of the euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:23801:7"/>
discord and tumult, and torment of the world to come; And therefore, our <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed God,</hi> blesse vs with this externall, and this internall, and make that lead vs to an eternall peace. But I speake of this subiect, especially to establish and settle them, that suspect Gods power, or Gods purpose, to succour those, who in forraine parts, grone vnder heauie pressures in matter of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> or to restore those, who in forraine parts, are deuested of their lawfull posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, and inheritance; and because <hi>God</hi> hath not done these great workes yet, nor yet raised vp meanes, in apparance, and in their apprehension, likely to effect it, That therefore <hi>God</hi> likes not the cause; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they begin to bee shaked in their owne Religion at home, since they thinke that God neglects it abroad. But, beloued, since God made all this world of nothing, cannot hee recouer any one peece thereof, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store any one peece, with a little? In the Creation, his production of specifique formes, and seuerall Creatures in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall dayes, was much, very much; but not very much, compared with that, which
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:23801:8"/>
he had done immediatly before, when he made Heauen and Earth of nothing. For, for the particular Creatures, God had then <hi>Praeiacentem Materiam,</hi> he had stuffe before him; enough to cut out Creatures of the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest sise, his <hi>Elephants</hi> of the Earth, his <hi>Whales</hi> and <hi>Leuiathans</hi> in the Sea. In that matter there was <hi>Semen Creaturarum,</hi> The Seed of all Creatures in that stuffe. But for the stuffe it selfe, the Heauen and Earth, God had not <hi>Semen Coeli,</hi> any such seed of Heauen as that he could say to it, doe thou hatch a Heauen; he had not any such <hi>Semen terrae,</hi> as that hee could bid that grow vp into an Earth: There was nothing at all, and all, that is, was produced from that; and then who shall doubt of his proceeding, if by a little he will doe much? He suffered his greater works to be paraleld, or to be counterfeit by <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raohs Magicians,</hi> but in his least, in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Lice, hee brought them to confesse <hi>Digitum Dei,</hi> the finger of God; and that was enough; The arme of God, the hand of God needs not; where he will worke, his finger is enough, It was not that imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that dreame of the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> that hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:23801:8"/>
the <hi>Magicians,</hi> who say, that the <hi>Deuill</hi> cannot make any Creature, lesse then a Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley corne; As it is with men, they miscon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it to be with the <hi>Deuill</hi> too; harder to make a little clocke, a little picture, any thing in a little, then in a larger forme. That was no part of the reason in that case: but since man ordinarily esteemes it so, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily admires great workes in little forme, why will he not be content to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie <hi>God</hi> that way, in a faithfull confidence, that hee can and will doe great workes by weake meanes. Should God haue stayd to leuie, and arme, and traine, and muster, and present men enow to discomfit <hi>Sennache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rib?</hi> Hee tooke a neerer way; he flew al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most two hundreth thousand of them, in one night by an <hi>Angell.</hi> Should God haue <note place="margin">

He troubled not so much as a cloud, he imployed no Creature at all, against the <hi>Philistines,</hi> when they came vp with thirty thousand <hi>Chariots;</hi> but hee <note place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 23 5</note>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:23801:9"/>
breathed a dampe, an astonishment into them, he imprinted a diuine terror in their hearts, and they fought against one another. <note place="margin">

               <hi>God</hi> fore saw a diminution of his honour, in the augmentation of <hi>Israels</hi> forces, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he reduced <hi>Gideons</hi> thirty two thousand to three hundred persons. It was so in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, God does much with few, and it was so in time, God does much, though late; though God seeme a long time to haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got his people, yet in due time, that is, in his time, he returnes to them againe. S. <hi>Augustine</hi> makes a vse ull Historicall note, That that land to which <hi>God</hi> brought the <hi>Children</hi> of <hi>Israel,</hi> was their owne land before; they were the right heires to it, lineally descended from him, who was the first possessor of it, after the floud: but they were so long out of pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of it, as that they were neuer able to set their title on foot; nay, they did scarce know their own title, and yet <hi>God</hi> repossessed them of it, reinuested them in it. It is so for <hi>persons,</hi> and <hi>times</hi> in his wayes in this world, Much with few, much though late, and it is so in his wayes to the next world too: for <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, Elias</hi> knew of no more but himselfe,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:23801:9"/>
that serued the right <hi>God</hi> aright: <hi>God</hi> makes him know that there were seuen thousand more, seuen thousand was much to one, but it was little to all the world: and yet these se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen thousand haue peopled heauen, and sent vp all those <hi>Colonies</hi> thither; all those <hi>Armies</hi> of <hi>Martyrs,</hi> those flockes of <hi>Lambes,</hi> inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent children, those <hi>Fathers,</hi> the Fathers of the Church, and <hi>Mothers,</hi> holy Matrons, and daughters, blessed <hi>Virgines,</hi> and learned and laborious <hi>Doctors;</hi> these seuen thousand haue filled vp the places of the fallen <hi>Angels,</hi> and repeopled that Kingdome: And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer we thinke them most worne out, <hi>God</hi> at this time hath his remnant (as the <hi>Apostle</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.5.</note> sayes) and <hi>God</hi> is able to make vp the whole garment of that remnant. So he does much with few, in the wayes to heauen; and that he does much though late, in that way too, thou mayest discerne in his working vpon thy selfe. How often hast thou suffered thy <hi>Soule,</hi> to grow cleane out of all reparations into ruine, by thine inconsiderate and habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall course of sinne, and neuer repaired it by any good vse of hearing the word, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing the <hi>Sacrament</hi> in a long time, and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:23801:10"/>
when thou hast at any time, come to a sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uey of thy conscience, how hast thou beene affected with an inordinate apprehension of <hi>Gods</hi> anger, and his inaccessiblenesse, his inexorablenesse towards thee, and sunke e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen into the iawes of desperation; And yet, <hi>Quia manet semen dei,</hi> because the seed of <hi>God</hi> hath remained in thee, <hi>Incubat Spiritus,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1. <hi>10.</hi> 3.4.</note> the Holy Ghost hath sat vpon that seed, and hatched a new Creature in thee, a modest, but yet infallible assurance of the Mercy of thy God. Recollect all; in raysing of sieges, and discomfiting of Armies, in restoring possessions, and reinuesting right heires, in repairing the ruines of the Kingdome of heauen, depopulated in the fall of <hi>Angels,</hi> in reestablishing peace of conscience; in a presumptuous confidence, or ouer-timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous diffidence in <hi>God, God</hi> glorifies him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe that way, to doe much with little.</p>
            <p>He does so; but yet hee will haue some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. <hi>God</hi> is a good <hi>Husband,</hi> a good <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> of Mans contributions, but contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he will haue: hee will haue a concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, a cooperation of <hi>persons.</hi> Euen in that great worke, which wee spake of at first,

Hee would haue a remnant of <hi>Gedeons Armie</hi> to fight his bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes: A remnant of <hi>Israels beleeuers</hi> to make vp his Kingdome; A remnant of thy <hi>Soule,</hi> his seed wrapd vp somewhere, to saue thy <hi>Soule;</hi> And a remnant of thy selfe, of thy <hi>Mind,</hi> of thy <hi>Purse,</hi> of thy <hi>Person,</hi> for thy temporall deliuerance. <hi>God</hi> goes lowe, and accepts small Sacrifices; a Pigeon, a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of Flower, a few eares of Corne; but a Sacrifice he will haue. The <hi>Christian Church</hi> implies a shrewd distresse, when shee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uides that reason, that clause in her prayer, <hi>Quia non est alius, Giue Peace in our time, O</hi>

               <hi>Lord, because there is no other that fighteth for vs:</hi> If the bowels of compassion bee eaten out, if the band of the Communion of Saints be dissolued, we fight for none, none fights for vs, at last neyther we nor they shall fight for <hi>Christ,</hi> nor <hi>Christ</hi> for them nor vs, but all become a prey to the generall enemie of the name of <hi>Christ;</hi> for <hi>God</hi> requires something, some assistance, some concurrence, some co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operation, though <hi>he can fight from heauen, and the Starres, in their order, can fight against Sisera.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore, though God giue <hi>his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> to none, <hi>his glorie,</hi> that is to doe all with <hi>Nothing,</hi> yet he giues them <hi>their glorie,</hi> that doe any thing for him, or for themselues. And as hee hath laid vp a record, for their glorie and Memoriall, who were remarke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for Faith (for the eleuenth <hi>Chapter</hi> to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> is a <hi>Catalogue</hi> of them.) So in this Song of <hi>Deborah</hi> and <hi>Barake,</hi> hee hath laide vp a Record for their glorie, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed their faith in <hi>Workes,</hi> and assisted his seruice.

            <p>In the fifteenth verse, <hi>Princes</hi> haue their place; <hi>The Princes of Issachar, were with Debo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah</hi> when the <hi>King</hi> goes to the field, Many, who are in other cases Priuiledged, are by their Tenures bound to goe. It is a high <hi>Tenure</hi> to hold by a <hi>Crowne;</hi> And when <hi>God,</hi> of whome, and whome onely they hold, that hold so, goes into the field, it becomes them to goe with him. But as <hi>God</hi> sits in <hi>Heauen,</hi> and yet goes into the field, so they of whome <hi>God</hi> hath said, <hi>Yee are Gods,</hi> the <hi>Kings</hi> of the Earth, may stay at home, and

yet goe too. They goe in their assistance to the <hi>Warre;</hi> They goe in their Mediation for <hi>Peace;</hi> They goe in their <hi>Example,</hi> when from their sweetnesse, and moderation in their Gouernement at home, their flowes out an instruction, a perswasion to Princes abroad. <hi>Kings</hi> goe many times, and are not thanked, because their wayes are not seene: and <hi>Christ</hi> himselfe would not alwayes bee seene; In the eight of <hi>Iohn,</hi> he would not be seene. When they tooke vp stones to stone him, he withdrew himselfe inuisibly, hee would not be seene: When <hi>Princes</hi> find that open actions exasperate, they doe best, if they be not seene. In the sixth of <hi>Iohn, Christ</hi> would not bee seene. When they would haue put vpon him, that which was not fit for him to take, when they would haue made him <hi>King,</hi> he withdrew himselfe, and was not seene.

            <p>And in the ninth verse, the <hi>Gouernors, the great Officers,</hi> haue their place, in this praise, <hi>My heart is towards the Gouernors of Israel that offered themselues willingly.</hi> It is not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in person; Great <hi>Officers</hi> cannot doe so; They are <hi>Intelligences</hi> that moue great <hi>Spheares,</hi> but they must not bee mou'd out of them.

            <p>The <hi>Merchants</hi> haue their place in that verse too.

the <hi>Text,</hi> but does not tell vs who; least men should direct their thankes for that which is past, or their prayers for future benefits, to any other, euen in heauen, then to <hi>God</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. The stars are nam'd; It could not be feared that Men would pray to them, sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to them, <hi>Angels &amp; Saints</hi> are not named; Men might come to ascribe to them, that which appertained to <hi>God</hi> onely. Now these <hi>Stars,</hi> sayes the text, <hi>fought in their courses, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nentes in Ordine,</hi> they fought not disorderly.

It was no disorderly Enchantment, nor it was no <hi>Miracle,</hi> that disordered these Starres; as in <hi>Iosuahs</hi> time, the <hi>Sunne</hi> and <hi>Moone</hi> were disordred in their Motions; But as <hi>Iosephus,</hi> who relates this battaile more particularly, sayes, with whom all agree, <hi>The naturall Influence of these heauenly bodies, at this time, had created and gathered such stormes and hayles, as blowing vehemently in the Enemies face, was the cause of this defeate:</hi> for so wee

And thirdly, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this War, he hath made <hi>Preachers Stars;</hi> and <hi>vae simon, woe be vnto them, if they doe not fight, if they doe not preach:</hi> But yet in the last place, they must fight, as the Stars in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen doe, <hi>In their order,</hi> in that Order, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to those directions, which, they, to whom it appertaines, shall giue them: for that is <hi>to fight in Order.</hi> And in these foure branches, wee shall determine this second part.</p>
            <p>First then we are in Contemplation of <hi>a Spirituall warre;</hi> now, though there be a

Let no man seuer those whom God hath ioyned,</hi> but let no Man ioyne those whom <hi>God</hi> hath seuered neyther, and <hi>God</hi> hath seuered <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>Belial:</hi> and that was <hi>Gods</hi> action, <hi>Ponam inimicitias;</hi> The Seed of the woman, and the Seed of the Serpent, wee and the Deuill, should neuer haue fallen out; wee agree but too well; but God hath put an enmity betweene vs. God hath put <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Falshood, Jdolatrie</hi> and <hi>Sinceritie</hi> so farre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunder, and infused such an incompatibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and imprinted such an implacabilitie betweene them, as that they cannot flow into one another: And therefore, there, <hi>Maledicti Pacifici,</hi> It is an opposition against God, by any colourable Modifications, to reconcile opinions diametrally contrary to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:23801:19"/>
one another, in fundamentall things. <hi>Day</hi> and <hi>Night</hi> may ioyne and meet. <hi>In Diluculis</hi> and in <hi>Crepusculis,</hi> The dawning of the day, in the Morning, and the shutting in of the day in the Euening, make day and night so much one, as sometimes you cannot tell which to call them: but <hi>Lux &amp; tenebrae,</hi> light and darknes, <hi>Midnight</hi> and <hi>Noone</hi> neuer met, neuer ioynd. There are points, which passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men, and vehemence of disputation, haue carried farther a sunder then needed: and these indeed haue made the greatest noyse; because vpon these, for the most part, depends the matter of profit: and <hi>Beati paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fici,</hi> blessed were that labour, and that labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, that could reconcile those things; and of that there might bee hope, because it is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten but the Persons that fight, it is not the thing, the matters are not so different. But then there are matters so different, as that a Man may sit at home, and weepe, and wish, prayse God that hee is in the right, and pray to God for them that are in the wrong, but to thinke that they are indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, and <hi>all one, Maledicti Pacifici,</hi> hee that hath brought such a Peace, hath
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:23801:19"/>
brought a curse vpon his owne Conscience, and laid, not a <hi>Satisfastion,</hi> but a <hi>Stupefaction</hi> vpon it. A <hi>Turke</hi> might perchance say, in scorne of vs both, They call you <hi>Heretiques,</hi> you call them <hi>Idolaters,</hi> why might not <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters,</hi> and <hi>Heretiques</hi> agree well enough to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether? But a true <hi>Christian</hi> will neuer make <hi>Contrarieties in fundamentall things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different,</hi> neuer make foundations, and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peredifications, the Word of <hi>God,</hi> and the Traditions of men, all one. Euery man is a little world, sayes the <hi>Philosopher;</hi> Euery man is a little <hi>Church</hi> too; and in euery man there are two sides, two armies: the flesh fights against the Spirit. This is but a <hi>Ciuill warre,</hi> nay it is but a <hi>Rebellion</hi> indeed; and yet it can neuer be absolutely quenched. So euery man is also a Souldier in that great and generall warre, betweene <hi>Christ,</hi> and <hi>Beliall,</hi> the Word of <hi>God,</hi> and the will of man. Euery man is bound to hearken to a peace, in such things as may admit peace, in differences, where men differ from men; but bound also to shut himselfe vp against all ouertures of peace, in such things, as are in their Nature irreconcileable, in differences
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:23801:20"/>
where men differ from <hi>God.</hi> That warre <hi>God</hi> hath kindled, and that warre must bee maintain'd, and maintain'd by his way; and his way, and his <hi>Ordinance</hi> in this warre, is Preaching.</p>
            <p>If <hi>God</hi> had not said to <hi>Noah, Fac tibi Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cam;</hi> and when he had said so, if he had not giuen him a <hi>Deseigne,</hi> a <hi>Modell,</hi> a <hi>Platforme</hi> of that <hi>Arke,</hi> we may doubt credibly, whether euer man would haue thought of a <hi>Ship,</hi> or of any such way of trade &amp; Commerce. Shipping was Gods owne Inuention, and therein <hi>Laetentur Insulae,</hi> as <hi>Dauid</hi> sayes, <hi>Let the Ilands reioyce.</hi> So also, if <hi>Christ</hi> had not said to his <hi>Apostles, Ite praedicate, Goe and preach:</hi> And when he had said so, said thus much more, <hi>Qui non crediderit damnabitur, Hee that beleeues not your Preaching, shall be damned:</hi> certainly man would neuer haue thought of such a way of establishing a kingdome, as by Preaching. No other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had any such Institution, as Preaching. In the <hi>Romane</hi> State, there was a publique Officer, <hi>Conditor Precum,</hi> who vpon great emergent occasions, deprecations of immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent dangers, or Gratulations for euident
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:23801:20"/>
benefites, did make particular <hi>Collects</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to those occasions: And some such occasionall <hi>Panegyriques,</hi> and gratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latory Orations for temporall benefites, they had in that <hi>State.</hi> But a fixt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant course of conteining Subiects in their Religious and Ciuill duties, by preaching, onely <hi>God</hi> ordain'd, onely his Children en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy'd. <hi>Christ</hi> when he sent his <hi>Apostles,</hi> did not giue them a particular command, <hi>Ite o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,</hi> goe and pray in the publique Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation; All Nations were accustomed to that; <hi>Christ</hi> made no doubt of any mans opposing, or questioning Publique Prayer; and therefore for that, he onely said, <hi>Sic ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitis,</hi> Not goe, and pray, but, <hi>when you pray, pray thus,</hi> hee instructed them in the forme; the dutie was well knowne to all before. But, for Preaching, He himselfe was anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for that, <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is vpon me,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Esa. 61.1</note> 
               <hi>because the Lord hath anoynted mee to preach:</hi> His vnction was his function.

there) <hi>Goe yee, and preach:</hi> Because I haue all <note place="margin">Math. 28 19.</note> power, for preaching, take yee part of my power, and preach too. For, Preaching is <hi>the power of God vnto Saluation, and the sauour of life vnto life.</hi> When therefore the <hi>Apostle</hi> sayes, <hi>Quench not the Spirit, Nec in te, nec in alio,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Thes. 5. 19.</note> sayes <hi>Aquinas;</hi> Quench it not in your selfe, by forbearing to heare the Word preached; quench it not in others, by discouraging them that doe preach. For so Saint <hi>Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome,</hi> (and not hee alone) vnderstood that place, <hi>That they quench the spirit, who discounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance preaching, and dishearten Preachers.</hi> Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> took his example from the <hi>lampe</hi> that burnt by him, when he was preaching; (It seemes therefore hee did preach in the afternoone) and he sayes, <hi>You may quench this Lampe, by putting in water, and you may quench it by taking out the oyle.</hi> So a man may quench the spirit in himselfe, if he smoother it, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>focate it with worldly pleasures, or profits, and he may quench it in others, if he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw that fauour, or that help, which keeps that Man, who hath the spirit of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, the Vnction of Preaching, in a cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full discharge of his dutie. Preaching then
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:23801:21"/>
being <hi>Gods Ordinance</hi> to beget Faith, to take away preaching, were to disarme <hi>God,</hi> and to quench the spirit; for by that <hi>Ordinance he fights from heauen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to maintaine that fight, he hath made his <hi>Ministers Starres;</hi> as they are called in the first of the <hi>Reuelation.</hi> And they fight against <hi>Sisera,</hi> that is, they preach against <hi>Error.</hi> They preach out of Necessitie; <hi>Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie is laid vpon me to preach,</hi> sayes the <hi>Apostle,</hi>

vpon the <hi>Psalm: Qui habitat.</hi> Now, though I preached but lately before; and now, though I had but late warning to preach now; So St. <hi>Basil</hi> preached his 2. <hi>Sermon</hi> vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Hexameron,</hi> the sixe dayes worke, when hee had but that Morning for Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: and more then so, in his 2. <hi>Sermon de Baptissimo;</hi> for, it seemes he preached that without any premeditation, <hi>Prout suggerit Spiritus sanctus.</hi> Now, though I had not time to labour a <hi>Sermon;</hi> and now, though I preach in <hi>anothers mans place;</hi> for so <hi>Saint Augustine</hi> preached his <hi>Sermon</hi> vpon the 95. <hi>Psalme:</hi> where he saies, <hi>Frater noster Seuerus, Our brother Seuerus should by promise haue prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched heere, but since he comes not, I will.</hi> Now, that is, whensoeuer Gods good people may be edified by my preaching: <hi>Vae si non,</hi> woe be vnto me, if I doe not preach. <hi>The Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon drew a third part of the Stars from heauen.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>In this phrase, as we told you before, out of <hi>Aquinas,</hi> the same thing is intended, as in that place of Saint <hi>Paul, Let all things bee done decently, and in Order.</hi> That the <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat Edition</hi> reades, <hi>Fiant honeste;</hi> and then sayes Saint <hi>Ambrose, Honeste fit, quod cum pace fit, That is done honestly, and decently, which is done quietly, and peaceably.</hi> Not with a peace, and indifferencie to contrary Opinions in fundamentall Doctrines, not to shuffle Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions together, and make it all one which you chuse, but a peace with persons, an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinence from contumelies, and reuilings. It is true that wee must hate Gods enemies with <hi>a perfect hatred,</hi> and it is true that <hi>Saint Chrysostome</hi> sayes, <hi>Odium perfectum est, odium consummatissimum,</hi> that is not a perfect ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, that leaues out any of their Errors vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hated.

But yet a perfect hatred is that too, which may consist with perfection, and Charitie is perfection: a perfect hatred is that which a perfect, that is, a charitable man may beare, which is still to hate <hi>Errors,</hi> not <hi>Persons.</hi> When their insolencies pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke vs to speake of them, we shall doe no good therein, if therein we proceed not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently, and in order. <hi>Christ</hi> sayes of his <hi>Church: Terribilis vt Castrorum acies, It is po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfull</hi>

in our <hi>Clergie,</hi> and other graue and reuerend <hi>Prelates</hi> of this <hi>Church;</hi> they presented it to him, and thereupon hee entred into the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie.

Amongst them, his 70. <hi>Capitularie</hi> is appliable to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent case; there hee sayes, <hi>Episcopi videant, That the Bishops take care, that all Preachers preach to the people the Exposition of the Lordes Prayer:</hi> and he enioynes them too, <hi>Ne quid nouum, ne quid non Canonicum, That no man preach any new opinion of his owne;</hi> nay, though it bee the opinion of other learned men in other places, yet if it be <hi>Non Canonicum,</hi> not declared in the <hi>Vniuersall Church,</hi> not decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in <hi>that Church,</hi> in which he hath his stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he may not preach it to the people: And so he proceeds there to <hi>Catechistical Doctrine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That is not new then, which the <hi>Kings of Iudah</hi> did, and which the <hi>Christian Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours</hi> did. But it is new to vs, if the <hi>Kings</hi> of this kingdome haue not done it. Haue
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:23801:26"/>
they not done it? How little the <hi>Kings</hi> of this kingdome did in <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> causes then, when by their conniuence that power was deuold into a forraine Prelates hand, it is pitie to consider, pitie to remember, pitie to bring into Con emplation; And yet tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly euen then our Kings did exercise more of that power, then our aduersaries who op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it, will confesse. But, since the true iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction was vindicated, and reapplyed to the Crowne, in what iust height <hi>Henrie the eight,</hi> and those who gouerned his Sonnes minoritie, <hi>Edward the sixt,</hi> exercised that iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction in <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> causes, none, that knowes their Story, knowes not. And, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause ordinarily, wee settle our selues best in the Actions, and Precedents of the late <hi>Queene</hi> of blessed and euerlasting memory, I may haue leaue to remember them that know; and to tell them that know not, one act of her power and her wisedome, to this purpose. When some <hi>Articles</hi> concerning the falling away from iustifying grace, and other poynts that beat vpon that haunt, had been ventilated, in Conuenticle, and in Pulpits too, and Preaching on both sides
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:23801:27"/>
past, and that some persons of great place and estimation in our <hi>Church,</hi> together with him who was the greatest of all, amongst our Clergy, had vpon mature deliberation established a resolution what should bee thought, and taught, held and preached in those poynts, and had thereupon sent down that resolution to be published in the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie, not vulgarly neither, to the people, but in a Sermon, <hi>Ad Clerum</hi> onely, yet her <hi>Maiestie</hi> being informed thereof, declared her displeasure so, as that, scarce any houres before the Sermon was to haue been, there was a Countermaund, an Inhibition to the Preacher for medling with any of those poynts. Not that her <hi>Maiestie</hi> made her selfe <hi>Iudge of the Doctrines,</hi> but that nothing, not formerly declared to be so, ought to bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be the <hi>Tenet,</hi> and Doctrine of this Church, her <hi>Maiestie</hi> not being acquainted, nor suplicated to giue her gracious allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for the publication thereof.</p>
            <p>His sacred <hi>Maiestie</hi> then, is herein vpon the steps of the <hi>Kings of Iudah,</hi> of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Emperors,</hi> of the <hi>Kings of England,</hi> of all the <hi>Kings of England,</hi> that embraced the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:23801:27"/>
Reformation, of <hi>Queene Elizabeth</hi> her selfe; and he is vpon <hi>his owne</hi> steps too. For, it is a seditious calumny to apply this which is done now, to any occasion that rises but now: as though the <hi>King</hi> had done this, now, for satisfaction of any persons at this time. For some yeares since, when he was pleased to call the <hi>Heads of Houses</hi> from the Vniuersity, and intimate to them the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences that arose from the Preaching of such men, as were not at all conuersant in the <hi>Fathers,</hi> in the <hi>Schoole,</hi> nor in the <hi>Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall Storie,</hi> but had shut vp themselues in a few later <hi>Writers;</hi> and gaue order to those <hi>Gouernours</hi> for remedy herein, Then he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, then he laid the foundation for that, in which hee hath proceeded thus much fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther now, to reduce Preaching neerer to the manner of those Primitiue times, when <hi>God</hi> gaue so euident, and so remarkable blessings to mens Preaching.</p>
            <p>Consider more particularly that which he hath done now; His <hi>Maiestie</hi> hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied his most gracious Letter to the <hi>most Reuerend Father in God, my Lords Grace of Canterbury,</hi> with certaine <hi>Directions</hi> how
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:23801:28"/>
Preachers ought to behaue themselues in the exercise of <hi>that part</hi> of their Ministerie. These being deriued from his <hi>Grace,</hi> in due course to his <hi>reuerend Brethren,</hi> the other <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,</hi> our <hi>worthy Diocesan,</hi> euer vigilant for the Peace and vnitie of the <hi>Church,</hi> gaue a speedy, very speedy intimation thereof, to the <hi>Clergie</hi> of his Iurisdiction; so did others, to whom it appertain'd so to doe in theirs. Since that, his <hi>Maiestie</hi> who alwayes taking good workes in hand, loues to perfect his owne works, hath vouchsafed to giue some <hi>Reasons</hi> of this his proceeding; which being signified by him to whom the <hi>State</hi> and <hi>Church</hi> owes much, <hi>The right Reuerend Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in God, the Bishop of Lincolne, Lord Kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the great Seale,</hi> and after by him also, who began at first, his <hi>Maiesties</hi> pleasure ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing thereby, (as he is too <hi>Great,</hi> and too <hi>Good</hi> a <hi>King</hi> to seeke corners, or disguises, for his actions) that these proceedings should be made publique, I was not willing only, but glad to haue my part therein, that as, in the seare of God, I haue alwaies preached to you the <hi>Gospell of Christ Iesus,</hi> who is the <hi>God</hi> of your Saluation; So in the testimony
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:23801:28"/>
of a good Conscience, I might now preach to you, <hi>the Gospel of the Holy ghost,</hi> who is the <hi>God of peace,</hi> of vnitie, and concord.</p>
            <p>These <hi>Directions</hi> then, and the <hi>Reasons</hi> of them, by his <hi>Maiesties</hi> particular care, euery man in the Ministery may see &amp; write out, in the seuerall <hi>Registers Offices,</hi> with his owne hand for nothing, and for very little, if hee vse the hand of another. Perchance you haue, at your conuenience, you may see them. When you do, you shall see, That his <hi>Maiesties</hi> generall intention therein is, to put a difference, between graue, and solid, from light and humerous preaching. <hi>Origen</hi> does so, when vpon the <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> he sayes, <hi>There is a great difference, Inter praedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>care, &amp; docere:</hi> A man may teach an Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, that is, make them know something that they knew not before, and yet not Preach; for Preaching is to make them knowthings appertaining to their saluation. But when men doe neither, neither Teach, nor Preach, but (as his <hi>Maiestie</hi> obserues the manner to bee) <hi>To soare in poynts too deepe, To muster vp their owne Reading, To display their owne Wit, or Ignorance in medling with Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill</hi>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:23801:29"/>
               <hi>matters,</hi> or (as his <hi>Maiestie</hi> addes) <hi>in rude and vndecent reuiling of persons:</hi> this is that which hath drawen downe his <hi>Maiesties</hi> piercing Eye to see it, and his Royall care to correct it. Hee corrects it by <hi>Christs</hi> owne way, <hi>Quid ab initio,</hi> by considering how it was at first: for, (as himselfe to right pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose cites <hi>Tertullian</hi>) <hi>Id verum quod primum; That is best, which was first.</hi> Hee would therefore haue vs conuersant in <hi>Antiquitie:</hi> For, <hi>Nazianzen</hi> askes that question with some scorne, <hi>Quis est qui veritatis propugna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torem, vnius diei spatio, velut e luto statuam fingit.</hi> Can any man hope to make a good Preacher, as soone as a good Picture? In three or foure dayes, or with three or foure Books? His <hi>Maiesty</hi> therfore cals vs to look, <hi>Quid primum,</hi> what was first in the whole <hi>Church?</hi> And againe, <hi>Quid primum,</hi> when we receiued the Reformation in this <hi>Kingdom,</hi> by what meanes, (as his <hi>Maiestie</hi> expresseth it) <hi>Papistry was driuen out, and Puritanisme kept out,</hi> and <hi>wee deliuered from the Superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Papist, and the madnesse of the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists,</hi> as before hee expresseth it: and his religious and iudicious eye sees clearly, That
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:23801:29"/>
all that Doctrine, which wrought this great cure vpon vs, in the Reformation, is contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the two <hi>Catechisines,</hi> in the 39. <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> and in the 2. <hi>Bookes of Homilies.</hi> And to these, as to <hi>Heads,</hi> and <hi>Abundaries,</hi> from whence all knowledge necessarie to saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, may abundantly be deriu'd, hee directs the meditations of Preachers.</p>
            <p>Are these new wayes? No way new: for they were <hi>our first</hi> way in <hi>receiuing Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> and our <hi>first</hi> way in <hi>receiuing the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</hi> Take a short view of them all: as it is in the <hi>Catechismes,</hi> as it is in the <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> as it is in the <hi>Homilies.</hi> First you are called backe to the practise of <hi>Catechising:</hi> Remember what <hi>Catechising</hi> is; it is <hi>Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutio viua voce.</hi> And in the <hi>Primitiue Church,</hi> when those persons, who comming from the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion, might haue beene scandalized with the outward Ceremoniall, and Rituall worship of God in the <hi>Church,</hi> (for Ceremonies are stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling blockes to them who looke vpon them without their Signification, and without the reason of their Institution) to auoyd that daunger, though they were not
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:23801:30"/>
admitted to see the <hi>Sacraments</hi> administred, nor the other Seruice of God performed in the <hi>Church,</hi> yet in the <hi>Church,</hi> they receiued <hi>Instruction, Institution,</hi> by word of mouth, in the fundamentall Articles of the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> and that was <hi>Catechising.</hi> The <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi> had it from the beginning, and the <hi>Iewes</hi> had it too: for their word <hi>Chanach,</hi> is of that signification, <hi>Initiare,</hi> to enter. <hi>Traine vp a child in the way he should goe, and when he</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pro. 22.6</note> 
               <hi>is olde, hee will not depart from it.

And <hi>Sepher Chinnuch,</hi> which is <hi>Liber Institutionum,</hi> that is, of <hi>Catechisme,</hi> is a Booke well knowne amongst the <hi>Iewes,</hi> euery where, where they are now: Their Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution is their Catechisme. And if wee should tell some men, That <hi>Caluins Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> were a <hi>Catechisme,</hi> would they not loue Catechising the better for that name? And would they not loue it the better, if they gaue me leaue to tell them that of which I had the experience. An Artificer of this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie brought his Childe to mee, to admire (as
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:23801:30"/>
truly there was much reason) the capacitie, the memory, especially of the child. It was but a Girle, and not aboue nine yeares of age, her Parents said lesse, some yeares lesse; wee could scarse propose any Verse of any Booke, or Chapter of the <hi>Bible,</hi> but that that childe would goe forward without Booke. I began to <hi>Catechise</hi> this child; and truly, shee vnderstood nothing of the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,</hi> nothing of any of those fundamentall poynts which must saue vs: and the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was doubled, how she knew so much, how so little.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Primitiue Church</hi> discerned this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie of <hi>Catechising:</hi> And therefore they instituted a particular <hi>Office,</hi> a <hi>Calling</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Catechisers.</hi> Which Office, as wee see in Saint <hi>Cyprians</hi> 42. <hi>Epistle,</hi> that great man <hi>Optatus</hi> exercised at <hi>Carthage,</hi> and <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen</hi> at <hi>Alexandria.</hi> When S. <hi>Augustine</hi> tooke the <hi>Epistle,</hi> and the <hi>Gospell,</hi> and the <hi>Psalme</hi> of the day, for his Text to one Sermon, did he, thinke you, much more then paraphrase, then Catechise? When <hi>Athanasius</hi> makes one Sermon, and, God knowes, a very short one too, <hi>Contra omnes Haereses, To ouerthrow</hi>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:23801:31"/>
               <hi>all Heresies in one Sermon;</hi> did he, think you, any more then propose fundamentall Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, which is truly the way to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw all <hi>Heresies?</hi> When Saint <hi>Chrysostom</hi> enters into his Sermon vpon the 3. <hi>Chapter</hi> to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> with that preparation, <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendite diligenter, non enim rem vulgarem polli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cemur, Now hearken diligently,</hi> sayes he, <hi>for it is no ordinary matter that I propose,</hi> There he proposes <hi>Catechisticall Doctrine</hi> of faith and works. Come to lower times, when <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sologus</hi> makes sixe or seuen Sermons vpon the <hi>Creed,</hi> and not a seuerall Sermon vpon euery seuerall Article, but takes the whole <hi>Creed</hi> for his Text, in euery Sermon, and scarse any of those Sermons a quarter of an houre long, will you not allowe this manner of Preaching to bee <hi>Catechising?</hi> Goe as lowe as can bee gone, to the <hi>Iesuites;</hi> and that great <hi>Catechizer</hi> amongst them, <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisius,</hi> sayes, <hi>Nos hoc munus suscipimus:</hi> Wee, wee Iesuites make Catechising our Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. I doubt not but they doe recreate themselues sometimes in other matters too, but that they glory in, that they are <hi>Catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers.</hi> And in that Profession, sayes hee, wee

to giue of his <hi>Directions,</hi> himselfe is pleased to assigne this, <hi>That the people might bee seasoned in all the Heads of the Protestant Religion.</hi> Not onely of the <hi>Christian</hi> against <hi>Iewes, Turkes,</hi> and <hi>Infidels,</hi> but of the <hi>Protestant</hi> against the <hi>Romane Church.</hi>

            <p>The <hi>Foundation</hi> is in the <hi>Catechisme;</hi> the <hi>growth</hi> and <hi>extention</hi> in the <hi>Articles,</hi> and then the <hi>Application</hi> of all to particular Audito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in the <hi>Homilies:</hi> which, if his <hi>Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie</hi> had not named, yet had beene imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his recommendation of the <hi>Articles.</hi> For the fiue and thirtieth <hi>Article</hi> appoynts the reading of them: both those, which were published in the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth, and those which after. In the first Booke, the very first <hi>Homilies</hi> are, of the <hi>Sufficiencie of Scriptures, and of the abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute necessitie of Reading them;</hi> sufficiently opposed against that which hath been sayd in that <hi>Church,</hi> both of the <hi>impertinencie,</hi> of <hi>Scriptures,</hi> as not absolutely necessarie, and of the <hi>insufficiencie</hi> of these <hi>Scriptures,</hi> if <hi>Scriptures</hi> were necessarie. And in the second Booke, the second <hi>Homily</hi> is against
<pb facs="tcp:23801:34"/>
               <hi>Idolatrie;</hi> and so farre against all approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches towards it, by hauing any <hi>Images</hi> in <hi>Churches,</hi> as that perchance Moderat Men, would rather thinke that <hi>Homilie</hi> to seuere in that kind, then suspect the <hi>Homilies</hi> of declination towards <hi>Papistrie.</hi> Is it the name of <hi>Homelies</hi> that Scandalizes them? would they haue none? Saint <hi>Cyrills</hi> 30. <hi>Paschall Sermons,</hi> which he preached in so many seuerall <hi>Easter daies,</hi> at his <hi>Arch-bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rike of Alexandria,</hi> and his <hi>Christmas dayes Sermons</hi> too, were ordinarily exscrib'd, and rehearsed ouer againe, by the most part of the Clergie of those parts: and in their Mouthes they were but <hi>Homilies.</hi> And <hi>Caluins Homilies</hi> vpon <hi>Iob</hi> (as <hi>Beza</hi> in his Preface before them, calls them) were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily repeated ouer againe in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Fraunce:</hi> and in their mouthes they were but <hi>Homilies.</hi> It is but the name, that scandalizes; and yet the name of <hi>Homilia</hi> and <hi>Concio,</hi> a <hi>Homily</hi> and a <hi>Sermon,</hi> is all one. And if some of these were spoken, and not reade, and so exhibited in the name of a Sermon, they would like them well inough. Certainely his <hi>Maiestie</hi> mistooke it
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:23801:34"/>
not, that in our <hi>Catechises,</hi> In our <hi>Articles,</hi> in our <hi>Homilies,</hi> there is inough for <hi>Positiue,</hi> inough for <hi>Controuerted Diuinitie;</hi> For that <hi>Iesuit,</hi> that intended to bring in the whole body of Controuerted Diuinitie into his booke, (whom we named before) desired no other Subiect, no other occasion to doe that, but the <hi>Catechisme</hi> of that Church; neither need any sober Man, that intends to handle Controuersies aske more, or go fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>His <hi>Maiestie</hi> therefore, who as he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands his duty to <hi>God,</hi> so doth he his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects duties to him, might iustly thinke, <hi>That these so well grounded Directions, might,</hi> (as himselfe sayes) <hi>bee receiu'd vpon implicite obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</hi> Yet hee vouchsafes to communicate to all, who desire satisfaction, the <hi>Reasons</hi> that mou'd him. Some of which I haue related, and all which, all may, when they will see, and haue. Of all which the Summ is, His <hi>Royall</hi> and his <hi>Pastorall</hi> care, that <hi>by that Primitiue way of Preaching, his Subiects might be arm'd against all kind of Aduersaries, in fundamentall truthes.</hi> And when he takes knowledge, <hi>That some few Church-men, but</hi>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:23801:35"/>
               <hi>many of the people, haue made sinister constructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his sincere intentions, As hee is grieued at the heart,</hi> (to giue you his owne wordes) <hi>to see euery day so many defections from our religion to Popery and Anabaptisme;</hi> So without doubt he is grieued with much bitternes, that any should so peruert his meaning, as to thinke, that these <hi>Directions</hi> either <hi>restraind the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of Preaching, or abated the number of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, or made a breach to Ignorance and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition,</hi> of which three scandals he hath been pleased to take knowledge. What could any <hi>Calumniator,</hi> any <hi>Libeller</hi> on the other side, haue imagin'd more opposit, more contrary to him, then approaches towards <hi>Ignorance,</hi> or <hi>Superstition?</hi> Let vs say for him, Can so learned, so abundantly learned a <hi>prince</hi> be su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected to plot for <hi>Ignorance?</hi> And let vs blesse <hi>God,</hi> that we heare him say now, <hi>That he doth constantly professe himselfe an open aduer sary to the Superstition of the Papist</hi> (without any milder Modification) and <hi>to the madnesse of the Anabaptist:</hi> And that <hi>the preaching against either of their Doctrines is not only approued, but much commended by his roy all Maiestie, if it bee done without rude and vndecent reuiling.</hi> If hee
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:23801:35"/>
had affected <hi>Ignorance</hi> in himselfe, he would neuer haue read so much; and if he had af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected <hi>Ignorance</hi> in vs, hee would neuer haue writ so much, and made vs so much the more learned by his Books. And if hee had had any declination towards <hi>Superstition,</hi> he would not haue gone so much farther, then his rank and qualitie pressed him to doe, in declaring his opinion concerning <hi>Antichrist,</hi> as out of <hi>Zeale,</hi> and <hi>zeale with knowledge</hi> hee hath done. We haue him now, (and long, long, O eternall <hi>God,</hi> continue him to vs,) we haue him now for a <hi>father</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> a <hi>Foster-father;</hi> such a father as <hi>Constantine,</hi> as <hi>Theodosius</hi> was; our posterity shall haue him for a <hi>Father,</hi> a <hi>Classique father;</hi> such a father as <hi>Ambrose,</hi> as <hi>Austin</hi> was. And when his works shall stand in the <hi>Libraries</hi> of our Posteritie, amongst the <hi>Fathers,</hi> euen these <hi>Papers,</hi> these <hi>Directions,</hi> &amp; these <hi>Reasons</hi> shalbe pregnant euidences for his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stant zeale to <hi>Gods</hi> truth, and in the meane time, as arrowes shot in their eyes, that imagine so vaine a thing, as a defection in him, to their superstition. Thus far he is from admitting <hi>Ignorance,</hi> and from <hi>Superstition</hi> thus far, which seemes to be one
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:23801:36"/>
of their feares. And for the other two, (which concurre in one) <hi>That these Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons should restraine the Exercise of Preaching, or abate the number of Sermons,</hi> his <hi>Maiestie</hi> hath declar'd himselfe to those <hi>Reuerend Fathers, To be so far from giuing the least discouragement to solid Preaching, or to discreet and religious Preachers, or from abating the number of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, that hee expects at their hands, that this should increase their number, by renuing vpon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery Sunday in the afternoon, in all Parish Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches throughout the kingdome, that primitiue, and most profitable exposition of the Catechisme.</hi> So that heere is no abating of Sermons, but a direction of the Preacher to preach vsefully, and to edification.</p>
            <p>And therfore, to end all, you, you whom <hi>God</hi> hath made <hi>Starres</hi> in this <hi>Firmament, Preachers</hi> in this <hi>Church,</hi> deliuer your selues from that imputation, <hi>The Starres were not</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Iob 25.5</note> 
               <hi>pure in his sight;</hi> The Preachers were not obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to him in the voice of his <hi>Lieutenant.</hi> And you, you who are <hi>Gods</hi> holy people, and zealous of his glory, as you know from St. <hi>Paul, that Stars differ from Stars in glory,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15 14.</note> but all conduce to the benefit of man: So,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:23801:36"/>
when you see these <hi>Stars,</hi> Preachers to differ in gifts; yet, since all their ends are to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance your saluation, encourage the <hi>Catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer,</hi> as well as the curious Preahcer. Looke so farre towards your way to Heauen, as to the Firmament, and consider there, that that starre by which wee saile, and make great voyages, is none of the starres of the greatest magnitude; but yet it is none of the least nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but a middle starre. Those Preachers which must saue your soules, are not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, vnlearned, extemporall men; but they are not ouer curious men neither. Your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are you, and your seruants are you; and you doe not prouide for your saluation, if you prouide not for them, who are so much yours, as that they are you. No man is sau'd as a <hi>good man,</hi> if he be not sau'd as a <hi>good Father,</hi> and as a <hi>good Master</hi> too, if <hi>God</hi> haue giuen him a family. That so, <hi>Priest</hi> and <hi>people,</hi> the whole Congregation, may by their religious obedience, and fighting in this spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall warfare in their <hi>Order,</hi> minister occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of ioy to that heart, which hath beene grieued; in that fulnesse of ioy, Which <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> expresseth. <hi>The King shall reioyce in thy</hi>

               <hi>strength, O Lord, and in thy saluation how great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shall hee reioyce? Thou hast giuen him his hearts desire, and thou hast not withholden the request of his lipps: for the King trusteth in the Lord, and by the mercy of the most High, he shall not bee mooued.</hi> And with that <hi>Psalme,</hi> a Psalme of Confidence in a good <hi>King,</hi> and a Psalme of Thank sgiuing for that blessing, I desire that this Congregation may be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued; for this is all that I intended for the <hi>Explication,</hi> which was our first, and for the <hi>Application,</hi> which was the other part proposed in these wordes.</p>
