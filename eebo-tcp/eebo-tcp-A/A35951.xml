            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He name of <hi>Wisdome</hi> and <hi>Happiness</hi> (most Illustrious Marquess) hath alwaies and every where been very eminent, and all men have justly commended him that hath been studious of both; But few they are who well understand the things themselves: For they that place their <hi>Happiness</hi> in any thing besides the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of God, in the matter of true <hi>Wisdome,</hi> are much mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: That indeed is the true <hi>Wisdome,</hi> by which wee are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly and infallibly led to solid and eternal <hi>Happiness.</hi> It is a most sad spectacle, and to wise observers not unprofitable, to behold the <hi>misery</hi> of mankind, joyned with <hi>madness.</hi> Man is banished from Heaven, and as a Vagabond wanders up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth, tossed up and down with the stings of misery, and a certain blinde de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of <hi>Happiness,</hi> inquires after his Remedy. But the <hi>Felicity</hi> hee should seek after above, hee looks for among terrene trash, and so misseth of it every where. For the chiefest <hi>Good</hi> hee embraceth the meanest things, and the deceitful sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of Vanity: By the frequent frustration of his conceived hopes, hee is mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of his errour, and urged with the perpetual agitation of a restless spirit, to seek after the heavenly Country, and his Fathers house. But hee goes astray from the womb, and his errour is endless, encreasing and multiplying the miseries that hee flies from.</p>
            <p>The contemplation of Divine <hi>Goodness,</hi> conflicting with mans obstinacy and stubbornness, heightens the sadness of this spectacle; The fountain of happiness descends from Heaven (cloathed with Majesty and Light, as with a garment) ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifesting to those that are in the dark, his invisibility, to wit, his eternal power and God-head, shining forth in the works of Creation, that hee might invite rebels in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to favour with him. But they either look not towards God, or looking to him, they acknowledge him not, or knowing him in some measure, they glorifie him not as God, but become vain in their imaginations, and bowed downward, they cry out, <hi>Who will shew us any good?</hi> None seriously pray, <hi>Lift up the light of thy Countenance upon us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God comes neerer in the works of his providence, and leaves himself not without witness, but communicates his good things to men unworthy; gives Rain from Heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling the hearts of his most ingrateful enemies, with food and gladness, that they might feel after the Lord, and finde him, whom they had lost; so by the riches of his goodness and forbearance, they might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to repentance; But they receive these benefits, and sacrifice them to glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony
<pb facs="tcp:49391:3"/>
and intemperance. And even with these things which Divine bounty vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed (arming themselves with the weapons of iniquity) they rebel against God.</p>
            <p>But here the <hi>Man-kindness</hi> of God doth not end, but hee comes close to us, reacheth forth his hand, knocks at every mans breast, produceth the Law written legibly upon every mans heart, shakes their consciences, stirs up their thoughts to summon those fugitive enemies to the Tribunal of Justice, to accuse the guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and convince them of their odious ingratitude, takes away all excuse from those that are convicted, and all this, that men might repent, and sue out for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. But they convinced of their iniquity, contumaciously lift up themselves against God, fall out with conscience, and lay violent hands upon it, to bee silent; they invade that truth of God, written upon their hearts, which once suppressed they imprison, and <hi>with-hold in unrighteousness.</hi> Its no wonder if God suffer such desperately stubborn, and self-condemned creatures, to walk in their own waies, and leaves them to Satan, giving them up to their own corrupt affections. Alas! Alas! millions are lost, and will bee so.</p>
            <p>By how much the more this spectacle is lamentable, by so much the goodness of God is more lovely, which will not endure that Divine Grace should suffer a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulse, by those which the good pleasure of God will have to be his own, to come to themselves, and be saved. You will easily affirm that to be a joyful sight, which for ever will bless the beholders, and make them happy. The <hi>Eternal Wisdome,</hi> the <hi>Beloved</hi> of the <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>Delight</hi> of <hi>Angels,</hi> the <hi>Light</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> the <hi>Life</hi> of <hi>Men,</hi> the <hi>Son of Righteousness,</hi> under whose <hi>wings</hi> is <hi>healing,</hi> and salvation, Our Lord Jesus Christ came down from the <hi>bosome</hi> of his Father: Who having discharged the price of our Redemption, conquered our enemies, gets up into his triumphant Chariot; passes through all places where his redeemed ones abide; for their sakes hee sets up the <hi>banner</hi> of his love; hee sends forth the voice of saving wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in the <hi>Gospel of Peace:</hi> By the Ministery whereof, hee opens the fountain of mans misery wider, reproves of sin, creates in them a sorrow after God, holds forth wrath to come, and terrifies; demonstrates to them their folly, unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and impotency to deliver themselves from those evils, and humbles them to an abnegation of their own wisdome and strength. Hee offers himself a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, for the restoring of amity betwixt God and man, provokes in us a thirst after Life and Righteousness, holds forth to us freedome from the Law of works, as also the ratification of the New and Free <hi>Covenant</hi> of Grace, to which hee causeth them to consent; perswades them to embrace Christ, that great gift of God, and wholly resign themselves up to him: Hee exhibits also to them Remission of sins, and causes them to lay hold upon it to Justification: Hee wills those that are justified, to mortifie the old man, and enkindles in them no less de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire after holiness, than after Heaven and Happiness it self: Hee requires the fruits of Faith, in obedience to the Divine Law, and causes them to suck vital juice from the vine, which they send forth in fruits worthy of the Gospel. Hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands that every one take up his own Cross, which lies in his way to Heaven, causing them to observe his commands, and after the Lord of Glory, bearing reproach for him, through prosperity and adversity to pass on unto eternal life.</p>
            <p>This is that saving <hi>Wisdome</hi> which deceives no man, but <hi>justifies</hi> and blesseth all her <hi>Children,</hi> and in like manner is <hi>justified,</hi> asserted and defended by all her <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi> This is that <hi>Wisdome from above,</hi> which every where is diffused through the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> in the thrice seven <hi>Apostolick Epistles,</hi> more than twenty times drawn into a <hi>Compendium,</hi> and is fitted to the present use of the <hi>Children of Light.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>LL Sciences have their introductions and rudimentary Preparatives, by which the learner may bee fitted and instructed to a farther and more researched knowledge of things; All Noble families have their Porters to open unto their Visitors, and courteously to conduct them from the Gate to the Parlour: I doubt not (Candid Reader) but to find thee of my judgement, that the explication of the Scriptures should have its Introduction too, and the Learned, and therefore Noble Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of Commentators, their Ostiaries and Ianitors. Now that I might become a Servant in this Family, and shew my officiousness to give entrance unto the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the holy Ministery, whereby they may have access unto the richer Providores in Gods Family, I have taken up my standing at the threshold of the house of God.</p>
            <p>'Tis well known in the Schools, in how little time, how many and great volumes are to be read, how many facilitating and perasceuastical exercises young Clients to Divinity must run thorow; and in apportionating either of daies or hours, to the several sorts of studies, how little time is spent in reading the Holy Scriptures, to get a right understanding of which, ought to bee the chief labour of all men, especially of those that would hear the Lord himself speaking, that they may beleeve, and that what they beleeve as the Oracles of God they may publickly preach; Hee that shall conduce what hee can to the furtherance of such Noble Bereans, Scripture-Disciples, Ile bee his warrant, hee shall not lose his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
            <p>For their sakes that are students in Theology, by the authority of the National Synods Delegates, I made in my publick Lectures an Analytical Exposition of all the Apostolick Epistles, and those Lectures, though somewhat rude, I committed to the Press, that I might spare many's labour of transcribing them, and I purposed candidly to give you an account of my intent therein, to the end that I might render thee more equitable to mee in thy censure of mee.</p>
            <p>For younger Students, for whom the reading of the Scriptures is necessary, but the peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of larger Commentaries is impossible, according to my duty, I was to set forth an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the main scope of the Text, and of the obscurer words, and harder sentences, and of their coherence one with another, and also with the principal scope; now here was need of an Analysis, Glosses, and some Exposition, or Paraphrase which might bee instead of an Exposition. Brevity was so necessary for the intended Introduction, that it would have been better never to have undertaken it, than not to have made it short; for if there had been no hope of brevity, it had never been at all. Now to the brevity of the Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, perspicuity was also necessary, lest a trussing together of many things in few words should intangle the Reader.</p>
            <p>That I might therefore obtain my designed end, I have pack'd the Analysis, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries, and Exposition or Paraphrase altogether, every one of which could not singly bee disposed of, without great tediousness: But whether or no, or in what measure I have effected what I aimed at, bee thou thy self Iudge, when having compared the Explication with the Text, thou shalt see how each thing hath reference to other. Onely know thus much, that I could with a great deal less labour have made my Explication longer, than so short as it is. I have not followed the Logical Analysis any further<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than was necessary to demonstrate the Scope of the Text; for to mince every member of the sentence by peece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meal,
<pb facs="tcp:49391:4"/>
would bee the work of a prolix Commentary: those that are called Logical terms of Art, I have used very sparingly, otherwise, I saw I should raise a quarrel against my self, and a trouble to thee, who mightest more easily understand the matter it self, than thou couldest examine, whether those terms were by mee rightly assigned, and wouldest sooner consent with mee in the main matter, than subscribe to my use of those Logical notions: For every one hath his several way of Analysing, so that you shall hardly finde two Writers that do agree in all their Logick terms, in the Resolution of but one Chapter, even when they unanimously accord in sense. For Logick terms according to a various respect had to the subject and attribute of the proposition to bee proved, are, and ought to be changed, the sense of the place remaining still intire and safe. The Precepts and Exhortations which are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatically proposed in that which they call (<hi>Modus Imperativus</hi>) or any other Rhetorical <hi>Modus,</hi> according to the Rules in Logick, I have turned <hi>in Modum Indicativum,</hi> that the position to bee confirmed may bee the more clearly illustrated. The emphasis and forcible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Spirit, I have left to bee unfolded in larger Commentaries and Sermons. For your memories sake, I have made the parts of every Chapter, and the chief Positions in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very part (as far as the truth of the matter would suffer) very few. Arguments for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of that Proposition that expresses the scope, I have made more or fewer, all after as perspicuity required; one while contracting the force of many Arguments into one, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther while unfolding them severally.</p>
            <p>Arguments that make to confirm the chief scope, and the next foregoing matter, I have referred to both. But I have disposed all things by way of Enthymem for brevity and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuities sake. If the scope or conclusion seems to bee repeated oftner than was needful, I hope you will pardon mee this labour, when you shall see the conclusion or purpose suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to bee more easily gathered by mee, than you can fetch it from what went before. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though at first blush some Arguments seem to bee the same, you shall see some new force the Apostle adds, doth make a difference. Nor let it not trouble you, that the Arguments that I refer to the confirmation of any Proposition, are used by learned men to prove other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions: For the same <hi>medium</hi> may fitly serve for the proving of several Propositions. Where the sense of the verses is obvious, and the connexion plain, there will be no need of this help of mine, which is to take place chiefly in the obscurer passages; but lest there should bee any gap, I have made the work all along similar and homogeneous. Hee that likes not this concise way of writing, I beg of him that hee would not deter others from the reading of it. If this Introduction shall but open a door to the Students of Divinity unto larger Commentaries, I have my desire. A Key, the less it is, the higher it is wont to bee valued. In so great variety of Writers, hee consults best for the Common-wealth, that handles onely necessary things well, or at least, briefly, that the Reader may lose as little labour and cost as may bee.</p>
            <p>If this labour of mine bee welcome to thee, your admonition shall not bee unwelcome to mee, though it pitch upon something to bee amended, or if in your prudence you think fit to give mee any advice. I will do my indeavour (God willing) to satisfie thee as to an <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Translation, which many of my friends put mee upon, if it shall bee found worth the while. In the mean time I humbly beseech the Father of Lights, that hee would send more learned and able servants of his into this Harvest, that what I cannot, they may do in this kind of writing. For I hope, that very many that are now kept off by the onely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixity of Commentaries, that they read little or nothing, and with very small benefit, will now read the Scriptures more eagerly, having some short helps for the opening of their scope and sense tendred them.</p>

            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Reverend Author having so well approved himself to the Church of God, by his several labours upon the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> was a great motive to us, to make these e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laborate <hi>Expositions</hi> upon the Epistles, of universal use, by putting them into the same language, with his pious Commentaries on the <hi>Psalms</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> St. <hi>Matthews Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,</hi> and other Tractates that have promoted sober minds in the practical understanding of the word of God. And for this in thy hands, as many learned men (with great commendation) have taken much pains in the explication of these sacred Letters of St. <hi>Paul</hi>; so this <hi>Learned Professor</hi> of <hi>Divinity</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hath very much served the Church of God, by the addition of his <hi>Analytical Exposition,</hi> wherein hee is true to his <hi>Method,</hi> solid in his <hi>Explication,</hi> and learned in both. Yet possible it is, that matters of the best desert, may fall under the censures of some, amongst the rest, perhaps the transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of this book into the <hi>English tongue</hi>; I hope the suspicion of an offence will not appear so great, when wee shall have shewed the reasons that carried us thereunto, which among the rest were such as these<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>Whilst this Commentary remained in the same language wherein the Author sent it into the world, it was more confined in its use, and could be helpful onely to some, and those men of learning; By this means it becomes instrumental to all, both learned and unlearned. And surely it is very meet that the learned should condescend to the good of others, when they cannot ascend to their own.</p>
            <p>We conceived that this eminent part of the Holy Scriptures, being plainly opened (seeing that so many have, and do wrest the Scriptures to their own destruction) might prove very useful to all <hi>Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,</hi> where the word of God is conscionably read, and diligently studied, for their direction in the true intent and meaning of the Holy Ghost; for want whereof, many have abused their own under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings, and the apprehensions of others about the mind of God in his revealed word; whereas this Commentary, being near at hand, will readily lead them, not onely to the sense of every single <hi>verse</hi> in any <hi>Chapter</hi> throughout this work, but to the scope and aim of the Apostle, in the whole design hee hath in hand: For by abstracting a particular sentence (or <hi>verse</hi>) from the body of the <hi>Epistle,</hi> it may seem to look another way, than the c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ntexture of the discourse <hi>doth</hi> import.</p>
            <p>Another motive of this translation, was that which sometime moved King <hi>Alured</hi> (or <hi>Alfred</hi>) to procure the turning of <hi>Gregories Pastorals</hi> into English, because some of his Church-men did not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the <hi>Latin</hi> tongue. Thus it pleases God to have it at this day; Many Preachers in <hi>England,</hi> who take upon them to teach others, understand nothing but their Mother-tongue themselves, nor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver came they where Learning grew. But seeing they will undertake to minister to the people, and the wind blows for their turn; That the Church of Christ, purchased with his most precious blood, might not be left qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>These were the main inducements wee eyed in attempting this work, and wee hope its general ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceableness<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will answer to whatever might be objected against the undertaking. Sometimes through the mistakes of printing the <hi>Latin</hi> book, the sense was here and there disturbed, whereupon wee were forced to take the more care in finding out the Authors mind, that wee might accordingly commend it to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Another thing I should signifie to the Reader: Some years since this Author set forth his <hi>Expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> of the <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> a Book so useful and solid, that it became deservedly acceptable to most men: This wee have inserted in its proper place, in this Volume and Edition: So that besides the Analy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <head>THE EPISTLE of <hi>PAVL</hi> to the ROMANS, Analytically Expounded.</head>
            <argument>
               <head>THE SUMME OF THE EPISTLE.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Apostle determined to visit the <hi>Romans,</hi> that hee might by his presence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm them in the faith. In the mean time when hee observes his coming delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, being moved by the Spirit of the Lord, hee writes this famous Epistle unto them.</p>
               <p>The parts of the Epistle, besides the beginning and conclusion, are two. The first shewes the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and spiritual ground of sinners Iustification by faith in Christ, <hi>to Chap. 12.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other part treats concerning the holy course of life, which justified persons should live; <hi>to the end of the Chapter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That which appertains to the first part, present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after the beginning of the Epistle, the Apostle undertakes to prove, THAT NO MAN CAN BE IUSTIFIED BY INHERENT RIGHTEOUSNESSE, BUT BY THE RIGHTEOUSNESSE OF CHRIST ON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LY, APPREHENDED BY FAITH A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LONE, AND FREELY OF HIS GRACE IMPUTED, BY GOD, TO US THAT BELEEVE.</p>
               <p>This Position hee proves by ten Arguments; whereof the two first are in the <hi>first Chapter.</hi> The third in the <hi>second Chapter;</hi> the seven other in the <hi>third Chapter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the further fixing of these Arguments, hee sub-joyns a sevenfold proof of this doctrine</p>
               <p>The FIRST is, That <hi>Abraham</hi> was justified by Faith alone. <hi>Chap. 4.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The SECOND is, That this onely reason of our justification, affords us comfort against the just anger of God, and original sin, the poison which <hi>Adam</hi> derived upon us. <hi>Chap. 5.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The THIRD is, That this ground of our ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification very much conduces to promote sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in them that are justified. <hi>Chap. 6.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The FOURTH is, That this ground of our ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification onely yeelds comfort to the afflicted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences of them that are justified upon their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect obedience, and the reliques of sin dwelling in them. <hi>Chap. 7.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The FIFTH is, That this ground of our ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification fenceth those that are justified, and san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, not onely against condemnation, or all the evils to bee feared after this life; but also confirms and comforts against all the troubles and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to which the Children of God are obnoxious in this life. <hi>Chap. 8.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The SIXTH proof is, That by experience it is found, that the Iews seeking righteousness from their works, fall short of it; and that the Gentiles, destitute of all shew of inherent righteousness, by faith in Iesus Christ, have obtained true and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving righteousness. <hi>Chap. 9.</hi> Where, from occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Iews cutting off, election and reprobation is handled.</p>
               <p>The which rejection of the Iews, being apparent and manifest to all the Churches, (because of their foolish incredulity and obstinacy) hee proves to bee just. <hi>Chap. 10.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet all the Iews not to bee despised, because the obstinacy of that Nation is to last but for a time, which hee shews. <hi>Chap. 11.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the other part of the Epistle, wherein hee treats of sanctification in the lives of all those that are justified, (<hi>1</hi>) After a serious obtestation, that all who are justified should consecrate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves unto God, and all the Ministers of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, maintaining peace amongst themselves, every one according to his ability should promote the san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification and salvation of the faithful; Hee gives general Precepts about Sanctity. <hi>Chap. 12. (2)</hi> Hee descends to more special duties towards the Magistrate, and their neighbours of all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, according to the Law of Charity. <hi>Chap. 13. (3)</hi> Hee handles the mutual duties of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, in a prudent use of their Christian liberty. <hi>Chap. 14.</hi> and in the former part of <hi>Chap. 15.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly, Assuring the <hi>Romans</hi> of his love, and authority, in the remaining part of <hi>Chapter 15.</hi> with salutations of the Saints, hee concludes his Epistle. <hi>Chap. 16.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The beginning contains the inscription of the Epistle to <hi>verse 8.</hi> And the proemial discourse to <hi>verse 17.</hi> and all is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to the preparing of the faithful <hi>Romans,</hi> that with all submission of mind, they would receive the subsequent doctrin; which designe may bee comprehended to the same sense, in this or the like <hi>maxim.

The matter of the Gospel which I preach, is not any common or ordinary thing, but <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> our <hi>Lord,</hi> the Son of <hi>God, God-man,</hi> in the unity of person, truly man, conceived by the Holy Ghost, of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> of the seed of <hi>David</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the flesh, or his humane nature: Also very God, as is apparent by many signes, so especially by his resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from the dead, whereby hee is expresly manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted to bee the most powerful Son of God, according to his divine nature, which is called the Spirit most holy, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. and 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. Therefore ought you with reverence and willingness to receive the subsequent do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 5.</hi> By whom wee have received grace and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stleship for obedience to the faith, among all Nations, for his Name:</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 6. To this very end, the glorious office of the Apostleship was freely bestowed upon the other Apostles, and my self by Christ; <hi>that</hi> according to that authority which Christ hath, and hath granted to us, wee might obtain amongst all Nations that saving obedience which is due to the doctrine of faith; Therefore you ought with all subjection of minde to entertain this doctrin of the Gospel.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 6.</hi> Among whom are yee also the called of Iesus Christ.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 7. Amongst the Gentiles, to whom I am sent, you beleeving <hi>Romans</hi> are the chief, because you are ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually called by Christ, and to him are you subjected in obedience of the faith; Therefore ought you to receive this doctrine of the Gospel with all submission of minde.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 7.</hi> To all that bee in <hi>Rome</hi> beloved of God, called to bee Saints; Grace to you, and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Iesus Christ.</q>
               <p>In the inscription of the Epistle, there remains the description and salutation of those to whom hee writes, wherein the <hi>Eighth Argument</hi> is contained, to this purpose.</p>
               <p>You are the Beloved of God, effectually called, and in part sanctified, and heirs of grace and peace; so that I may justly in the Name of God, apply to you the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the Gospel, and wish you <hi>Grace</hi> (i. e. All good things which by way of Sanctification flow from the special favour of God.) <hi>Peace, (i. e.</hi> all those things which conduce to your happiness, either in this present life, or that which is to come) from God, through Christ the Mediatour, to bee communicated to you; Therefore ought you with all willingness of minde to hearken to my doctrin.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 8.</hi> First, I thank my God through Iesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.</q>
               <p>In the other verses of the beginning wee have his proc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mial speech, whereof this is the scope,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 9. Throughout the world, the report of your faith is famous, which you yeeld to the Gospel, whereat I rejoyce, and give thanks to God by Christ our Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, for you all; Therefore you ought to attend to my Gospel with all readiness of mind.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 9.</hi> For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the Gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you alwayes in my prayers.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 10. The care which I have of your salvation, and the desire I have of your good, will not let mee bee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindful of you in my prayers, which because it cannot o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise appear to you, I call God to witness, who best knows, with what sincerity of heart I serve him in the Ministery of the Gospel of his Son; Therefore ought you to obey mee in what I write to you.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 10.</hi> Making request (if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God) to come unto you.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 11. That I may bee profitable unto you, I do not onely not decline the labour of comming unto you, but I earnestly desire of God, that hee would at length grant mee a prosperous journey unto you, when it shall seem good to him; Therefore ought you willingly to hearken.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 11.</hi> For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end you may bee esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 12. I am very desirous to see you, not that I might partake of your outward injoyments, but that I might communicate to you a fuller knowledge of the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of the Gospel, as some spiritual gift, whereby you may bee established in the faith against what ever ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; Therefore you ought willingly to entertain this doctrine.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 12.</hi> That is, that I may bee comforted together
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49391:6"/>
with you, by the mutual faith both of you and mee.</q>
               <p>Hee unfolds this Argument (lest it might seem arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly spoken) modestly intimating that hee was as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to receive comfort and edification from their faith, as hee was to administer the same to them, from his.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 13.</hi> Now I would not have you ignorant, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 13. Although I have been hitherto hindred from comming to you, yet after many impediments, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed my purpose of comming unto you again, that, by the preaching of the Gospel, I might not onely confirm you in the faith and obedience of the Gospel, but might bee a means of converting some amongst you to the faith, even as among the other Gentiles I have gained some to God; Therefore ought you to hearken to my doctrine.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 14.</hi> I am debter both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 14. By the office of my Apostleship, and the special command of Christ, I am a debter to all sorts of men to preach the Gospel; Therefore you ought to hearken to my doctrine.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 15.</hi> So, as much as in mee is, I am ready to preach the Gospel to you that are at Rome also.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 15. I have much respect to you <hi>Romans,</hi> and according to the liberty granted of God, as much as in mee lyes, I am ready to preach the Gospel no less to you, than to others, for your salvation; Therefore you ought to obey my doctrine.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 16.</hi> For I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God unto salvation, to every one that believeth, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>I am not ashamed] Argum.</hi> 16. Although the Gospel which I preach is commonly dis-esteemed, and goes along with the Cross, yet because it is not mine, but the Gospel of Christ (holding forth that grace which by him is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated unto us) honourable and glorious, whereof I am no wise ashamed; Therefore you ought to hearken to my doctrine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Power] Argum.</hi> 17. Confirming what was said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; The Gospel which I preach is a powerful and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual instrument of salvation to every one that beleeves, without exception of Nation, whether Jews or Gentiles, the Jews prerogative being regarded, to whom the Gospel ought first to bee preached, because of the Covenant long since made betwixt God and the Jews; Therefore you ought, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 17.</hi> For therein is the righteousness of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed from faith to faith; as it is written, The just shall live by faith.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 18. Confirming the former; In the Gospel which I preach is revealed and discovered the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God from faith to faith, which before was hid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Ceremonies and shadows; that is to say, That means of justifying sinners, which God himself hath found out, in which onely wee can stand before God, and in which alone hee is well pleased: To wit, the righteousness of Christ our Lord, which is made ours from faith to faith, i. e. from faith (increasing by degrees) from less to a greater measure; or from faith <hi>meerly, onely,</hi> and not of works; or our inherent righteousness; Therefore ought you to receive the things which I write; with all willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and submission of mind.</p>
               <div n="2" type="part">
                  <head>The second part.</head>
                  <p>Hee passeth to the second part of the Chapter, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in hee laies down a Proposition to bee confirmed in the following part of the Epistle, which is this, <hi>That Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness which is revealed in the Gospel, is the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Christ, imputed to us by the grace of God, apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by faith alone, and not inherent righteousness in men, which is works.</hi> Or which is to the same sense, <hi>wee are justified by faith in Christ, and not by works.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Arguments brought to confirm this Position are <hi>ten,</hi> whereof two are contained in this <hi>Chapter,</hi> one in the <hi>second,</hi> the rest in the <hi>third</hi> Chapter. To all which, this dis-junction is to bee premised. Either wee are justified by <hi>Faith,</hi> or Righteousness freely <hi>imputed,</hi> or by works, or <hi>inherent</hi> Righteousness.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Just] Argum.</hi> 1. By the Righteousness of faith onely wee obtain life; Therefore by the righteousness of faith alone wee are justified; for by an indissoluble con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection <hi>Righteousness</hi> and <hi>Salvation</hi> are joyned together, and there is the same reason or ground of both. This Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument hee confirms by a Testimony, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.4. Who rejects those as Hypocrites, from life, that trusted in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, or their own works, and the righteous by faith, hee pronounceth heirs of life onely.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 18.</hi> For the wrath of God is revealed from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven against all ungodliness, and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. Wee are so farre from being justified by works, that the wrath of God openly pursues the unjust and wicked works of all men, of the Gentiles and the Jews, to wit, of those that are out of Christ; Therefore wee are justified onely by the righteousness of faith, or the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of Christ apprehended by faith, and through grace imputed unto us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Truth]</hi> Hee confirms this Argument by several parts; and first hee shewes the unrighteousness of men, in the example of the Gentiles, to <hi>verse</hi> 24. and the wrath of God poured out upon the wicked; and their unrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness hee further shewes to the end of the <hi>Chapter.</hi> Hee proves the impiety and unrighteousness of the Gentiles, inasmuch as the wisest of men (to wit, the Rulers and Philosophers among the Gentiles) with-held the truth in unrighteousness, <hi>i. e.</hi> That true knowledge which they obtained from God (through unrighteousness, or the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of their own will) they suppressed, and detained in themselves as a captive, whilst they neither communicated it unto others, nor shewed it forth in works of piety; Therefore they are all impious and unrighteous. This Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is much to the purpose; for if this bee true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the prime part of man-kinde out of Christ; 1 Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the wisest Law-makers and Philosophers amongst the Heathens, much more is it true, touching the rest; for if the flower and principal part bee corrupted, what shall wee think of the dreggs and lower sort?</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vers. 19.</hi> Because that which may bee known of God is manifest in them, for God hath shewed it unto them.</p>
                     <p n="20">
                        <hi>20.</hi> For the invisible things of him from the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his Eternal Power and God-head, so that they are without excuse.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>This Argument hee explains two waies; <hi>First,</hi> By shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the Gentiles had certain remnants of the light of Nature, concerning the worshiping of God; because that which may bee known of God by natural light, was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest to them, to wit, The Eternity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Power<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Divinity of God, with the rest of his Attributes, which are appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by the light of Nature, even from the Creation of the World, were manifested (by the things that were made) clearly as in a glass, that they could not plead ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vers. 21.</hi> Because that when they knew God, they glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied him not as God, neither were thankful, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.</p>
                     <p n="22">
                        <hi>22.</hi> Professing themselves to bee wise, they became fools:</p>
                     <p n="23">
                        <hi>23.</hi> And changing the glory of the incorruptible God, into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and four-footed beasts, and creeping things.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Hee explains the former Argument, by shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Gentiles detained and imprisoned the known
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49391:7"/>
truth, partly, in that they gave not God the glory of his Attributes, and divine works, as also that they were not thankful for his benefits, which the light of Nature would have taught them. Partly, because they became vain in their imaginations, and deceived themselves, being blind where they seemed most of all to bee wise, leaving those true Principles concerning God, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hrough their own false reasonings, they drew false conclusions about God, and the worshiping of him. <hi>Lastly,</hi> They apparently manifested their ingratitude and folly by their works; they framed the images of men and beasts, whereby they would represent God, or the properties of God, to the eye; thus, as much as in them lay, they changed the glory of God, dishonoured by so vile a comparison, into those abominable images.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vers. 24.</hi> Wherefore God also gave them up to unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, through the lusts of their own hearts, to disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour their own bodies between themselves:</p>
                     <p n="25">
                        <hi>25.</hi> Who changed the Truth of God into a Lie, and worshipped, and served the Creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>The impiety and unrighteousness of men against God, being manifested in the Example of the Gentiles, hee shews the wrath of God to bee poured out upon the wicked; and withall the greatness of their iniquity, In that God gave them up <hi>judicially</hi> to their own affections, and most justly left them to themselves, for a punishment of their abominable Idolatry: That they which robbed God of his glory, might suffer in, and by themselves, the foulest ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominy: And that they which changed the glorious At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes of God into lying images (which are nothing less than what they are called) should change themselves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to beasts by their unbridled lusts. They are said to <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and serve things created, passing by the Creator:</hi> For although Idolaters seem, in the false representation of God by an Image, to intend him honour and worship, yet God altogether rejects that worship, and leaves it wholly to the Image or Creature, with whom hee will not by any means share his worship.</p>
                  <p>God is called in this place, <hi>Blessed for ever,</hi> that wee may know that the injurious carriage of Idolaters can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract nothing from the felicity of God; But that his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and blessedness will abide for ever, to whom wee all of us ought with the Apostle to ascribe it, saying, AMEN.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vers. 26.</hi> For this cause God gave them up unto vile af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; for even their women did change their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural use into that which is against nature:</p>
                     <p n="27">
                        <hi>27.</hi> And likewise also the men, leaving the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another, men with men working that which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their errour which was meet.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>In the Example of the Gentiles is propounded a further demonstration of mans unrighteousness, and Gods wrath against the wicked: To wit, that God gave them up ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicially to the hands of their own lusts, and defiled spirits (who served their own corrupt affections in matter of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion) that (against Nature) the men and women in their abominable Sodomitical filthiness (below beasts, in their unnatural lusts) by way of requital should debase themselves, who by their Idolatry had abased the glory of God, in resembling him to Creatures and fictions of their own.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vers. 28.</hi> And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate mind, to do those things which are not convenient.</p>
                     <p n="29">
                        <hi>29.</hi> Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness, full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity, whisperers,</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>Hee proceeds further to manifest the unrighteousness of man, and the wrath of God; to wit, That God most justly gave them up to a reprobate mind, who refused to retain in their minds the knowledge of him, which by the light of nature was apparent in all the works of Creation, that being deprived of the use of common judgement, as if they had turned beasts, they ran mad into all wickedness against the Law of Nations and Nature, without the least shew of Reason.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>The last demonstration of mans unrighteousness, and the wrath of God in his justice leaving them to themselves, appears with a threefold aggravation.

(3) They themselves onely did not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit such things, but (not onely by their silence, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, flattery and authority) became Patrons to them that did, confirming and hardening them in their sins. This is the condition of the wisest men out of Christ, who are so farre from the righteousness of works, that they do nothing but abuse the known principles of Righteousness, provoke the wrath of God against themselves, and more and more pollute themselves with all manner of filthiness, to their fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal perdition.</p>

                  <p>IN this Chapter wee have the third Argument set down to prove the Position, <hi>viz.</hi> CONCERNING THE RIGH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TEOVSNESSE, NOT BY WORKS, BVY BY FAITH. Which is propounded in the first and second verses; in the remaining part of the Chapter it is confirmed, and the objections removed.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 1.</hi> Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever thou art that judgest, for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thy self, for thou that judgest, doest the same things.</p>

                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:49391:7"/>The <hi>third</hi> Argument against Justification by works, from the self-condemnation of all men, drawn from the last verse of the former Chapter. Every man (condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning others, and doing the same things which hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns) in his own judgement is condemned without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse. Therefore every man is so farre from being justified by works, that on the contrary hee is condemned.</p>
               <p>In the second verse a reason of this is subjoyned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>the judgement of God is just,</hi> and according to the merit of the deed, condemns every sinner, both him that judgeth, and him that is judged. Therefore hee which according to the judgement of God condemns another to death for sin, condemns himself doing the like things.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 3.</hi> And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgement of God?</q>
               <p>This Argument in the following part of the Chapter is confirmed, removing the four pretended Objections, whereby men may evade the force of the Argument.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 1. Hee securely contemns the judgement of God, who (because God hath hitherto spared him) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth himself impunity (or freedome from punishment) when hee judgeth others: <hi>I am not afraid</hi> (saith hee) <hi>of the judgement of God.</hi> The Apostle refutes this Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and proves it null by six Reasons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. That such an imagination is vain and foolish; for <hi>Thinkest thou, &amp;c.</hi> which is the same, as if hee had said, <hi>In vain doest thou think to escape the judgement of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 4.</hi> Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness, and forbearance, and long-suffering, not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Despisest] Reas.</hi> 2. Such an imagination puts contempt and abuse upon the riches of the bounty, forbearance, and gentleness of God, when any one (because God hath spared hitherto) goes on in sin, and conceives hopes to go unpunished.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bounty] Reas.</hi> 3. That the bounty of God ought to invite, and move to repentance, not to go on in sin, out of hopes to go unpunished.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 5.</hi> But after thy hardness and impenitent heart, treasurest up unto thy self wrath against the day of wrath, and revelation of the righteous judgement of God:</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hardness] Reas.</hi> 4. That such a thought is the harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our hearts in sin, and a sealing of them up that wee cannot repent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Treasure] Reas.</hi> 5. That hee who securely contemns the judgement of God, heaps up unto himself a kinde of treasure of punishments, from divine justice, to the time of that last and terrible judgement, wherein that whole treasure of punishments, in the most righteous anger of God shall bee openly poured out upon him.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 6.</hi> Who will render to every man according to his deeds:</p>
                  <p n="7">
                     <hi>7.</hi> To them, who by patient continuance in well-doing seek for glory, and honour, and immortality, eternal life:</p>
                  <p n="8">
                     <hi>8.</hi> But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and wrath;</p>

                     <hi>9.</hi> Tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man that doth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile:</p>
                  <p n="10">
                     <hi>10.</hi> But glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 6. God will give to every man in the day of Judgement according to his works, good or evil; his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of grace, or punishments of his justice; To wit, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life to them that persevere in obedience to the truth, hoping for a reward, <hi>vers.</hi> 6, 7. And besides the signs of wrath in this life, eternal death also after this life (as it is just for an angry God to inflict) upon the adversaries of the truth, and the servants of unrighteousness, <hi>verse</hi> 8. Hee confirms this reason, in that God will have no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to any Nation or outward Priviledges in the inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his punishments; But the Jews which had the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est favours of God, should bee first in their punishments; and that hee would inflict upon the soul and body of the Heathens, or Gentiles, their deserved torments, <hi>verse</hi> 9. And to the same manner, in his rewards, without diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Nations, hee will glorifie (<hi>i. e.</hi> with all gifts that may <hi>externally</hi> accomplish a man, such as <hi>Glory,</hi> and <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi>; and <hi>inwardly,</hi> which is signified by <hi>Peace</hi>) and will heap upon the pious and honest Jew, according to all the priviledges which hee hath vouchsafed to that Nation; and will crown the pious and honest Gentile in his place, with eternal life, <hi>verse</hi> 10. from whence it follows, that hee is deceived, who indulges hopes of impunity, because God hath hitherto spared him.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 11.</hi> For there is no respect of persons with God.</q>
               <p>Hee confirms the former reason from the equity of God, in that hee is <hi>no respecter of persons</hi>; and hee meets with the second Objection, propounded <hi>verse</hi> 2. against the severe judgement of God against sinners. <hi>Some might object.</hi> In the executing of Judgement, respect is to bee had, as well of the Heathen, who lives out of the Church, without the knowledge of the Law, or the doctrine of God; as also of the Jew, which is a Disciple of God, and an hearer of the Law; God forbid that either of them should perish, for both seems unjust, although they are sinners. Hee refutes this Objection, and proves it just that every sinner should perish, <hi>by five Reasons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. Because there is no respect of persons with God, that hee should exempt from condemnation those that persevere in sin, whether Jews or Gentiles, for any reason which appertains to the person, not the cause. And here it is to bee observed, that God looks with an equal eye upon the Jew and Gentile out of Christ, not in the degrees of punishment, but in the guilt of eternal death, which all sinners are worthy of, although not in the like degree.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 12.</hi> For as many as have sinned without Law, do by nature the things contained in the Law, those ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving not the Law, shall be judged by the Law.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 2. This confirms and unfolds the other, because they that have sinned without the Law (<hi>scil.</hi> written) A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Law, written upon their hearts by nature, even by the same Law within them, shall perish without the written Law by the sentence of Justice. And whoever have sinned in the Law, or in the knowledge of the Law written, shall bee condemned even by the sentence of the written Law.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 13.</hi> (For not the hearers of the Law are just be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, but the doers of the Law shall be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.)</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 3. Especially intended against the Jews, who according to the rule of Righteousness, cannot bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for Righteous before God, even they that are hearers of the Law, unless they perform perfect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Law, which because neither Jew nor Gentile can do, by consequence neither can they bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from deserved condemnation; but on the contrary, especially the Jews, which are hearers of the Law, and do not keep it, are most worthy of judgement.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 14.</hi> For when the Gentiles which have not the Law, do by nature the things contained in the Law, these having not the Law, are a Law unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves:</p>
                  <p n="15">
                     <hi>15.</hi> Which shew the work of the Law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean while accusing, or else excusing one another.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 4. Especially intended against the Gentiles, which though they have not the written Law, yet they have a Law within them, and by nature do some external works of the Law, although they have not the written
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49391:8"/>
Law, yet that Law within them is a Law, and that really and indeed written upon their hearts, as their consciences witness, accusing them when they do ill, and excusing them when they do well; Therefore they have nothing to pretend why they should not undergo deserved condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, when they sin, much less the Jews.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 16.</hi> In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ, according to my Gospel.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 5. Because in the day of judgement God will bring forth the secrets of the heart, and according to this my doctrine in the Gospel, will pronounce the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of sinners to bee just, whether Jews or Gentiles; Therefore they cannot bee excused who sin, but perish by their own just desert.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 17.</hi> Behold thou art called a Jew, and restest in the Law, and makest thy boast of God,</p>
                  <p n="18">
                     <hi>18.</hi> And knowest his will, and approvest the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the Law,</p>

               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>The third Objection.</hi> But something must bee allowed to the priviledges of the Jews, that they come not into the like condemnation with the Gentiles; And here hee seems to conflict with some principal teacher of the Law, and Patron of Righteousness by works, and brings forth seven props of his vain confidence, by way of concession granting all. (1) The first that hee grants is, the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal honour of a worshiper of God: <hi>Thou art called a Jew,</hi> which was a name not of Nation only, but of a confessor of the true Religion. (2) A submission of mind to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Law: <hi>Thou restest in the Law,</hi> and thou ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaudest thy self in this, as an eminent benefit. (3) <hi>Thou makest thy boast in God,</hi> viz. that thou art of that people, chosen above all other Nations, &amp; in Covenant with God, <hi>vers.</hi> 17. (4) The knowledge of Gods will, taken out of the Law. (5) The discerning of good and evil, and of things that differ, and controversies, by the benefit of the same Law, <hi>verse</hi> 18. (6) The confidence of such abundant knowledge, and certainty, that they could teach others. (7) That they had a systeme and collection of that knowledge, which was here and there contained in the Law, and that all the rest besides this our <hi>Rabbi,</hi> are infants and foolish, <hi>verse</hi> 19, 20.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 21.</hi> Thou therefore that teachest another, teachest thou not thy self? Thou that preachest a man should not steal, doest thou steal?</p>
                  <p n="22">
                     <hi>22.</hi> Thou that sayest a man should not commit adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, doest thou commit adultery? Thou that ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrest idols, doest thou commit sacriledge?</p>

                     <hi>23.</hi> Thou that makest thy boast of the Law, through breaking the Law dishonourest thou God?</p>
               </q>
               <p>The Apostle answers the Objection, and all these being granted, hee shews them insufficient to righteousness, by two Reasons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. Because thou doest not teach thy self, <hi>i. e.</hi> thou dost not shew forth thy doctrine by thy deeds, but either pollutest thy self with those vices, or the like, which thou forbiddest in others. Therefore those things suffice not to free thee from condemnation.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 24.</hi> For the Name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles, through you, as it is written.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 2. Confirming the former, Because through your fault the Gentiles speak evil of God, as if hee had or could bear prophane worshipers: Therefore the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited priviledges make nothing to Righteousness.</p>
               <p>This reason hee confirmes by the testimony of <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 36.22. who complains of the Hypocrites of his time, boasting in the same priviledges.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 25.</hi> For Circumcision verily profiteth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>f thou keep the Law; but if thou be a breaker of the Law, thy Circumcision is made uncircumcision.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>The fourth Objection.</hi> But because of the Covenant of God, the sign whereof is Circumcision, I shall not perish, who am circumcised, saith the Jew, confiding in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Ceremony.</p>
               <p>The Apostle answers and proves, that Circumcision does not exempt us from condemnation, or death, by four Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. Because Circumcision if it bee joyned with perfect obedience to all the rest of the commandements, if it could bee, it would profit as a part of that obedience to justification by works, for which the Jew did contend; but if the transgression of the Law bee found in him that is circumcised, as touching justification by works, circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision and uncircumcision will bee the same; Therefore circumcision exempts not from condemnation.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 26.</hi> Therefore, if the uncircumcision keep the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of the Law; shall not this uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 2. Because the Gentiles uncircumcision joyned with perfect obedience to the Law, if it could bee, shall bee of the same account with the Jews circumcision; If so bee God require to justification by works nothing but a perfect observation of the Moral Law; Therefore cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision frees not from condemnation.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 27.</hi> And shall not uncircumcision, which is by nature, if it fulfil the Law, judge thee, who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 3. Because the Gentile being by nature uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised, if it was possible that hee could keep the Moral Law, compared with thee who are outwardly circumcised, and yet transgressest the Law, by thy own judgement, hee shall argue thee worthy of condemnation; Therefore cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision doth not free from condemnation.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 28.</hi> But he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly, neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh.</p>
                  <p n="29">
                     <hi>29.</hi> But hee is a Jew which is one inwardly, and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> in the letter, whose praise is not of men, but of God.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 4. Because neither the outward profession of the true Religion (long ago erected among the Jewes by God himself) is to be accounted for a <hi>true</hi> profession of the <hi>true</hi> Religion, nor outward Circumcision of the flesh is to bee reckoned for true Circumcision, <hi>ver.</hi> 28. But hee is a <hi>true</hi> Professor of the <hi>true</hi> Religion, who is such an one in the Spirit; and that is true Circumcision which is of the heart, spiritual in the inward soul, and not that which is outwardly in the body, or the letter, which is commonly called Circumcision. He that is a Jew indeed, and that which is true and spiritual Circumcision, hath commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation and praise, not only among men, (who only see things that are open and manifest) but with God, who looks into the heart: Therefore outward Circumcision perfects not our righteousness, nor frees any man from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, <hi>ver.</hi> 29.</p>

                  <p>THere are two parts of this Chapter; in the FIRST he answers five objections against the foresaid Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, to <hi>ver. 9.</hi> In the SECOND part, he proceeds to prove the POSITION, touching JUSTIFICATION NOT BY WORKS, BVT BY FAITH.</p>
               </argument>
               <q>
                  <p>Ver. 1. <hi>What advantage then hath the Iew? or what profit is there of Circumcision?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Much every way; chiefly, because unto them were committed the Oracles of God.</hi>
                  </p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>The</hi> first <hi>objection</hi> is, from this Doctrine some might say, then the Jew hath no prerogative above the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, nor is there any profit of Circumcision, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. Hee answers, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. that this is the principal and chief privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49391:8"/>
of the Jewes; that the Covenant was made with the Jewes, and this Nation had the custody of the holy Scriptures, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Tables of the Covenant committed to them of God, and the Jewes were made Depositaries, (Treasurers) which was a singular benefit, and a famous honour.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 3.</hi> For what if some did not believe; shall their unbelief make the Faith of God without effect?</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>The second Object.</hi> But they are fallen from that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, because they have not believed the Oracles of God, and so the Faith of God given in that Covenant is made void; to which hee answers <hi>four</hi> wayes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First</hi>; It follows not that the faithful Promises of God made to this Nation were void, because some of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved not.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 4.</hi> God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a lyar; as it is written, That thou mightest bee justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly</hi>; He answers, by detesting the Objection, because it is absurd to imagine, that God should fail our Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly</hi>; He answers, by laying down a most true as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion to the contrary, that God is to bee avouched al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes true, and that every man by nature is a lyar.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly</hi>; That the sins of men, and their lyes, are no hindrance to God in the performing of his Promise, but rather serve to illustrate his Truth, Mercy and Justice; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause by how much the greater and more the sins of men are, so much the more is the Justice of God eminent when hee punisheth, and his mercy and truth when hee spares; which hee confirms out of <hi>Psal.</hi> 51.4. Where <hi>David</hi> in the Confession of his sins, commends the truth of God, and pronounceth God alwayes to overcome when hee judges, as often as any one Undertakes to judge of what hee doth, or saith.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 5.</hi> But if our unrighteousness commend the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of God, what shall wee say? Is God unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous who taketh vengeance? (I speak as a man.)</q>
               <p>The <hi>third Object.</hi> From the words of the Psalm per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to blasphemy; If our sins illustrate the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God, then God seems to be unrighteous, who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venges those sins whereby hee is glorified. This is object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Apostle in the person of a man, ignorant of God.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 6.</hi> God forbid; for then how shall God judge the world?</q>
               <p>Hee <hi>answers</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (1) By rejecting the Objection as blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous; <hi>God forbid,</hi> saith hee.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) Hee <hi>answers,</hi> by giving a reason why hee rejects the Objection; Because it is impossible that hee which shall judge the world should be unjust.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 7.</hi> For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lye unto his glory; why also yet am I judged as a sinner?</p>
                  <p n="8">
                     <hi>8.</hi> And not rather as wee bee slanderously report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and as some affirm that wee say, Let us do evil, that good may come; whose damnation is just.</p>
               </q>
               <p>The <hi>fourth Objection,</hi> urging the former: If by my sin, to wit, my lye, the truth of God is more glorified, I am not only not to be condemned for sin, but I may fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after it, that the glory of God may bee more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. In <hi>answer,</hi> hee saith (1) They were malicious slanderers that thus charged the Apostles Doctrine; <hi>Let us do evil, that good may come of it.</hi> Hee <hi>answers.</hi> (2) That these calumniators, and those that teach and follow this Doctrine, <hi>doing evil, that good may come,</hi> were justly to bee condemned of God.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 9.</hi> What then? Are wee better than they? No, in no wise; for wee have before proved both Iewes and Gentiles, that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y are all under sin.</q>
               <p>The <hi>fift Object.</hi> But by this Doctrine wee Jewes have no preheminence of the Gentiles, to wit, in the matter of <hi>Iustification by Works,</hi> which is the principal question.</p>
               <p>Hee <hi>answers,</hi> that in this respect the Jew is no better than the Gentile, and hee renders a reason of it, because hitherto wee have proved that both Jewes and Greeks are under sin.</p>

                  <head>The second Part.</head>
                  <p>In the second part of the Chapter hee returns to prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the Dispute concerning <hi>Iustification,</hi> not by <hi>works</hi> but by <hi>faith.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Argument</hi> 4. Concerning Justification not by works, but by faith: The Scripture witnesseth, that all men are under sin, and liable to condemnation, to <hi>ver.</hi> 20. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no man is justified by the works of the Law, <hi>ver.</hi> 20.</p>
                  <p>The testimonies of Scripture are six: (1) Out of <hi>Psa.</hi> 14.1, 2, 3. and <hi>Psalm</hi> 53.1, 2, 3. where the Prophet speaking of the unregenerate in his time, and of all in their natural estate out of Christ, pronounceth; <hi>first,</hi> that no man is righteous, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. <hi>Secondly,</hi> that all are blind, and ignorant of the things which make for their Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> that there were none which were affected with a desire of knowing, or worshipping, or having any communion with God, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> that all were guilty of Original Apostasie from God, and his known Will. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> that all were unprofitable, polluted, abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable, by reason of the filthiness of their wickednesses. <hi>Sixthly,</hi> that there were none, <hi>viz.</hi> of those that were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerated, that did any good, and by consequence that there was none but did evil, and only evil; for when hee does the work commanded, not to God commanding, being unregenerate, hee serves himself, and sacrificeth to his own idols.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 13.</hi> Their throat is an open sepulchre, with their tongues they have used deceit, the poyson of Aspes is under their lips.</q>
                  <p>The <hi>second</hi> testimony is from <hi>Psalm</hi> 5.9. wherein <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> under the type of his enemies, condemns all unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate men, or men not reconciled to God, of impurity of heart, from whence proceeds nothing but that which is abominable and loathsome unto God; that the throat of every one is as a Sepulchre newly opened, sending forth a pestilential smell of wicked thoughts, out of whose mouth comes forth nothing but pestilent, injurious and deceitful speeches.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Poyson</hi>] The <hi>third</hi> testimony is from <hi>Psalm</hi> 140.3. In which the same is confirmed of <hi>Davids</hi> enemies, which were types of persons unreconciled unto God, in that they are alwayes ready to send out from their mouths, as from a quiver, poysonful speeches, no less hurtful than the poyson of Aspes.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 14.</hi> Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness.</q>
                  <p>The <hi>fourth</hi> testimony is from <hi>Psalm</hi> 10.7. to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said sense, wherein the Psalmist complains of the natural man, that his mouth is full of cursing, and reproachful words, whereby the glory of God, and the fame of our Neighbour is wronged.</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>The <hi>fifth</hi> testimony is from <hi>Psalm</hi> 59.7, 8. In which unregenerate men are pronounced guilty of cruelty, vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, oppression and man-slaughter, who create nothing but misery and destruction to themselves and others, in the whole course of their lives, who are very far from procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring peace, or any thing that is good, either to themselves or others.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>sixth</hi> testimony is from <hi>Psalm</hi> 36.2. Wherein un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49391:9"/>
men by their deeds, are condemned of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaness and contempt of God; for seeing they are void of the fear of God, there is nothing to restrain them from falling headlong into all kind of wickedness.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 19.</hi> Now wee know that what things soever the Law saith, it saith to them that are under the Law; that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.</q>
                  <p>Hee prevents an <hi>Objection,</hi> lest any man should elude the force of the testimonies before recited, as if they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed but to some few, and those certain impious men, who lived in the times of <hi>David</hi> or <hi>Isaias.</hi> Here hee shews that the common disposition of mankind is taxed, which live unde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 20.</hi> Therefore by the deeds of the Law, there shall no flesh bee justified in his sight, for by the Law is the knowledge of sin.</q>
                  <p>The <hi>third</hi> conclusion and principal, drawn from the fore-cited testimonies; <hi>therefore</hi> by the works of the Law no flesh shall bee justified in the sight of God, for it mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not, that some may bee justified by their works before men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For by the Law] Argument</hi> 5. Serving to prove the same assertion: All men are convinced of sin, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the Law; for by the Law is the knowledge of sin, not a procurer of righteousness to any one: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no man is justified by the works of the Law.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Vers. 21.</hi> But know, the righteousness of God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Law is manifested, being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets.</p>
                     <p n="22">
                        <hi>22.</hi> Even the righteousness of God, which is by the Faith of Iesus Christ unto all, and upon all them that believe, for there is no difference.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 6. Tending to the asserting of the affirmative part of the position. Now in the Gospel, the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God is manifested without the works of the Law, approved by the testimony of Scripture, to wit, that the righteousness of God, which is imputed and given to all believers, apprehending by Faith the righteousness of Christ Jesus, without distinction of Nations or persons; therefore by this Righteousness alone, which is through Faith in Jesus Christ, are wee justified. The Argument is good, for if wee cannot bee justified by the works of the Law, and yet there is another way to justify us found out, to wit, that which God commends to us in the Law, and in the Prophets: As for example, when hee hath said in the Law, <hi>In the Seed of</hi> Abraham <hi>all Nations shall bee blessed:</hi> And in the Prophets, <hi>The Iust shall live by Faith.</hi> It's fitting wee should believe our selves to bee justified only upon this latter ground, to wit, by Faith.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, seeing wee can conceive only a two-fold Righteousness; one is of the <hi>Law,</hi> or of works inherent, or a mans own righteousness; another, which is <hi>Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical,</hi> called the Righteousness of Faith, or the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of Christ imputed unto us, to wit, that Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness which hee imputes to all that believe: After the exclusion of the former Righteousness, that being now impossible, the other is of necessity to bee admitted, which is commended to us in the Old Testament, now revealed in the New, and only is possible and acceptable to God, deserving alone the name of <hi>Righteousness.</hi>

Wherein is shewed the common disease of all men, as also the necessity of the common remedy; all men without exception have sinned, and by Law are shut out from the glory of God, or Eternal Life; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all are no otherwise justified but freely, or by Divine Grace through the Redemption of Jesus Christ; that is to say, they cannot otherwayes bee justified, than by Faith in Christ the Redeemer, who by his Blood hath purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed for us Righteousness and Salvation, and hath freely of his Grace made it ours.</p>

God hath set forth Christ that hee might bee a Reconcilement, and Propitiatory Sacrifice, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the wrath of God is appeased towards all that lay hold on him by Faith; therefore it is not possible that a man should be justified, but by Faith in Christ, offering up this attonement in his Blood, unless God should alter the means of appeasing himself.</p>

God in this present time of the Gospel hath set forth Christ as the means of appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing his anger, to those that imbrace it by Faith, that by this way of justifying, his Righteousness might bee mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest in the time past, in his forbearance and forgiveness of sins past, which from the beginning of the world hee hath forborn and forgiven, to wit, that God did not pardon the sins of his own, but upon the account of the Propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atory Sacrifice of Christ, which was to come, and that without any violation of his Justice: Therefore this ground of our Justification is no less to bee asserted, than the glory of Gods Justice is to bee manifested. The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is clear: For if Justification by Faith in the Blood of Christ, shews that God never pardoned sins, but upon sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction made to his Justice by the Blood of Christ, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly hee would have the righteousness of God concealed, that would determine any other ground of our Justification than by Faith.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That hee might bee just</hi>] This confirms the Argument, that God hath set forth Christ, that hee might bee a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation through Faith in his Blood; not only that hee might declare himself just in sending the promised Messi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, for whose sake freely and also justly hee would pardon sin, but that hee might shew himself the Author and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of true Righteousness to us, (that were without any righteousness of our own) by believing in Jesus Christ: Therefore this ground of our Justification by Faith, is no less to bee maintained, than the glory of Gods Justice, Faithfulness and Goodness, to bee declared in justifying Believers.</p>

Because <hi>by the Law of Faith,</hi> or the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, which requires Faith to our Justification by the Righteousness of another, mans boasting in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self is excluded, and not <hi>by the Law of Works,</hi> or the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works, which exacts perfect obedience, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords matter of boasting to men in their Inherent Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness; <hi>Therefore</hi> (saith hee) <hi>wee conclude<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that a man is Iustified by Faith without the Works of the Law.</hi> The Argument is good: For if men were Justified by their Works, and Inherent Righteousness, they might boast of the meritorious cause of their Justification to bee in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; but they that are Justified by Faith, are compelled to renounce their own Inherent Righteousness, and to place their only Confidence in the imputation of the Righteousness of Christ, and solely in the grace of God.</p>

To which hee <hi>answers,</hi> That it's common to both, whereof he adds a reason, because there is <hi>one God</hi> of those that are Justified; therefore there must bee but one way of justifying all, to wit, by Faith, or of Faith. For if hee should Justifie the Jews upon one ground, and the Gentiles upon another, God would seem to differ from Himself in communicating Righteousness and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to sinners, both to Jews and Gentiles, which is absurd.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 31.</hi> Do wee then make void the Law through Faith? God forbid; yea, wee establish the Law.</q>
                  <p>Another question is, Whether the Doctrine of Faith, or Justification by Faith, makes the Law of none effect, or to bee given in vain, while it is denied that men are Justified by the Law? Hee answers, that the Law is no wayes rendred void, but is rather established by the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Faith; for Faith, or the Doctrine of Faith, establishes the Law three wayes. <hi>First,</hi> in respect to the threatnings, shewing that Christ was dead by the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Law, that hee might satisfie the Law, and that wee were lyable to death, unless freed from it by Christ. <hi>Secondly,</hi> in respect to the Precepts, because hee demonstrates that perfect obedience was yeelded to the Law, in the Righteousness of Christ. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Faith establishes the Law in respect to Believers, because being justified by Faith, by virtue of Christ, they are initiated into new obedience, who before they were justified by Faith, could do nothing but sin.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>UNto the <hi>twelfth Chapter</hi> the Apostle illustrates, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends, and further by many Arguments establishes this Divine ground of our Iustification by Faith, not by Works. Wee, for the more easie method, shall make the Confirmation of this Doctrine seven-fold.</p>
                  <p>The first Confirmation of Iustification by <hi>Faith,</hi> which is contained in this Chapter, is chiefly from the example of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the ground of whose Iustification is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, both to Iews and Gentiles, whose Faith is set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us all of God for a pattern.</p>
                  <p>There are <hi>three</hi> parts of the Chapter. In the <hi>first,</hi> the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Iustification is set down, <hi>to ver. 9.</hi> In the <hi>second,</hi> hee proves this ground of Iustification to bee common both to Iews and Gentiles, <hi>to ver. 18.</hi> In the <hi>third,</hi> the Faith of <hi>Abraham</hi> is commended to the use of Believers, <hi>to the end of the Chapter.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 1.</hi> What shall wee say then, that <hi>Abraham</hi> our Father, as pertaining to the flesh, hath found?</q>
               <p>So much as pertains to the example of <hi>Abraham,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the form of an interrogation, hee denies that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was justified according to the flesh, or by the Law of Works, or Inherent Righteousness, which is called <hi>flesh, Galat.</hi> 3.3. in respect to the Spiritual Righteousness of Christ: From whence it follows that no man is justified by Works.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 2.</hi> For if <hi>Abraham</hi> were justified by Works, hee hath whereof to glory, but not before God.</q>
               <p>This <hi>Thesis</hi> concerning <hi>Abraham,</hi> is asserted by five Reasons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 1. If <hi>Abraham</hi> was justified by Works, hee hath whereof hee may glory, but not before God; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee is not justified by Works before God. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is sufficient; because boasting in our selves is not taken away by the Law of Works, but by the Law of Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.27. For in the question before men, Whether <hi>Abraham</hi> is just, <hi>Abraham</hi> can produce his Works, and boast, saying, I will shew thee my Works; and so hee shall bee justified before men by his Works: But the question is, Whether hee bee righteous before God, whereupon hee must renounce his own works, and fly to the Promise of Blessedness in Christ, to come of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> Seed, that hee might bee justified in Christ by Faith alone.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 3.</hi> For what saith the Scripture? <hi>Abraham</hi> hath believed God, and it was counted to him for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 2. The Scripture testifies, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.6. that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> was justified by Faith, or that Righteousness was imputed to him by Faith; therefore hee was justified by Faith, not by Works.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 4.</hi> Now to him that worketh, is the reward not reckoned of Grace, but of debt.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 3. The reward cannot bee of Grace, but of debt, to him that seeks after righteousness by his works; wee may assume thus, But to <hi>Abraham</hi> it was imputed of Grace. Therefore <hi>Abraham</hi> did not mercenarily seek after righteousness by the works of the Law.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 5.</hi> But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his Faith is counted for righteousness.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 4. To this purpose Faith is imputed for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness to him that is not mercenary, but renouncing his own righteousness, believes in God, who freely justifies the ungodly that flees to Christ Jesus; But such was the Faith of <hi>Abraham.</hi> Therefore <hi>Abraham</hi> was not justified by works before God, but Faith was imputed to him for righteousness; or the Blessing promised in Christ to come, received through Faith by <hi>Abraham,</hi> was imputed to him for righteousness.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 6.</hi> Even as <hi>David</hi> also describeth the blessedness of the man unto whom God imputed righteousness without works,</p>
                  <p n="7">
                     <hi>7.</hi> Saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and whose sins are covered.</p>
                  <p n="8">
                     <hi>8.</hi> Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute sin.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 5. <hi>David</hi> testifies, <hi>Psalm</hi> 32.12. that Blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is given to him, to whom Righteousness is imputed without works, and whose righteousness consists not in good works, but in the forgiveness of sins: therefore such was of necessity the Justification of <hi>Abraham</hi>: consisting not in the perfection of his works<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but in the remission of his sins. Understand the same of the Justification of all, which the Apostle even now hath shewed.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 9.</hi> Cometh this Blessedness then on the Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion only, or upon the uncircumcision also? for wee say, that Faith was reckoned to <hi>Abraham</hi> for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness.</q>

                  <p>The <hi>second</hi> part of the Chapter, wherein hee proves this to bee the ground of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Justification, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Eternal Life, (to wit, by Faith) is common to the uncircumcision, or the Gentiles, and to Circumcision; or the Jews. The <hi>question</hi> is propounded in this verse, the <hi>answer</hi> whereof follows, till hee hath proved it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon both to Jews and Gentiles.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. <hi>Abraham</hi> received from God the Sign of Circumcision, as a Seal of the Covenant of Grace, or the Righteousness of Faith, which hee had yet being uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised, to that end, that hee might bee the Father as well of the Faithful that were uncircumcised, as of those that were circumcised, which were the children of the flesh, and also of the Faith of <hi>Abraham.</hi> Therefore the righteousness of Faith is common to Believers, both cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised and uncircumcised, or those that follow the steps of the Faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> not yet circumcised. <hi>Abraham</hi> is called the Father of the Faithful, because hee was the first eminent example of Faith, the Righteousness which is imputed by Faith, and by his example, a Leader to all, that they may believe.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 13.</hi> For the promise that hee should bee the heir of the world, was not to <hi>Abraham,</hi> or to his Seed through the Law, but through righteousness of Faith.</q>
                  <p>Hee proves that <hi>Abraham</hi> was not the Father of any but Believers, both circumcised, and uncircumcised; and with this hee adds a <hi>third Argument:</hi> The Promise was made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to his Seed, that hee should bee afterwards heir of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> in a <hi>type,</hi> and of the World and Heaven, in <hi>truth,</hi> being restored to that right which <hi>Adam</hi> lost; and hee came not to this by the Law, or upon the condition of works, but by the absolute Promise, being j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>y Faith, or having the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of Faith; therefore his children are not they which are by the Law, looking for righteousness by Works, but only they which are of Faith, looking for righteousness by Faith; <hi>i. e.</hi> All and only they that believe, circumcised and uncircumcised, who have an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual community in the righteousness of Faith, and the promise of the inheritance. The <hi>Argument</hi> is valid; for if Father <hi>Abraham</hi> is not heir of the world, and hath any righteousness but by Faith, certainly none are his sons but the faithful, who have their righteousness by Faith, and from Righteousness the Inheritance.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 14.</hi> For if they which are of the Law bee heirs, Faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 4. This confirms the former <hi>Argument:</hi> If those which are of the Law, or seek Righteousness by Works, are the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and heirs of Life, and partakers of Righteousness, then Faith is vain, and the Promise is void: But this is absurd; therefore they which are of the Law, are not heirs, but only Believers are the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and heirs of Righteousness and Life. The <hi>Argument</hi> is strong, for if Righteousness and the Inheritance are given through Faith and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, then they are freely given: But if by the works of the Law, then of debt, and merit, and not of grace, for merit or debt leaves no place for free grace, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, makes faith and the promise void.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 15.</hi> Because the Law worketh wrath; for where no Law is, there is no transgression.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 5. Confirming the former, the Law worketh wrath to them that seek for Righteousness by their Works, <hi>i. e.</hi> it pronounceth condemnation and death up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the guilty for their transgressions, which should bee none, if there was no Law. Therefore they that are of the Law, are not heirs of Righteousness and Life, but all and only they which are of Faith, both circumcised and uncircumcised.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 16.</hi> Therfore it is of Faith, that it might bee by Grace, to the end the Promise might bee to all the Seed, not to that only which is of the Law, but to that also which is of the Faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who is the Father of us all.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 6. God hath determined that the Inheritance should bee of Faith, to this end, that it might appear to bee of Grace, or through Grace; therefore all and only Believers, circumcised, and uncircumcised, are heirs. The <hi>Argument</hi> is good, because Faith and Grace concur, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually standing and falling together: Faith is wholly maintained by Grace, which Grace is only promised and given to them that believe. It being granted, that the Inheritance is through Grace, it follows, to bee through Faith also; and it being granted that it is through Faith, it follows, that it is by Grace also, and that Believers are heirs only through Grace.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That it might bee firm] Argum.</hi> 7. The Inheritance is of Faith, and by Grace, that the Promise might bee firm to all the Seed, not only to that which is of the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> by the Law of Nature, and with all Believers, <hi>i. e.</hi> to the believing circumcised Jews; but also to that seed which is not after the flesh, but only of the Faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that is, to the believing uncircumcised Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles. Therefore unless wee would make the Promise of Righteousness, and the Inheritance (hanging it upon the condition of performing the Law) infirm and uncertain, the whole Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> (or all and only they that believe, both circumcised and uncircumcised) are heirs by Faith with Father <hi>Abraham,</hi> who according to Faith, is the Father of all us that believe, both Jews and Gentiles. The matter is clear, because the Law, or the condition of Works, would render the Promise of the Inheritance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, and altogether uncertain, seeing that whatever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon our works can no wise bee firm, both because wee are mutable, as also the condition of works, by reason of our infirmity, is impossible; but that which is of Grace, that which is by Faith, that which is in Christ, is necessarily firm, because it leans upon the unchangeable good pleasure of God, and the Merit of Christ.</p>

                     </gap>e grounds upon which the Faith of <hi>Abraham</hi> is commended, are six.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because <hi>Abraham</hi> (through his Faith) by the special Sentence of God, is declared the Father of many Nations, and so the Father of us that believe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Faith: For as <hi>Abraham</hi> begat <hi>Isaac</hi> by virtue of the Divine Promise, and not by the power of Nature; even so by virtue of the Divine Promise, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing that hee should bee the Father of many Nations, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> took all Believers into the number of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, to bee reckoned amongst his Seed. And thus in the virtue of the Promise, hee begot, or conceived the Faithful, as Children of the Promise; which hee shews more clearly, by calling <hi>Abraham</hi> the <hi>Father</hi> of the Faithful, not only <hi>before God,</hi> or in the <hi>sight of God,</hi> that is, after a spiritual manner, and in the account of God, but also to the <hi>likeness</hi> of God, by a kind of simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude answering to God, whom hee believed; for in the Act of Faith, <hi>Abraham</hi> standing in the light of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of God Almighty who spake unto him, believed the Promise. Those sons which God promised, hee look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon as present by Faith: And thus after a sort hee became the Father of them, after the similitude of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quickning] Reason</hi> 2. Because <hi>Abraham</hi> by Faith fixed his eyes upon the truth and Omnipotency of God effectually bringing life out of death, and a beeing out of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49391:10"/>
nothing; and effectually calling things that were not yet, as if they were or had a beeing; to which Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Truth when <hi>Abraham</hi> believed, his Faith put on a kind of similitude to the Truth of God Almighty.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 18.</hi> Who against hope believed in hope, that hee might become the Father of many Nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall thy Seed bee.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 3. Because <hi>Abraham</hi> believed <hi>in</hi> Spiritual <hi>hope, i. e.</hi> hee had in his heart a firm and invincible confidence, with a lively and strong hope of the promised issue: <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst hope, viz.</hi> of the flesh, and natural reason, which did object nothing but impossibility, and as it were affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that they could not bee his Seed, as God had spoken.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 19.</hi> And being not weak in Faith, hee considered not his own body now dead, when hee was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of <hi>Sarah</hi>'s womb.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 4. Because hee was not weak in faith; hee did not consider, or did not stand upon those impediments that lay before his Faith, from himself and his wife, as now dead, in respect to natural generation, but rather magnified the power and faithfulness of God which had promised.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 20.</hi> Hee staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief, but was strong in Faith, giving glory to God.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 5. Because hee disputed not against the Promise, not was stopt by those objections, which unbelief suggest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but valiantly defended the Promise of God, and set himself against temptations, ascribing to God the glory of his truth and Omnipotency.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 21.</hi> And being fully perswaded, that what hee had promised, hee was also able to perform.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 6. Because hee gave to God speaking, the glory of his truth, out of a most full perswasion of Gods power for the performance of his Promise. For the Promise once made, there is no doubt to bee made of his will to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form what hee promiseth: But the question which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, is touching the Power of him that promiseth. Which question being laid aside, <hi>Abraham</hi> rests in the promise of him whom hee knew to bee Almighty.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 22.</hi> And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 7. Wherein the Faith of <hi>Abraham</hi> is commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in that his Faith (by this act shewing it self to bee <hi>true,</hi> such a Faith which uniteth, humbled and emptied man (in the sight of God) to God that promiseth) was imputed to him for righteousness.

                  </q>
                  <p>Now the Apostle shews forth the example of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Faith, fitted to the common use of Believers, giving a pledge as it were by this example, promising that our Faith in Christ Jesus, in like manner, should bee imputed unto us for righteousness. And that hee might invite us to believe, hee <hi>first</hi> compares the Gospel (ministred unto us in the Name of God, touching the Death and Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christ for us) to the promise made unto <hi>Abraham</hi>: And further, hee requires of us Faith in God, who offers us this grace by the preaching of the Gospel, that wee might believe with <hi>Abraham.</hi> And lastly, hee affirms our Faith in God, who hath willingly satisfied himself in the death of Christ, whom hee hath raised also from the dead (that hee might impute, and apply to us, the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness obtained by the death of Christ) no less certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to bee imputed unto us for righteousness, than it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that <hi>Abrahams</hi> Faith was imputed to him for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness; and so sure it is that this was not written for his sake alone, but for us, to whom in like manner this Faith was to bee imputed for righteousness.</p>

                     <hi>Vers. 25.</hi> Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our Iustification.</q>
                  <p>Hee layes the foundation of this certainty in a twofold judicial act of God towards Christ. The <hi>first act</hi> is, the <hi>delivering</hi> up of Christ our Surety to death for our offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The <hi>other</hi> is, the <hi>raising</hi> of him for our Justification. In the <hi>first</hi> whereof, God testifies that the sins of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed were translated upon Christ by Covenant. And in the <hi>other,</hi> that hee is abundantly satisfied for their sins, and that the Redeemed in the person of their Surety are justified: From whence it follows, that to those who are Redeemed, (seeing they by Faith agree in this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant revealed in the Gospel) Faith is imputed to righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, or the Righteousness obtained by Christ is apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them, that as in the person of their Surety they are justified, so also they may bee justified in themselves.</p>

                  <p>The parts of the Chapter are two. In the first is propounded a consolation in repeating the several fruits of our Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness by Faith in Christ, to verse the sixth.

                  <hi>Vers. 1.</hi> Therefore being justified by Faith, wee have peace with God through our Lord Iesus Christ.</q>
               <p>The <hi>first</hi> part of the Chap. in which hee recites <hi>nine</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits or fruits, which depend upon each other, to shew the consolation, which Justification by Faith in Christ afford<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> to us.</p>
               <p>The <hi>first</hi> fruit is <hi>peace,</hi> or reconciliation with God, now appeased by our Mediator, or through Christ who hath made peace for us.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 2.</hi> By whom also wee have access by Faith into his Grace wherein wee stand:</q>
               <p>The <hi>second</hi> fruit, is a daily leading by the hand, as it were, through Christ by Faith, into the favour and grace of God, that wee might use and enjoy it more and more, and bee even wholly taken into it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Stand</hi>] The <hi>third</hi> fruit, is the confirmation of us in this state of grace, that wee may not fall from it, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly stand.</p>
               <p>And <hi>rejoyce</hi>] The <hi>fourth</hi> fruit, is a rejoycing in the most assured hope of enjoying of celestial glory hereafter with God.</p>

               <p>The <hi>fifth</hi> fruit, is a glorying in all tribulations, and that in the midst of afflictions, to which wee are lyable in this life, after wee are justified.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Knowing</hi>] The <hi>sixth</hi> fruit, is the giving occasion of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing in tribulations, upon a certain knowledge or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion of persevering in holiness by the Cross. Because thereby God teacheth us patience, and by patience in us, affords us new instructions of his grace towards us, giving us experience, and by experience encreaseth and confirms our faith, and hope of present and full freedome hereafter from tribulations.</p>

               <p>The <hi>seventh</hi> fruit, is a certainty of the possession of the good hoped for, or freedome from being ashamed, which the frustration of conceived hope causeth: for hope arising from Justifying Faith, after this manner stirred up and encreased, deceiveth not, nor maketh him that hopes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>The Spirit</hi>] The <hi>ninth</hi> fruit, is the Holy Ghost more plentifully given to us who believe in Christ, which Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit works in us this sense of Divine Love towards us, and witnesses together with our Spirits, that wee are the sons of God, and works in us all his other works belonging to Regeneration, Consolation and Salvation. All that are justified by Faith have right to all these priviledges: If there bee any that are Babes in Christ, or under any ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and know not that they are justified, and are not acquainted with the Consolations of the Spirit, and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row under their sins, no wonder that they receive no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort from these fruits.</p>

                  <p>The second part of the Chapter, wherein hee shews the solidity of Consolation against wrath and sin, by a two-fold comparison; whereof the <hi>first</hi> is of <hi>Christ</hi> with <hi>Christ; to ver.</hi> 12.

                  </p>
                  <p>There are three members of the comparison of <hi>Christ</hi> with <hi>Christ,</hi> wherein is proved, that they which are justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied shall bee saved from wrath, by three Arguments.</p>

                        </gap>st</hi> member of the comparison, is of the efficacy of Christs love towards us <hi>before</hi> Justification, with the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of his love towards us <hi>after</hi> our Justification. To this <hi>sense,</hi> when wee lay in misery and sin, destitute of all strength to deliver our selves, Christ in the fulness of time died for us sinners, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. Such great love amongst men is scarcely found towards a righteous man, unless per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance for a good man, and some way profitable to us, some would dare to die, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. Whereupon the love of Christ is commended to us from this, that when wee were yet sinners, not yet justified, Christ died for us, that wee might bee delivered from wrath, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. Therefore much more effectual shall the love of Christ bee towards us, now justified by his blood, that wee might bee delivered by him from wrath, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. The <hi>Argument</hi> is sufficient, because the love of Christ towards us now justified, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee less than it was towards us when wee lay in our sins. This is the first <hi>Argument.</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>second</hi> member of the comparison, is the efficacy of Christs <hi>death</hi> before Justification, and of his <hi>life</hi> after Justification, <hi>after this manner:</hi> If when wee were <hi>ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> the Death of Christ was effectual for the reconciling of us unto God, it shall bee effectual to free us from wrath now being justified and reconciled; because it is absurd to determine, that Christ being raised from the dead, and living in heaven, should not preserve us from wrath, for whom that wee might bee freed, hee both died and arose from the dead.

                     <hi>Vers. 11.</hi> And not only so, but wee also joy in God, through our Lord Iesus Christ, by whom wee have now received the attonement.</q>
                  <p>The <hi>third</hi> member of the comparison, is of the effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy or virtue of Christ to procure and effect, that God might bee ours, (as a thing properly our own) <hi>which is greater,</hi> with the virtue and efficacy of Christ to preserve us from wrath, <hi>which is less: To this sense,</hi> wee have not this advantage only by Christ, that wee should bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served from wrath, but that which is <hi>chi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And this is the <hi>third</hi> Argument. In all which is shewed the solid consolation of those which are justified by Faith.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 12.</hi> Wherefore, as by one man sin entred into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.</q>
                  <p>Another comparison is of Christ and <hi>Adam,</hi> tending to shew, that the righteousness of Christ is no less effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to save those that are justified by Faith, than the sin of <hi>Adam</hi> was of force to destroy those that are not justified. There are <hi>six</hi> parts of the Comparison.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>first, As by one man, viz.</hi> Adam, <hi>sin entred into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men</hi> that are the sons of <hi>Adam</hi> by nature, in as much as in him, as in a common parent, <hi>all have sinned</hi>; so by one man Christ Jesus, <hi>the second Adam,</hi> Righteousness entred into the world, and Life by Righteousness, and so life was communicated to all men which are the sons of Christ by grace, (such as all are which are justified by Faith) in as much as in him, as in a common parent, surety, and advocate, all are justified. This Antithesis remains to bee collected from what follows, and especially from the end of <hi>ver.</hi> 14. where Christ is made the <hi>Anti-type</hi> of <hi>Adam,</hi> because hee is the Gate and Fountain of Righteousness and Life, as <hi>Adam</hi> was the Gate and Fountain of sin and death.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vers. 13.</hi> For until the Law sin was in the world, but sin is not imputed when there is no Law.</p>
                     <p n="14">
                        <hi>14.</hi> Nevertheless, death reigned from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moses,</hi> even over them that had not sinned after the simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of <hi>Adams</hi> transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>Hee proves that sin entred into the world, by one man <hi>Adam,</hi> and was propagated to his posterity: For from <hi>Adam,</hi> to the Law written by <hi>Moses,</hi> sin was in the world, and imputed; and that could not bee, unless there had been some Law, at least <hi>unwritten,</hi> and <hi>innate</hi>; for had there been no Law, neither <hi>written</hi> nor <hi>innate,</hi> sin could not bee imputed, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. but it was imputed, because the punishment was inflicted: If so bee the wages of sin is death, it reigned from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moses,</hi> not only over those that were of riper years, but also over infants, which sinned originally in him, (seeing all men were in <hi>Adam</hi> one man) though not actually, or after the simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of <hi>Adams</hi> actual transgression, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. The sum of all is, there was death, the wages of sin, therefore there was sin, therefore a Law, and sin from one passed unto all. Hee calls <hi>Adam</hi> a <hi>type</hi> of him that was to come, viz. of the second <hi>Adam, Christ,</hi> that wee might under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand how Christ ought to answer in his saving effects, to those destructive effects of <hi>Adam,</hi> and that by the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of God, who would represent Christ the Saviour of men, in the lost original of mankind, that Christ might bee no less acknowledged the Fountain, Head, and Root of Righteousness and Life, to bee derived to those that are his, as <hi>Adam</hi> was the Fountain, Head and Root of propagating sin and death to his.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>second</hi> member of the Comparison wherein they disagree, which is first briefly propounded, afterward more largely explained. The offence is not like the gift

of God, for that <hi>good</hi> which proceeds from God, is of <hi>Divine</hi> efficacy and virtue, therefore infinitely surpasses the <hi>evil</hi> which is from man: Wherefore if the offence of one man, <hi>i. e.

                     </gap>n Jesus Christ, who also is God, shall abundantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey life to them which are spiritually born of Christ. The sum of all is, Hee would have us know, that the grace of Christ is more potent to save, than the sin of <hi>Adam</hi> to destroy; and the gifts which are bestowed through the grace of God, are more excellent than those which <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> lost.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 16.</hi> And not as it was by one that sinned, so was the gift; for the judgement was by one to condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but the free gift is of many offences unto Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification.</q>
                  <p>The <hi>third</hi> branch of the Comparison, shewing the dissimilitude between the evil that entred only by <hi>Adam</hi> sinning, and the gift, which is by Jesus Christ; because the just judgement of God from one sin of <hi>Adam,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to the just condemnation of himself, and of all, that by the Law of Nature were comprehended in his loyns: But grace, or the free gift of God, not only frees us from that one Original sin, but from a multitude of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual sins committed by every one, to a full justification from all sin. The sum of all is, condemnation is from one offence, but the gift of grace is an acquittal from all offences.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 17.</hi> For if by one mans offence death reigned by one, much more they which receive abundance of grace, and the gift of righteousness, shall reign in life by one, Iesus Christ.</q>

                  <p>Hee illustrates and concludes this whole comparison, by shewing the abundance of sin in those that are justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, renders the grace of Christ more illustrious; and this hee does by answering an objection concerning the end and use of the published Law.</p>
                  <p>It may bee questioned, if death reigned by the Law of Nature, not written before <hi>Moses,</hi> what need was there of any written Law; and seeing righteousness comes not by the Law, as is said before, to what end was the Law?</p>
                  <p>Hee answers, by shewing a three-fold end of giving the Law.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First:</hi> The <hi>Law entred, that the offence might abound; i. e.</hi> The Law forbidding sin, and enjoyning righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, in that space of time betwixt <hi>Adam</hi> and Christ, came in, that sin, (which was daily committed, and yet because of ignorance not acknowledged) might bee known to bee sin, and that the natural wickedness of men might appear, which occasions, that by how much the more the Law requires righteousness, by so much the more concupiscence is stirred up aga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nst the Law; and that by this, the sin which lyes hid in men might bee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested, and known to abound.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But where</hi>] The <hi>second end,</hi> that from the abundance of sin in those that were to bee justified, the exceeding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant grace of Christ towards those that are justified might appear: seeing that where sin abounds in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of men that are to bee justified, there the grace of Christ justifying is found to super-abound.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Even as</hi>] The <hi>third end,</hi> that the power of sin, (as a King) by the Law, might more clearly appear, shewing forth its condemning power, the power of the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Christ (as a Superiour King) held forth in the Gospel, might bee more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>minent, prevailing, not only to the abolishing of the Kingdome of sin, but also to the conferring of Eternal Life upon those that are justified: Therefore by how much the more the force of sin (reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over men not justified) crowding them to the prison of Eternal death, might more clearly appear; by so much the more, the virtue, power, and excellency of the grace of Christ, overcoming and subduing sin, leading men powerfully unto Eternal Life, might more manifestly bee declared.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>THe <hi>third</hi> proof of the Doctrine of Iustification freely by Faith in Christ, in that it conduceth very much to the promoting of Sanctity and Holiness.</p>
                  <p>There are two PARTS of the Chapter: In the <hi>first</hi> hee shews, that by Faith in Christ, or the Doctrine concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the free ground of Iustification, several wayes promotes endeavours after Sanctification; <hi>to verse 12.</hi> In the other <hi>part,</hi> hee exhorts those that are justified to follow after holiness; <hi>to the end.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 1.</hi> What shall wee say then? Shall wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in sin, that grace may abound?</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>2.</hi> God forbid: how shall wee that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?</p>
               </q>
               <p>By answering an objection, which seems to arise from this Doctrine, hee sets down a confirmation of the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition; That this Doctrine of Grace, or of Free Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, makes for the promoting of holiness. Some may say, Shall wee persevere in our sins, wee that are justified by Faith, that the grace of God may appear more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, as this Doctrine of Free Justification, by the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Righteousness of Christ, seems to intimate? Hee answers, by denying and rejecting: Far from us bee
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49391:12"/>
such a thought. As if hee had said, They that are justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Faith, ought not to indulge themselves in any sin, but to endeavour after holiness: And this Proposition hee confirms by <hi>ten</hi> Arguments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. Wee are <hi>dead</hi> unto sin, in as much as when wee gave up our names unto Christ, that wee might bee justified and sanctified by him, wee renounced sin, that wee might not have any more to do with it, than the dead have with the living. Therefore wee that are justified, ought not any longer to live in sin.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 3.</hi> Know you not, that so many of us as were baptized into Iesus Christ, were baptized into his death?</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. Wee (as you know) which are freely justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Faith in Christ, are also taken into the fellowship of his Death, by Baptism; by which Sacrament wee have bound our selves to die unto sin, and Christ hath bound himself unto us, to communicate the power of his Death, that wee might die unto sin. Therefore wee ought not to undulge our selves in our sins, but endeavour after holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 4.</hi> Therefore wee are buried with him by Baptism into death; that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so wee also should walk in newness of life.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 3. Our communion with Christ in his Death, is sealed to us in our Baptism, for the abolishing of the old Man of Sin, <hi>i. e.</hi> Not only that wee might bee bound to mortifie the old man, but also that wee might bee made certain concerning the mortifying and subduing of sin, by virtue of Christs Death. Therefore wee ought not to indulge our selves in sin, but endeavour the mortifying of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 4. As our communion with Christ in his Death is sealed to us in our Baptism, so also in his Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; that as Christ was raised from the dead, to a blessed and immortal life, by the glory of the Father, who powerfully raised him; so should wee endeavour by Faith, applying the virtue of Christ, to arise from sin, and to walk in newness of life, to the glory of the Father powerfully renewing us. Therefore ought wee not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in sin, but follow after holiness.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 5.</hi> For if wee have been planted together in the likeness of his death, wee shall bee also in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his resurrection.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 5. Drawn from our spiritual and neerest union with Christ by Faith, which union is the ground of the communication of that virtue which flows from the Death and Resurrection of Christ; for by Faith wee are planted into Christ, as the Branch into the Vine, and this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafting brings us into that conformity with the Death and Resurrection of Christ, that wee dying unto sin, <hi>Christ dying,</hi> and following after newness of life, <hi>Christ rising again,</hi> may bee clearly seen in a certain likeness to himself. Hence hee confirms his former Argument; when wee are planted together with Christ by Faith, wee are so neerly united to him, that there follows of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity a conformity with him in his death, to the mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of sin, and in his resurrection, to newness of life. Therefore unless wee will acknowledge no union with him, and implanting into him, wee must renounce all sin, and endeavour after holiness.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 6.</hi> Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might bee destroyed, that henceforth wee should not serve sin.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 6. From that <hi>judicial</hi> union which wee have with Christ crucified. The force of which Argument, that it may bee seen, four things are to bee maintained. 1. That Christ hanging upon the Cross as our Surety, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stained our persons before Gods Tribunal. 2. That hee under-went the punishment due to our corrupt nature, or the old man, so called, because the evil of nature in those that are regenerated waxeth old, and hastens to destruction. 3. That hee took upon him to slay the old man in us. 4. In that hee took upon him to represent our persons, wee are thereby obliged to labour after mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of sin by his Spirit, that after Justification wee should no longer serve sin. From hence the Argument, wee know, or believe that our old man is crucified <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicially</hi> with Christ, to this end, that in us who are justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Faith, might bee weakned the body of death, (so that filthiness of habitual corruption, compacted, as it were, into one monstrous body, prepared with all its mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to actual sinning) that wee should no more, after wee are justified, serve sin. Therefore wee ought to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the mortification of sin, unless wee will cast away the Faith of our <hi>judicial</hi> union with Christ, hanging upon the Cross.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 7.</hi> For hee that is dead, is freed from sin.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 7. From the fruit of this union with Christ dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Cross; whosoever is dead to his old Lord sin, is justified and freed from the yoke and dominion of sin, that hee might not serve it any longer, nor obey the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of it: You may assume, But wee are justified by Faith in Christ dying for sin upon the Cross, wee are dead to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>our old Master Sin, therefore wee are justified and freed from the yoke and dominion of sin, that wee should not any longer obey its commands; for what ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice can sin further exact from us, whom Christ in his death upon the Cross hath slain, as it were?</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 8.</hi> Now if wee bee dead with Christ, wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that wee shall also live with him.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 8. If wee die with Christ, <hi>i. e.</hi> are united to him dying, in his power endeavouring to mortifie sin, wee need not doubt but wee shall live a spiritual, new and heavenly life with him; therefore it behoves us to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the mortifying of sin.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 9.</hi> Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead, dieth no more, death hath no more dominion over him.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 9. Confirming the former; Wee believe that Christ rose to an immortal life, neither is hee for ever hereafter lyable unto death, but alwayes living; hee both will, and is able to perpetuate in us a new life, that death may no more have dominion over us. Therefore as wee do not believe in vain, that by his power wee shall live a new and eternal life, so ought wee to labour, that the new life, to which wee have risen with Christ, may bee continued, not to suffer sin should any more prevail, or have dominion over us.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 10.</hi> For in that hee died, hee died unto sin once; but in that hee liveth, hee liveth unto God.</p>
                  <p n="11">
                     <hi>11.</hi> Likewise reckon yee also your selves to bee dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God, through Iesus Christ our Lord.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 10. As Christ died but once to wash away and abolish sin, and rising from the dead, hee lives for ever to the glory of God; so you that are justified, by argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Faith gather, and reckon your selves in the death of Christ to bee once dead, nor to bee obliged to dye for sin any more; that yee were once dead by the dethrone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of sin, neither are yee bound to serve sin any longer; that yee were once dead to the destroying of sin, nor can yee bee destitute of the strength of Christ to mortifie sin, but in his resurrection yee are bound to live unto God, or the glory of God, and that yee might so live, yee have strength and help enough by Jesus Christ our Lord. Therefore the Doctrine of free Justification by Faith, is so far from opening a door of liberty to sin, that on the contrary, nothing is more effectual and conducible to the promoting of Sanctity and Holiness.</p>
               <div n="2" type="part">
                  <head>Second Part.</head>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 12.</hi> Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, that you should obey it in the lusts thereof.</q>
                  <p>The <hi>second</hi> part of the Chapter follows, wherein the Apostle infers, out of what went before, an exhortation to all that are justified by Faith, that they follow after
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49391:12"/>
Holiness. The Proposition to bee proved is the same with the former, viz. <hi>They that are justified, ought not to continue in sin, but labour after Holiness.</hi> Hee produceth <hi>thirteen</hi> Arguments, whereof the <hi>three</hi> former are inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the following Exhortation.</p>
                  <p>The branches of this Exhortation are <hi>three,</hi> and the Arguments as many, couched in the Exhortation, to the confirming of the Proposition.</p>
                  <p>The first branch of the Exhortation is, that they would not obey sin, by indulging the sinful lusts of the body.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. The <hi>first</hi> Argument is this; To obey the sinful lusts of the body, is to suffer in your mortal body the reign of sin, or of the Devil, from whence yee are freed, which they that are justified should tremble at. Therefore being now justified, you ought not to follow af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sin, but holiness.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 13.</hi> Neither yeeld you your members as instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of unrighteousness unto sin, but yeeld your selves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness unto God.</q>
                  <p>The <hi>second</hi> branch of the Exhortation is, that they would not fight for this Tyrant, <hi>viz.</hi> sin, making use of the faculties of their souls or bodies as servants to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for it, wherein is the <hi>second</hi> Argument: To serve sin, is to yeeld the faculties of the Soul, and members of the body, as weapons of iniquity to fight for sin and the Devil against God, and our own Salvation, which all that are justified ought to abhor. Therefore they that are justified, ought not to serve sin.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Yeeld</hi>] The <hi>third</hi> member of the Exhortation, that they would yeeld themselves Souldiers and Servants unto God, who hath freed them from death, wherein is the <hi>third</hi> Argument. God hath called you back from death in sin, and Eternal Perdition, unto Life, that you might bee Servants unto righteousness, and might contend for God against his enemies; therefore ought you to labour after Holiness.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 14.</hi> For sin shall not have dominion over you; for yee arae not under the Law, but under Grace.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 4. If you contend and fight against sin, the Tyrant shall not recover his dominion over you, which hee hath lost, neither shall sin reign over you, but you shall become Conquerours through Christ; therefore ought you to labour after Holiness.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For you are not] Argum.</hi> 5. Confirming the former, you are not under the Law, under the Covenant of works, wherein the Commandment exacted strict obedience, but affords no strength to assist in our obedience; but you are under Grace, or the Covenant of Grace, wherein the Grace of God, with the Command, confers life to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, and strength to obey; therefore certain of the victory against sin, yee ought to endeavour after Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 15.</hi> What? then shall wee sin, because wee are not under the Law, but under grace? God forbid.</q>
                  <p>Hee repeats and rejects the absurd objection of <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines,</hi> who take occasion from the grace of God to sin more freely, when the contrary follows, <hi>viz.</hi> because wee are under grace, therefore wee ought not to indulge to our selves a liberty of sinning.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 16.</hi> Know you not, that to whom you yeeld your selves servants to obey, his servants yee are to whom yee obey, whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 6. Serving by the way to confute the objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; seeing there is a necessity that you bee servants to him whom you obey, and that you receive a reward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to your work, whether you obey sin, or the Divine Commands, unless you will bee accounted the servants of sin, and will receive the reward of eternal death, it behoves you to beware that you indulge not your selves in sin, and if you will bee accounted the Servants of God, that you may bee pronounced Righteous, and Heirs of Life, of necessity you must labour after Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 17.</hi> But God bee thanked that yee were the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of sin: but yee have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered to you.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 7. By the grace of God, the time of your bondage is past, in which you were servants to sin, before your regeneration, and now converted, you have begun to yeeld sincere obedience to the Gospel, the impression whereof you have received as from a print: Therefore to return to the service of sin, or to depart from the sound Doctrine, is unworthy, but it behoves you to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severe in your obedience to the Doctrine into which you were delivered.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 18.</hi> Being then made free from sin, yee became the servants of righteousness.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 8. Being now freed from sin, by the Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Arm of God, yee are servants of righteousness to holiness: Therefore by the Law of servitude, being ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to righteousness, yee are bound to become servants also unto holiness.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 19.</hi> I speak after the manner of men, because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as yee have yeelded your members servants to uncleanness, and to iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, unto iniquity; even so now yeeld your members servants to righteousness, unto holiness.</q>
                  <p>After his excuse of his homely similitude, which in many things holds no proportion with these spiritual things, yet notwithstanding the Holy Ghost is pleased to use, because of the infirmity of the Romans, for the sake of those that were carnal, which could not so easily apprehend an higher, or more spiritual way of speaking: Hee repeats the exhortation, and addeth:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 9. You have sometimes yeelded your members unto uncleanness, and have been altogether servants to unrighteousness; therefore now 'tis fitting, that with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual industry at least, you yeeld your members servants unto righteousness, and to holiness, not to bee less studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of doing well, than heretofore you have been of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and doing ill.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 20.</hi> For when yee were the servants of sin, yee were free from righteousness.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 10. Confirming the former: When you were servants of sin, yee were free from righteousness, for you were not at all servants unto righteousness: Therefore now 'tis equal, seeing you are the servants of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, that you should bee free from sin, and not at all servants unto it.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 21.</hi> What fruit had you then in those things, whereof yee are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 11. You have gained no other fruit for your former sinful course of life, but shame, which is now up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, nor could you expect any other fruit for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture but eternal death, which is the end of sin; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it behoves you to beware that you serve sin no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 22.</hi> But now being made free from sin, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come servants to God, yee have your fruit unto ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, and the end everlasting life.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 12. After you gained your liberty from the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of sin, you became servants unto God, and have your fruit unto holiness, encreasing and abounding dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly therein, at length you shall obtain eternal life; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought you diligently to follow after holiness.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 23.</hi> For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life, through Iesus Christ our Lord.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 13.

                  <p>IN the former <hi>Chap.</hi> hee exhorts those that are justified by Faith, to Holiness; and because they who most follow after Holiness, are most sensible, and lament the power of sin dwelling in them, not yet extinguished: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for the sake of these ariseth the fourth Confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Doctrine of Free Iustification by Faith in Christ, in that it yeelds consolation to the afflicted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences of the Saints, by reason of their imperfect o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the Law, and the reliques of sin that dwell in them.</p>

                        <hi>Vers. 1.</hi> Know yee not, Brethren, (for I speak to them that know the Law) how that the Law hath domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over a man, as long as hee liveth.</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>As to the <hi>first part,</hi> taking a comparison from Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, hee shews that the Justified which are delivered from the conjugal Covenant of the Law, and Espoused by a new Covenant of Grace, to a new Husband Christ, should bring forth the fruits of holiness, in new obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Law, to the glory of our new Husband, Christ.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>three</hi> first <hi>verses</hi> hee propounds the <hi>protasis</hi> of the comparison, after this manner: As no Law hath do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over the dead (as yee know) but only over them that are alive, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. and particularly the Law of Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age is dissolved, the one being dead, so that the Wife, (the Husband being dead) without adultery may marry another, <hi>ver.</hi> 2, <hi>&amp;</hi> 3. so you, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as it shall appear by and by.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 4.</hi> Wherefore my Brethren, yee also are become dead to the Law by the Body of Christ, that yee should bee married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that wee should bring forth fruit unto God.</q>
                  <p>The <hi>Apodosis</hi> of the comparison, to this manner; So you that were espoused formerly to the Law by a Covenant of Works, Christ being dead for you, that hee might satisfie the Law, Justice, and the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works in our name, you are judicially dead to the Law, in the body of Christ (for the Law, or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works hath slain Christ, and you in him) and by consequence you are delivered from the matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Covenant of the Law; so that without the breach of Justice you may enter into a new Covenant of Grace, with Christ, being raised from the dead. To this end hee shews, that the purpose of marriage being disannul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, betwixt the Law of Works and us, not that wee should live as wee list, but being raised from a state of death, by the Resurrection of Christ, that wee should bee espoused to another Husband, <hi>viz.</hi> to him which is rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed from the dead, <hi>i. e.</hi> to Christ, who rose from the dead, and hath raised us with himself to newness of life, and hath espoused us to himself, according to the Covenant of Grace, that being married unto Christ, wee might bring forth fruits of obedience to the glory of God.</p>
                  <p>There are <hi>five</hi> Arguments of consolation to the Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, who bewail the imperfection of their own obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Become dead] Argum.</hi> 1. You are freed from the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works, which admits no obedience besides what is perfect, and every way compleat: Therefore all you that are Justified have consolation, which bewail the imperfection of your new obedience.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Of another] Argum</hi> 2. You are now married to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Husband, <hi>viz.</hi> to Christ, who is raised from the dead, who when hee could answer the imperfections of your obedience, and (according to the Covenant of Grace) render your begun obedience acceptable unto God, hee took it upon himself: You have this consolation that mourn over the imperfections of your new obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>

                     </gap> are married unto Christ, which is raised from the dead, that you may not abide unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but may bring forth fruit to the glory of God: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take yee comfort, who bewail your imperfect obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 5.</hi> For when wee were in the flesh, the motions of sins which were by the Law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 4. Confirming the former, from the change of our condition, while wee were unregenerate (and by consequence under a Law-Covenant) evil affections by the holy Law of God were stirred up, and put forth themselves powerfully in our members, and all our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties both of soul and body, to the production of the deadly fruit of actual sin: Therefore it will follow, when wee are now regenerated, and under the Covenant of Grace, holy desires stirred up by the New Covenant, powerfully shew forth themselves in our members, to the bringing forth the fruit of good works unto God, that wee might not abide unfruitful. Which is no small consolation; for if wee by Faith would lay hold upon the Covenant of Grace, and would stir up our souls by the promises thereof applyed unto us, there is no doubt but wee should more plentifully bring forth good works; That is it which Christ saith, Joh. 15.5. <hi>I am the vine, yee are the branches, hee that abides in mee, and I in him, hee brings forth much fruit: for without mee you can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi>

                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 6.</hi> But now wee are delivered from the Law, that being dead wherein wee were held, that wee should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the letter.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 5. Opening and confirming the former, from the end of our changed condition, Now, <hi>to wit,</hi> after Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification, through the Grace of Christ wee are freed from the Law-Covenant (that Covenant being dead in which wee were held, or wee being dead in Christ, in whom wee were contained judicially) to that very end, that wee should serve God, by the power of the Holy Ghost, bestowing new strength upon us, by bringing forth new and spiritual fruit, not superficial and hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, which the letter of the old legal Covenant (now
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49391:13"/>
abolished) at the most, brought forth: Therefore God will not fail of his end, but will cause those that are justified, bewailing their imperfect obedience, to bring forth much fruit in the newness of the letter, for the fruits which are brought forth by virtue of the Covenant of Grace, are truly new, and arise from the regenerating Spirit, furnishing us with new strength forthwith to good works; But the fruits which are brought forth by virtue of the Covenant of Works, either are open rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of corrupt Nature against Gods Law, or counterfeit obedience onely in the outward performance; such as the fruits of the Pharisees are, who in the letter, <hi>that is,</hi> the outward shew, and formality obeyed, without any reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the heart.</p>

                  <q>
                     <hi>Verse 7.</hi> What shall wee say then? Is the Law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the Law: For I had not known lust, except the Law had said, Thou shalt not covet.</q>
                  <p>The <hi>second</hi> part of the Chapter, containing an Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy for the holiness of the Law, in answering <hi>two</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, arising out of what was said before. The <hi>first Objection</hi>; seeing that evil and sinful motions are excited by the Law, as was said, the Law seems to bee sin, or the cause of sin.</p>
                  <p>Hee <hi>answers</hi> by way of negation; farre bee it from us to entertain any such thought; hee gives <hi>three</hi> Reasons of his negation, illustrated by his own experience, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in hee pleads for the Law.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>first Reason,</hi> Because the Law discovers sin, and manifests the evil that is in it, which hee confirms by his own experience, who had not known that lust which lurked in his heart to bee sin, had hee not seen it forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by the <hi>Law</hi>: Therefore the Law is holy.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 8.</hi> But sin taking occasion by the Commandement, wrought in mee all manner of concupiscence; for without the Law sin was dead.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 2. Because the sin that dwells in us, or the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual pravity of our nature, is the cause of actual sins; but the <hi>Law</hi> is not the <hi>cause,</hi> but the occasion to sin, not given, but taken. For sin that dwells in us (saith hee) or the evil of nature, taking occasion from the Law for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding lust, so much the more is inflamed and excited; And indeavouring after what was forbidden, begat in mee all manner of concupiscence, and evil motions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For without the Law</hi>] Which hee confirms by a sign, Because the <hi>Law</hi> not being known, sin lies hid, and is as dead, but when the Law comes, it is stirred up, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears; as filthiness is not seen in the absence of the Sun, but that arising, it appears and stinks, not by the Suns fault, but by its own: Therefore the <hi>Law</hi> is holy.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 9.</hi> For I was alive without the Law once, but when the Commandement came, sin revived, and I died.</q>
                  <p>By his own experience hee further explains the matter, shewing, that formerly when hee was a Pharisee and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate, in his own opinion hee was alive, that is, very just, and in no wise guilty of eternal death; but when his eies were opened by the grace of God, the true sense of the <hi>Law</hi> was unfolded, then hee understood the force of sin, and that hee was guilty of eternal death.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 10.</hi> And the Commandement which was ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to life, I found to bee unto death.</q>
                  <p>From this experience hee saith that hee learned two things; <hi>First,</hi> That the end of the command, and the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect was good in it self, because the command is good in it self, and by it self ordained to life, if men obeyed it: The <hi>other,</hi> that the effect of the <hi>Law</hi> by accident was death, so farre as it threatned death to the sinner, and urges him from justice with the sentence of death.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vers. 11.</hi> For sin taking occasion by the Commandement, deceived mee, and by it slew mee.</p>
                     <p n="12">
                        <hi>12.</hi> Wherefore the Law is holy, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement holy, and just, and good.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>The <hi>third Reason,</hi> in defence of the Law; The sin that dwells in us, is the cause of death, onely taking oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion from the Law, or the command, as hee had learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by experience: for sin (while hee thought of what was forbidden in the Law) invited and inticed him to forbidden things, and polluted him, and so by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand made him more and more obnoxious to death: Therefore the <hi>Law</hi> is altogether holy; and particularly that which <hi>forbids Concupiscence,</hi> is holy, just and good, because it is given by an holy God, according to equity, and for our profit.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 13.</hi> Was that then which is good made death un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o mee? God forbid. But sin, that it might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear sin, working death in mee by that which is good, that sin by the Commandement might become exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sinful.</q>
                  <p>The <hi>second Objection</hi>; Some might say, Therefore hath that which is good been the cause of death? Hee answers, by rejecting the reproach; for the occasion is to bee distinguished from the cause, and the use of a thing from the abuse of it. Hee therefore acquits the <hi>Law,</hi> and casts all the blame upon the sin that dwells in us. Truly (<hi>saith hee</hi>) it is not the <hi>Law,</hi> but sin that dwells in mee, which is the cause of death, and discovers it self to bee sin, so farre forth as it is stirred up in mee, and kindled by the good <hi>Law</hi> of God, it enkindles rebellious motions to the <hi>Law</hi> of God, and so much the more upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count doth it cause death, that so sin in mee, by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand might appear above measure sinful. Which is spoken most seasonably, to stop the mouths of all, who otherwise would deny inborn concupiscence (now natural to all) to be sin, was it not found to bee the cause of actual sins and death; and this defence hee makes for the Law.</p>

First, Betwixt himself and the Old Man, or that part which was not yet renewed, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, the New Man, or the renewed part; and here hee himself renewed, condemns himself unrenewed, as void of any good, and a fit receptacle for all evil. <hi>I know</hi> (saith hee) <hi>that there doth not dwell in mee, that is in my flesh</hi> (or corrupt and unrenewed nature, which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from my carnal Generation) any spiritual good thing, whereby I may please God.</p>
                  <p>Hee proves what hee said, and propounds the <hi>second</hi> conflict, betwixt his will renewed, and the weakness of his <hi>flesh,</hi> or his perverse nature, hindring that the holy motions, stirred up by the Spirit, were not brought into act and performed.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 19.</hi> For the good that I would, I do not, but the evil which I would not, that I do.</q>
                  <p>The <hi>third</hi> conflict, betwixt the regenerated <hi>Will</hi> and the <hi>Flesh,</hi> or the Old Man, not onely hindring the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the Will renewed, but also producing evil effects, contrary to the renewed Will. Some may won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what hee means, when hee speaks of the commission of evil; seeing wee all know from the Scriptures, how holily and unblameably our Apostle behaved himself in all things, after his conversion. But it will bee no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, when wee consider, that, by reason of the abundant measure of holiness, which was bestowed upon him, hee could not behold those rebellious motions of his nature, but hee would accuse himself of the omission of good, and the commission of evil; for hee took notice of those motions, either hindring him from performing all the parts of his duty towards God and men, which hee strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly desired to do; or polluting some way or other all his actions in the sight of God: What wonder therefore, if after this manner, hee set out himself as a great sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner?</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 20.</hi> Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in mee.</q>
                  <p>The Conquest follows, after this sharp conflict, repeating the consolations of himself, and the rest of the Saints, That the sin committed would not bee impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him, bewailing this his imperfection; but to the corruption of his nature, or his habitual corruption in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling, designed to destruction and abolition: And because hee conflicted with sin, therefore is hee denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated from the better and renewed part, as above, <hi>vers.</hi> 17. and not from the worser part.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Verse. 21.</hi> I finde then a Law, that when I would do good, evil is present with mee.</q>
                  <p>The <hi>third</hi> sharp Conflict follows, consisting of a three-fold contention: The <hi>first</hi> is betwixt himself regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, <hi>endeavouring</hi> after <hi>holiness</hi>; and an evil <hi>inclination</hi> cleaving unto him, and impelling him with a kind of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, and as it were by a Law inciting and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking to evil.</p>

                        <hi>23.</hi> But I see another Law in my members, warring against the Law of my mind, and bringing mee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to captivity to the Law of sin, which is in my mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>The <hi>second</hi> Contention is betwixt the inner spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al man, renewed with his affections, and the Law of God, <hi>on the one part</hi>; and the outward or Old Man not renewed, furnished with his instruments and faculties, with his rebellious motions, <hi>on the other side</hi>; Against the Law of God, and the Law or inclination of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed mind, fighting, and sometimes prevailing, and making him captive to the evil disposition of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. This is the fight, whereof hee speaks, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. <hi>The flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh, and these are contrary, that you cannot do the things which you would.</hi> Which wrastling onely they understand, that feel it within them, and the force of sin some way or other polluting their most holy actions, all their life long.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 24.</hi> O wretched man that I am, who shall deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver mee from the body of this death?</q>
                  <p>The <hi>third</hi> Contention is betwixt evil Concupiscence, and the holy servant of God, lying prostrate under the oppression of the conquering perverseness of his nature, or this body of death, groaning, lamenting, and crying out to God for deliverance.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 25.</hi> I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord.</q>
                  <p>After this feirce combate follows the victory, and <hi>Comfort</hi> by faith in Christ justifying, together with his thanksgiving to God his deliverer, who hath provided comfort in his Son, not for those that continue in sin, but which bewail their sins and imperfections.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 25.</hi> — So then, with the mind I my self serve the Law of God: but with the flesh, the Law of sin.</q>
                  <p>At length with a composed mind, after his being affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with sorrow for sin dwelling in him, and with joy, because of his hoped-for liberty by Christ, the Apostle at length propounds himself a fellow-souldier with other Saints, in this holy war, against the remainder of sin. <hi>After this manner</hi>; I therefore an Apostle (that for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to those who bewail their sins, I may briefly recollect what I have spoken of my self) I profess that I have not attained to that measure of Sanctity, after which I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire: But together with the rest of the Saints mourning and conflicting, under the hope of freedome I go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; and as if I was divided from my self, the spirit and the flesh wrastling in me: with my <hi>mind,</hi> or my spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual part, <hi>delightfully</hi> I serve the Law of God; but with

               <head>CHAP. VIII.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>THe fift Confirmation of <hi>Justification by Faith</hi> is this, That this way of Iustifying, affords solid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation, not only against all evil to bee dreaded after this life, but also against all troubles and afflictions to which the children of God are lyable in this life.</p>
                  <p>There are <hi>three</hi> parts of the <hi>Chapter.</hi> The <hi>first</hi> is to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort those that are Iustified, against the fear of Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, which might trouble those that bewail the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection of their Sanctification, and the reliques of sin. Which consolation hee appropriates to those that are justified, endeavouring after holiness, secluding those that are unregenerate, and delight in sin, <hi>to ver. 9.</hi> which hee applyes to the <hi>Romans, to ver. 12.</hi> and thus applyed, hee shews the use of it, <hi>to ver. 17.</hi> The <hi>second</hi> part contains the Consolations of the Iustified in respect to the calamities of this life, to which the godly are lyable, <hi>to ver. 31.</hi> The <hi>third</hi> part contains the triumph of those that are justified, over all their enemies, <hi>to the end.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 1.</hi> There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Iesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the spirit.</q>
               <p>From what hath been spoken, hee infers consolation to those that are justified, against the fear of condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; which the conscience of sin dwelling in us, may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily affright us with. There is no condemnation (saith hee) to those which by true Faith are ingrafted into Christ: And because many profess the Faith they have not, hee describes true Believers and justified persons from this property, that they do not indulge themselves in sin, neither do they willingly follow the guidance of the flesh and corrupt nature, but walk after the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God, and the motions of the Holy Ghost, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly perswading them, to direct the course of their life according to the Rule of the Word of God.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 2.</hi> For the Law of the Spirit of Life in Christ Iesus, hath made mee free from the Law of Sin and Death.</q>
               <p>That this consolation belongs to them that are truly justified, and endeavour after holiness, hee proves by <hi>three</hi> Arguments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. The Law of Faith, of Life, and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in Christ, or the Covenant of Grace, hath freed eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Believer, and mee in particular, from the law of sin and death, or the Covenant of Works. Therefore to them that are justified, truly united unto Christ, there is no condemnation. For by the Law of the Spirit of Life in Christ Jesus, hee understands the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> or the <hi>Covenant</hi> of Grace, because by Faith, or the Covenant of Grace, the Spirit is received, and communion with the Life of Christ. And by the Law of Sin and Death, hee understands the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Works,</hi> as <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.27. or the Covenant of Works, by which Law or Covenant convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of sin is made, and condemnation unto death of them that are guilty.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 3.</hi> For what the Law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin condemned sin in the flesh;</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. Seeing the Law was found weak, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure for us Justification, by reason of the infirmity of the flesh, or humane nature, now corrupted; not able to yeeld perfect obedience to the Law. God sending his Son in the flesh, of the same nature with us, and in all things like unto us (sin excepted) in the flesh of his Son cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, condemned our sin, that satisfaction being made for us, it might bee abolished in us. Therefore sin in us that are justified, who are in Christ, cannot bee the cause of condemnation, and thus there is no condemnation to us.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 4.</hi> That the righteousness of the Law might bee fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the spirit.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 3. To this very end sin is condemned, in Christ that is condemned and dead for us, that wee being once dead and condemned in him, it might appear that the Law is satisfied; in us, I say, who follow not the lusts of the flesh, but the guidance of the Holy Ghost: Therefore now no condemnation remains us.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 5.</hi> For they that are after the flesh, do mind the things of the flesh: but they that are after the spirit, the things of the spirit.</q>
               <p>Hee gives <hi>four</hi> reasons why hee makes this consolation peculiar to them that follow after holiness, secluding all that are unregenerate, and continue in sin. The <hi>first</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, They that are carnal and unregenerate, savour and affect only those things that are carnal and wicked; but those that are regenerate, savour and affect spiritual things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Therefore its no wonder, that only they that follow after holiness, are admitted to the consolation of an immunity from condemnation; and they which are carnal are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 6.</hi> For to bee carnally minded, is death: but to bee spiritually minded, is life and peace.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 2. The wisdome of carnal men, which is the Governour of their counsels and actions, and is carried on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to those things, which please the flesh, whether in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to God, or eternal life, and so it inclines to death. But the wisdome of the spirit, or an habit directing the actions of regenerate men, is carried to those things which belong to spiritual life and peace: Therefore its no wonder, if only they that are regenerate, and spiritual, are exempted from condemnation, but not they that are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 7.</hi> Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the Law of God, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indeed can bee.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 3. Confirming the former; the wisdome of the flesh it self, the principal virtue of politick wits, is <hi>enmity</hi> against God, for it only seeks and cares for its own, reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God; neither is it <hi>subject</hi> to the Law of God, or <hi>can bee subject:</hi> for it cannot but subject to its own carnal ends, the <hi>Soul, Heaven, God,</hi> and <hi>all</hi> things; and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue after these so far as it thinks them conducible to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ends: Therefore its no wonder that carnal men are not freed from condemnation.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 8.</hi> So then, they that are in the flesh, cannot please God.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 4. Whoever are unregenerate, in the state of corrupt nature, or the flesh, cannot please God, because they cannot but follow after those things which please them: Therefore no wonder they are not freed from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 9.</hi> But yee are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if so bee that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man have not the Spirit of Christ, hee is none of his.</q>
               <p>Applying the character of justified persons out of the judgement of charity to the <hi>Romans,</hi> hee also applies to the same <hi>Romans,</hi> to whom hee writes, the consolation which arises from freedome from condemnation: hee prudently in the mean time bespeaks them, that they would not indulge hypocrisie in any; and hee gives <hi>four</hi> Reasons of this application.</p>
               <p>The <hi>first Reason</hi>; You are not subject to the dom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nion of the flesh, you are not unregenerate, but in a spiritual condition, following the guidance of the Spirit: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is no condemnation to you, or, which is the same, to you belongs the foresaid consolation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 2. Confirming the former, the Spirit of God dwelling in you, framing your hearts and lives unto ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness; for unless I should thus judge of you, I should
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49391:15"/>
think you did not belong unto Christ; for hee that hath not the sanctifying Spirit of Christ, is not yet a living member of Christ: Therefore there is no condemnation unto you.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 10.</hi> And if Christ bee in you, the body is dead, because of sin; but the Spirit is Life, because of righteousness.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 3. Seeing that Christ is in you, though your bodie indeed, in respect to the remnants of sin, not to bee abolished, but by death, is destined to death, and shall certainly dye; Yet the Spirit of Regeneration, which is given to you, is eternal life it self in you, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun in your souls, because of the Righteousness of Christ imputed unto you: Therefore there is no condemnation unto you.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 11.</hi> But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead, dwell in you; hee that raised up Christ from the dead, shall also quicken your mortal bodies, by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 4. The Spirit of Christ dwelling in you, will never forsake his habitation, but will render you to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self a glorious and immortal receptacle; To which end, God will no less certainly and powerfully raise even your mortal bodies, to life immortal, as hee hath raised the body of Christ from the dead: Therefore to you there is no condemnation.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 12.</hi> Therefore, Brethren, wee are debtors, not to the fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sh, to live after the flesh.</q>
               <p>The Consolation which hee had applied to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> from their immunity from condemnation, bee draws into use, exhorting them to the study of holiness, by which they should strengthen their consolation: The <hi>Arguments</hi> of his exhortation are <hi>six.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>first Argument</hi>; Wee are bound by all means to obey the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> continually minding us of our duty, both inwardly, and by the Word: But wee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>re no deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to the <hi>flesh,</hi> or to serve the lusts of our nature, because wee are nothing indebted to that, besides hatred, and all means of mortification: Therefore ought wee to follow after holiness.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 13.</hi> For if yee live after the flesh, yee shall dye, but if you through the Spirit do mortifie the deeds of the body, yee shall live.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. If you set up the lusts of the flesh, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Nature for a Rule, that you may order your lives according to that, yee shall eternally dye: Therefore as you would not perish, follow after holiness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 3. If you obey the Holy Ghost, using onely those means prescribed by it, and make use of that power communicated by the Spirit to you that beleeve in Christ, for the mortifying the corrupt affections and deeds of your bodies, without doubt you shall obtain Eternal Life through the grace of God: Therefore ought you to follow after holiness.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 14.</hi> For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, are the Sons of God.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 4. Confirming the former: All that follow the command, and guidance of the Holy Spirit, testifie themselves to bee the Children of God, by virtue of the regenerating Spirit: Therefore that you may prove your selves the Sons of God, obeying the Spirit of God, follow after holiness.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 15.</hi> For yee have not received the spirit of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage again to fear, but yee have received the spirit of adoption, whereby wee cry, Abba, Father.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 5. Further confirming that they are the Sons of God; Because after they fled to Christ, and embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Covenant of Grace, being set free by Faith from the servile fear of condemnation (which the Spirit strikes all those with, who seek Life from the Covenant of Works) and are indued with the Spirit of Adoption: from hence the <hi>Argument,</hi> After yee have imbraced the Covenant of Grace, by Faith in Christ, a servile fear of Condemnation, <hi>according to the tenor of the Gospel,</hi> is no more given unto you; but the Spirit of Adoption, that you may most familiarly call upon God the Father, with the people of God, every one in his own tongue: Therefore you are both the Sons of God, and also it becomes you to behave your selves as the Sons of God, in following after holiness.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 16.</hi> The Spirit it self beareth witness with our spirit, that wee are the Children of God.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 6. The Spirit of God seals up in our hearts, and witnesses together with our spirits, or consciences, that wee are the Children of God: Wee are therefore bound, as it becomes the Sons of God, to follow after holiness.</p>

                  <head>The second Part.</head>

                  <p>The <hi>second</hi> part of the Chapter, comprehends the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solations of justified persons by Faith, against the sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of afflictions in this life.</p>
                  <p>Hee premises a Conclusion, drawn from what was said before, wherein hee proves that they who are justified by Faith, are not onely Heirs of God, and have right to all his good things, but also co-heirs with Christ, and brought by Adoption into communion with the onely begotten Son, and into the inheritance with him, being the Sons of God. This is the right of those that are justified, to the inheritance, which inheritance that they might bee brought into the possession of, hee subjoyns the condition of suffering with Christ. And this affords <hi>thirteen</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of consolation.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>first Argument</hi> of Comfort. Communion with Christ in the Kingdome of Heaven, and the possession of the glorious inheritance, will follow our communion with him in his sufferings: Therefore let us comfort our selves in our afflictions.</p>

                     <hi>what shall wee therefore say to these things</hi>? In answer to this, the triumph of all that are justified by Faith in Christ follows, amongst which the Apostle reckons him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and in their names, as some leader, hee speaks in the singular number. The <hi>first</hi> triumph is, over all enemies together in one, by reason of the conjunction of those that are justified with God. <hi>If God bee for us, who shall bee against us?</hi> i. e. Seeing God is for us, about to fulfil in us his eternal purpose of sanctification, and glorifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who, or men or Devils, may rise up against us, to hinder our salvation?</p>

                  <p>The <hi>second</hi> triumph, is concerning the want of some good necessary to salvation, leaning upon such great love of God towards us, that hee gave his Son to death for us;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49391:16"/>
After this manner, God who spared not his own Son (than whom hee hath nothing dearer) but gave him up to death for the salvation of all the Elect, cannot but give us his Son, and with him all other gifts, necessary to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and lastly salvation and glory it self; what there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can bee wanting to us to salvation?</p>

                  <p>The <hi>fourth</hi> triumph is, over every judge, or any one that shall assume that office, and shall undertake to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn those that are justified. Seeing God hath justified us, who shall dare to condemn us? Seeing Christ is dead for us, yea as a Conquerour is risen from the dead, and ascended into Heaven, and there in glory intercedes for us, no condemnation is to bee feared by us, unless wee should say, that the death, resurrection, and ascension of Christ, his sitting in glory, and intercession is in vain, which is blasphemous: Therefore wee triumph in Christ.</p>

                     <hi>Vers. 35.</hi> Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?</q>
                  <p>The <hi>fifth</hi> triumph is, over outward afflictions, whereof hee reckons up <hi>six</hi> kinds, wherein hee comprehends all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities, with which Christians in any kind, by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankful world, are used to bee persecuted for Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness sake: Denying concerning all, that any enemy, by these evils, can hinder the fullest effect, and sweetest sense of divine love towards us, but that wee should at length partake of it.</p>

                  <p>Lest hee should seem to triumph over a feigned enemy, hee proves out of <hi>Psal.</hi> 44.22. That all the true servants of God, which then lived, were liable to all those mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, that they may apply to themselves the words of the <hi>Psalm,</hi> saying, <hi>For thy sake, O God! are wee killed all the day long, and are handled as if wee were sheep for the slaughter.</hi>

                  <p>Hee follows his triumphing, declaring the excellency of the victory, which Christians in his time had over these evils, by the power of Christ: for they returned al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies from the battel more than Conquerours, neither wounded, nor wearied, suffering no loss, but more heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and strong, more holy and increased in every grace, even then when they seemed to the world to bee most o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome, the glory of which triumph hee wholly ascribes to the love of Christ.</p>

                        <hi>Vers. 38.</hi> For I am perswaded, that neither death, nor life, nor principalities, nor powers, nor Angels, nor things present, nor things to come,</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>The <hi>sixth</hi> and last act of triumph, is over unbeleef, and all doubtings, which might arise from any Creature, or, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny present or future cause. By <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> hee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands prosperity and adversity, by which wee might bee either allured or affrighted. By <hi>Angels</hi> hee understands good and evil spirits, if it was possible they should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur to the separating of us from Christ. By <hi>Principalities</hi> and <hi>Powers,</hi> hee means the power of Kings, Emperours, Governours, Tyrants in the whole world. By things <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,</hi> and things to <hi>come,</hi> hee understands, all those oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences which had already fallen out, or might before death come upon us.

Over all these, in a full confidence of Faith, hee triumphs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the powerful, and efficacious, certain and immutable love of God, whereby hee is pleased to promote us to Eternal Life; from the embracing of whose love, and a saving sense thereof, nothing shall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver separate those that are justified by Faith in Christ.

               </q>
               <p>The <hi>second objection</hi>; Some might say, But if the <hi>Iewes</hi> bee accursed from Christ, as thou teachest, the Word of God is of no effect, and the promise of Grace made to the <hi>Israelites</hi> is void, when God said to <hi>Abraham, I will bee thy God, and the God of thy Seed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hee <hi>answers,</hi> Although the Nation of the Jewes, for the most part is rejected, yet it cannot bee that the Word of God should fail, or the promise should bee void. The reasons of this answer are six.</p>
               <p>The <hi>first reason,</hi> Not all that were born of <hi>Israel</hi> the <hi>Patriarch,</hi> according to the flesh, are true and elect <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites,</hi> or the elect people <hi>Israel,</hi> to whom the promise of Communion with God is made: Therefore although ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny born of the Patriarch <hi>Israel,</hi> are rejected, it follows not, that the Word of God, or the Promise of God should fail, because it is fulfilled in the Elect.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 7.</hi> Neither because they are of the Seed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> are they all children, but in <hi>Isaac</hi> shall thy Seed bee called.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 2. Neither doeth it follow, because the Jews are the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to the flesh, therefore they are all children, or in a Scripture sense, that promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Seed: For so the <hi>Ishmaelites</hi> should bee reckoned the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> contrary to the Scripture which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strains the right of sons to <hi>Isaac</hi> and his family, saying, <hi>In</hi> Isaac <hi>shall thy Seed bee called</hi>: Therefore although the Jews for the most part are rejected, it does not follow that the Promise should fail.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 8.</hi> That is, they which are the children of the flesh, these are not the children of God, but the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Promise are counted for the Seed.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 3. The children of the flesh are to bee distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished from the elect children of God: For this God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, when <hi>Ishmael</hi> was secluded, hee called <hi>Isaac</hi> the <hi>Seed of Abraham,</hi> to wit, the children of the flesh of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> not that they were all the elect children of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but only the children of the Promise (or those whom God out of his grace, did appoint to make children of the Faith of <hi>Abraham</hi> with <hi>Isaac,</hi>) were the children of God, and the Seed to whom the promise was made: Therefore although<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Jews are rejected, which are now alive for the most <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 4. Confirming the former, The word of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, (which is this, <hi>At the very same time will I come, and</hi> Sarah <hi>shall have a Son</hi>) The word of promise, <hi>I say,</hi> (shewing that <hi>Isaac,</hi> not by any priviledge after the flesh, but born by virtue of the Divine Promise) proves that the Blessing was given not to the Seed after the flesh, but to the elect Seed, raised up by grace: Therefore, although the Jews are rejected for the most part, it follows not that the promise is null, because there remain Elect, which are heirs of the Promise.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 10.</hi> And not only this, but when <hi>Rebecca</hi> also had conceived by one, even by our Father <hi>Isaac,</hi>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 5. After this manner; not only the former examples shew that all the children are not the true Seed, to whom the promise is made, but also more clearly, the example of <hi>Rebecca,</hi> who conceived Twins of the same <hi>Isaac</hi> our Father, viz. <hi>Esau</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> whereof one only was truly a son, to whom the Promise of the Blessing was made: Therefore it follows, that some Seed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> may bee rejected, and yet the Promise not bee void, but abide firm, and bee fulfilled in the Elect Seed.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 11.</hi> (For the children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to Election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth)</p>
                  <p n="12">
                     <hi>12.</hi> It was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Hee unfolds this difference of the Seed, or of the chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing some, and rejecting others, from their causes, <hi>to wit,</hi> that it depends not upon works good or bad in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but upon the meer good pleasure of God calling. <hi>For the children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection might stand, not of works,</hi> [or mans merits] <hi>but of him that calleth,</hi> or solely upon the Will of God that calls; It was answered to <hi>Rebecca,</hi> concerning her Twins, upon all accounts now equal, that it should bee, that the Blessing under the type of the Birth-right, or Dominion, should accrew to the <hi>younger,</hi> but the Curse; under the type of Servitude, to the <hi>elder.</hi> Hence,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason.</hi> 6. The purpose wherein God hath determined concerning every man, according to the Decree of Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, abides firm, not depending upon any of mans works, but upon the meer and most free pleasure of God, calling whom hee will, as from the answer given to <hi>Rebecca,</hi> it appears, touching the twins not yet born: Therefore these, or those Jews being cast off, the Promise of God might abide firm to the rest.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 13.</hi> As it is written, <hi>Jacob</hi> have I loved, but <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sau</hi> have I hated.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 7. Confirming and explaining the former; God loves some (of those which are every way alike) from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, and in time makes his love appear: and some hee hates<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in time shews that hee hates them; as in the example of <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Esau</hi> it appears, <hi>Malac.</hi> 1.2.

Therefore the Jews in part rejected, make not void the promise of God.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 14.</hi> What shall wee say then? is there unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness with God? God forbid.</q>
               <p>Hence ariseth a <hi>third Objection,</hi> If God chuse and love some, every waies alike and equal, and hates others pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing them by, what shall wee say? Is there not injustice (or unrighteousness) with God, who does not deal e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually with those that are in the same condition? The Apostle answers with abhorrence, <hi>God forbid.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 15.</hi> For hee saith to <hi>Moses,</hi> I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion, on whom I will have compassion.</q>
               <p>Hee gives an account of his denial, first in <hi>Election,</hi> then in <hi>Reprobation:</hi> from which grounds being granted, hee draws conclusions: The reason why there is no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness in Election, is this: Because it is the most supream and free pleasure of God to exercise his mercy: hee hath free power to do what hee will with his own, as it appears out of the Word of the Lord to <hi>Moses,</hi> Exod. 33.19. Therefore there is no unrighteousness in God, seeing that in Election hee does with his mercy what hee will.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 16.</hi> So then, it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.</q>
               <p>From hence hee draws a conclusion, to this sense, If the sole cause of shewing forth divine mercy and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, bee the most free pleasure of God, then the cause thereof is not in mans will, or pleasure, nor actions or good works, but alone in God: <hi>It is not of him that willeth,</hi> saith hee; Therefore it is not from mans free will. <hi>It is not of him that runneth,</hi> saith hee; Therefore it is not from humane indeavours and actions, that any one is loved, chosen, or obtains mercy and the blessing; and by consequent it solely depends upon God that shews mercy.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 17.</hi> For the Scripture saith unto <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee, and that my Name might bee declared thoroughout all the earth.</q>
               <p>In the <hi>second</hi> place hee gives an account of Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, why there is no unrighteousness in that, from the mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> holy end of Reprobation: Because Reprobation tends to the illustrating the glory of God, as it appears out of the Scriptures speaking of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> whom God raised up for this very end, that his Name might bee glorified in him: Therefore there is no unrighteousness with God reprobating whom hee will.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 18.</hi> Therefore hath hee mercy, on whom hee will have mercy, and whom hee will, hee hardeneth.</q>
               <p>Hence hee draws a Conclusion common both to Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Reprobation: That the cause of Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Election is to bee sought onely in the most free and holy Will of God, who most freely, and without unrighteousness, hath mercy on whom hee will, and most freely without unrighteousness, after most holy wayes hardens whom hee will.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 19.</hi> Thou wilt say then unto mee, Why doth hee yet finde fault? for who hath resisted his will?</q>
               <p>The <hi>fourth</hi> Objection, arising out of what went before, If God hardens whom hee will, then hee undeservedly reprehends those that are hardened in their sins; and by consequence, undeservedly punishes, because no man can resist his will.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 20.</hi> Nay but, O man! who art thou that thou repliest against God? shall the thing formed say to him that formed it; Why hast thou made mee thus?</q>
               <p>The Apostle gives a <hi>fourfold</hi> answer to this Objection, Because in such disputations carnal and corrupt reason pleaseth it self. The <hi>first Answer</hi> is to the person of the Objector; <hi>Nay but, O man! who art thou that replyest against God?</hi> In which words hee shews two things; First, That this Objection is made by a corrupt man, who by nature is a lyar, and from his own free will a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, whose conscience might stop his mouth, from speaking against God; <hi>Who art thou, O man!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>second</hi> is, That hee against whom the Objection is made, is God, whose waies to us are past finding out, yet alwaies holy, even then when the reasons of his Counsel least of all appear to us, who are of a short understanding: <hi>Who art thou that repliest against God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>second Answer</hi> is from the absolute authority of God over his Creatures, in the words of <hi>Isaiah</hi> 45.9.110 <hi>unto him that striveth with his Maker, let the potsheard strive with the potsheards of the earth, shall the Clay say to him that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ashioneth it, what makest thou?</hi> By which answer the Apostle shews this objection to bee contrary both to Scripture, and sound reason (because it intrencheth upon the absolute and unlimited right that God hath over the Creatures) and therefore the curse and woe is pronounced upon all that after this manner dispute against God,
<q>
                     <hi>Vers. 21.</hi> Hath not the Potter power over the Clay, of the same lump to make one Vessel to honour, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother unto dishonour?</q>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>third Answer</hi> is propounded by way of compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison of the power of God over men, with the power of men over other creatures, after this manner. As much power as man hath over any creature of God, so much hath God over man, whom hee hath created: But man hath power of the same mass of Clay, to make one Vessel to honour, another to dishonour, according as hee please: Therefore God may, of the mass of man-kind, fashion some to honour, others to dishonour, as hee please; and by consequence, unrighteousness is not to bee objected against God, in the matter of Election and Reprobation.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 22.</hi> What if God, willing to shew his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much long-suffering the Vessels of wrath fitted to destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:</q>
               <p>The <hi>fourth Answer,</hi> not onely freeing God from all unrighteousness in this his free choice of some, and the reprobation of the rest, but also shewing the wisdome, and exact justice, in this whole business, that neither the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate can complain of unrighteousness, nor the Elect glory in their merits. The force of the answer (by way of question) to touch the consciences of men the more sharply, is urged thus. <hi>What if God willing to shew his wrath,</hi> or his vindicative justice, <hi>and would make known his power,</hi> in the execution of his justice (which was most just) <hi>hee hath indured with much patience the vessels of wrath,</hi> by their own wickedness, <hi>fitted to destruction,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he would give up their deserved condemnation to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution? What is here I say, that common reason can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply against God? what is here, which any man may not commend in this Counsel of God? Thus the matter was in the casting off the Jews, whom God rejected not from the grace of the Gospel, until they had refused the grace of Christ, and abused much gentleness and leni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; which Righteousness, in the execution of the decree, frees God from all unrighteousness, in making the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference; seeing that hee executes no otherwise than hee hath decreed.</p>
               <q>

                  </gap>ee might make known the riches of his glory on the Vessels of mercy, which hee had afore prepared unto glory?</q>
               <p>A question yet depends, therefore wee must repeat, <hi>What if God, that hee might render the riches of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious grace more illustrious, towards the Vessels of mercy whom hee hath prepared unto glory, will have his wrath and power manifested in the just destruction of the vessels of wrath?</hi> what is there in this decree that any one can blame, in the execution whereof there is so much Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, and wisdome, and goodness manifested?</p>

                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 30.</hi> What shall wee say then? that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of Faith:</q>
                  <p>The <hi>third</hi> part of the Chapter, wherein the Apostle o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens this, as his scope to what went before, that the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of Believers among the Gentiles, and of Justicia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries among the Jews, might confirm his former Doctrine of Justification by Faith, and not of Works. The first part of the experience touching the Gentiles, is this, The Gentiles (saith hee) which did not follow after the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of works, attained true righteousness, <hi>viz.</hi> that righteousness which is by Faith: Therefore that is the only ground of Justification, which is by Faith, and not of Works.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 31.</hi> But <hi>Israel,</hi> which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness.</q>
                  <p>The other part of the experience, is of the unbelieving Jews; The <hi>Israelites</hi> (saith hee) followed after the law of righteousness, that they might bee justified according to that, but attained not that righteousness which is by works, because righteousness by the Law is impossible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Therefore Justification is not by Works, or according to the Law, but of Faith.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 32.</hi> Wherefore? because they sought it not by Faith, but as it were by the works of the Law; for they stumbled at that stumbling stone.</q>
                  <p>That hee might further make use of this experience, hee enquires after the cause, why the Jews that followed after the Law, did not attain to righteousness: By way of answer, hee assigns a <hi>threefold</hi> cause: The <hi>first</hi> is, because they did not seek after righteousness by Faith, which is the only ground of Justification.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Another</hi> cause, in as much as they sought after righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness by works, which way is impossible, not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause no man could perfectly observe the Law, but also because good works, which the followers after legal righteousness, without Faith perform, are not worthy the name of good works, they have only the shew of good works, and they that affect Justification thereby, fondly desire to bee justified, <hi>as it were</hi> by works, or a shew of good works. The <hi>third</hi> cause, because they knew not Christ, by reason of his humility, and the infirmity of his flesh, in whom they should believe, that they might bee justified, but despised him, and to their own destruction set themselves against him, stumbling at him, as at a stumbling stone.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 33.</hi> As it is written; Behold, I lay in Zion a stumbling stone, and rock of offence; and whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver believeth on him shall not bee ashamed.</q>
                  <p>Both parts of this experience hee confirms from the Prophets prediction, <hi>Isai.</hi> 8.14. and 28.16. after this manner: <hi>Behold I will lay</hi> (saith God) Christ <hi>in</hi> the Church, whose beginning is out of <hi>Zion, a tryed stone, a rock of offence</hi> (as the incredulous Jews have experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced) <hi>and whoever believeth in him,</hi> in the expectation of him, <hi>that is,</hi> in his righteousness and life eternal, hee shall not bee frustrated, as the believing Jews have found by experience: And thus the Apostle hath firmly proved that wee are justified by Faith.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>HEE further prosecutes the argument of the <hi>Jewes</hi> temporal rejection; shewing this to bee the cause, in that the <hi>Jews</hi> foolishly and stubbornly rejected the righteousness of God in Christ.</p>
                  <p>There are two parts of the <hi>Chapter.</hi> In the <hi>first</hi> hee shews the folly of the <hi>Jews, to ver. 14.</hi> In the <hi>other,</hi> their stubbornness, <hi>to the end of the Chapter.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 1.</hi> Brethren, my hearts desire, and prayer to God for <hi>Israel</hi> is, that they might bee saved.</q>
               <p>The Apostle being about to shew the just causes of the Jews rejection, hee prefaces, as before, from his good affection, lest any thing should bee thought to bee spoken by him, out of hatred.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 2.</hi> For I hear them Record, that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge.</q>
               <p>Hee shews their preposterous zeal for God to bee the cause of his affection, which zeal was worthy of humane commiseration, though it was not to bee commended, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it did not arise out of knowledge, but ignorance, therefore it was blind zeal, the zeal of fools.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 3.</hi> For they, being ignorant of Gods righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves to the righteousness of God.</q>
               <p>Hee proves the folly of the <hi>Romans,</hi> by <hi>six</hi> Arguments.</p>
               <p>The <hi>first Argument.</hi> Out of ignorance of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of God, imputed to us by Faith in Christ, they affected the inherent righteousness of their own works, and proudly rejected the righteousness of Christ offered
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:49391:18"/>
to them: Therefore they betrayed their folly.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 4.</hi> For Christ is the end of the Law for righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to every one that believeth.</q>
               <p>The <hi>second Argum. Christ is the end of the Law, for righteousness, to him that believes, i. e.</hi> the whole Law is therefore given, that men acknowledging their sins, manifested by the Law, might flee unto Christ, and might obtain righteousness by Faith: Therefore the Jews did foolishly, who making a shew of the Law, did not acknowledge Christ, which is the end of the Law.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 5.</hi> For <hi>Moses</hi> describeth the righteousness which is of the Law, that the man which doth those things shall live by them.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 3. The righteousness of the Law, or Works, as <hi>Moses</hi> testifies, confers life upon none, but those that perform all things that are commanded in the Law, which is impossible: Therefore the Jews foolishly affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed such a kind of righteousness.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 6.</hi> But the righteousness which is of Faith, speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on this wise; Say not in thine heart, who shall ascend into heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is, to bring Christ down from above.</p>
                  <p n="7">
                     <hi>7.</hi> Or who shall descend into the deep? that is, to bring Christ up again from the dead.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 4. The righteousness of Faith (as the same <hi>Moses</hi> witnesseth) forbids those that believe in God, from being troubled for those things, which are so diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, or impossible, as to ascend into heaven, or to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend into the deep: Because seeing Christ hath already overcome those difficulties, descending from heaven, and rising from the dead, to bee any further troubled, how to attain righteousness, life eternal, and freedome from death, is no less than to destroy the foundations of the Christian Religion, and to enquire how it was possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to descend from heaven, or rise again from the dead: Therefore the Jews betray their folly, who renounce this righteousness of Faith.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 8.</hi> But what saith it? the word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that is, the word of Faith which wee preach.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 5. The righteousness of Faith, as it gives se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity to those that believe, touching the difficulties in the way of salvation, so also it holds forth an easie way to righteousness and salvation: For the Word of God, or the Word of the Gospel, the same which the Apostles preached, is neer us, that receiving it into our hearts, wee may acquiesce in it, and confess the truth of it with the mouth; As if hee should say to us, Bee not troubled, cast your care upon God, and believe him that speaks in the Gospel, and shew forth your Faith by your works: Therefore the Jews rejecting this easie way of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness propounded, are very foolish.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 9.</hi> That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Iesus, and shalt believe in thine heart, that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt bee saved.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 6. Opening and confirming the former; The sum of the Gospel is propounded under this most sweet condition, <hi>viz.</hi> If thou applyest with sincere affection to thy self the redemption procured by Christ, and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested in his Resurrection by the power of God, and stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diest to glorifie Christ with a sincere confession, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt thou shalt obtain salvation: Therefore the Jews refusing this condition of Justification and Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, betray their folly.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 10.</hi> For with the heart man believeth unto righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, and with the mouth confession is made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to salvation.</q>
               <p>This hee confirms with <hi>five</hi> reasons:</p>
               <p>The <hi>first Reason</hi> is, From the connection of Faith in the heart, and confession in the mouth, according to the order appointed by God, which is, that by Faith from the heart in Christ Jesus, wee might obtain righteousness or Justification; and that, justified by Faith, wee might proceed to the possession of Salvation, glorifying Christ, by confession of the mouth, or outward works: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ought to bee joyned, Faith in Christ from the heart, and confession of Christ in the mouth: or inward Faith, and outward works, ought to bee joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 11.</hi> For the Scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him, shall not bee ashamed.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 2. Confirming the connection of true Faith and Salvation, from the testimony of <hi>Isai.</hi> 28.16. which shews, that they shall not bee frustrated in their hope, or their expected salvation, whoever believe in Christ: Therefore the connection of Faith and Salvation is firm.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 12.</hi> For there is no difference between the <hi>Jew</hi> and the <hi>Greek,</hi> for the same Lord over all, is rich unto all that call upon him.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 3. Confirming the generality of the connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, betwixt Faith and Salvation, there is no distinction of Jew or Gentile, nor exception made with God of any that believes: Therefore every one that hath Faith, without exception, shall bee saved, as well Jew as Greek.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The same] Reason</hi> 4. Confirming the universality of the connection, between Faith, and confession of the mouth, or sincere calling upon God and Salvation: The Lord Jesus Christ is the same, and alwayes like himself, and rich in his grace to all that call upon him: Therefore all that believe, and call upon Christ by Faith, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing him with their mouth, shall bee saved.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 13.</hi> For whosoever shall call upon the Name of the Lord, shall bee saved.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 5. Confirming the connection betwixt true confession of the mouth, or calling upon Christ through Faith, and Salvation, from the testimony of <hi>Ioel</hi> 2.32. who pronounceth, All that <hi>call upon the Name of the Lord, shall bee saved.</hi>

                        <hi>Vers. 14.</hi> How then shall they call on him, in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him, of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a Preacher?</p>
                     <p n="15">
                        <hi>15.</hi> And how shall they preach, except they bee sent? As it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the Gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>The <hi>second</hi> part of the Chapter, wherein hee shews the stubbornness of the Jews, answering the objections which might have made for their excuse.</p>
                  <p>The first objection is from the conjunction of the means ordained to the righteousness of Faith, after this sense.</p>
                  <p>Seeing it is impossible for those that believe not to call upon the Lord Jesus, or for those that hear not the Word, to believe; or those that have not the Word preached to them, that they should hear, or the Word to bee preached to whom the Messengers are not sent, (which connection is gathered from the words of <hi>Isaiah,</hi> who joyns together the Gospel and the Preachers; the send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Messengers, and the Hearers rejoycing; the feer, or the coming of the Preachers with gladness in those that received them.) It follows, that the Jews are to bee excused, at least from a stubborn rejecting of Gospel righteousness, because they heard not the Gospel.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 16.</hi> But they have not all obeyed the Gospel: For <hi>Esaias</hi> saith, Lord, Who hath believed our report?</q>
                  <p>The Apostle <hi>answers,</hi> That the Jews heard and did not believe, which hee proves from the Prophets complaint, bewailing, that few believed the word of the Prophets: Therefore the Jews are not to bee excused from stubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 17.</hi> So then Faith cometh by hearing, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>earing by the Word of God.</q>
                  <p>From the same testimony hee confirms the connection
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49391:18"/>
of Faith, hearing, and the Word of God, that hee might draw on the unbeleeving Jews, and provoke those that beleeved to use the means.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 18.</hi> But I say, have they not heard? yes verily, their sound went into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world.</q>
                  <p>Hee repeats the Objection, and <hi>answers</hi> that the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legation, to wit, that the Jews did not hear the Gospel, was false; because the sound of the Gospel went through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole world, as the voice of the day and night, as it is said, <hi>Psal.</hi> 19.5. to which place the Apostle alludes.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 19.</hi> But I say, Did not <hi>Israel</hi> know? first <hi>Moses</hi> saith, I will provoke you to jealousie by them that are no people, and by a foolish Nation I will anger you.</q>
                  <p>Another Objection, But perhaps the <hi>Israelites</hi> did not know, or understand the offer of the Gospel, but through ignorance refused the doctrine they understood not: Therefore they may bee excused in point of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinacy.</p>
                  <p>Hee refels this Objection, by a threefold testimony of Scripture; The <hi>first</hi> is out of <hi>Moses,</hi> Deut. 32.21. who foretells, that because of the Covenant of Grace rejected, or the conjugal Covenant violated, it should come to pass that the Jews should bee rejected from the Covenant, and that the Gentiles should bee taken in, in their stead: Therefore the Jews are guilty of stubborn refusing grace.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 20.</hi> But <hi>Isaiah</hi> is very bold, and saith, I was found of them that sought mee not, I was made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest to them that asked not after mee.</q>
                  <p>The <hi>second</hi> Testimony from <hi>Isaiah</hi> 65.1. who <hi>boldly,</hi> i. e. not fearing persecution from his people, foretells, that, for the Jews frowardness, and stubborn rejecting of grace, it should come to pass, that God casting off the Jews, would take the Gentiles that sought him not, into communion with him by faith.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 21.</hi> But to <hi>Israel</hi> hee saith, All day long I have stretched forth my hands, unto a disobedient and gain-saying people.</q>
                  <p>The <hi>third</hi> Testimony, wherein out of <hi>Isa.</hi> 65.2. hee proves in express terms, that the Jews were condemned for their rebellion: Because God <hi>all the day long,</hi> or all the time of his forbearance, did offer himself to them as a Father, with his arms spread forth, but they refused him: Therefore the Jews are guilty of rejecting his grace, and for this cause are justly cast off by God.</p>

               <p>From hence the Apostle inferres two Conclusions; the <hi>first</hi> answering the design of this Epistle, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Election, seeing it is of Grace, not of any Works fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen, because in the matter of Election, Grace and Works (as causes) mutually destroy each other: For if Grace bee the cause of Election, Works are not; And on the contrary: But Grace is the cause, as hath been said: Therefore Works fore-seen are not the cause.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 7.</hi> What then? <hi>Israel</hi> hath not obtained that which hee seeketh for, but the Election hath obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, and the rest were blinded.</q>
               <p>The <hi>second</hi> Conclusion, shewing what was said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. <hi>vers.</hi> 31. of the <hi>Israelites,</hi> who sought for Righteousness by the Law, and did not attain it, is to bee understood onely of the Reprobate: For the Elect <hi>Israelites</hi> obtained Righteousness, which they sought for by Grace, in the <hi>Messiah,</hi> but the rest, that is the Reprobate, were hardened.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 8.</hi> According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear unto this day.</q>
               <p>That the Reprobate were hardened, hee proves by a <hi>twofold</hi> Testimony: The <hi>first</hi> is of <hi>Isaiah</hi> 29.16. and 6.9. where God is said in his Righteous judgement, to have smitten this perverse people with the punishment of blindness and stupidity, or, for the contempt of his Word, to have given up to a reprobate sense, that they might not discern the Grace of God offered in the Gospel; which judgement lay upon the multitude, till the time of the preaching of the Gospel.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 9.</hi> And <hi>David</hi> saith, Let their Table bee made a snare, and a trap, and a stumbling-block, and a recompence unto them.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Another</hi> Testimony is from <hi>David,</hi> Psal. 69.23, 24. who (as a type of Christ) praies against his enemies, that all the benefits of God, and the Gospel also tende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to them, might bee to them an occasion of ruine, that afterwards they might savour nothing but earthly things, who being so often warned of God, would not relish heavenly things, and that in just revenge of their unthankfulness.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 11.</hi> I say then, have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid. But rather through their fall, salvation is come unto the Gentiles, for to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke them to jealousie.</q>
               <p>Hee repeats the <hi>first</hi> Argument, to prove that the Jews were not to bee despised, and hee adds a <hi>second</hi>: The Jews are not cast off, that all, and every one of them should perish, that are of this Nation; but that salvation through Christ refused by the Jews, might come to the Gentiles, that the Gentiles being converted unto God, might provoke the Jews to jealousie, and by consequence to Repentance: Therefore the Jews are not to bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised.</p>
               <p>The Jews are provoked to jealousie, when they see

themselves shut out from God, and scattered, that they might not bee a Church: But the Gentiles in their room to bee taken of God into his bosome, wherein before the Church of the Jews had been cherished.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 12.</hi> Now if the fall of them bee the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the Gentiles: how much more their ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness?</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 3. As the ruine of the Jews turned to the good of the Gentiles, so also, and much more, the restitution of the Jews, shall prove an advantage to the world, and the Gentiles: Therefore, so far should it bee from us to despise the Jews, as wholly cast away, that on the other side, their Conversion is to bee wished and hoped for.</p>

                  <p>

I my self am an Apostle of the Gentiles, so much the more earnestly do I bestow my Ministery in converting as many as I can, and magnifie my office, to this end, that I might provoke the Jews, my Kinsmen, not to suffer you only to enjoy the priviledge of the Sons of God, but that they would joyn themselves unto you, and so might bee saved: Therefore it is your duty not to despise them, as altogether cast off, but to labour with mee that they may bee saved.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 15.</hi> For if the casting away of them bee the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling of the world: what shall the receiving of them bee, but life from the dead?</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 5. If the casting off the Jews, is through the goodness of God turned to an occasion of reconciling the Gentiles, from the conversion of the Jews, is not such a change for the better to bee expected amongst the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, as if it was a kind of Resurrection from the dead? Therefore the Jews are not to bee despised, as altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cast off, but their conversion is to bee desired and hoped for: For when God shall again resume his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient people, what wonder if hee shall powre out upon all the Churches a greater plenty of his Spirit? What wonder if hee take away those destructive Heresies and Schismes, wherewith the Christian Churches amongst the Gentiles, was almost oppressed even to death, and unite them more firmly among themselves, and with the Church of the Jews? That this hereafter shall bee the happy condition of the Churches, about the time of the Jews conversion, the Apostle would not have us despair, who propounds to us, as it were, a Resurrection from the dead, to bee hoped for by us, in the change of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches condition.</p>

Unless thou continue in the Faith and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience unto Christ, considering the severity of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Jews, and his goodness towards thee, thou also shalt bee broken off, and cast away: Therefore unless thou wilt bee rejected, keep thy self in the fear of God, and despise not the Jews.</p>

Although the rejected Jews (so much as concerns the Gospel, refused by those reprobate Jews) are accounted of God, as enemies, for your advantage: yet in respect to the election of this people, that they might above all other Nations bee esteemed the people of God; and in respect to the Elect in this Nation, the Jews are loved, because of the Covenant betwixt God and their Fathers: Therefore for the very same reason ought they not to bee despised, but loved by you.</p>

Preventing an objection; Although this Nation by just desert, may seem to fall from all its privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, yet because of the gifts of special grace bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, (and in particular, their calling according to his purpose) whether upon any Nation above others, or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any man above others, are unchangeable, which God will never wholly cut off, or re-call, but will in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of this people make it appear that they are firm: Therefore this Nation ought not to bee contemned by you, but to bee had in honor rather.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 30.</hi> For as yee in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief:</p>

It is every way to bee believed, that God will manifest as much grace to the Jews, by occasion of that mercy shewed to you Gentiles, as hee hath shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to you Gentiles heretofore disobedient, by occasion of the stubbornness and unbelief of the Jews: Therefore the Jews are not to bee despised, as altogether cast off, but their conversion is rather to bee endeavoured.</p>

After this manner, The most wise Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God hath so ordered the business of saving his own, that all being found in sin and rebellion, might have no matter of boasting, and whoever should obtain Salvation, might ascribe all to Divine bounty: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Jews are not to bee despised, as wholly cast off, but the work of Divine mercy towards this people, in the time appointed, is to bee expected.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 33.</hi> O the depth of the riches both of the wisdome and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgements, and his waves past finding out?</q>
               <p>The Apostle shews a two-fold use of this argument, as also of the fore-going Doctrine, especially concerning the election of some, and the reprobation of others.</p>
               <p>The first is, that wee may admire and celebrate the depth of the riches of the ineffable Wisdome of God: <hi>Another</hi> is, That wee seek no further than is revealed, touching the Counsels of God, but even in things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, wee bee wise to sobriety, (because the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels of God exceed our capacity, and are indeed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searchable) glorifying God in all.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 34.</hi> For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his Counsellour?</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Three</hi> Reasons hee adds of both those deductions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 1. No creature hath pierced into the mind of God, none was ever of his Counsel: Therefore the Counsels of God are past finding out, wee ought not to search after them, but admire and magnifie the riches of his Wisdome.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 35.</hi> Or who hath first given to him, and it shall bee recompenced to him again?</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 2. God is in no mans debt, or can bee, no man merits at his hand, no man can come forth and say, that hee hath obliged God by any act of goodness in himself: Therefore they cannot boast, any of the Elect, as if God was bound to them by any Law, that hee should appoint them unto life: neither can any of the Reprobates com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, as though hee paid not what hee ought, seeing hee is a debter to no man.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 36.</hi> For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things, to whom bee glory for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 3. Confirming the former; All things are of God, as the first Author; All things are upheld by him, as the Preserver; All things tend to him, as the ultimate end: Therefore when it seems good to him to promote his own glory, in the rejection of the Jews, or calling of the Gentiles, in the Election of some, and Reprobation of others, all honor and glory ought to bee ascribed unto him by all men for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Living] Reason</hi> 2. Because this is a living Sacrifice, wherein nothing is to bee slain but sin; and you your selves shall live consecrated unto God, and shall bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served unto eternal life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Holy] Reason</hi> 3. This Sacrifice is truly holy, in the daily offering up whereof, Holiness it self consists.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Acceptable] Reason</hi> 4. Because this Sacrifice will not bee rejected of God, as those many legal shadows offered up by hypocrites, but accepted of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reasonable] Reason</hi> 5. Because the act whereby you offer up this Sacrifice to God, is your reasonable, or spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual service, pre-figured by that typical worship, and so much above that, as spiritual things are above carnal, and the bodies of Saints to bee preferr'd before the carkasses of brute beasts.</p>

                  <hi>Vers. 2.</hi> And bee not conformed to this world, but bee yee transformed by the renewing of your mind, that yee may prove what is that good,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:49391:20"/>
that acceptable and perfect Will of God.</q>
               <p>The <hi>second</hi> branch of the Exhortation, That wee take heed in life and conversation, that wee do not make the pleasure and manners of worldly men our Rule, to which wee conform our selves: This exhortation contains a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in it self; because men of the world onely savour the honours, pleasures, and profits of this present world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bee yee transformed</hi>] The <hi>third</hi> branch of the Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, That wee endeavour the transforming of our car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal mind into that which is spiritual, by the daily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing of our understanding and will. <hi>Two</hi> Reasons hee gives of this Exhortation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Discern yee] Reason</hi> 1. Because the Law of God, or his Will revealed in the Word, is the Rule to which wee ought to conform. 1. <hi>Good,</hi> teaching and leading us to those things which are <hi>good,</hi> and making us good. 2. It is <hi>acceptable</hi> to God, who accepts no obedience, but what is prescribed in the Word. 3. It is <hi>perfect,</hi> comprehending all things, which appertain to the worship of God, and our salvation: Therefore indeavour after renewing your minds.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Discern yee] Reason</hi> 2. Because without a renewed mind, and spiritual, wee cannot discern the proper sense of the divine Will revealed in the Word, and knowing it, wee cannot approve, and approving it, wee can have no experimental knowledge, how good, acceptable to God, and perfect it is in it srlf: Therefore ought wee to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour after renovation of mind.</p>

                  <head>The second Part.</head>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 3.</hi> For I say, through the Grace given unto mee, to every man that is among you, not to think of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self more highly than hee ought to think, but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of Grace.</q>
                  <p>The <hi>second</hi> part of the Chapter follows; wherein ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Apostolical authority (which hee calls Grace, because granted to him out of ineffable Grace) hee charges <hi>every one that was among them,</hi> in any publick office, or any excellency of gift, that hee would not think of himself above his fellows, or above the value of his talent, or the measure of his knowledge, but that hee would carry himself soberly, and moderately in all things, towards all. The <hi>Reasons</hi> of this Exhortation are <hi>five.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. God hath distributed to every one not a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, but a measure of Faith: Therefore it is fitting that every one should modestly contain himself within that measure.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 4.</hi> For as wee have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office:</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 2. As in the natural body, divers members are deputed to divers operations; So in the Ecclesiastical bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Beleevers, or the society of the Officers of the Church, divers functions are designed to divers imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: Therefore it is fitting, that each contain himself modestly in his office.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 5.</hi> So wee being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 3. Included in the same similitude, as in the natural body, many members constitute one body, so in the Ecclesiastical body, all the faithful, in particular all Church-Officers, are one body in Christ: Therefore all ought to concurre modestly, every one for his part, to maintain the unity of the body.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In particular] Reason</hi> 4. As in the natural body, so in the Ecclesiastical body, each of the members, are not onely of the whole body, but of one another; or every member is intended to promote the benefit of another: Therefore all ought to serve each other, mutually promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the benefit of each other, and not proudly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudently hinder one another.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 6.</hi> Having then gifts, differing according to the Grace that is given to us, whether prophesy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith:</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 5. Those divers gifts which wee have, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muncated through the Grace and good pleasure of God, who hath bestowed them: Therefore let us not grow proud, but modestly demean our selves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Whether Prophesie</hi>] Hee descends to particular ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry publick gifts, and to each hee prescribes their opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and bounds: Hee makes two kinds of functions. The first is <hi>Prophesie</hi>; The second of a <hi>Deacon</hi>; Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie comprehends the handling of the Word; Hee saith, <hi>having Prophesie, let us prophesie, according to the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Faith,</hi> i. e. Let us onely teach that which God hath propounded to be beleeved in the Scripture, and that which wee solidly know or beleeve to bee the sense of Scripture.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 7.</hi> Or Ministery, let us wait on our Ministring; or hee that teacheth, on teaching:</q>
                  <p>The second kind of Ecclesiastical functions, is that of <hi>Deacon,</hi> which contains all the gifts subservient to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry of the Word, as afterward hee declares. Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which hee prescribes, that hee which is imployed in that office, would contain himself in it, and would not aspire higher, unless orderly called.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hee that teacheth</hi>] Hee subdivides Prophesie into the office of <hi>Teachers</hi> and <hi>Pastors</hi>: By Teachers hee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands those, who teach by office, and labour in informing of our minds in the knowledge of the Truth, and these hee commands that they diligently use their ability in teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and wholly give themselves to it.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 8.</hi> Or hee that exhorteth, on Exhortation: hee that giveth, let him do it with simplicity; hee that ruleth, with diligence; hee that sheweth mercy, with chearfulness.</q>
                  <p>By <hi>Pastors</hi> hee understands, those who <hi>exhort,</hi> and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in moving the affections, and have ability, not onely for interpreting the sense of the Scripture, but pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to apply the Word for the present benefit of hearers, with stirring up the affections. These hee commands to attend to Exhortation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hee that distributes</hi>] Hee reckons up three kinds as it were of Deacons, subservient to the Ministery of the Word. The <hi>first</hi> is of those that distribute, <hi>i. e.</hi> by way of Office they are set over the treasurie of the Church; the goods of the Church, and the collections of the Saints they dispence to the publick uses of the Church; hee commands these, that they distribute with <hi>simplicity,</hi> that is with good fidelity, without acception of persons, and respect to private advantage.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hee that Rules</hi>] The <hi>second</hi> kind, is of those which are otherwise called, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. <hi>Ruling Presbyters,</hi> and by office were set to over-see the manners of the people, that scandals might bee avoided, and removed from the Church; These hee commands, that they diligently and carefully attend to their duty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hee that shews mercy</hi>] The <hi>third</hi> kind of Deacons, is of those who by office were to shew pitty, and were set to over-see the poor, the sick, those that were banished, and others that were afflicted in the Church: These hee commands, that they attend to their duty with chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness; lest with their frowardness they more afflict those, whom a disease, or poverty, or banishment hath already afflicted. In all these Precepts hee distinguishes betwixt themselves divers functions by divers gifts, and divers subjects, setting several kinds of Officers over divers im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments; using the like way of commanding in all of them.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>third</hi> part of the Chapter, wherein hee changes the form of command, and delivers Precepts touching Christian virtues, in number about <hi>sixteen.</hi>

Therefore hee friendly forbids private re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, and commands that wee let our anger, and the anger of our adversary to cool, exciting neither by words or deeds, adding a grave Argument, because it belongs to God, either immediately by himself, or else by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate, to revenge all injuries offered unto us. What is to bee done in case of <hi>unblameable defence,</hi> is to bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired amongst common places.</p>

                     <hi>Vers. 20.</hi> Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him, if hee thirst, give him drink; for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head.</q>

                     <hi>Precept</hi> 15. Of doing good to our enemies, when op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity and their necessity requires it: And this Reason is subjoyned, because by this wee heap coals up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, that they may either bee softened (as metal is melted in the fire) if there bee any ingenuity in them; or that their conviction and condemnation might bee made so much the more heavy, and that not by ours, but their own fault.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 21.</hi> Bee not overcome of evil, but overcome e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil with good.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Precept</hi> 16. Tending to the same purpose, but more generally, That in contending with our enemies, wee judge rightly of the victory; which is, not that wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite, or overcome evil with evil; for then wee are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther overcome of evil, than overcome; but this is the only victory, that by doing well we overcome evil, and this is the victory which here hee exhorts us to seek after.</p>

                  <hi>Praise] Argum</hi> 5. Because the Magistrate confers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and praise upon those that do well, and observe the Law.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 4.</hi> For hee is the Minister of God to thee for good: but if thou do that which is evil, bee afraid, for hee beareth not the Sword in vain: for hee is the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of God, a Revenger to execute wrath upon him that doth evil.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 6. Because the Magistrate is the Minister of God for our good; for by the Magistrate God enjoyns us things honest and profitable, and takes away those that are evil, which is very advantagious to us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For hee bears not the sword] Argum.</hi> 7. Because hee is armed with the sword to punish them that are evil, by that authority which is divinely given him: Therefore it behoves them that are guilty of evil, even in danger of life, to fear, and to bee subject.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 5.</hi> Wherefore yee must needs bee subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 8. Because it is necessary to bee subject, not only for avoiding the anger of the Prince, and civil punishments, but also for the sake of a good conscience, in respect to the command of God, commanding subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 6.</hi> For, for this cause pay you tribute also, for they are Gods Ministers, attending continually upon this very thing.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 9. Because wee owe tribute to Magistrates, as to the Ministers of God, who are imployed in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the publique, and solely attend that: Therefore ought you to bee subject unto them.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 7.</hi> Render therefore to all their dues, tribute, to whom tribute is due; custome, to whom custome; fear, to whom fear; honour, to whom honour.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 10. Brought in by way of conclusion: Because as it is just to give every one his due, so also to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate tribute, fear, honor is to bee paid: Even as all, or some of these belong to the Supreme or inferiour Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate, and their Ministers.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>second</hi> part of the Chapter follows, wherein hee handles holiness of life and love, as in respect to duties of the Second Table. There are <hi>six</hi> Arguments of this exhortation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Except this] Argum.</hi> 1. Because love is a perpetual debt: Therefore alwayes to bee paid.</p>
                  <p>

                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 9.</hi> For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery; Thou shalt not kill; Thou shalt not steal; Thou shalt not bear false witness; Thou shalt not covet: And if there bee any other Commandment, it is briefly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in this saying; namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy self.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thou shalt not</hi>] Hee strengthens this argument with two reasons: The <hi>first</hi> is taken from an enumeration of the precepts of the Second Table, all which are referred to love.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 10.</hi> Love worketh no ill to his neighbour, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Love is the fulfilling of the Law.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 2. Because love does no evil to our neighbour, which wee are forbidden by the Law: Therefore love is the fulfilling of the Law, and wee ought to follow af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 11.</hi> And that knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep; for now is our sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation neerer than when wee believed.</q>

                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 3.

                  <p>
                     <hi>For now] Argum.</hi> 4. Because our salvation is neerer than when wee were first converted to the Faith. Wee must endeavour so much the more to bring forth the fruits of Faith, and hope of Salvation.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 12.</hi> The night is far spent, the day is at hand; let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the Armour of light.</q>

                  <p>Hence hee draws a <hi>four-fold</hi> hortatory conclusion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Let us walk</hi>] The <hi>first</hi> exhortation is, that wee walk orderly, as it becomes children of the light, regenerate through the grace of the Gospel.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Riotousness</hi>] The <hi>second</hi> exhortation is, that wee ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain from intemperance and all filthiness, particularly from riotousness, and drunkenness, and adulteries, and filthy lasciviousness, (wherewith prophane men are wont to pollute themselves in their chambers) and strife, and envy.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 14.</hi> But put yee on the Lord Iesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfill the lust thereof.</q>
                  <p>The <hi>third</hi> exhortation is, <hi>That wee put on Christ,</hi> which hee saith, rather, than let us put on temperance, and other virtues, contrary to the fore-mentioned vices; for unless in the first place wee closely imbrace Christ, and his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness imputed to us by Faith, that wee fetch virtue from this Fountain to good works; our righteousness will not exceed the righteousness of Philosophers and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees. For even then when wee perform any thing holy, it is by virtue of the Spirit of Christ. Again, wee ought to put on Christ, that his righteousness may cover our nakedness, the imperfection and pollution of our works.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For the flesh</hi>] The <hi>fourth</hi> exhortation, That being contented with the necessary and lawful use of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to the health of the body, wee take no care to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the immoderate lusts of the flesh, or indulge our selves in carnal delights; for hee that takes too much care for his body, takes too little for his soul.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>INstructions concerning the mutual duties, in the use of Christian liberty, of the Faithful, follow: Some of the faithful, as the converted <hi>Gentiles,</hi> were perswaded of their Christian <hi>liberty,</hi> or <hi>freedome</hi> from the yoke of <hi>Moses,</hi> and did not observe legal Holy-dayes, or choice of meats. Others there were, as some <hi>Jews,</hi> somewhat weaker in this Article, not sufficiently confirmed about their liberty, who abstained from meats forbidden by <hi>Moses,</hi> out of a reverence to the Divine Law: They observed Fasts, Holy-dayes, Sabbaths, Calends: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst these, there arose a dissention, which hindred
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:49391:21"/>
the work of the Gospel. To both joyntly the Apostle gives precepts, <hi>to ver. 13.</hi> To them that were strong in the Faith, or in the perswasion of their <hi>liberty</hi> by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, <hi>in the remaining part of the Chapter.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 1.</hi> Him that is weak in the Faith, receive you, but not to doubtful disputations.</q>
               <p>The Apostle counsels that they mutually adjoyn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to those, with whom they were perswaded con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the abrogation of the Ceremonial Law; as also with those that were weak in the Faith, or in this perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and that they would forbear contentious disputes, concerning which hee exhorts both, beginning with those that were strong in the Faith.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 2.</hi> For one believeth hee may eat all things; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther who is weak, eateth herbs.</q>
               <p>Hee shews the occasion of the difference and dispute, in the instance of meats, whilest some eat any flesh with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any fear of the ceremonial prohibition: Others not perswaded, abstain from those meats forbidden, content with herbs, or any other sort of meat.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 3.</hi> Let not him that eateth, despise him that eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not: and let not him that eateth not, judge him that eateth, for God hath received him.</q>
               <p>The Apostle forbids discords, betwixt these, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning of each others in such a case; using <hi>nine Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For God] Argument</hi> 1. Because God hath taken both into the fellowship of the grace of his Son; therefore it is unworthy that in such a case one should despise or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn another. For it was unequal that they which were weak, should bee contemned by them that were stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, as superstitious, and Novices: and in like manner, that they which were strong in the Faith, should bee condemned as prophane by them that were weak.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Verse 4.</hi> Who art thou that judgest another mans ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant? to his own Master hee standeth or falleth; yea, hee shall bee holden up; for God is able to make him stand.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. It is unequal to judge another mans ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, without a Call from God, because it concerns his Master, not another, whether hee perish or bee saved: Therefore in this thing one ought not to condemn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hee shall bee holden up] Argum.</hi> 3. Because hee that is a servant of Christ, shall bee established by him, who both can and will keep him: Therefore this Judgement is contrary to the judgement of Christ, or, mutual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning of each other, is a sin.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 5.</hi> One man esteemeth one day above another: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother esteemeth every day alike. Let every man bee fully perswaded in his own mind.</q>
               <p>Hee propounds another instance of the occasion of this contention, in observing the dayes prescribed by <hi>Moses,</hi> which days some (to wit certain converted Jews) af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to bee observed before others: But others, (to wit, the Gentiles) out of conscience of their liberty purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by Christ, equally esteemed those dayes, with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, not prescribed by the Ceremonial Law. Here the Apostle prohibits contention, and condemning of each other, propounding a rule of due carriage of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in such a case, to wit, that every one of them should labour after solid grounds for the supporting their Faith, either for the doing or omitting those things, which were controverted touching the Ceremonial Law; and thus hee addeth a <hi>fourth Argument</hi>; That they would not condemn one another, because in the foresaid case, some might do it with a well-grounded perswasion, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon the like foundation might abstain: Therefore it was not fitting that they should condemn one another. For the Apostles in the Council at <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> freed the Gentiles from the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> for the Ceremonial Law was never imposed upon them: But the Apostles taking away from the Jews the necessity of Ceremonies, for some time left them to a free use, till after a season, the Gospel shining forth more clearly, they might plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly see that their Synagogue was to bee buried; wherefore the Gentiles might with a full perswasion lay aside those ceremonies, and the Jews observe them; at least so long as the favour of God suffered the Temple at <hi>Hierusalem</hi> to stand, whereunto the chief ceremonies were tyed.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 6.</hi> Hee that regardeth a day, regardeth it unto the Lord; and hee that regardeth not the day, to the Lord hee doth not regard it; hee that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for hee giveth God thanks: and hee that eateth not, to the Lord hee eateth not, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth God thanks.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 5. Because the Jew observing a day prescribed by the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> and abstaining from meat for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, in like manner the Gentile, not observing the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> both of them acted (with Thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving) to the glory of God: The Jew, because hee had meat enough, not forbidden: The Gentile, because hee might eat any meat, gave thanks: Therefore neither to bee condemned by the other.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 7.</hi> For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.</p>
                  <p n="8">
                     <hi>8.</hi> For whether wee live, wee live unto the Lord: and whether wee die, wee die unto the Lord: whether wee live, therefore, or die, wee are the Lords.</p>
                  <p n="9">
                     <hi>9.</hi> For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that hee might bee Lord both of the dead and living.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Hee confirms the end propounded to him that did ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, and to him that did not observe the ceremonies, and withall adds a <hi>sixth Argument.</hi> They that are not in their own power, but anothers, nor live to themselves, nor die to themselves, but only to Christ, they are bound to direct their actions, and omissions, to the glory of Christ, as also not to condemn their fellow-servants: But wee, or none of the Faithful lives or dies to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, nor is at his own dispose, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. But wee live and die to Christ, to his honor, to whom appertains the care over us in life and death, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. which hee proves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Christ died and rose again to this end, that hee might bee Lord over his Redeemed ones, living and dying: Therefore it follows, that the Faithful ought not to condemn or contemn one another.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 10.</hi> But why doest thou judge thy Brother? or why doest thou set at nought thy Brother? for wee shall all stand before the Iudgement Seat of Christ.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 7. The Faithful are Brethren, whether Jews or Gentiles: Therefore they ought not to judge or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn one another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wee shall appear] Argum.</hi> 8. All are to bee judged at the Tribunal of Christ: Therefore all ought to take heed that they do not rashly condemn one another.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 11.</hi> For as it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to mee, and every tongue shall confess to God.</q>
               <p>That hee confirms by the testimony of <hi>Isaias,</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling, <hi>Chap.</hi> 45.23. that Christ shall bee Judge of all, and that all shall acknowledge subjection to him, as to God.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 12.</hi> So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.</p>
                  <p n="13">

                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 9. Drawn from the former, Every one is to give an account of himself to Christ, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. Therefore every one ought to prepare himself for the Judgement Seat of Christ, and not to judge his Brother.</p>

special, properly belonging to them that are strong, that they abuse not their liberty, with offence to the weak, <hi>vers.</hi> 13.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 14.</hi> I know and am perswaded by the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, that there is nothing unclean of it self: but him that esteemeth any thing to bee unclean, to him it is unclean.</q>
                  <p>Hee prevents an Objection: Some might say, I am perswaded by the Grace of Christ, that no meat is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure or prohibited under the Gospel: Therefore I may eat any meat indifferently: Hee answers by denying the consequence, because pure meat, is made impure to him that eats, after two sorts: <hi>First,</hi> if hee that eats thinks it unlawful.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 15.</hi> But if thy Brother bee grieved with thy meat, now walkest thou uncharitably; Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Meat is impure, if any one (perswaded of his liberty) eat to the offence of his Brother: In which case, hee proves that hee must not eat with scandal, or that hee must take heed, that hee abuse not his liberty, and that by <hi>eleven Arguments.</hi>

                     <hi>Vers. 17.</hi> For the Kingdome of God, is not meat, and drink, but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 5. Because (as it is, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.8.) meat and drink nothing promote the spiritual Kingdome of Christ, but righteousness, peace, and joy, and the other fruits of the Spirit: Therefore wee are bound to abstain from meats, or things indifferent, when there is danger, that by an unseasonable use of our liberty wee should disturb the Kingdome of Christ.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 18.</hi> For hee that in these things serveth Christ, is acceptable to God, and approved of men.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 6. They that use these, as meat, drink, and the like indifferent things, wisely to the service of Christ (taking them by his leave, and abstaining, that the work of Christ may bee promoted) are acceptable to God and men: Therefore wee are to use our Christian liberty without offence.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 19.</hi> Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie another.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 7. By way of Consequence from the former Argument, drawn by way of Exhortation. So must wee use our liberty, that, by peace and edification of others, the Kingdome of Christ may bee promoted: Therefore wee must not use our Christian liberty, but so far as it may bee most serviceable to peace and edification.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 20.</hi> For meat, destroy not the work of God: all things indeed are pure; but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 8. The work of God ought not to bee destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or the salvation of thy Brother brought into danger, for a light matter (as the use of a certain kind of meat at a certain time:) Therefore wee must not eat with of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>All things</hi>] Hee prevents an Objection: Some might say, <hi>all things</hi> are lawful, <hi>i. e.</hi> those meats whereof wee speak. Hee answers, It is true, considering the things by themselves, but they are unlawful (in case of scandal) to him that eats with offence, to them that are weak.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 21.</hi> It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink Wine, nor any thing whereby thy Brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 9. It is good to abstain from all meat and drink, when there is danger that our Brother, in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Religion, may bee made worse, by our using meats and drinks: Therefore in such a case wee ought to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 22.</hi> Hast thou Faith? have it to thy self before God. Happy is hee that condemneth not himself in that thing which hee alloweth.</q>
                  <p>Hee here meets with an <hi>Objection:</hi> I have Faith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning my liberty, and it is necessary that I profess it. Hee answers, by denying that profession is necessary, by way of fact, in matter of scandal, because liberty consists no less with abstinence, than the use of the thing; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee commands that the Objector bee content in such a case, concerning the liberty of his Faith, by an inward professing of it towards God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Blessed</hi>] Hee confirms his assertion by an Aphorism, wherein the <hi>tenth Argument</hi> is contained. Hee is blessed, who (in that hee certainly knows to bee lawful for him, that hee may use it, or refrain from it) so using his liberty, that by abusing of it to the offence of others, hee make not himself guilty of condemnation: Therefore in such a case wee must refrain.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 23.</hi> And hee that doubteth, is damned if hee eat, because hee eateth not of Faith; for whatsoever is not of Faith, is sin.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 11. There is danger, lest a weak and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful person, should bee drawn by the meer example of him that eats, to eat with a doubting conscience, and sin, running headlong into the guilt of condemnation: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in such a case wee must abstain.</p>
                  <p>By this Argument hee deters the weak, from eating with a doubtful conscience by the example of any man; and hee deters the strong from unseasonable eating, lest hee bee the cause of another mans sin and guilt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Whatsoever</hi>] Hee proves him to sin that eats with a doubting conscience, because hee eats not of Faith, or out of perswasion, that the deed is lawful; and whatever is not done of Faith, that it may bee a lawful deed, hee pronounceth it to bee sin.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>THere are two parts of the <hi>Chapter:</hi> In the former part the <hi>Apostle</hi> proceeds in his Exhortation to them that are weak in the Faith, touching Christian <hi>Liberty,</hi> how they should carry themselves towards the weak, <hi>to vers. 13.</hi> In the other part is contained the conclusion of the <hi>Epistle, to the end.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 1.</hi> Wee then that are strong, ought to bear the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of the weak, and not to please our selves.</q>
               <p>That which concerns the <hi>first,</hi> Because no agreement in differences about the use of things indifferent can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably bee expected without sin, unless they that are strong carry themselves decently towards them that are weak in the use of their liberty: Therefore hee exhorts, that they would so do, and bear the infirmities of the weak, patiently bearing with them, and by prudent counsel, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning them as those that are weak in that matter. The Arguments of his Exhortation are <hi>seven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:49391:22"/>
                  <hi>To bear] Argum.</hi> 1. It's the duty of the stronger, both by the Law of Nature, and by Divine Law, to bear the burdens of the weak: Therefore the strong in Faith in these things indifferent ought to bear with the infirmities of the weak.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Please] Argum.</hi> 2. The stronger which refuse to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form this duty towards the weak, will bee found guilty of self-love, onely minding their own private advantages: Therefore the weak are to bee born with.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 2.</hi> Let every one of us please his neighbour for his good to edification.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 3. Because every man is bound to please his neighbour, when it may bee done to his edification, and for his good. Hee addes to <hi>Edification,</hi> lest wee fall into sin for the sake of any one.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 3.</hi> For even Christ pleased not himself, but as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached thee, fell on mee.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 4. Whereby the former is confirmed, from the example of Christ: Christ not respecting his own profit, but our infirmity, and salvation, pleased not himself, but us: which hee proves, because our sins (which in their nature are injuries unto God) Christ bore, that hee might free us from deserved punishments, and hee put his shoulders to bear our burthen: Therefore for the sake of them that are weak, wee ought to depart from our right, at least in things indifferent, that they may bee saved.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 4.</hi> For whatsoever things were written afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, were written for our learning, that wee through patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope.</q>
               <p>Hee proves that this example is to bee imitated, from the general scope of the Scriptures, which is our edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (in faith and obedience) by promises, precepts and examples: that wee in all our tribulation, patiently o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying the Will of God, might have consolation and hope through the Scriptures.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 5.</hi> Now the God of patience and consolation, grant you to bee like-minded one towards another, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Christ Iesus.</q>
               <p>Hee concludes the Argument with prayer, that God, who is the fountain of patience and comfort, would give unto them the same affection one towards another, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the example of Christ, <hi>i. e.</hi> that they might think the same thing, according to the doctrine of Christ, and might love one another, for if love abounded, there would bee agreement in things indifferent.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 6.</hi> That you may with one mind, and one mouth, glorifie God, even the Father of our Lord Iesus Christ.</q>
               <p>The end of his prayer is, that all strife and discord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing removed, with one heart and mouth they might glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie God, even the Father of Christ, who hath given us the adoption of Sons, and joyned us amongst our selves, by the bond of Brethren, with Christ.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 7.</hi> Wherefore receive yee one another, as Christ al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so received us to the glory of God.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 5. In like manner by the example of Christ, drawn from what was abovesaid, by way of exhortation, Christ had compassion on us, took us weak ones, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy into fellowship with him, to the glory of God, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning our sins: Therefore wee ought to take into our fellowship of love and peace, those that are weak, and (as they may seem) unworthy, passing by their infirmities.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 8.</hi> Now I say that Iesus Christ was a Minister of the Circumcision for the truth of God to confirm the promises made unto the Fathers.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 6. Again also from the example of Christ; Christ was a Minister of the Circumcision, or to the Jews, preaching amongst them, and undergoing all the offices of a Minister, by reason of the Covenant that was made with their Fathers: Therefore it behoves all Christians, to bee of the same mind with Christ, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Jews (which are weak in the Faith) even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the Covenant with their Fathers.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 9.</hi> And that the Gentiles might glorifie God for his mercy, as it is written, For this cause I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess to thee among the Gentiles, and sing unto thy Name.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 7. Again from the example of Christ, who preached among the Jews, not onely that hee might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the completing of the Truth of God, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises made to the Patriarchs, but also to this end, that the Gentiles converted by and with the Jews, might glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God together: Therefore it is most unworthy that the Jews and Gentiles should contemn one another for things indifferent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wherefore</hi>] As concerning the Gentiles, hee proves out of the Scripture, that Christ intended to call them into the fellowship of the Jews, by a fourfold testimony: <hi>first,</hi> out of <hi>Psal.</hi> 18.50. Wherein Christ under the type of <hi>David,</hi> promiseth that hee will preach the Name of God amongst the Gentiles.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 10.</hi> And again hee saith, Rejoyce yee Gentiles, with his people.</q>
               <p>The <hi>second</hi> proof is taken out of <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.43. wherein the Gentiles are commanded to rejoyce, with the Jews, as the people of God: Therefore the Gentiles are joyned with this people.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 11.</hi> And again, Praise the Lord, all yee Gentiles, and laud him all yee people.</q>
               <p>The <hi>third</hi> proof is taken out of <hi>Psal.</hi> 117.1. The Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles are commanded to praise God: Therefore they shall obtain mercy.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 12.</hi> And again, <hi>Isaiah</hi> saith, There shall bee a root of <hi>Jesse,</hi> and hee that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles, in him shall the Gentiles trust.</q>
               <p>The <hi>fourth</hi> proof is taken out of <hi>Isaiah</hi> 11.10. Christ shall reign as King over the Gentiles, and the Gentiles shall beleeve in him: Therefore they shall bee conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 13.</hi> Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in beleeving, that you may abound in hope through the power of the Holy Ghost.</q>
               <p>Hee concludes this whole Exhortation, concerning ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staining from the unseasonable use of our liberty, about meats, in case of scandal, with a most ardent prayer: That God would recompence this their Christian abstinence from meats, with the abundance of spiritual gifts, which would create to them more joy, from the comfort of Faith, and the holy Spirit of Peace, than they could otherwise finde in all the delights of what meats soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 14.</hi> And I my self also am perswaded of you, my Brethren, that yee also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p n="15">
                     <hi>15.</hi> Nevertheless, Brethren, I have written the more boldly unto you, in some sort, as putting you in mind, of the grace that is given to mee of God:</p>
                  <p n="16">
                     <hi>16.</hi> That I should bee the Minister of Iesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministring the Gospel of God, that the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering up of the Gentiles might bee acceptable, being sanctified of the Holy Ghost.</p>
               </q>
               <p>The other part of the <hi>Chapter,</hi> containeth the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the <hi>Epistle</hi>: wherein hee first shews the cause of his writing, and of his not comming yet unto them, that although hee was perswaded, that the <hi>Romans</hi> abounded in grace, and knowledge, whereby they were able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort, and instruct one another in all those things whereof hee had spoken before; Yet notwithstanding hee shews that hee hath written the more freely and fully to them; <hi>First,</hi> Because the advice which hee gave them was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable unto them: <hi>Furthermore,</hi> because of his Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal authority given him by the Grace of God, it behoved him so to attend to his Ministery among the Gentiles, that they being converted and crucified according to the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:49391:23"/>
old man, by his Gospel, might bee offered unto God, as a Sacrifice sanctified by the Spirit of holiness, and accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of God through Jesus Christ.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 17.</hi> I have therefore whereof I may glory through Iesus Christ in those things which pertain to God.</q>
               <p>That by what is said before his authority might appear, hee commends his Apostleship upon a <hi>seven-fold</hi> account.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> from the spiritual effects produced by the power of Christ, which with God is highly esteemed, however men undervalue it.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 18.</hi> For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ hath not wrought by mee, to make the Gentiles obedient, by word and deed.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> From the conversion of the Gentiles, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of hee durst not speak more than was truth, neither could hee say how much hee hath done, or what Christ had effected by his Ministery, to the conversion of the Gentiles.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 19.</hi> Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God, so that from <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> and round about unto <hi>Illyricum,</hi> I have fully preached the Gospel of Christ.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> From the signs of his Apostleship, <hi>viz.</hi> the power and miracles of the Holy Ghost, by which the Gentiles were convinced, touching the certainty of the Doctrine of the Gospel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So that] Fourthly,</hi> From the multitude of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles which hee conquered by his Ministery, amongst which were all those which lye betwixt <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> containing as it is thought the space of about a thousand four hundred miles, besides the Provinces adjacent.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 20.</hi> Yea, so have I strived to preach the Gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should build up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another mans foundation.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> From his founding the Churches of God in those places, the bringing in of whom, as Christ was the only Author, so was it only by <hi>Pauls</hi> Ministery, and not by any other of the Apostles.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 21.</hi> But as it is written, To whom hee was not spoken of, they shall see: and they that have not heard, shall understand.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Because in his Ministery was most evidently fulfilled what was fore-told by the Prophet.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 22.</hi> For which cause also I have been much hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered from coming to you.</p>
                  <p n="23">
                     <hi>23.</hi> But now having no more place in these parts, and having a great desire this many years to come unto you;</p>

               </q>
               <p>Laying a foundation for his excuse in what hee said before, that hitherto hee had not come to the <hi>Romans, ver.</hi> 22. and 23. hee gives them hopes of his coming, and tarrying a while with them, in his journey, which hee intended for <hi>Spain</hi>: After hee should have been refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with their company, as with <hi>Aromatick</hi> odours.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 25.</hi> But now I go unto <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to minister unto the Saints.</p>
                  <p n="26">
                     <hi>26.</hi> For it hath pleased them of <hi>Macedonia</hi> and <hi>Achaia,</hi> to make a certain contribution for the poor Saints which are at <hi>Hierusalem.</hi>
                  </p>
               </q>
               <p>Hee expresses the time of his coming, after hee had been at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and had brought the charitable bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volences of the Greek Churches for the relief of the poor Saints in <hi>Iudea.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 27.</hi> It hath pleased them verily, and their deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours they are; for if the <hi>Gentiles</hi> have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to minister to them in carnal things.</q>
               <p>Hee proves that this benevolence was to bee bestowed upon the Jews, because the Gospel came from the Jews to the Gentiles.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 28.</hi> When therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will come by you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Spain.</hi>

               </q>
               <p>At <hi>Cenchrea</hi> there was a Haven neer to <hi>Corinth,</hi> in which little Town a Church collected, the charge which this Church could not bear, it seems <hi>Phebe</hi> sustained, whose house was freely set open as a common receptacle for Christian strangers, and therefore shee is called the Servant of the Church: For it does not seem that shee was of the company of poor Widows, which the Church maintained at their publique charge, (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.) but it is likely, that shee supplyed the office of them, and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stained them at her own cost, because shee succoured both the Apostle, and many others: And that shee took so great a journey from <hi>Greece</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> having the care of secular affairs at <hi>Rome,</hi> (which deserved the cognizance and assistance of the whole Church, and to that end, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolical intercession) are not the signs of a poor, but wealthy famous woman, whom therefore hee would

have received by the <hi>Romans in the Lord, i. e.</hi> with Christian affection, and for the Lords sake, and treated fairly by the Saints, <hi>i. e.</hi> as became the outward conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Phebe,</hi> adorned with holiness.</p>

               </q>
               <p>The salutations, with the names and commendations of the Saints, are so clearly distinguished, that here is no need of any <hi>Analysis,</hi> some observations shall suffice for our purpose.</p>
               <p>How could <hi>Priscilla</hi> and <hi>Aquila</hi> bee <hi>helpers</hi> to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles? It appears, <hi>Act.</hi> 18. that although they were private persons, yet as much as could bee privately done by them, keeping themselves in their calling, they did vigorously labour in propagating the Doctrine of Christ, according to their knowledge, and with singular zeal; in which business, as the wife is named before the husband, so shee seems to precede him [in piety.]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Their necks</hi>] It appears that <hi>Priscilla</hi> and <hi>Aquila</hi> cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiously stood up in the defence of the Apostle in some dangerous persecution or tumult, and that they rescued his life with hazard of their own lives; upon which account, all the Church which regarded the welfare of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, ought to render thanks to them.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 5.</hi> Likewise greet the Church that is in their house, salute my well-beloved <hi>Epenetus,</hi> who is the first fruits of <hi>Achaia</hi> unto Christ.</q>
               <p>By Church, hee seems to understand only their family, (piously instructed, and daily imployed about holy things, amidst their manual labours) by reason of its resemblance to a Church; because hee saith not the Church which met in their house, but which is, or dwells in their house, unless wee suppose them to have given en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment also to the whole Church, as <hi>Gaius,</hi> of whom <hi>ver.</hi> 23.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Epenetus</hi> is said to be <hi>the first fruits of Achaia,</hi> because he was converted to the faith amongst the first, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.15. the family of <hi>Stephen</hi> also, upon that account is commended amongst those that are of chief note, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved Christians in the faith.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Andronicus</hi> and <hi>Iunia</hi> of the Apostles Kindred, are said to bee of note among the Apostles, because they were known and approved of by the Apostles, and highly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted of among them, who also were converted to the Faith before the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> and were partners of his sufferings for the Gospel, in prison and bonds.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 8.</hi> Greet <hi>Amplias</hi> my beloved in the Lord.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Amplias</hi> is said to bee worthy of <hi>love in the Lord,</hi> for the faith and piety which was vouchsafed of the Lord.</p>

                  <hi>Vers. 13.</hi> Salute <hi>Rufus</hi> chosen in the Lord, and his Mother and mine.</q>
               <p>Hee salutes <hi>Rufus</hi> an eminent young man, whose Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther very much respected <hi>Paul,</hi> even as much as shee did <hi>Rufus</hi> her own Son.</p>

               <p>Because in those times, amongst the signs of mutual love, a kiss was, (as now the shaking of right hands a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us) hee commands that they salute one another holily, without fraud and deceit.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 16.</hi> — The Churches of Christ salute you.</q>

               <p>Hee interposes (as it were in a Parenthesis) his admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition to observe, restrain and excommunicate those which should move any thing against the Apostolical do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, or discipline (already received by them) to the renting of the Church, and commands to avoid fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, <hi>viz.</hi> after they were excommunicated by the Church.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 18.</hi> For they that are such serve not our Lord Iesus Christ, but their own belly, and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the people.</q>
               <p>Hee adds <hi>four</hi> Reasons of this his admonition; <hi>First,</hi> because such men whoever they bee, serve not God, but their own belly, minding worldly things, <hi>i. e.</hi> their own lusts, and advantages, but not the welfare of the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason second</hi>; Because unless they bee observed by the wiser sort, the more simple are easily deceived by their feigned words, by which means they make a schism in the Church.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 19.</hi> For your obedience is come abroad unto all men, I am glad therefore on your behalf: but yet I would have you wise unto that which is good, and simple concerning evil.</q>

               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 20.</hi> And the God of Peace shall bruise Satan un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your feet shortly. The grace of our Lord Iesus Christ bee with you. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The whole Preface is laid down, to prepare the minds of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> for ready obedience to the doctrine and admonitions of the <hi>Apostle</hi>: And in this or the like conclusion, the scope of the Preface may bee represented: It is your duty, O yee <hi>Corinthians,</hi> with a ready and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missive

                  <hi>Sosthenes] Argum.</hi> 3. I have taken in <hi>Sosthenes</hi> as a witness to my admonition, (touching whom, <hi>Act.</hi> 18.17.) that by two witnesses this testimony might bee confirmed: Therefore ought you to obey my admonition and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, unless you will have the witness of us two against you.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 2.</hi> Unto the Church of God which is at <hi>Corinth,</hi> to them that are sanctified in Christ Iesus, called to bee Saints, with all that in every place call upon the Name of Iesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 4. In the description of those to whom hee writes: you are the Church of God, called out of the world, consecrated unto God, brought into communion with Christ, called unto holiness: Therefore if you will bee accounted worthy of your priviledges, you ought to hearken and obey mee in my doctrine and admonitions, which make for holiness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>With all that call upon] Argum.</hi> 5. My Apostleship, and the authority of this doctrine, the use, and fruit of it, is not extended only unto you, but to the Church of God universally, and all the Saints which adore Jesus Christ, the true God, and our Lord: Therefore ought you to hearken and obey my doctrine and admonitions.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 3.</hi> Grace bee unto you, and peace from God the Father, and from the Lord Iesus Christ.</q>
               <p>In this salutation is the <hi>sixth Argument.</hi> I acknowledge you, to whom (with the rest of the Saints, living in any place, according to the authority committed to mee) I may apply the blessing of the Gospel, as also grace and peace, <hi>i. e.</hi> all things that pertain to virtue and glory, to holiness and happiness, that being made more certain by mee of the favour of God, you may expect the same things with a stronger faith, through the Mediator Jesus Christ: Therefore ought you cheerfully to obey my do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and admonition.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 4.</hi> I thank my God alwayes on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Iesus Christ,</p>

               <p>In the other verses of the Preface, because hee was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to reprove many vices among the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> hee commends what was good in them, confirming their faith in God, lest being sharply reproved they should faint; withall hee shews what opinion hee had of them, and what good will towards them, whereby hee might better reach the end which hee aimed at.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 7. I do not envy you, but rather rejoyce and render continual thanks to God, for the rich grace of God towards you, especially in your reconciliation to him by Jesus Christ, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. I rejoyce much for the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of spiritual gifts bestowed on you, pertaining to the knowledge and preaching of the Gospel, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. Therefore ought you readily to obey mee, advising you concerning the right using of that grace, and those gifts.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 6.</hi> Even as the testimo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 8. Those gifts are conferr'd upon you for the confirmation of our testimony, and your faith, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Gospel of Christ: Therefore yee ought (that you might more abound in the gifts of the Spirit) to give credit, and yeeld obedience to mee, admonishing and teaching the things which are sound, from the same Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, Christ.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 7.</hi> So that yee come behind in no gift, waiting for the coming of our Lord Iesus Christ,</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 9. You want no kind of Ecclesiastical and Spiritual gifts, which are necessary for those that are tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers in the way, yet notwithstanding you are not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, you must expect your fulness at the coming of Christ: Therefore that you may with joy receive Christ at his coming to Judgement, you ought to yeeld obedience to my admonitions and doctrine, which may promote your perfection.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 8.</hi> Who shall also confirm you unto the end, that yee may bee blameless in the day of our Lord Iesus Christ.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 10. I am perswaded (I speak concerning the Elect, such as in charity it is fitting I should think you to bee) that Christ will confirm you, and cause you to persevere in grace, and will purge you from all spot, and at length will present you without blemish in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God: Therefore to this very end ought you to hearken to my teaching and admonition.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 9.</hi> God is faithful, by whom yee were called unto the fellowship of his Son, our Lord Iesus Christ.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 11. Confirming that hee had said before: Your effectual calling into communion with Christ, which is a lasting and saving gift, as also the faithfulness of God, (who hath promised perseverance and confirmation in grace to that very end, to those that are effectually called into the fellowship of his Son) are pledges of this my perswasion of you: Therefore that you may answer my expectation, and your calling, you ought to obey my counsel and doctrine.</p>
               <div n="2" type="part">
                  <head>The second Part.</head>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 10.</hi> Now I beseech you, Brethren, by the Name of our Lord Iesus Christ, that yee all speak one thing, and that there be no divisions amongst you, but that yee bee perfectly joyned together in the same mind, and in the same judgement.</q>
                  <p>The <hi>second</hi> part of the Chapter follows, wherein hee endeavours to re-call them from Schism, exhorting, that if Christ was dear unto them, laying aside their making of parties, they would follow after unity in Doctrine, and the manner of reaching, and to this end, that they might bee knit together in the same affections, in the same mind, and the same judgement.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 11.</hi> For it hath been declared unto mee of you, my Brethren, by them which are of the house of <hi>Cloe,</hi> that there are contentions among you.</q>
                  <p>That hee might not exhort them in vain, hee shews that hee heard of their Schism, from Authors of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 12.</hi> Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of <hi>Paul,</hi> and I of <hi>Apollo,</hi> and I of <hi>Cephas,</hi> and I of <hi>Christ.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>Now hee comes to the Schism; they contend concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Teachers, preferring some before others, as if they were more perfect, denominating themselves from them, with envy and contempt of each other: Which Teachers hee names not, but by concealing them, hee pacifies the minds of the Schismaticks, that the Schism might more easily bee laid aside: And as it were for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample sake hee names himself, and <hi>Apollos,</hi> and <hi>Cephas,</hi> although in the following part of the Epistle, it is plain, that their own vain babling Teachers were the Authors and furtherers of Schism, who also brought <hi>Paul</hi> himself so far into contempt amongst the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that hee could scarcely keep his own place amongst them, they
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:49391:25"/>
were so far from having their denomination from him.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 13.</hi> Is Christ divided? Was <hi>Paul</hi> crucified for you? Or were yee baptized in the name of <hi>Paul?</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>Hee strives now to cure and take away this Schism, the arguments of dehorting and reproving, are <hi>five.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>first</hi> argument is this; By this Schism, the mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal body of Christ is rent, and its unity divided into so many parts, as there are Sects: Therefore Schism is to bee cured, and abolished.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Crucified</hi>] The <hi>second</hi> argument. None of your Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers purchased the Church to himself by death: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this honour is due to none, that the Church should have its name from him, and bee rent in pieces for his sake.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In the Name</hi>] The <hi>third</hi> argument: You were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed in the name of none of your Teachers, that you should take your denomination from them: Therefore for the sake of your Teachers, you are not to bee divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into parties.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vers. 14.</hi> I thank God that I baptized none of you, but <hi>Crispus</hi> and <hi>Gaius,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="15">
                        <hi>15.</hi> Lest any should say, that I had baptized in mine own name.</p>
                     <p n="16">
                        <hi>16.</hi> And I baptized also the houshold of <hi>Stephanas:</hi> besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>The <hi>fourth</hi> argument. Schismatick Teachers among you are to bee blamed, who by affecting the baptizing of many confusedly, endeavour to challenge to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves the Disciples taken away from others, as if they had been baptized into their name; and that God by his Providence using my help but to the baptizing of few, I give thanks unto him who hath freed mee from the suspition of this evil: Therefore you are not to bee divided in parties for the sake of your Teachers.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 17.</hi> — For Christ sent mee not to baptize, but to preach the Gospel, not with wisdome of words, —</q>
                  <p>Hee adds <hi>another</hi> reason, why so few were baptized by him, because hee endeavoured to exercise his chief parts in the discharging of the trust committed to him, <hi>i. e<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> by preaching, to convert one after another, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the care of those that were converted, to bee baptized by others, lest hee himself should bee distract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, because Christ sent him not to baptize, <hi>viz.</hi> chiefly, to hinder his preaching, but specially to preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Not with wisdome of words</hi>] The <hi>fifth</hi> argument. Those Schismaticks, your Teachers, who endeavour to draw Disciples after them by their specious eloquence, do not follow my example in the spiritual manner of teaching; for I preach not with the wisdome of words, or the elegancy of speech, or acuteness of wit, with set form of speech (as the Precepts of <hi>Oratorie</hi> injoyn) but in the plainness and simplicity of speech, ordered for edification, I preached according to the mind of our Lord: Therefore for the vain eloquence of such Teachers, your Church is not to bee rent in pieces.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 17.</hi> Lest the Cross of Christ should bee made of none effect.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lest of none effect</hi>] The <hi>third</hi> part of the <hi>Chapter,</hi> wherein hee confirms his practice in the manner of preaching, and also his duty, <hi>viz.</hi> that hee might not preach with the wisdome of words, but in the simplicity of the truth, to the capacity of all his Auditors, and to their edification, not to please their ears; and hee proves that it was no wonder that Christ sent him to preach the Gospel, not with wisdome of words; to this end hee brings <hi>twelve</hi> arguments in this <hi>Chapter,</hi> adding more in the following.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lest of none effect</hi>] The <hi>first Argument</hi> is from the rule of contraries; if I compose my speech in preaching rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torically, to the rules of Eloquence, the Cross of Christ had been made of none effect, or (as it is, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.5.) the Faith of my hearers, had rather stood in the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of men, than in the power of God, <hi>i. e.</hi> the plain Doctrine concerning Christs humiliation to his Cross, had wanted its glory of mens conversion, and Humane Eloquence had carried away the Garland: Therefore it is no wonder that Christ sent mee to preach not with the wisdome of words.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 18.</hi> For the preaching of the Cross is to them that perish, foolishness: but unto us which are saved, it is the power of God.</q>
                  <p>By answering an <hi>objection,</hi> hee adds a <hi>second argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Some might say, but the Doctrine of the Cross shall bee made contemptible, and exposed to scorn, as foolishness, if it shall not bee commended to us with the splendour of wisdome. Hee <hi>answers,</hi> its true in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the reprobate, and those that abide in the way of perdition, but not so in respect of the Elect, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, who highly esteem plain preaching, finding it to bee the effectual means of God to Salvation. Hence the <hi>Argument</hi> riseth why the Apostle used simplicity of speech, and not artificial flourishes in preaching of the Gospel. God is wont powerfully to convert, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the salvation of the Elect, by this plain manner of preaching: Therefore its no wonder that Christ sent mee to preach not with wisdome of words.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 19.</hi> For it is written, I will destroy the wisdome of the wise, and will bring to nothing the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of the prudent.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 3. God will curse those wise ones, who despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the simplicity of Divine Truth, dare in the place of it, substitute their own wisdome in the preaching of the Gospel, which hee proves by the testimony of the Prophet <hi>Isaiah, Chap.</hi> 29.14. Where God threatens that hee will turn their wisdome into foolishness, who mind only words in his Worship, and not the power of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, to inward sanctification: Therefore its no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that Christ sent mee to preach not with wisdome of words.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 20.</hi> Where is the Wise? Where is the Scribe? Where is the Disputer of this World? Hath not God made foolish the wisdome of this World?</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 4. Is taken from experience, because God in the calling of his Church, rejected the works and the persons of the most wise amongst the Jews and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, by suffering the greatest part of wise Politicians, and Scribes, or Interpreters of the Law, the Disputers of this World, or Phylosophers, to walk in their own ways, for hee suffered almost the whole multitude of the wise men of this world, to wallow like fools in the mire and dirt with their worldly wisdome and learning, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the bounds of his Church, or the Kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. In this <hi>Argument</hi> the Apostle alludes to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie of <hi>Isaiah</hi> 29.14. For if you ask, Where are the Wise, &amp;c? they are not to bee found in the Church, for their wisdome not directing them to the true knowledge of their misery, and their only remedy in Christ, is foolishness. This is the force of the argument; in the calling and building up of the Church, neither did God use the wise men of this world, nor their eloquence: Therefore it is no wonder that Christ sent mee to preach not with wisdome of words.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 21.</hi> For after that, in the wisdome of God, the world by wisdome knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 5. Which is for confirmation of the former: Because afterward in the wisdome of God, which shines forth in the works of Creation, and daily providence, worldly men, neither by that natural knowledge remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in them, nor by the help of Philosophy, nor by any wisdome of their own, have known God aright; but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving neglected all means of knowledge, shutting their eyes, God hath revealed another way of Salvation, by the plain, and as it were foolish way of preaching the Gospel (as it seems to unregenerate men) that hee might save
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:49391:25"/>
the Elect through Faith: No wonder therefore that Christ sent mee to preach the Gospel, not with wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of words.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Vers. 22.</hi> For the Iews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdome.</p>
                     <p n="23">
                        <hi>23.</hi> But wee preach Christ crucified, unto the Iews a stumbling block, and unto the Greeks foolishness:</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>Hee adds a <hi>sixth Argument,</hi> illustrating what hee had said before, not onely from his own practice, but of the other Apostles, who, neither for the Jews sake (seeking after miracles) nor of the Gentiles (seeking after wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome) studied to satisfie the curiosity of men, with a polished stile; but following the plain manner of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Gospel, prescribed by God himself, they preached redemption by the humiliation of Christ, nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding that the Jews would bee offended at the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Cross, nor that the Gentiles would account this kind of preaching foolishness. No wonder therefore that Christ sent mee to preach the Gospel, not with wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of words.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 24.</hi> But unto them which are called, both Iews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God.</q>
                  <p>Hee excepts some of the Jews and Gentiles, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexeth the <hi>seventh Argument</hi>; from the judgement and experience of the Elect, powerfully called out of Jews and Gentiles, who had experienced and acknowledged Christ preached in plainness of speech, to bee the evidence of the power of God, above all miracles; and the manifestation of the wisdome of God, above all (which the Gentiles seek after) worldly wisdome. No wonder therefore that Christ sent mee to preach the Gospel not with wisdome of words.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 25.</hi> Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 8. By which hee confirms that this judgement of the faithful is true; because the Institutions of God, (however they may seem most foolish and weak to the world) are more prevalent than all the wisdome and power of men, as wee may see in the Sacraments. No wonder therefore that Christ sent mee to preach the Gospel, not with wisdome of words.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 26.</hi> For yee see your calling, Brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh; not many mighty, not many noble are called.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 9. Whereby hee shews that God made choice of this plain manner of preaching, but not lofty and spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, by his like good pleasure, in the selecting of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons by his calling: Hee chose not many wise, mighty, noble, according to the flesh, or outward condition and degree in the world, but men, for the most part, of no wisdome, power, or greatness of birth, as to the world, yea not at all accounted of: No wonder therefore if God chusing also the like manner of preaching hath sent mee to preach the Gospel not with wisdome of words.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vers. 27.</hi> But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world, to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world, to confound the things which are mighty;</p>
                     <p n="28">
                        <hi>28.</hi> And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>With this Argument hee brings in the <hi>tenth,</hi> from the subalternate end of this Counsel of God, <hi>viz.</hi> that hee might shew that hee nothing esteemed those things which were highly valued by men, that so whoever swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with pride because of these things, might bee asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, confounded, and looked upon as vile, and of no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; neither is it therefore to bee wondred at, that God hath chosen this plain manner of preaching, and that I should stick to it, that the vain wisdome of words might bee shamed, seeing that all the pomp of words is found only to tickle the fancies of men, and avails no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the conversion of the heart.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 29.</hi> That no flesh should glory in his presence.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 11. From the ultimate end of Gods good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in chusing, things, and persons, and weak means to salvation, which end is here negatively propounded, lest any should glory in himself: No wonder therefore that God hath sent mee to preach not with wisdome of words, lest I should glory in my self when any are converted by my preaching.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 30.</hi> But of him are yee in Christ Iesus, who of God is made unto us wisdome and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:</q>
                  <p>In the mean time hee comforts the <hi>Corinthians</hi> against this their abasement and mean condition, before the World, granting to them by way of recompence of noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of stock in regeneration, riches in wisdome and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, and finally freedome from all sin and misery in Christ: and for the greater confirmation of their faith, hee discovers that Christ was appointed by God, and given to them for righteousness and life, for Christ is made all these things by merit, imputation, application, and effectual accomplishment to the use of all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 31.</hi> That according as it is written, Hee that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.</q>
                  <p>Hee sets down affirmatively the ultimate end of Gods good pleasure in chusing weak means and persons, and in debasing all men in themselves, that (as it is, <hi>Ier.</hi> 9.23.) all the glory might bee given to God; from whence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rises the <hi>twelfth Argument,</hi> God so orders all things, that no man should glory save in the Lord: Therefore it's no wonder, that God sent mee not to preach the Gospel with wisdome of words, that in the success of the Gospel wee might all glory in God alone.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>HEe goes forward to confirm the same doctrine which hee delivered in the foregoing <hi>Chapter,</hi> viz. That in the preaching of the Gospel he rejected Rhetorical Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, but was pleased with plainness, and spiritual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration, not that the Apostle defends the rashness or rawness of any in preaching, as if wee might speak what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever comes to the tongues end, without Method, or sense, in a rude stile, and contemptible kind of speaking; for the right way of preaching hath it's excellency, which neither approves of dissembling, or sordidness, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns the affectation of eloquence (which causes the hearer more to admire him that speaks, than that which is spoken:) for the truth thought upon, and rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood (when the Preacher delivers it out of Faith and Love) the simple willingly follow it, and a speech fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the building up of all auditors, which relishes better with the wisest hearers, than all the flourishes of Rhetoricians. This plain kind of preaching hee proves more excellent than artificial eloquence, by <hi>eight</hi> Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the former of which are taken from the experience of <hi>Paul</hi> himself, and the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to whom hee writes.</p>
               </argument>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 1.</hi> And I, Brethren, when I came unto you, came not with excellency of speech, or of wisdome, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring unto you the testimony of God.</q>
               <p>The <hi>first Argument.</hi> I <hi>Paul,</hi> when I came to you <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> to preach the Gospel, by which you were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to the Faith, did advisedly abstain from the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency of eloquence: Therefore plainness of speech in preaching the Gospel is better than artificial Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorick.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 2.</hi> For I determined not to know any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, save Iesus Christ, and him crucified.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. I did not at all value it, to shew amongst you, or discover of my self the knowledge of any thing, save of the person, offices, efficacy, and vertue of Jesus
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:49391:26"/>
Christ, and specially of his Passions and Humiliation: Therefore this way of preaching is most excellent.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 3.</hi> And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling;</q>
               <p>I, being mindful of humane infirmities, in the midst of dangers, composing my self to humility without pride, preached amongst you, and carried my self pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively and tremblingly in my duty: Therefore the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Gospel plainly is the excellentest way.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 4.</hi> And my speech, and my preaching, was not with entising words of mans wisdome, but in demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of the Spirit, and of power.</q>
               <p>My speech and preaching never glistered with the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuteness of wit, or humane Philosophy, nor with fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of words fitted for perswasion, but in the evidences of Scripture, and sound truth, in which the Spirit shewed himself powerfully, and worked in your hearts: Therefore this kind of preaching is most excellent.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 5.</hi> That your faith should not stand in the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of men, but in the power of God.</q>
               <p>Giving a reason of his practice, why hee refrained himself from Humane Eloquence in his speeches, hee adds the <hi>fift argument:</hi> If I had made use of artificial expressions to convert you to the Faith, Humane Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence had been the cause of believing the Gospel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst you <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and not the naked truth, (which is said to bee the power of God, because God works powerfully by it in his people) and so the Faith of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> had been grounded upon the deceitful foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Humane Eloquence; but when any one by E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence is moved to believe, hee may bee moved also by greater Eloquence to forsake the truth of Faith: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it follows, that this plain way of preaching is most excellent.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 6.</hi> Howbeit, wee speak wisdome amongst them that are perfect; yet not the wisdome of this world, nor of the Princes of this world, that come to nought.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum. 6.</hi> From the comparing the Gospel and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Wisdome together: That the Gospel hath its own proper wisdome, eloquence and lustre (in this plain kind of preaching) any one of years may bee judge; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can it more admit of the dressing of Humane Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, than the most beautiful face admits of painting. In those that undertake to preach the Gospel, the help of Humane Wisdome is requisite, not the splendour of it in preaching.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wisdome</hi>] His comparison of Divine Wisdome in its plainness of speech, with worldly wisdome, is <hi>eight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>first Comparison</hi>; They that are perfect, or grown up in the School of Christ, which have their senses exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised, to discern good and evil, this <hi>Wisdome</hi> of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel they apprehend, admire, and magnifie; but that which is <hi>Humane,</hi> they suspect, and only they that are Novices, and ignorant altogether of Divine things, admire it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Not of this world] Comparison</hi> 2. Humane Wisdome is only of this world, or temporary; but the wisdome of the Gospel is of the world which is to come, or Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of the Princes] Comparison</hi> 3. Humane Wisdome is of men, who although they are accounted by the world for Princes, yet they perish with their wisdome, and come to nought.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 7.</hi> But wee speak the wisdome of God in a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, even the hidden wisdome which God ordained, before the world, unto our glory.</q>
               <p>The other part of the <hi>Comparison</hi>; The <hi>Wisdome of the Gospel,</hi> is the wisdome of the <hi>Living</hi> and <hi>Eternal</hi> God, because it was wisely contrived of God, and because in it the wonderful Wisdome of God is revealed, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Salvation and Redemption of men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In a mystery] Comparison</hi> 4. <hi>Humane</hi> Philosophy is common and obvious to every one that is indued with the gifts of Nature; but the <hi>Wisdome</hi> of the Gospel is a Mystery, or hidden wisdome, because it is not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood by natural reason, as Humane Philosophy, but by Supernatural Revelation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Before the world] Comparison</hi> 5. In the antiquity of it, the <hi>Wisdome</hi> of the Gospel is not of yesterday, but ordained of God before the world: But Humane Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy is an invention lately found out, and not yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected or finished.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Glory] Comparison</hi> 6. The <hi>Wisdome</hi> of the Gospel appertains to Glory and Salvation, especially of us who live under grace: But <hi>Humane</hi> Wisdome, compared with this, appertains not to salvation, but vain specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 8.</hi> Which none of the Princes of this world knew: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Comparison</hi> 7. <hi>Humane</hi> Wisdome may consist with the not knowing of Christ, but Divine Wisdome cannot. This comparison is confirmed by experience, because the chief heads of the Jews, and the Rulers of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, (who in respect to their wisdome, seemed to get a name in the world) understood nothing of the Wisdome of the Gospel, which hee proves by this instance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause had they known any thing of the Gospel, they had either out of reverence to the Divine Power, or out of fear been wary of Crucifying the Lord of Glory so igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniously.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 9.</hi> But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither hath entred into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Comparison</hi> 8. By which hee confirms and illustrates the <hi>fourth</hi> and <hi>sixth</hi> comparison: The object of Humane <hi>Wisdome,</hi> is apprehended by the external senses, and the understanding, or the natural light of reason; but the object of that <hi>Wisdome</hi> which is unfolded in the Gospel, containing those things which Christ hath procured for us, (to bee enjoyed in this present, and in the world to come) cannot bee apprehended, either by the outward senses, or the understanding, founded in sensible things, or by the discourse of reason, without revelation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the knowledge of it, (as <hi>Isaiah</hi> speaks, <hi>Chap.</hi> 64.14.) cannot come into the heart of man naturally. From all the parts of this comparison arises</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 6. The Wisdome of the Gospel, which the plain way of preaching it, best opens, far excells all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane wisdome, which only the wisdome of words (used for preaching) opens, and that with obscuring the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Gospel: Therefore the preaching of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel in simplicity, is for the best. The sum of all is, plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of speech shews to the hearers the depth of the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God; but wisdome of words, shews how learned the Preacher is in humane wisdome.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 10.</hi> But God hath revealed them to us by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.</q>
               <p>Hee illustrates this Doctrine, by answering two <hi>Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Objection</hi> 1. From whence therefore do you know the Gospel? Hee answers, From the revelation of the Spirit through Faith, wee understand the subject of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, which hee confirms from the end and properties of the Holy Spirit, which is given unto us; because the Holy Ghost, as it were by searching, perfectly knows all things, even the hidden things of God, and reveals to us these mysteries.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 11.</hi> For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? Even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.</q>
               <p>This property of the Spirit, hee proves by way of comparison; As the Spirit of a man can best know the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:49391:26"/>
things which are in man, so the Spirit of God only can know the deep things of God, and by consequence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal them.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 12.</hi> Now wee have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is of God, that wee may know the things that are freely given to us of God.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Objection</hi> 2. But if the Spirit only knows, what have you to do with the Spirit? Hee answers, That the Spirit is given to us that believe, not that common spirit of the world, not the gift of Eloquence, or worldly wisdome, but the Spirit, or the gift of spiritual grace, to this end, that wee may know those spiritual gifts, <hi>viz.</hi> Christ with his benefits freely bestowed upon us, through the grace of God.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 13.</hi> Which things also wee speak not in the words which mans wisdome teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth, comparing spiritual things with spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 7. Confirmed by the practice of the Apostles: Spiritual things ought to bee manifested (if the Apostles practice bee to bee imitated) not with the painted lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of mans wisdome, but in a spiritual stile, and in words which the Holy Ghost teaches: Therefore this is the best manner of preaching: This <hi>heavenly</hi> business cares not to bee adorned, but is content to bee taught: Hee that speaks (saith <hi>Peter</hi>) let him speak as the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of God, that is, let him use pious language, reverend, sanctified, speaking of divine things, as becomes the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Spiritual things</hi>] Confirming this argument, hee sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns the <hi>eighth:</hi> Because to spiritual things, and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual men, or men indued with the Spirit of God, a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual stile, and manner of speech ought to bee fitted, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing spiritual arguments taken out of the Scripture, which will not bee, if the preaching of the Gospel bee cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with Rhetorical flourishes, and Philosophical sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, with painted speeches; for such kind of speech is as much unbecoming the Gospel, as <hi>Herods</hi> Purple Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was unbecoming Christ: Therefore this manner of preaching is the most excellent.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 14.</hi> But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto him: neither can hee know them, because they are spiritually discerned.</q>
               <p>Hee illustrates this Doctrine, by occurring to an <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection</hi>: Some man might say, This Doctrine of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle cannot bee admitted by humane reason, for there is no man but accounts it folly, not to set out the most excellent and spiritual things with the most elegant man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of speech: Hee <hi>answers,</hi> by distinguishing men, or the same man, into <hi>Rational,</hi> and <hi>Spiritual</hi>; because hee is called rational, as hee is considered in his meer natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, or so far as in any particular act, being destitute of the Spirit, hee judgeth of divine things by the wisdome of the flesh, as also of this spiritual manner of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: And hee is called the <hi>spiritual</hi> man, so far as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed in his mind and affections, hee attends to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate of the Spirit. Concerning the former, <hi>i. e.</hi> The rational man, (not regenerated) or any one not born a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, hee grants what is objected, shewing the reasons why hee cannot apprehend nor approve this Doctrine, nor any other spiritual matter. The reasons are three. 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are foolishness unto him, and ridiculous, even those things which are the very wisdome of God. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause so far as hee is so, for want of light, as also the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of his natural wisdome against God, hee cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend spiritual things. 3. Because spiritual things are discerned only spiritually, <hi>i. e.</hi> by a spiritual light, and the Spirit within actually manifesting the object, of which the rational man is destitute: For so great is the blindness of our mind, the deceit, perverseness, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aptness to spiritual things, that unless wee are regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, and illuminated actually in every thing by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Christ, wee discern nothing in spiritual things.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 15.</hi> But hee that is spiritual, judgeth all things, yet hee himself is judged of no man.</q>
               <p>The other part of the distinction lies thus; The spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual man, so far as hee is spiritual, knows all the things of God, (<hi>viz.</hi> concerning whom wee speak) and discerns the spiritual and saving manner of handling these mysteries of God, and acknowledges them according to his measure: But hee himself, in his spiritual state and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, can bee discerned or accounted spiritual, by no man which is not spiritual, or so far as hee is not spiritual.</p>

                  <hi>Vers. 16.</hi> For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that hee may instruct him? but wee have the mind of Christ.</q>
               <p>Hee proves the answer given, by a sentence borrowed from <hi>Isai.</hi> 40.13. Because no man knows the counsel of God, but they to whom hee hath given his Spirit: And therefore no natural (or <hi>rational</hi>) man can judge con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the mysteries of Salvation, and the spiritual man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of handling them, but only they that are spiritual, so far as they have the mind of Christ revealed to them by his Spirit, such as were the Apostles, and the rest of the Faithful, every one in his own measure.</p>

                  <p>TO the former Arguments in the <hi>Chapter</hi> foregoing, (proving plainness of speech in preaching the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel) hee adds one, <hi>ver. 1, &amp; 2.</hi> and in the remaining part of the <hi>Chapter</hi> passes to the reproving of their Schism.</p>
               </argument>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 1.</hi> And I brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto Babes in Christ.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>2.</hi> I have fed you with milk, and not with meat; for hitherto yee were not able to bear it, neither yet now are yee able.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Hee takes an argument from the necessity of the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, amongst whom are found some less knowing, to whom the height of spiritual things is not only to bee tempered and seasoned with simplicity of speech, but to bee brought down to a familiar and plain manner of speaking; which hee confirms by his own experience, and the example of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> amongst whom, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst those that were carnal, and Babes in Christ, the Apostle is compelled to descend from his manly kind of speech, and, as with children, to stammer, as it were, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout divine things: Wherefore hee fed them with a more easie and familiar kind of speech, as children are fed with milk.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For yee were not</hi>] Hee gives <hi>three</hi> reasons of this his doing: The <hi>first</hi> is, because you could not then bear a more perfect manner of Preaching, as stronger meat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nor yet] Reason</hi> 2. Because neither as yet, when hee wrote these things, were they able to bear it.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 3.</hi> For yee are yet carnal; for whereas there is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you envying, and strife, and divisions, are yee not carnal, and walk as men?</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 3. Because yee are carnal, comparatively, <hi>viz.</hi> in respect to spiritual perfection, after which you ought to strive; which that hee might prove, hee passes to a reproof of the Schism which sprung up amongst them: <hi>First</hi> in general, because among them the works of the flesh were manifest, a preposterous ambition, and from that arose contentions, and thence divisions, or Schismes, which was to walk in the wayes of unregenerate and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal men.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 4.</hi> For while one saith, I am of <hi>Paul,</hi> and another, I am of <hi>Apollo,</hi> are yee not carnal?</q>
               <p>Furthermore in particular hee proves the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to bee carnal, and more specially taxes them of Schism, because they chose to themselves certain Teachers, from one of whom one would call himself, and from another, another. In the mean time hee forbids them making any
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:49391:27"/>
Schism about their Teachers, laying down <hi>fourteen</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, all which prove, that they ought not to nourish the Schism which was grown up amongst them, neither the Teachers, nor the people.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Are yee not] Argum.</hi> 1. This contending about your Teachers, argues that you are carnal: Therefore Schism is not to bee nourished.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 5.</hi> Who then is <hi>Paul?</hi> and who is <hi>Apollo</hi>? but Ministers by whom yee beleeved, even as the Lord gave to every man.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. The prime Apostles and Evangelists, not your ordinary Teachers (whose names hee mentions not) are onely the Ministers of your conversion and Faith: Therefore they are not so highly to bee magnified, that you should name your selves from them, and because of them should bee rent into factions: Therefore this Schism is not any further to bee maintained.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 6.</hi> I have planted, <hi>Apollo</hi> watered, but God gave the encrease.</p>
                  <p n="7">
                     <hi>7.</hi> So then, neither is hee that planteth any thing, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hee that watereth, but God that giveth the increase.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 3. The Ministery and labour of the Apostles and Evangelists, whether in conversion, or edification of those that are converted, profits no more (without the blessing of God) than planting or watering of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diner, if God give not the increase: Therefore so much honour (that you should glory in them) is not to bee ascribed to men, but God.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 8.</hi> Now hee that planteth, and hee that watereth are one, and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.</q>

               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 9.</hi> For wee are labourers together with God: yee are Gods husbandry, yee are Gods building.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 6. All Teachers ought to work together with God, and to minister together with him: Therefore Schisms ought not to bee by, or for them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Husbandry] Argum.</hi> 7. They that are the people of God, as a field, or building, ought to bee closely united to one another in the service of God: Therefore ought they not to bee rent into parties one from another.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 10.</hi> According unto the Grace of God which is given unto mee, as a wise Master-builder I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon: but let every man take heed how hee buildeth thereupon.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 8. Is propounded under the form of an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, whereby hee more sharply wounds their am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious Teachers, the authors of Schism, which strove by their boasting of Philosophy and Eloquence, every one to gain Disciples after them: This is the <hi>Argument</hi>: It is dangerous, lest while each of these ordinary Teachers, serve their own ambition, they build some kind of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine upon the Apostles foundation, which agrees not with the foundation: Therefore Schism is not to bee fomented.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 11.</hi> For other foundation can no man lay, than that is laid, which is Iesus Christ.</q>
               <p>Hee gives a Reason, why hee directs his admonition onely to their ordinary Teachers, about superstructures, because the summe of all saving doctrine concerning Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, as the sure and onely foundation, is laid by the Apostles, from which it is not lawful for ordinary or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Teachers to depart.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 12.</hi> Now if any man build on this foundation, Gold, Silver, precious Stones, Wood, Hay, Stubble:</q>
               <p>Therefore hee compares the doctrine of the Gospel to a building, the Apostles to builders, laying the foundation of all saving doctrine: Those Teachers that follow after, hee compares to those that build the walls upon the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation laid by the Apostles; of whom some taught <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ound doctrine agreeable to the foundation, for the truth of it, and the spiritual manner of handling it; others stuffed their preaching with Philosophical flowers, and the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of words, building as it were, Wood, Stubble, Hay, not solid matter, nor tending to salvation.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 13.</hi> Every mans work shall bee made manifest, for the day shall declare it, because it shall bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed by fire, and the fire shall try every mans work, of what sort it is.</q>
               <p>That they might here know their danger, hee fore-tells the tryal of every ones work in his preaching the Gospel (no less exact, than that of Gold-smiths in trying their metals by fire) at leastwise in the last day, wherein God will judge of all persons and works.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 14.</hi> If any mans work abide which hee hath built thereupon, hee shall receive a reward.</q>
               <p>In which day at least, whosoever hath built solid and precious doctrine, agreeable to the foundation, shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a reward of his faithfulness, according to the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of God.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 15.</hi> If any mans work shall bee burnt, hee shall suffer loss: but hee himself shall bee saved; yet so, as by fire.</q>
               <p>But if any one shall mingle Philosophical speculations, the hay of humane wisdome, the stubble of wordy elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, with his preaching; or shall add any other devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his own, which cannot indure the sentence of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine judgement, hee shall suffer loss of all his labours, but the Preacher shall bee saved, but so as by fire, <hi>i. e.</hi> if so bee hee is able to abide the fiery and exact tryal of God, whereby hee wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 16.</hi> Know yee not that yee are the Temple of God, and that the spirit of God dwelleth in you?</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 9. Appertains to preachers, as also hearers, because when they know themselves to bee the Temple of God, it is a wicked thing to defile and do violence to the Church or Temple of God, even their own conscience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing witness: Therefore this Schism is not further to bee fomented, unless they will do injury to the Spirit of God dwelling in them.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 17.</hi> If any man defile the Temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the Temple of God is holy, which Temple yee are.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 10. From the pernicious effect: It is to bee feared lest God destroy you with your vanities and dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, while you defile his Temple: Therefore this Schism is not to bee fomented any further.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 18.</hi> Let no man deceive himself: if any man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you seemeth to bee wise in this world, let him become a fool, that hee may bee wise.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 11. Propounded by way of prevention of an Objection, in maintaining this Schism you seem wise to your selves, but your self-confidence deceives you: This is the cause of Schism, and therefore you are to beware of it, and that you may beware of the Schism, hee prescribes the way how they should beware, which is this, that hee which seems to excel in humane wisdome, renounce this vain opinion of his own wisdome, and yeeld up himself in obedience unto God, following the plain manner of Preaching, which though it seem foolishness to men, yet it alone is able to make us wise.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 19.</hi> For the wisdome of this world is foolishness with God: for it is written, Hee taketh the wise in their own craftiness.</p>
                  <p n="20">
                     <hi>20.</hi> And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Hee confirms the counsel that hee had given, from the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:49391:27"/>
judgement of God, concerning carnal wisdome, that God accounts it foolishness, especially when carnal wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome rejects the institutions of God, and despises the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of them, which hee proves by the testimony of the Scriptures, the <hi>first</hi> is of <hi>Iob</hi> 5.13. The sense where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is, However vain men may seem wise to themselves and the world, yet God so frustrates their devices, and turns them into snares, that they may fall by their own Counsels, rather than by others; and thus hee convinceth them of folly. Another Testimony is in <hi>Psal.</hi> 94.11. Where God declares the thoughts of the wise to bee vain, which savour onely humane things, for those things which they imagine to make most for their happiness, contribute least.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 21.</hi> Therefore let no man glory in men, for all things are yours.</p>
                  <p n="22">
                     <hi>22.</hi> Whether <hi>Paul,</hi> or <hi>Apollo,</hi> or <hi>Cephas,</hi> or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come, all are yours.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 12. Propounded by way of dehortation from the Schism, which hee reprehended: Because Schism, and making parties concerning their Teachers, is unholy boasting in men: Therefore this Schism is not to bee fomented: They gloried in their Teachers, when they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed too much to them, depending upon them, and made them (as it were) Masters of their Faith, when they ought onely to depend upon God, who speaks by his Ministers, when, and as much as hee please.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>All things</hi>] Confirming this dehortation, hee adds <hi>Argum.</hi> 13. Because all your Teachers, the least and the greatest, even the Apostles themselves, and all things in the world, things present, and things to come, life and death, and whatsoever else can bee reckoned up, are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of God, that they may bee serviceable to the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the faithful: Therefore you ought not for the vain glory of your Teachers, to rent your selves into parties, or boast in your Teachers, as if you were the flock of learned men.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 23.</hi> And yee are Christs, and Christ is Gods.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 14. The last Argument is in the last verse, wherein calling their Teachers as also the people, and the gifts and dignity of all, to the fountain, hee reduceth them into order, that they might depend upon Christ, and God alone, and in him might make their boast: for as the world is ours, and all things in the world, are designed as it were to our good, so wee are of Christ, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed by him, that wee might bee his f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <argument>
                  <p>AS amongst the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> their glorious Teachers were magnified by their followers, so the Apostles were meanly thought of, and the other faithful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of <hi>Christ,</hi> as if they had not been to bee compared with these eloquent <hi>Ministers,</hi> either in gifts, or suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess: The <hi>Apostle</hi> teaches that this judgement is to bee rectified, and the <hi>Schism</hi> not to bee fomented any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>There are <hi>two</hi> parts of the <hi>Chapter</hi>: In the <hi>first,</hi> hee corrects this corrupt judgement of theirs, <hi>to vers. 14.</hi> In the <hi>second,</hi> hee shuts up all hee had to say by way of reproof touching their Schism, <hi>to the end.</hi> Hee laies down <hi>nine</hi> Arguments (why hee corrects their rash judgement concerning the Apostle, and his companions, and other faithful Ministers of Christ, and of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal comparing of these with their <hi>Teachers.</hi>) Which prove that wee must beware of making unbecomming comparisons of the <hi>Ministers</hi> of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> neither ought wee rashly to judge of any ones gifts.</p>
               </argument>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 1.</hi> Let a man so account of us, as of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of Christ, and Stewards of the mysteries of God.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. Which is propounded in a similitude taken from Stewards: Wee, whom you despise, although wee are not Masters of your Faith, yet wee are the Ministers of Christ, from whose hands you ought to receive the treasure of salvation, and the bread of life: Therefore you ought to beware of comparing the gifts of Teachers.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 2.</hi> Moreover, it is required in Stewards, that a man bee found faithful.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. That which commends the Ministery of the Gospel, is not the excellency of gifts, but a faithful dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation of their gifts, and the mystery of salvation, whereof God alone is the just Judge: Therefore wee must beware of this unequal comparing of the gifts of Teachers.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 3.</hi> But with mee it is a very small thing, that I should bee Iudged of you, or of mans judgement: yea, I judge not mine own self.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 3. Because neither yee, nor any men, nor I <hi>Paul</hi> am a competent Judge of my own dignity: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore yee are to take heed of this unequal comparing of Teachers: For if <hi>Paul</hi> could not determine in what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem hee himself ought to bee had, the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were rash, who determined concerning the dignity of <hi>Paul</hi> and the rest of their Teachers.</p>

                  <hi>Vers. 4.</hi> For I know nothing by my self, yet am I not hereby justified; but hee that judgeth mee is the Lord.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 4. Confirming the former: I an Apostle, though I am not conscious of ill mannaging my office, yet I dare not acquit my self, or determine of my own dignity to the injury of others, but I leave the judgement wholly to God: Therefore this unjust comparing of Teachers from their gifts, is to bee taken heed of.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 5.</hi> Therefore judge nothing before the time, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts, and then shall every man have praise of God.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 5. Propounded by way of dehortation; To judge, especially by way of comparison, concerning the dignity [or worth] of men, is not seasonable, before the coming of the Lord: Therefore wee are to take heed of this unfitting comparing of men, from their gifts.</p>

               <p>Hee shews the afflictions of himself and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> (which are called the last of the Apostles, because they were called after the Ascension of Christ, and by a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial command sent to the Gentiles) (as it is, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.2. &amp; 14.14.) shewing that they were set forth of God in the sight of all, as those that conflicted with all kind of troubles.</p>

               </q>
               <p>As to the other part of the conclusion, because some amongst them were puffed up, in hopes to escape cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, as if the Apostle would not come unto them,</p>
               <p>Hee threatens 1. That hee would come. 2. That hee would try, whether in those Teachers there bee that Power of the Spirit, or meerly the eloquence of words, without the demonstration of the Spirit.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 20.</hi> For the Kingdome of God is not in word, but in Power.</q>
               <p>Hee gives an account why hee esteemed nothing of their meer eloquence, or their boasting in human wisdom, because the Kingdome of Christ, and the Salvation or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification of men, is not promoted with words, or the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of words, but by the Power of God.</p>
               <q>

               <p>Lastly, lest any of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> whether Teachers or their Followers should foment Schism, hee propounds this choice to them, Whether they would that hee should come to their correction, with the authority of Church-censures, which hee resolved to do, if they fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther made Parties, and fomented Schism; Or whether they would that hee should come to their comfort, in the spirit of love and meekness, which hee intended, if they repented.</p>
               <p>Thus hee passes to the <hi>Excommunication</hi> of the Ince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stuous Person.</p>

               <head>THE SECOND ARTICLE CONCERNING THE INCESTUOUS PERSON.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>LEst they should think his Commination vain, (whereof hee speaks toward the <hi>end</hi> of the former <hi>Chapter</hi>) he commands that the <hi>Incestuous</hi> Person be <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated,</hi> propounding to that end, <hi>eleven</hi> Argum.</p>
               </argument>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 1.</hi> It is reported commonly, that there is fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his Fathers Wife.</q>
               <p>The <hi>first Argument</hi>; because the Incestuous Person is defiled by an hainous wickedness, which the Gentiles will not so much as speak of without detestation: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee is to bee Excommunicated.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 2.</hi> And yee are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that hee that hath done this deed might bee taken away from among you.</q>
               <p>The <hi>second Argument</hi> is joyned with the reproof of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> because you ought long since to have grieved for the great offence, and to have excommunicated the wicked person, and not to excuse his fault by lessening of it, or making a jest at it, or glorying in it, as if you were taken with the fact.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 3.</hi> For I verily as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I was present, concerning him that hath so done this deed,</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <hi>4.</hi> In the Name of our Lord Iesus Christ, when yee are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Iesus Christ,</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <hi>5.</hi> To deliver such a one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the Spirit may bee saved in the day of the Lord Iesus.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 3. Because now besides that ordinary power which you have in the Ecclesiastical Senate, <hi>viz.</hi> you are instructed and obliged also by an extraordinary Power to excommunicate him; for truly you have my mind, or spirit, judgement, opinion and authority concerning that wicked person (as much in my absence as if I was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent:) Therefore when you are gathered together, being fortified by this Apostolical Epistle, (in which the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, or mind, or opinion of mee an Apostle is contained) and by the authority of Christ, (in whose name the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of the Church are to bee made) that you deliver that wicked one to Satan, or excommunicate him. Hee sayes, <hi>Deliver him to Satan,</hi> because hee that is rejected and cast out of the Church by Excommunication from the Church-dignity of the Saints, as to the outward condition of a man, the same also is declared to bee (as to his outward condition) in the Kingdome, bondage and power of Satan; for to bee a Citizen even in the outward state of the Church, (which is said to bee the Kingdome of God) is a greater honour than to reign without the Church: Therefore hee that is Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated, hee loses much of his repute, and honour, and dignity, and is reckoned amongst the subjects of the devil.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Destruction of the flesh] Argum.</hi> 4. From the end of Excommunication, by way of preventing an objection, because Excommunication is a means of Repentance and Salvation; for truly by this censure the pride of the flesh may bee mortified, and the new creature bee saved in the day of judgement: Therefore hee is to bee excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 6.</hi> Your glorying is not good: know yee not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 5. Lest the whole Church should bee infected and polluted by the contagion of so great a wickedness, as by a little leaven the whole lump is leavened: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Incestuous Person is to bee Excommunicated. This Argument is enforced by repeating his reproof of the <hi>Corinthians.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 7.</hi> Purge out therefore the old leaven, that yee may bee a new lump, as yee are unleavened: for even Christ our Passeover is sacrificed for us.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 6. Propounded by the continuing of the <hi>Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi>; because the Christian Church is to bee purged from scandals, yea, and the hearts of Christians, from all the corruption of their old nature, with no less dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence than heretofore the houses of the Jews, under the Law, were purged from common leaven, before the Passeover was sacrificed: Therefore the Incestuous Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is to bee Excommunicated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That yee may bee] Argum.</hi> 7. From the profitableness of it. Yee must endeavour, that yee may bee a new and holy society, an holy lump, or that yee may bee found new creatures, really and in deed, as yee are unleavened by your obligation and profession, or as you are Saints: Therefore the Incestuous Person is to bee Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Passeover</hi>] Confirming this Argument, hee adds the <hi>eighth,</hi> because the thing signified in the Passeover, <hi>to wit,</hi> the Sacrifice of Jesus Christ, doth not less engage Christians to their duties, (represented by the celebrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ceremonies of the Feast) that is, to bee careful, that holiness may flourish in us, and in the Church; than it did oblige the Jews heretofore, to observe the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the Feast, in which the Paschal Lamb, being a type, sacrificed was set before them.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 8.</hi> Therefore let us keep the Feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice, and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness, but with the unleavened bread of sincere truth.</q>
               <p>From hence hee infers, (as it were by a perswasive conclusion) the <hi>ninth Argum.</hi> That malice and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness being put away, both from themselves, and from the Church, and by consequence, that Incestuous Person be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing excommunicated, they might worship and serve the Lord cheerfully, and holily, in sincerity and truth: The force of this Argument is this, Wee cannot live holily and righteously (as the signification of the Feast of the Paschal Lamb typified, requires of us) unless the leaven of our former life, and wicked practices, be purged away out of us, and the House of God, or the Church; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less wee endeavour to keep sincerity and truth in us and the Church: Therefore hee is to bee Excommunicated.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 9.</hi> I wrote unto you in an Epistle, not to company with fornicators.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 10. Because he before forbad them by his Epistle to have fellowship with Fornicators, and by consequence they might understand, that Fornicators were to bee Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated from the Church, and much more ince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stuous persons: Therefore that Incestuous Person is now to bee excommunicated.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 10.</hi> Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the Covetous, or with Extorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners, or with Idolaters; for then must you needs go out of the world.</q>
               <p>Lest they should excuse themselves, hee shews them that that Precept concerning vicious persons, was not to bee understood by them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of those that were in the world, or without the Church; because thus the Apostle had commanded a thing impossible, because they must eithe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> necessarily live amongst such wicked persons, or go out of the world; for they lived at <hi>Corinth,</hi> the Citizens where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of (with whom the Faithful necessarily must have civil commerce) remained for the most part Infidels.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 11.</hi> But now have I written unto you, not to keep company, if any man that is called a Brother, bee a Fornicator, or Covetous, or an Idolater, or a Railer, or a Drunkard, or an Extortioner, with such a one, no, not to eat.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 11. If you have not been heretofore sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly instructed in this business, at least yee now have my
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:49391:29"/>
mind, which you have heard out of this Epistle, that you must not ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> with a Professor, or Brother, that is a Fornicatour; and by consequence that Brother is to bee excommunicated, who being convinced of his faults by the Church, remains still wicked without repentance: Therefore now you ought much more to conclude that the incestuous person is to bee excommunicated.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 12.</hi> For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not you judge them that are within?</p>
                  <p n="13">
                     <hi>13.</hi> But them that are without, God judgeth; therefore put away from among your selves that wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Another reason of the Exposition is given, by urging the <hi>twelfth Argument,</hi> for excommunicating the ince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stuous person, because from thence (that neither the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, nor the Church, had right to exercise Church Censures upon those who were without the Church, but they were left to the judgement of God onely) they ought to conclude, that to judge of the members of the Church belonged to them: Therefore that wicked incestuous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, was to bee taken away from amongst them by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, which is the scope of the whole Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

               </argument>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 1.</hi> Dare any of you, having a matter against a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, go to Law before the unjust, and not before the Saints?</q>
               <p>By <hi>eleven</hi> Arguments hee proveth that Christians ought not to contend before Heathen Judges: <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. It is a shameful thing, when there are holy Judges, to go to Law under Infidel Judges: Therefore wee must not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend before Infidel Judges.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 2.</hi> Do you not know that the Saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall bee judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters?</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. The Saints which shall judge the World, are much more worthy of judging matters pertaining to this world: Therefore wee must not contend under Infidels.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 3.</hi> Know yee not that wee shall judge Angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 3. The Saints shall judge Angels, <hi>viz.</hi> Evil Angels, in the day of judgement; therefore they are much more fit to judge of temporal things: Therefore wee must not contend under Heathen Judges: The Saints are said to judge Angels and the world, Because they being now acquitted in judgement, as assessors in judgement with Christ, shall consent to the sentence of the Judge against the enemies of God and the Church.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 4.</hi> If then yee have judgements of things pertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this life, set them to judge who are least e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed in the Church.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 4. Those that are of least esteem in the Church, are rather to bee appointed Judges, than that wee should betake ourselves to Infidels: Therefore, &amp;c.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 5.</hi> I speak to your shame, is it so, that there is not a wise man amongst you? no not one that shall bee able to judge between his Brethren?</q>
               <p>Hee corrects himself in this Argument, by shewing that hee would have appointed Judges, not simply those that are least esteemed in the Church, but this hee would have done by a comparative concession, from what they practised, that hee might with shame restrain them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Is it so] Argum.</hi> 5. You have amongst you those that are wise men, and yet you betake your selves to prophane judicatories, as if there were not wise men amongst you, which might decide controversies: Therefore it behoves you not thus to behave your selves.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 6.</hi> But Brother goeth to Law with Brother, and that before the unbeleevers.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 6. Seeing that you are Brethren, yee ought not to contend one with another in going to Law: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore much less under Heathens.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 7.</hi> Now therefore, there is utterly a fault among you, because you go to Law one with another; why do yo not rather take wrong? why do you not rather suffer your selves to bee defrauded?</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 7. Strivings and contentions, discover your weakness, infirmities, and sin: Therefore you must not contend, especially before Infidels.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wherefore] Argum.</hi> 8. I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> would bee better to suffer injury and wrong, than with scandal to contend: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee ought not to contend, especialy under In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 8.</hi> Nay, you do wrong, and defraud, and that your Brethren.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 9. Those that are active in contending a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst you, joyn it with injury, and defrauding of your Brethren, inasmuch as the actors are full of revenge, pride, and covetousness: Therefore your contending is unjust, and especially under Infidels.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 9.</hi> Know yee not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the Kingdome of God? bee not deceived: neither Fornicators, nor Idolaters, nor Adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,</p>
                  <p n="10">

               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 10. These unjust contendings, as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kinds of wickedness, and abominable impurity, which are here reckoned up, keep men out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heaven: Therefore you ought not to contend, &amp;c.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 11.</hi> And such were some of you; but yee are washed, but yee are sanctified, but yee are justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Name of the Lord Iesus, and by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of our God.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 11. And last: Seeing you <hi>Corinthians</hi> have been defiled with all, or most, or at least with some of these fore-said vices, and now, so far as in charity wee may judge of you, yee have obtained remission of sins, and are sanctified through the Spirit, and cloathed with the Righteousness of Christ; you ought to beware (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving power from the Grace of Christ) le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 12.</hi> All things are lawful unto mee, but all things are not expedient; all things are lawful for mee, but I will not bee brought under the power of any.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>The other part</hi> of the <hi>Chapter</hi> containing the fourth Article of the Epistle followes, concerning the avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing simple Fornication (as it is called) which the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> accounted a thing indifferent, as other Gentiles did: Hee proceeds to reproof, by preventing their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology which they were ready to make: The <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> might say, All indifferent things are lawful for us, but as meat, so also Fornication is indifferent: Therefore it is lawful for us. <hi>First,</hi> Hee answers in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, by limiting of the <hi>Major, viz,</hi> that all indifferent things are lawful, so far as they are convenien<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <q>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:49391:29"/>
                  <hi>Vers. 13.</hi> Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord: and the Lord for the body.</q>
               <p>Further hee <hi>answers</hi> in special to the <hi>minor,</hi> shewing the difference betwixt meats and fornication, granting that it is lawful to use any kind of meat, because God hath ordained to the good of nature, meats for the belly, and the belly for meats, but yet with a temporary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction; for as God will destroy meats, so hee will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the belly, as to the use it now hath; so that for the sake of the belly, wee ought not to endanger our eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Salvation, or the Salvation of others, eating with of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence: As to that which concerns fornication, hee denies it lawful upon any necessity, as meat is lawful, but sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to be a sin, and to be avoided; and that he proves by <hi>six</hi> Arguments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. Because the body is not made for fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or ordained to that end, as the belly for meats, and meats for the belly, but that it should bee a member of Christ our Lord, who is ordained to bee the head of the man, to govern the whole body, that it may bee kept holy: Therefore Fornication is no way lawful.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 14.</hi> And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. Our bodies shall bee raised glorious in the Resurrection, as the Body of Christ was raised: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ought not to bee defiled with fornication.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 15.</hi> Know you not that your bodies are the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an Harlot? God forbid.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 3. The Faithful which are members of Christ, are not by fornication to bee made the members of an Harlot, which argument hee sharpens with an Interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation: Therefore, &amp;c.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 16.</hi> What, Know yee not, that hee that is joyned to an Harlot, is one body? For two (saith hee) shall bee one flesh.</q>
               <p>That hee may confirm this <hi>argument,</hi> hee proves from the Analogy of Marriage, that fornication with an har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot, makes the fornicators one flesh; and by consequence the fornicator is made the member of an harlot: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fornication is unlawful.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 17.</hi> But hee that is joyned unto the Lord, is one spirit.</q>
               <p>Further hee proves that Believers are members of Christ, because joyned by Faith, and are one Mystical Body with Christ, one Spiritual Body, or one Spirit.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 18.</hi> Flee fornication: every sin that a man doth, is without the body: but hee that committeth forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, sinneth against his own body.</q>
               <p>Hee turns the <hi>Position</hi> into a <hi>Dehortation,</hi> and adds the <hi>fourth Argum</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by way of comparison with other sins; other sins abuse the object without, chiefly and principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but fornication abuses its own body, and more dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honors the body than any other sin: Therefore it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 19.</hi> What, know yee not that your own body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which yee have of God, and you are not your own?</p>

The Faithful are not their own, but purchased with the Blood of Christ: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ought to take heed, that they defile not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with fornication, but rather endeavour by an holy conversation, both of body and soul, to glorifie God their Redeemer, whose they are.</p>

               <head>THE FIFTH ARTICLE OF CASES TOUCH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ING MARRIAGE.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>THe Apostle being enquired of by the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> concerning Marriage-Cases, in this <hi>Chapter</hi> hee answers <hi>five</hi> of their demands.</p>
               </argument>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 1.</hi> Now concerning the things whereof yee wrote unto me; it is good for a man not to touch a woman.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>2.</hi> Nevertheless to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband.</p>
               </q>
               <p>The <hi>first</hi> enquiry is of men unmarried, who lived a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle life, whether it were best for them to marry: The reasons of this demand were <hi>two,</hi> the fear of troubles, and the fear of defilement in Marriage. That which belongs to the <hi>first</hi> reason, wee are to remember that the <hi>Corinthians</hi> had been a long time in danger of persecution; although now they lived prosperously; and the most part feared no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. The Apostle answers those that are in such a case, if no necessity lyes upon them to marry, it is good and profitable not to marry, but where there is danger of sinning by incontinence, wee are rather to eschew for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication and sin, than the danger of troubles in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 3.</hi> Let the husband render to the wife due benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence: and likewise also the wife unto the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.</q>
               <p>That which concerns the scruple<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t any one should think his conscience by Matrimonial Society defiled, hee declares not only the conjugal bed to bee undefiled, but also the right of the Marriage-bed ought to bee granted to him that seeks a wife, whereto hee subjoyns four rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Due] Reason</hi> 1. Because that benevolence is due by the Law of Marriage.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 4.</hi> The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband hath no power of his own body, but the wife.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 2. Because by conjugal agreement, the husband hath power over the wives body, and the wife over the husbands, chiefly to avoid fornication.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 5.</hi> Defraud you not one another, except it bee with consent for a time, that you may give your selves to fasting and prayer, and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 3. Because otherwise there would fall out an unjust defrauding of each others part, if commerce should bee denied without reason.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That you may give your selves</hi>] Hee limits what hee had said with a special exception<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unless it bee agreed by consent on both parts, that for a time they might give themselves to fasting and prayer.</p>

                     </gap>t Satan tempt] Reason</hi> 4. Because after the set time, if benevolence desired bee denied, it is dangerous lest Satan tempts the party defrauded, for his incontinency, to commit adultery.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 6.</hi> But I speak this by permission, and not of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment.</p>
                  <p n="7">
                     <hi>7.</hi> For I would that all men were even as I my self: but every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, another after that.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Hee explains this his opinion touching contracting Marriage, and using conjugal society, that it is not an u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal precept, as if here commanded Marriage to all, but that the granting or permission is universal, only in case of incontinency; for plainly, if by the will of God it might bee, the Apostle could with the <hi>Corinthians</hi> (who moved the question) both continence, and the advantages of single life, which God had bestowed upon him; but because the gift of Continence is not given to
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:49391:30"/>
every one, hee saith, that hee spake this by permission, which hee hath granted.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 8.</hi> I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, it is good for them, if they abide even as I.</p>
                  <p n="9">
                     <hi>9.</hi> But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.</p>
               </q>
               <p>From hence hee gathers up the sum of what hee had said, that hee might plainly answer those who lived un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>married, or Widows, it was convenient that they should abide in that state, if they could contain, if not, that they marry.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For it is better</hi>] Hee gives a reason, because it behoved them rather to beware of burning lusts, which defile the conscience with sin, than of the troubles of Marriage, even those troubles which accompany a married state in times of persecution.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 10.</hi> And unto the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, let not the wife depart from her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.</q>
               <p>The <hi>second</hi> thing they enquire of, is concerning Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce, the parts whereof are <hi>two</hi>: The <hi>first</hi> is, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both being Believers, whether it is lawful for marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Christians to make a Divorce, unless the case bee for adultery? Hee <hi>answers,</hi> that it is not lawful; which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer that hee may confirm, hee denies that hee command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any thing new, or from special revelation, but that hee repeats an old command by the authority of the Lord, who in the Institution of Marriage, established, that the married should bee one flesh, whereupon that separation and divorce is unlawful.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 11.</hi> But if shee depart, let her remain unmarried, or bee reconciled to her husband, and let not the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band put away his wife.</q>
               <p>But if the wife, (pretending necessary causes of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting, as danger of life, or such like) shall depart, hee commands that either shee bee reconciled to her husband, or abstain from new Marriage, and by consequence much more from fornication; and that hee commands both for the punishment of frowardness and impatience, and the tryal of sincerity, lest this liberty should bee drawn into licentiousness: In the mean time hee commands the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band that hee put not away his wife, or give her cause to depart.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 12.</hi> But to the rest speak I, not the Lord, If any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and shee bee pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.</p>
                  <p n="13">
                     <hi>13.</hi> And the woman which hath an husband that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth not, and if hee bee pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him.</p>
               </q>
               <p>The other <hi>part</hi> of their enquiry follows, wherein the question is concerning those that are married, where the one is an Infidel, whether Divorce is lawful? Hee saith that hee will <hi>answer</hi> to this part, from the authority of special revelation, because God had not determined it in the Law, what Christians should do in that case; this is it which hee saith, <hi>The Lord</hi> hath not determined it in the old Law, <hi>but I, viz.</hi> by special revelation from the Lord, will determine it. In the <hi>first</hi> part of his answer, hee forbids that the unbelieving party should bee put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, if shee desire not to leave him.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 14.</hi> For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean, but now are they holy.</q>
               <p>Hee lays down <hi>five</hi> Reasons. <hi>First,</hi> Because an unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving person is sanctified, though not in it self, yet to the use of the Believer; although not simply, yet so far, that Marriage is sanctified to the believing party, and to the children brought forth: Therefore let not the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving wife bee put away, if shee desire to tarry.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Else] Reason</hi> 2. Confirming the former, from the consequent absurdity, because otherwise the children of Christians, in such a case, would not bee born under the Covenant, they would not bee born Christians, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to Christ in holiness; the contrary to which is true: Therefore let not the unbelieving wife bee put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, if shee desire to tarry.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 15.</hi> But if the unbelieving depart, let him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part: A brother or a Sister is not under bondage in such cases: but God hath called us to peace.</q>
               <p>Before hee adds the reasons that are behind, hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds another part of the answer: If the unbelieving party will not co-habit, but depart, in this case, hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares the Marriage to bee void, and the party believing to bee free.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To peace] Reason</hi> 3. Proving that the unbelieving party is not to bee put away, being willing to stay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Believers are called to maintain peace with all: Therefore if the unbelieving party admits of equal terms of peace, shee is not to bee put away.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 16.</hi> For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband? Or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save thy wife?</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 4. Because by dwelling together the unbeliever may bee gained.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 17.</hi> But as God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath called every one, so let him walk, and so I ordain in all Churches.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 5. Because every one, in what condition soever, ought to abide in that honest and lawful calling, in which God by his Providence hath set them, as the Apostle taught in all Churches: Therefore wee must also abide in Marriage with an unbeliever, being willing to stay: For whereas Marriage hath been contracted in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenism, God would not that the calling of one to the Grace of Christ Jesus, should defraud the party not yet converted: The Apostle prescribes the same Law to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving servants, that they shake not off the yoke of an unbelieving Master, who desired not to put away the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant converted to the Faith.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 18.</hi> Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised: Is any called in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumcisian? let him not bee circumcised.</p>
                  <p n="19">
                     <hi>19.</hi> Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but the keeping of the Commandments of God.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Hee confirms the Reason fore-going by an Induction. <hi>First,</hi> of Circumcision and Uncircumcision, neither where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was to bee stood upon by a Christian, but this only, that in both states, they observed the Moral Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 20.</hi> Let every man abide in the same calling, wherein hee was called.</q>
               <p>From hence, because in one example of the Inducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the fulness of it might easily bee apprehended, hee infers a general position of abiding in that state wherein God had called him.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 21.</hi> Art thou called being a servant? care not for it: but if thou mayst bee made free, use it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</q>
               <p>Further, hee adds another member of the Induction, concerning bondage, in which hee adviseth them to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide, unless God had opened a door to their liberty.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 22.</hi> For hee that is called in the Lord, being a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, is the Lords Free-man: Likewise also hee that is called, being free, is Christs servant.</q>
               <p>Hee gives a reason, Because bodily servitude is no diminution to the spiritual liberty of Christians, from the guilt of sin and wrath, neither doth bodily liberty ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt and free us from the service of Christ.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 23.</hi> Yee are bought with a price, bee not yee the servants of men.</q>
               <p>By the way hee admonisheth them, that (whether bond or free, as to the body) that they take heed they do not things unlawful in themselves, by the command or will of men, because that would bee, to serve men against Christ, who had bought them with a price, that in all things they should do the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:49391:30"/>
Will of their Redeemer, not of men.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 24.</hi> Brethren, let every man wherein bee is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, therein abide with God.</q>
               <p>That no man might rashly depart from his Calling, hee further inculcates a general Precept of abiding with God in the present condition of life, in obedience unto God, until it should seem good to him to change their condition.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 25.</hi> Now concerning Virgins, I have no comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of the Lord; yet I give my judgement as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to bee faithful.</q>
               <p>The <hi>third</hi> inquiry which the <hi>Corinthians</hi> made to <hi>Paul, concerning Virgins, Male and Female, whether they might marry or not?</hi> To which being about to give answer, hee premiseth, that hee had no special command, whereby the state of Virginity was either injoyned, or prohibited, but that hee would faithfully give his advice, and his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of the convenience, as it became him, to whom God had vouchsafed mercy to bee faithful.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 26.</hi> I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, I say, that it is good for a man so to bee.</p>
                  <p n="27">
                     <hi>27.</hi> Art thou bound unto a Wife? seek not to bee loosed; art thou loosed from a Wife? seek not a wife.</p>
               </q>
               <p>There are <hi>three</hi> parts of the answer: <hi>First,</hi> In the present necessity, or the danger of persecution, as hee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids those that are married, to put away their Wives, so hee saith it is more convenient, that they that are single should continue unmarried, <hi>viz.</hi> if they have the gift (as hee said before) of continency.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 28.</hi> But and if thou marry, thou hast not sinned, and if a Virgin marry, shee hath not sinned: never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless such shall have trouble in the flesh.</q>
               <p>The other <hi>part</hi> of the answer follows, wherein hee teacheth, that to marry is not sinful, but incident to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral troubles, concerning which hee will not any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther treat, lest hee should seem to disswade them from marriage, more than was safe.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 29.</hi> But this I say, Brethren, the time is short, it remaineth, that both they that have Wives, bee as though they had none:</p>
                  <p n="30">
                     <hi>30.</hi> And they that weep, as though they wept not, and they that rejoyce, as though they rejoyced not, and they that buy, as though they possessed not:</p>
               </q>
               <p>The <hi>third</hi> part of the answer follows, wherein hee commands, that whether they married or not, they should take heed to themselves that they bee not much moved with the advantages, or disadvantages, the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures or troubles of this short life, but moderately bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prosperity and adversity, they should provide for the life which is to come, alwaies prepared to suffer sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful things, and to leave a joyful condition, according to the Will of God, for this is as much as if they had not Wives, as if they wept not, &amp;c. whilst they using a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage-state, are not hindred in their race to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heaven, but they go forward with all expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, through sorrow and joy, through the convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and inconveniences of this life, all occasions, all changes.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 31.</hi> And they that use this world, as not abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing it: for the fashion of this world passeth away.</q>
               <p>The reason of this is laid down, <hi>Because</hi> the good and evil things of this life, as a shadow, pass away: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought wee to use the things of this life, as it were in our passage, that they hinder us not in our race.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 32.</hi> But I would have you without carefulness; hee that is unmarried careth for the things that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Lord, how hee may please the Lord:</p>
                  <p n="33">
                     <hi>33.</hi> But hee that is married, careth for the things that are of the world, how hee may please his Wife.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Hee laies down <hi>two</hi> Reasons of his counsel about the keeping themselves unmarried, <hi>First,</hi> That they might bee freed from trouble, which the fear of persecution, and of the present condition, might cast those that are mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into. <hi>Reason</hi> 2. Because hee that is unmarried, more conveniently is at leisure for divine imployments, or to attend upon the exercises of Religion, and more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to please God: But hee that is married is forced by his Calling<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to lay out much of his time about earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly businesses, and houshold-cares, and so in lawful things to please his Wife, which care, although it may bee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, where it is performed in the fear of God, yet it is not so immediate obedience, and so near to God, as that which is placed in the exercises of Religion.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 34.</hi> There is difference also between a Wife, and a Virgin, the unmarried Woman careth for the things of the Lord, that shee may bee holy, both in body, and in spirit: but shee that is married, careth for the things of the world, how she may please her Husband.</q>
               <p>Hee shews the same difference to bee betwixt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Virgins, and Women that are married: That a Virgin may with fewer avocations, and less difficulty, more holily (both in body and soul) attend to holy im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, because shee hath no family to take care of; This is called <hi>Holiness,</hi> not as it is opposite to sin, but as opposed to <hi>Civil</hi> or <hi>Common:</hi> So<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Ministery of the Gospel may bee called more holy, than any civil Calling: But a Wife is usually incumbred with houshold-cares, and an indeavour to please her Husband, nor can shee so free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have leisure for holy exercises.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 35.</hi> And this I speak for your own profit, not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is comely, and that you may attend upon the Lord without distraction.</q>
               <p>The Apostle expounds all this his advice, that it tends onely to this, that they may more conveniently and fitly bee composed, to attend upon God without distraction in the exercises of Religion, if they have the gift of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency, not that hee might cast upon them a snare of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity to abstain from marriage, if they had not the gift of continency.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 36.</hi> But if any man think that hee behaveth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self uncomely towards his Virgin, if shee pass the flower of her age, and need so require, let him do what hee will, hee sinneth not; let them marry.</q>
               <p>The <hi>Fourth</hi> matter that is inquired of, is, <hi>Concerning the duty of Parents, in whose power are Daughters mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riagable, whether advisedly they may give their Virgin Daughters to marriage or not?</hi> The Answer hath <hi>two</hi> parts; The <hi>first</hi> upon a <hi>threefold</hi> supposition. 1. If any one is suspected to detain his Daughter from Marriage longer than is expedient. 2. If his Daughter have passed the flower of her age, <hi>i. e.</hi> hath attained to the twentieth year of her age, and begins to bee more than of ripe years. 3. If hee see the mind of the Virgin in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable to Marriage, let him follow the will of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, and his own. Let the Daughter, and the Son in Law, whom the Father shall chuse, bee joyned in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, the Parent sins not in it.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 37.</hi> Nevertheless, hee that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so decreed in his heart, that hee will keep his Virgin, doth well.</q>
               <p>The other part of the <hi>Answer,</hi> also upon a <hi>threefold</hi> sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, 1. If the Parent bee perswaded that hee wrongs not his Daughter, if hee with-hold her from Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. 2. If his Daughter have the gift of continence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and out of no necessity the Father is moved to seek an Husband for her, so that the Parent may determine of his Daughter as hee please. 3. If hee purpose to keep his Virgin unmarried, hee hath done well, saith hee, for the advantage of his Daughter.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 38.</hi> So then, hee that giveth her in Marriage, doth well; but hee that giveth her not in Marriage, doth better.</q>
               <p>Whereupon hee concludes in the <hi>first</hi> case, that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent does well, or for the benefit of his Daughter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And in the <hi>other</hi> case, that the Parent does better, or, that
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:49391:31"/>
hee more consults the benefit of his Daughter: in the mean time hee asserts that there is sin in neither.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 39.</hi> The Wife is bound by the Law, as long as her Husband liveth: but if her Husband bee dead, shee is at liberty to bee married to whom shee will, onely in the Lord.</q>
               <p>The <hi>fifth</hi> thing that is inquired of, is this, <hi>Whether se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Marriages of Widows are lawful or not?</hi> The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer hath <hi>two</hi> parts. 1. Hee saith it is lawful with a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation, if so bee they marry with pious affections, and with a person that is a beleever, and to one whom shee may by the Law of God: for this it is to <hi>marry in the Lord,</hi> so to marry, that the blessing of God may bee expected.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 40.</hi> But shee is happier if shee so abide, after my judgement; and I think also that I have the Spirit of God.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Hee answers, although it bee lawful, yet it is not expedient for the most part, especially when in danger of persecution, or in present necessity: Because shee shall bee more happy, if shee abide in her Widow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, <hi>i. e.</hi> shee shall live in more tranquillity, and void of troubles, which <hi>second</hi> Marriages might create to her. Modestly insinuating this his advice concerning the conveniency of it, to bee divine, hee strongly asserts that it most certainly conduceth to convenience; for more is said, than if hee had spoken this without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuation.</p>

               <head>THE <hi>Sixth</hi> ARTICLE CONCERNING THE AVOIDING OF THINGS <hi>offered to Idols.</hi>
               </head>
               <argument>
                  <p>THe <hi>sixth Article</hi> of the <hi>Epistle</hi> follows, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the avoiding of things offered to Idols, <hi>Chap. 8, 9, 10,</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 1.</hi> Now as touching things offered unto Idols, wee know that wee all have knowledge: knowledge puffeth up; but charity edifieth.</q>
               <p>The disputation which is contained in this <hi>Chapter</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in the answering of <hi>three</hi> Objections, from whence it appears, that it is not simply lawful to feed upon things offered to Idols.</p>
               <p>The <hi>first Objection</hi>; wee are sufficiently instructed by knowledge, concerning the lawful use of things offered to Idols: Therefore wee may lawfully eat of them. Hee answers by way of concession, and correction, to this sense, although any one knows his liberty in using things offered to Idols, yet a bare knowledge is not sufficient, unless it bee joyned with charity in use and practice; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause knowledge without charity puffeth up, and makes them proud despisers of the Brethren that know but little; but joyned with charity if edifies, <hi>i. e.</hi> accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates it self for the good of others.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Verse 2.</hi> And if any man think that hee knoweth any thing, hee knoweth nothing yet as hee ought to know.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <hi>3.</hi> But if any man know God, the same is known of him.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Hee explains what hee had spoken, by distinguishing betwixt him that knows with pride, and him that knows with charity to God and his neighbour. The one, who hath knowledge joyned with pride, knows nothing so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidly, because hee is puffed up with a vain opinion of his own knowledge, but the other who hath knowledge joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with love, as hee is taught by God, so hee is approved of by God that hee is truly knowing.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 4.</hi> As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto Idols, wee know that an Idol is nothing in the world, and that there is none other God, but one.</q>
               <p>The <hi>second Objection</hi>; wee know that an Idol hath no divinity in it, either externally or internally, which is conceived to bee in him by those that offer things to the Idol, or is feigned to bee represented in him. Wee know also that there is no God but one: Therefore seeing the Creatures of God may not bee polluted by us from the fictions of men, it is not lawful to feed upon things offered to Idols.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 5.</hi> For though there bee that are called Gods, whether in Heaven or in Earth (as there bee gods many, and Lords many:)</p>
                  <p n="6">
                     <hi>6.</hi> But to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and wee in him, and one Lord Iesus Christ, by whom are all things, and wee by him.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Hee answers first by concession and confirmation of the antecedent laid down by the opposers. For although they may bee in the words and opinion of men, and may bee called caelestial and terrestial Gods, and many Lords, yet there is but one <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Lord, viz.</hi> the Father (by which name wee are brought to the other persons, to wit, the Son and the holy Spirit, who are one <hi>God,</hi> the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all Creatures <hi>from whom</hi>; and the end of all <hi>to whom,</hi> chiefly in respect of us, who are beleevers, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to his glory) and one Mediatour Jesus Christ, the same God with the Father, by whom, as by the Word of the Father, all things were created; and wee beleevers redeemed by him, who therefore is said to bee Lord, both in respect of creation and redemption.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 7.</hi> Howbeit, there is not in every man that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: for some with conscience of the Idol unto this hour, eat it as a thing offered to an Idol, and their conscience being weak, is defiled.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Hee answers by way of limitation, denying that this measure of knowledge is in all that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted; because some have not yet manifestly laid down their old opinion concerning Idols, but are touched with a certain reverence of the Idol, whilst they eat things offered to Idols, and so their weak consciences are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed, doubting whether they do well: Therefore it is not simply lawful to feed upon things offered to Idols.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 8.</hi> But meat commendeth us not to God: for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther if wee eat, are wee the better, neither if wee eat not, are wee the worse.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Objection</hi> 3. But the eating of meats is in indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent things placed without Religion, in which, liberty is granted to us: For our eating, and our not eating are both alike pleasing to God, so far as it is for our health, whether wee eat this or that meat: Therefore wee are not here to bee barred of our liberty.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 9.</hi> But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to them that are weak.</q>
               <p>Hee <hi>answers,</hi> that this is true indeed, unless in case of scandal, yet that hee sins, who uses his liberty to the offence of his weak Brother.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 10.</hi> For if any man see thee, which hast know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, sit at meat at the Idols Temple, shall not the conscience of him that is weak, bee emboldened to eat those things which are offered to Idols?</q>
               <p>This hee proves by <hi>four</hi> Reasons. <hi>First,</hi> Because in the praesupposed case, the weak one is encouraged and ill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed by the example of him that eats in the Idols Temple with knowledge, without charity, to the pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of himself by eating things offered to Idols: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not simply lawful to eat things offered to Idols.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 11.</hi> And through thy knowledge shall the weak Brother perish for whom Christ died?</q>
               <p>Because by so doing hee is destroyed, for whom Christ died, <hi>to wit,</hi> as much as can bee by the intention and procurement of the practice of them that eat: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not simply lawful to eat things offered to Idols.</p>
               <q>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:49391:31"/>
                  <hi>Vers. 12.</hi> But when yee sin so against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, yee sin against Christ.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 3. Because in so doing wee sin not only against the Brethren, whose conscience is wounded, but also a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Christ, because it tends to the frustrating of the end of Christ death, <hi>viz.</hi> so far as hee whom Christ hath redeemed, that hee might bee saved, hee that eats with offence, endeavours what in him lies, that he should perish: Therefore, &amp;c.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 13.</hi> Wherefore if meat make my brother to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, I will eat no flesh while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to offend.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 4. Because it is better to bee deprived for ever of our liberty of eating flesh, than to eat with offence, which the Apostle shews in the instance of his own vow: Therefore, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. From the Law of Nations, propounded in a <hi>threefold</hi> example, of <hi>Souldiers,</hi> of <hi>Vine-dressers,</hi> and <hi>Shepherds:</hi> Souldiers, Vine-dressers, and Shepherds, are nourished by the fruit of their labours, every one in his calling: Therefore also wee Ministers ought to bee maintained by the fruit of our labours in the Gospel.</p>

                     <hi>10.</hi> Or saith hee it for our sakes? For our sakes no doubt this is written, That hee that ploweth, should plow in hope: and that hee that thresheth in hope, should bee partaker of his hope.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 3. From the testimony of the Law, of giving food to the Oxe that treads out the corn, which shews that it was spoken for the sake of those that labour for the use of others, especially in the Ministery. The Oxe is fed with the corn which hee did beat out with his feet; therefore all labourers, plowers, threshers, and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence the Labourers in the Gospel ought to bee main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with the fruit of their own labours. For if hee that plows and threshes in the hope of reward, is parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of his hoped-for reward, Why should nor they also that labour in the Gospel bee partakers of the fruit of their own labours?</p>

               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 12.</hi> If others bee partakers of this power over you, are not wee rather? Nevertheless, wee have not used this power: but suffer all things, lest wee should hinder the Gospel of Christ.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 5. From the like example of the Teachers, who preached at <hi>Corinth,</hi> whose example hee alledges in point of lawfulness, but denies that hee would follow them in the doing of any such thing, that hee might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the Gospel. Your Teachers are maintained at your charges: Therefore it is fitting that wee also should bee maintained, although wee are resolved not to use our right.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 13.</hi> Do not you know that they which minister a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout holy things, live of the things of the Temple? and they which wait at the Altar, are partakers of the Altar?</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 6. From the example of the <hi>Levites,</hi> to whom maintenance, and part of the Sacrifices was given for their Ministery: The <hi>Levites</hi> lived of the Altar: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee that are the Ministers of the Gospel ought to live of the Gospel.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 14.</hi> Even so hath the Lord ordained, that they which preach the Gospel should live of the Gospel.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 7. Christ hath given a Command for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the Ministers of the Gospel: Therefore they ought to live of the Gospel.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 15.</hi> But I have used none of these things; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have I written these things, that it should bee so done unto mee: for it were better for mee to die, than that any man should make my glorying void.</q>
               <p>Hitherto hee hath asserted his own right; Now hee shews his moderation in the use of his foresaid liberty; <hi>First,</hi> in the business about maintenance, hee shews his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution for the future to forbear; from which his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution hee will not bee removed with hindrance to the Gospel, chusing rather to die by famine; the reason whereof hee gives, from the <hi>end,</hi> that hee might glory a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst those that spake evil of him, who perhaps might say that the Apostle Preached for hire.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 16.</hi> For though I preach the Gospel, I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon mee, yea, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:49391:32"/>Hee explains himself, that this boasting was not meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Preaching of the Gospel, because hee was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to that by the necessity of his office, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, as also the fear of Gods displeasure.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 17.</hi> For if I do this thing willingly, I have a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: but if against my will, a dispensation of the Gospel is committed unto mee.</q>
               <p>My Preaching (saith hee) if it bee voluntary, it shall have a reward, but if against my will, yet I must discharge it, because of the dispensation committed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mee, by the Command of God, and that would bee without the glory of my voluntary Preaching, If I should unwillingly preach the Gospel, as they do, who exercise their Ministery, not out of any love to God, and desire of converting Souls, but for filthy lucres sake, or out of vain-glory.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 18.</hi> What is my reward then? Verily, that when I preach the Gospel, I may make the Gospel of Christ without charge, that I abuse not my power in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel.</q>
               <p>Now hee saith, that hee hath matter whereof to boast against his Reproachers, as a reward of his not receiving any stipend from them, in as much as hee Preached the Gospel to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> without charge unto them: whereunto hee sub-joyns another reason, That if hee had exacted a maintenance there where his Reproachers endeavoured to bring an evil report upon him, then hee had abused his liberty.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 19.</hi> For though I bee free from all men, yet have I made my self servant unto all, that I might gain the more.</q>
               <p>Hee extends the moderating of his liberty to all sorts of things indifferent, wherein hee served not himself, but others, that hee might gain them.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 20.</hi> And unto the <hi>Jews,</hi> I became a <hi>Jew,</hi> that I might gain the <hi>Jews;</hi> to them that are under the Law, as under the Law, that I might gain them that are under the Law.</q>
               <p>That hee explains particularly in <hi>three</hi> things: <hi>First,</hi> that hee did conform himself to the Jew, bound (as they thought) under the Ceremonial Law, observing the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Ceremonies for time and place, as the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter required, as if hee had been under the yoke of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies; and that hee did by the opinion of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which left to the Jews (born under that yoke) whereof the Apostle was, a free use of Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies for a time, but in no wise to the <hi>Gentiles, Act.</hi> 21. 21, 25.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 21.</hi> To them that are without Law, as without Law, (being not without Law to God, but under the Law to Christ) that I might gain them that are without Law.</q>
               <p>The <hi>second</hi> is, That conforming himself to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles which were without Law, hee laid aside the use of Ceremonies, as one that was without Law; but in the mean time, hee intimates that hee did not understand the Moral, or the law of love, which is the perpetual Law of God and Christ, from which hee could not bee freed; but the Ceremonial Law, from which indeed hee was freed, that hee might freely, for the advantage of the Gospel, use Ceremonies, or might abstain from using them.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 22.</hi> To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some.</q>
               <p>The <hi>third,</hi> That hee conformed himself to those that doubted of their liberty, abstaining from things lawful, as they did; finally, hee accommodates himself in all things indifferent to all men, for <hi>three</hi> causes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That hee might gain as many as possible, or at leastwise some.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 23.</hi> And this I do for the Gospels sake, that I might bee partaker thereof with you.</q>
               <p>The <hi>second</hi> cause, That the Doctrine of the Gospel might bee better esteemed of amongst all, by his mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate carriage.</p>
               <p>The <hi>third</hi> cause, That serving the advantages of the Gospel, hee might bee saved, being made partaker of the Gospel with other Believers.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 24.</hi> Know you not that they which run in a race, run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that you may obtain.</q>
               <p>Hitherto hee hath insisted upon his own example, as the Antecedent of the Argument, the force of this exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple follows, or the hortatory conclusion, <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>Corinthians</hi> would labour after temperance, and not so mind their meat, as to eat with offence that which was offered unto Idols; To this end hee shews them, that they must run in their Christian Race, in which all (not one only, as it was usual in their sports) that run according to the Laws of God, were to bee crowned.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 25.</hi> And every man that striveth for the Maste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, is temperate in all things. Now they do it to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a corruptible Crown, but wee an incorruptible.</q>
               <p>And how that comes to pass hee shews, <hi>viz.</hi> If after the example of those that contended in those Noble Games, (whether running or combating) usually celebrated neer unto <hi>Corinth,</hi> they should not indulge themselves in gluttony and pleasures, but temperate in all things, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all things, whereby the conquering Crown might bee won. In their <hi>Isthmian</hi> or <hi>Corinthian</hi> Games, the Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and Wrestlers inured themselves to a most temperate diet, by way of Preparation for the Race, as now horses are fitted for running: The Conquerours in these Games were crowned with Lawrel, or Ivy, or were honoured with some such like reward: After the same manner, the Apostle would have Christians most moderate in their u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the things of this world, and abstinent from what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever may stop their course, or hinder them in their war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, and that they might obtain an incorruptible, that is, an Eternal Crown, (laid up in heaven for all those who strive lawfully, and finish their course.) Hee adds three Hortatory Arguments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. Because you Christian Wrestlers may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a more noble Crown than that corruptible one, of those that sport in those Gymnastick Games.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 26.</hi> I therefore run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the ayr:</p>
                  <p n="27">
                     <hi>27.</hi> But I keep under my body, and bring it into sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection: lest that by any means, when I have preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to others, I my self should bee a cast-away.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. From his own example running, and acting the part of a Champion, and smiting his adversary cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly and seriously. I earnestly keep down the body of sin, and the old man, and the lusts of the flesh, that they may bee slain; and I compel my body properly so called, (by virtue of Spiritual Discipline) to bee subject to my Spirit: Therefore do you the same thing: For so the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle nurtured his body, that in labours, and watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and fastings, it might hold out in its duty, that it might not wax wanton against the Spirit: and the body of sin (as much as lay in him) bee destroyed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lest by any means] Argum.</hi> 3. From the end of it, I keep under the body of sin, or the old man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> lest if I should live otherwise than I advise others to live, I should bee a cast-away, or as an hypocrite, should bee blotred out of the number of the Saints: Therefore do you the same thing that I do, and to the same end.</p>
               <p>The Apostle here does not oppose Reprobate to one that is <hi>Elect,</hi> but to one that is <hi>Approved</hi>; for as the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture calls <hi>Reprobate silver,</hi> that which is not true and genuine, and that <hi>Approved,</hi> which is <hi>sincere</hi>; so the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle calls him Reprobate, who answers not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and is not sincere, and as hee ought to bee: If wee should imagine that here hee takes <hi>Reprobate</hi> in an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute sense, wee are to take notice of nothing but the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary connection betwixt a prophane life, (if it bee supposed to continue to the end) and Reprobation: For
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:49391:32"/>
whoever dies in his sins, shews himself to bee a reprobate. For it is absurd, and no waies agreeable to the writings of this our Apostle to affirm, that hee made any doubt of his Election, or thought the decree of his Election changeable. For on the other side, Because hee was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded of his Election and Regeneration, the demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration whereof hee gave in the holiness of his life, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king all heed, lest by an evil life, hee should shew forth in himself the signs of Hypocrisie, not in any wise of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation.</p>

                  <p>HItherto hee hath spoken of things offered to <hi>Idols,</hi> by way of Concession, as if they were indifferent. In this <hi>Chapter,</hi> hee sets down a <hi>twofold</hi> use of things of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to <hi>Idols</hi>: The one publick in the Idols Temple, simply unlawful, <hi>to vers. 23.</hi> The other private in their houses, which (without the case of scandal) was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but in case of <hi>scandal</hi> unlawful, from which hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts, <hi>to the end.</hi> That which pertains to the <hi>publick</hi> eating of things offered to Idols in the Idols Temple, hee disswades from, by <hi>five</hi> Arguments.</p>
               </argument>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 1.</hi> Moreover, Brethren, I would not that you should bee ignorant, how that all your Fathers were under the cloud, and all passed thorough the Sea:</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>2.</hi> And were all baptized to <hi>Moses,</hi> in the Cloud, and in the Sea:</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. There is danger, lest you fall into those sins and punishments, into which the Israelites fell, if you proceed to participate of, and bee present at Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Banquets, and covet after things offered in Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to Idols: Therefore you ought not to eat things sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed to Idols, in the Idols Temple.</p>
               <p>That the likeness of the Israelites example may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, hee shews that they had the like priviledges with us (because the Iseaelites were our Fathers) not of the Israelites onely, but also of the Christians amongst the Gentiles, <hi>viz.</hi> in the profession of the true Religion, and propagation of them to us their posterity; for as they are wont to bee called Fathers, who lived in ancient times, with some certain relation of propagating Religion to us; So hee calls the Israelites our Fathers; because they went before us in the partaking of the same Religion, the same Covenant, and like Sacraments: For the walking under the cloud, and the Sea which was over their heads, as if they had with us been bapized into the doctrine and outward profession of <hi>Moses,</hi> of obtaining salvation by the <hi>Messias.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 3.</hi> And did all eat the same spiritual meat:</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <hi>4.</hi> And did all drink the same spiritual drink: (for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them; and that Rock was Christ.)</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <hi>5.</hi> But with many of them God was not well pleased; for they were overthrown in the wilderness.</p>
               </q>
               <p>They did also as it were partake of the same Supper of the Lord with us, eating Manna, and drinking out of the Rock, or waters gushing out of the Rock, which followed the Camp of the Israelites (which are called spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual meat and drink, because they had a spiritual mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, figuring the same Grace of Christ, which the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Lord doth) yet notwithstanding many of those Israelites (because they displeased God) perished in the wilderness.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 6.</hi> Now these things were our examples, to the intent wee should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted.</q>
               <p>Furthermore, hee reckons up the sins for which God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted punishments, and death it self upon them, for an example to posterity; from which sins the Apostle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> lest they also perish; and <hi>first,</hi> hee exhorts them in general, lest they covet evil things as they did, <hi>i. e.</hi> lest they indulge their fleshly lusts, as those ancient Israelites did, who by their lusts were hurried beyond the bounds appointed by God.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 7.</hi> Neither bee you Idolaters, as were some of them, as it is written, The people sate down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.</p>
                  <p n="8">
                     <hi>8.</hi> Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them commited, and fell in one day three and twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand.</p>
                  <p n="9">
                     <hi>9.</hi> Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted, and were destroyed of Serpents.</p>
                  <p n="10">
                     <hi>10.</hi> Neither murmure yee, as some of them also murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and were destroyed of the destroyer.</p>
               </q>
               <p>More especially hee admonishes them, that they bee not Idolaters, or Fornicators, or Tempters of Christ (try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how true and just Christ is, and that by unlawful waies) or murmurers against the providence of God, as the Scripture witnesses of the Israelites. The meaning of this dehortation is this: That you bee not amongst a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Idolatrous Banquets made in the honour of any Idol, lest yee suffer that which the Israelites did, sacrificing to the honour of the Golden Calf, whose indulging their glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony and sport, was in stead of Religion, <hi>vers.</hi> 7. Bee not taken with the desire of pleasing Idolaters, that for their sakes you bee mixed with them in Idolatrous Banquets, lest God also deliver you to your hearts lusts, that toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the pollution of your souls, you defile also your bodies by Fornications, Adulteries, and so perish with those Israelites, <hi>vers.</hi> 8. Tempt not Christ, by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>busing of his knowledge, and pretending Christian liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for your lusts, which is nothing else, than to provoke Christ to anger. As the Israelites in the wilderness pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked the Angel of the Covenant, <hi>or Christ,</hi> who went before them in the wilderness, and perished by Serpents, <hi>vers.</hi> 9. Lastly, Murmure not, because it is not lawful to you by Christian Religion, to bee present at the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous feasts of your friends in the Idols Temple, lest you perish with the murmuring Israelites.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 11.</hi> Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.</p>
                  <p n="12">
                     <hi>12.</hi> Wherefore let him that thinketh hee standeth, take heed lest hee fall.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Further hee shews that the use of these examples be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto all men living, and those that shall live here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after; hee declares the danger of falling into the same sins, and the same punishments, if they shall mix them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with Idolatrous Feasts; rebuking in the mean time their vain confidence, who feared not the danger, but fed securely upon things offered to Idols in the Idols Temple.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 13.</hi> There hath no temptation taken you, but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to bee tempted above that you are able: but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that yee may bee able to bear it.</q>
               <p>Hee prevents an <hi>Objection,</hi> from the fear of evil things, which did hang over them, from the Idolaters, their fellow Citizens, if they should so much abhorre their society, that they would not bee at their publick Religious Feasts. Hee answers, that that temptation was no other than what was ordinary to men, for which they might hope for an end, for the faithfulness of God who will not permit, that they should bee tempted above mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, who indeavour to keep themselves from impurity, chiefly in the case of confessing of him, but lest they should fall with the temptation, hee is wont to discover a way of freedome from danger, or at least from sin; out of these things precedent from the <hi>first verse,</hi> it follows: Therefore wee ought not to feed in the Idols Temple, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on things offered to Idols;</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 14.</hi> Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. Of disswading from things offered to I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols in the Idols Temple. Idolatry is joyned with the publike eating of things offered to Idols, from which Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry yee ought to fly: Therefore wee ought not to eat things offered to Idols in the Idols Temple.</p>
               <q>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:49391:33"/>
                  <hi>Vers. 15.</hi> I speak as to wise men: judge yee what I say.</q>
               <p>Being about to confirm this Argument, hee calls his Hearers or Readers wise, and commands that they weigh both the argument now spoken, and the confirmation of it, which hee sub-joyns, adding <hi>five</hi> reasons, by which hee proves, that this publike eating of things offered to Idols in the Idols Temple, doth render them guilty of Idolatry.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 16.</hi> The Cup of Blessing which wee bless, is it not the Communion of the Blood of Christ? The bread which wee break, is it not the Communion of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Christ?</q>
               <p>The <hi>first reason,</hi> from the like example of Christians, whose fashion is this: The partaking of the Elements in the Supper of the Lord, is the profession of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Christ, and other Christians in the true Religion: Therefore the partaking of things offered to Idols, in the Feast of the Devil together with Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, is the profession of Communion with the Devil and Idolaters, in Idolatry, or their false Religion.</p>
               <p>But hee urges this reason and the rest, by often questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning; <hi>The Cup of Blessing</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hee sayes, Is it not a sign, a powerful token, and real profession of that saving Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion which wee have in the Blood of Christ shed for us? Also that holy bread which wee break in our Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, is not it a sign, and real profession of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, which all of us have in the Body of Christ crucified for us? Therefore it follows from the like, that the partaking of the Sacrifice in an Idolatrous and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villish Feast, is no less a sign and real profession (in it self, and out of the intention of the deed) of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with Idolaters, and the Idol, to whom the Sacrifice was offered.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 17.</hi> For wee being many, are one bread, and one body: for wee are all partakers of that one bread.</q>
               <p>Hee unfolds this reason to this sense. As wee Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, although many, yet by virtue of our Society in the same worship, Sacramentally sealed, grow together, as it were into one bread, <hi>i. e.</hi> into one Mystical Body, in this that wee communicate of one and the same Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Bread: So those that communicate with Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, in the participation of Idolatrous Sacrifices, by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of their society in the same worship, sealed by their Idolatrous feasting in the Idols Temple, grow up into one Mystical body with them, in this, that together with them, they communicate of one and the same Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Sacrifice.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 18.</hi> Behold <hi>Israel</hi> after the flesh: are not they which eat of the Sacrifices, partakers of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar?</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 2. From the like example of the <hi>Israelites,</hi> the <hi>Israelites</hi> eating of the Sacrifices, by thus doing testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied themselves to bee partakers of the Altar and Jewish Religion: Therefore they who eat of the Idol-Sacrifices in the Idolatrous Feast, witness that they communicate with Idolaters in their Idolatry.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 19.</hi> What say I then? That the Idol is any thing? or that which is offered in Sacrifice to Idols is any thing?</p>
                  <p n="20">
                     <hi>20.</hi> But I say, That the things which the <hi>Gentiles</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, they Sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that yee should have fellowship with devils.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 3. Propounded by way of answer to an objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Although an Idol hath nothing of Divinity (as was said before) nor things offered to Idols is any thing of the Worship of God, which possibly the Idolater supposeth and intends; yet in the nature of the work, an Idolatrous Sacrifice is the worshipping of Devils, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 11.15. Therefore partaking of that which is offered unto Idols, is the most gross Idolatry, from which you ought to abstain.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 21.</hi> Yee cannot drink the Cup of the Lord, and the Cup of Devils: yee cannot bee partakers of the Lords Table, and of the Table of Devils.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 3. By way of dehortation from things offered to Idols in the Idol Temple; The partaking of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental Feast of Idols, or Devils, cannot consist with a lawful and saving partaking of the Supper of the Lord; because this was to do homage to two Lords, God and the Devil, and to profess publike service to both: Therefore wee must not eat of things sacrificed to Idols in the Idol Temple.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 22.</hi> Do wee provoke the Lord to jealousie? Are wee stronger than hee?</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 4. By way of dehortation from things offered to Idols: God is provoked to jealousie, if any one profess himself a Christian, and yet publikely partakes of things sacrificed to Devils: Therefore must wee not eat of things sacrificed to Idols.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Stronger] Argum.</hi> 5. Because to persist in this so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest a sin, is to proclaim war with God, and to try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any bee stronger than hee: And therefore unless any be so mad, as to think himself stronger than God, we must abstain from things offered to Idols in the Idol-Temple.</p>

                  <head>THE SECOND PART.</head>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 23.</hi> All things are lawful for mee, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for mee, but all things edifie not.</q>
                  <p>The other part of the <hi>Chapter</hi> follows, wherein hee propounds a general Doctrine, (that hee may come to the private use of things offered unto Idols) which is this. All things (to wit, indifferent) are lawful, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less when it is not expedient to use them, or they edifie not.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 24.</hi> Let no man seek his own, but every man ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wealth.</q>
                  <p>That they are not lawful, when not expedient, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difie not, or are hurtful to edification, hee gives a reason hereof, by way of Precepts, because in the use of our li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty wee must regard rather the Salvation of another, than our own temporal profit.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 25.</hi> Whatsoever is sold in the Shambles, that eat, asking no question for conscience sake.</q>
                  <p>Premising the general Doctrine, hee answers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning things offered unto Idols, when they are out of religious use (as for example, when they are sold in the Shambles) any one may eat them without any scruple of conscience. For it was a custome to set to sale in the Shambles flesh that was sacrificed, the gain whereof was returned to the Priests.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 26.</hi> For the earth is the Lords, and the fulness thereof.</q>
                  <p>The reason is, Because in that common condition they are the creatures of God, sanctified to the use of the faithful, and they were allowed a free use of them, by the Lord of Heaven and Earth, &amp;c.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 27.</hi> If any of them that believe not, bid you to a Feast, and yee bee disposed to go, whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no question for conscience sake.</q>
                  <p>In like manner, if any Believer bee invited to a Feast in the private house of an Unbeliever, hee saith, the Christian may eat without scruple, of any meat that is set before him.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 28.</hi> But if any man say unto you, This is offered in Sacrifice unto Idols, eat not for his sake that shewed it, and for conscience sake. The earth is the Lords, and the fulness thereof.</q>
                  <p>Hee excepts in case of scandal, when either an Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, or a weak Brother, shall intimate that that mea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> was sacrificed to Idols, in which case hee wills them to forbear, and sub-joyns <hi>seven</hi> Reasons.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Lest if thou eat after warning given, thy weak brother who warned thee bee offended, or lest the unbeliever bee hardened in his Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:49391:33"/>
if happily hee gave thee warning.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Is the Lords.] Reason</hi> 2. Other meats besides that, wherein there is danger of offence, God hath sanctified; and because the Lord of the earth hath not granted pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of using his creatures indifferently with the offence of any one: Therefore in this case wee must not eat.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 29.</hi> Conscience, I say, not thine own, but of the others: for why is my liberty judged of another mans conscience?</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 3. If any one eats with offence, Christian Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in eating will bee condemned of another mans conscience, as prophane licentiousness: Therefore in this case wee may not eat.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 30.</hi> For if I by grace bee a partaker, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks?</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 4. Hee should sin against the Grace of God, if hee should abuse the gift of God, (for every kind of meat is the gift of God, as in the giving of Thanks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore or after meat wee acknowledge) so as to give occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of speaking evil of him, as if hee had no regard of another mans Soul: Therefore wee must not eat in this case.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 31.</hi> Whether therefore yee eat, or drink, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever yee do, do all for the glory of God.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 5. Propounded by way of Precept: In all our actions (and therefore in eating and drinking) wee must endeavour that God may bee glorified, which is not done when wee eat with offence: Therefore, &amp;c.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 32.</hi> Give none offence, neither to the <hi>Jews,</hi> nor to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> nor to the Church of God.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 6. Wee must give offence to none, whether they profess the true Religion or not: Therefore in case of scandal wee ought not to eat.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 33.</hi> Even as I please all men in all things; not seeking mine own profit, but the profit of many, that they may bee saved.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 7. All are bound to imitate the Apostles exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in all indifferent things, who served not his own tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral profit, but the Eternal Salvation of others: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as hee, in such a case, would not eat, so are all bound not to eat this or that meat, in case of scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal.</p>

               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 3.</hi> But I would have you know, That the head of every man is Christ: and the head of the woman is the man, and the Head of Christ is God.</q>
               <p>Furthermore hee sub-joyns to the following<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a <hi>maxim</hi> concerning order divinely stablished in the mystical body of the Church, <hi>viz.</hi> that Christ is nearest subordinate to God, as hee is God-man, the Mediator and the Head of the Church, and that the man next succeeds in dignity unto Christ, and the woman to the man, which so far as it appertains to the honour of the sex, shee is made subordinate to the man as Head; whereupon they may understand that order in Church-Assemblies is to bee observed.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 4.</hi> Every man praying, or prophecying, having his head covered, dishonoureth his head.</q>
               <p>It is apparent that the <hi>Corinthians</hi> did not sufficiently observe this order, because their women in the publike Assemblies (after the manner of Heathens) laid aside their veils, and the men covered their heads and faces; (they are said to pray and Prophesie, who met publike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and consented to promote this publike Worship of God.) This uncomeliness hee reproves both in the men and women, by <hi>nine</hi> Arguments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dishonours] Argum.</hi> 1. The covering of the man is not agreeable to the dignity of his sex, and against the honour of Christ, whom hee ought to represent: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is uncomely.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 5.</hi> But every woman that prayeth, or Prophesieth with her head uncovered, dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if shee was shaven.</p>
                  <p n="6">
                     <hi>6.</hi> For if the woman bee not covered, let her also bee shorn: but if it bee a shame for a woman to bee shorn or shaven, let her bee covered.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. It is dishonourable to the Female Sex to lay aside her veil, and against the dignity, as well of her na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural head<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as of her metaphorical head, <hi>to wit,</hi> the man to whom shee ows subjection for the honour of the Mascu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line Sex; the reason whereof hee gives, because it was not less unseemly for the woman to bee without her veil, than to bee shorn: Here therefore the woman is repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for undecency, which shee ought to amend.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 7.</hi> For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as hee is the Image and Glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 3. The man (seeing hee is the Glory of God, and the representation of his glorious Excellency in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the woman over whom hee is appointed head) ought to shew forth the Glory of God in his manly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment: Therefore hee must beware of this unseemli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in the use of a veil.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The woman.] Argum.</hi> 4. The woman is the glory of the man; or the image of his dignity, in whom (as in a Glass) the excellency of the man (for whose sake shee was created) is seen, to whom shee ought to profess sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection by the covering of herself: Therefore seeing the woman behaves herself otherwise amongst you, shee is blamed for uncomeliness. This does not any whit hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der but the woman is created, in respect of her Soul and spiritual state, to the glory and Image of God, as well as the man.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 8.</hi> For the man is not of the woman, but the woman of the man.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 5. The man is the material principle of the woman, because shee was made out of the ribs of man: Therefore it becomes the man and the woman to testifie the priviledge of their original, in the observation of the aforesaid decency: Therefore you are guilty of undecen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy which do otherwise.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 9.</hi> Neither was the man created for the woman, but the woman for the man.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 6. Seeing the man hath the respect of the end, and the woman is destined for the end; it is fitting that this difference of their excellency should bee expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the observance of decency: Therefore when it is not observed, you are deservedly to bee reproved.</p>

                  <p>Hee gives a Reason, why hee beleeved Schisms to bee amongst them, <hi>viz.</hi> Because by the malice of the Devil and men, out of the just judgement of God, not onely Schisms in their affections arose, but also Heresies or Sects, which must bee, and to that end are they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted of God, that approved and sincere Christians, (maintaining that which is right in the contending for parties) may bee manifestly known; and to the greater glory of God, and the conservation of true Religion, in purity, they might appear sincere to the whole world.</p>

                  <p>This hee demonstrates in <hi>four</hi> notable faults amongst them, in the celebration of the Lords Supper; The <hi>first</hi> is, That every one of them with his faction (excluding the other members of the Church) did take the holy Supper Schismatically. <hi>Secondly,</hi> They mixed with the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Lords Supper, their own Supper, or their common Feasts, which were called <hi>Love-Feasts.

                     <hi>Vers. 28.</hi> But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that Bread, and drink of that Cup.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Shewing the easiness of preparation, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one may worthily receive this Sacrament; Onely (saith hee) set every man examine himself, that being sensible of the greatness of his sin and misery, hee may see how much need hee hath of a remedy by Christ, and let him consider with what Faith and purposes of holiness hee is bound to approach communion with Christ, who is a thousand times lost without him; and when hee hath examined himself, so let him eat and drink in that holy Banquet, <hi>i. e.</hi> so let him apply the thing signified, with his participation of the sign, that hee consider what need hee hath of it.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 29.</hi> For hee that eateth and drinketh unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lords body.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Having shewed the punishment of eating un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily: That hee brings judgement, or temporal and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal punishment, unless hee repent, upon himself by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy eating and drinking, who participates of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Sacrament without examination of himself, because hee <hi>discerns</hi> not this Feast, or the thing signified, from his own common Supper, but comes to the Lords Table no otherwise than to some common one.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 30.</hi> For this cause many are weak and sickly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, and many sleep.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Shewing before their eyes the examples of Gods temporal anger, in diseases and death it self inflicted already upon many of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> for their propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Sacrament.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 31.</hi> For if wee would judge our selves, wee should not bee judged.</q>
                  <p>Hee clears from severity this infliction of temporal judgement. <hi>First,</hi> From the equity of it, That God justly punishes those that judge not themselves, or repent not, but lye securely in their sin, which hee would not do if they repenting would judge themselves.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 32.</hi> For when wee are judged, wee are chasten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Lord, that wee should not bee condemned with the world.</q>
                  <p>Further, That the inflicting of these punishments, is a fatherly chastisement, whereby the faithful may bee brought to repentance, and not perish with the world.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 33.</hi> Wherefore, my Brethren, when yee come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to eat, tarry one for another.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The Apostle directs the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to a right use of the Supper, giving a Precept to avoid Schism, that they would tarry one for another, and would partake of the holy Supper together; and every man take not his supper asunder, because the Supper of the Lord is a common action of the Church, in the publick Assembly, to bee celebrated after the manner of a Feast.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 34.</hi> And if any man hunger, let him eat at home, that yee come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixthly,</hi> By forbidding their manner of feasting in publick, by their feasts of charity before the holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and commanding, that if need were, they would eat at home to satisfie their hunger, repeating the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of prophaning the Supper, and of the following judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. At last, because it was impossible, that all things which appertain to a particular Church, should bee or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, unless hee was present; Hee promises to take care of the rest, touching the observing of order, especially in that Church, when hee should come himself.</p>

               <head>THE EIGHTH ARTICLE CONCERNING THE USE OF SPIRITUAL GIFTS.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>THe <hi>eighth</hi> Article of the <hi>Epistle</hi> concerning spiritual <hi>Gifts,</hi> and the right use of them, in the <hi>three</hi> next following <hi>Chapters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some were proud of spiritual <hi>Gifts,</hi> and despised others in comparison with themselves; Some envyed others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they had a larger measure of spiritual <hi>Gifts,</hi> most abused their gifts to discord, not to spiritual <hi>Edification</hi>: The <hi>scope</hi> of the <hi>Apostle,</hi> is, to correct these abuses, and to dehort them from them, and to set before them the right use, and that with <hi>sixteen</hi> Arguments: whereof some of them conclude one, others of them another part of their end, but all urge a prudent use of gifts.</p>
               </argument>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 1.</hi> Now concerning spiritual Gifts, Brethren, I would not have you ignorant.</q>
               <p>The Apostle comprehends all abuse, onely under igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or imprudence, and the right use of spiritual Gifts, under prudence: The Position which the Apostle pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds to bee proved, is this: yee ought not to behave your self ignorantly, or imprudently in the business of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Gifts, but prudently.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 2.</hi> Yee know that yee were Gentiles, carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way unto these dumb Idols, even as yee were led.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. From the comparison of their former and present state, to this sense: Not long since yee being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute of all the Gifts of the Holy Ghost, yee were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried about after the pleasure of the Devil, that impure spirit, even as other Gentiles, into the grossest worship of dumb Idols, or into Idolatry: Therefore now being converted, and adorned with spiritual Gifts, you ought to behave your selves prudently, taking heed, that you bee not hurried about by that evil spirit, to no less hurtful enormities, in the abuse of spiritual Gifts.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 3.</hi> Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God, calleth Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus accursed: and that no man can say, that
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:49391:35"/>
Iesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. Those that blaspheme Christ, as they are certainly destitute of his Spirit, so certainly are all you, (who with a sincere Faith profess Jesus Christ your Lord) indued with his Spirit, or with the saving and special gift of the Holy Spirit, without which you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not profess him with a sincere Faith: Therefore concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing other spiritual gifts, which do not necessarily accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany Salvation, yee ought not to envy each other.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 4.</hi> Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit;</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 3. Although there are diversities of gifts, yet all flow from the same Fountain, and one Holy Spirit: Therefore in the use of these gifts you ought to carry your selves prudently, and friendly to agree toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 5.</hi> And th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>re are differences of Administrations, but the same Lord.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 4 Administrations and Ecclesiastical offices are many, but the same Lord, whom you all ought to serve: Therefore ought you to demean your selves pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, and promote the work of God only.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 6.</hi> And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God that worketh all in all.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 5. There are divers operations, various works produced by divers men as instruments, but the same God is hee that works those works in those divers instruments: Therefore there ought to bee no debate concerning these. Hee ascribes gifts to the Holy Spirit, who distributes gifts both ordinary and extraordinary, according to the necessity of the Church, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. Hee ascribes Functions and Offices to Christ, who being Lord in his house, appoints what services hee pleases, hee calls to offices whom hee will, and makes use of those that are called, in their functions, as hee will, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. But operations, or the exercises of gifts of what kind soever, hee ascribes in this <hi>verse</hi> to God the Father, who as hee is the first begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of all, so hee works very effectuously in all; nor therefore doth the Apostle distinguish these, as if gifts, offices, and operations, may bee so of one person, as not of all the persons, but that wee may have need, that by this distinction of gifts, offices, and operations, (which concur to the producing of the same work) wee might more easily bee led by the hand, to apprehend the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction of persons, and unity of essence; and that wee might observe the equality of the persons of the Holy Trinity, and their unity in gifts, offices, and exercises of gifts, and observing, might all of us unanimously endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour for the good of the Church, and the glory of God.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 7.</hi> But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit with all.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 6. Spiritual gifts, or manifestations of the Spirit, <hi>to wit,</hi> in which the Spirit is manifested, are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for one end, <hi>viz.</hi> for the good and edification of the whole Church: Therefore there ought not to bee diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence concerning these.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 8.</hi> For to one is given by the Spirit the word of Wisdome, to another the word of Knowledge, by the same Spirit.</q>
               <p>This hee shews by reckoning up the <hi>nine</hi> kinds of gifts, which all tend to the good of the Church. The <hi>first gift, To one is given the Word of Wisdome,</hi> whereby hee can seasonably apply sound doctrine to his Hearers, which is the gift of a <hi>Pastor.</hi> The <hi>second; To another the word of Knowledge,</hi> which is the gift of a <hi>Teacher,</hi> whereby hee can give the general doctrine and sense of the Scripture, although hee hath not the gift fitly to apply it.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 9.</hi> To another Faith by the same Spirit; to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the gifts of healing by the same Spirit.</p>
                  <p n="10">
                     <hi>10.</hi> To another the working of Miracles, to another Prophecie, to another discerning of Spirits, to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther divers kinds of Tongues, to another the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of Tongues.</p>
               </q>
               <p>The <hi>third gift,</hi> is <hi>Faith,</hi> which is called the Faith of many and famous miracles, and in the following <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> it is called <hi>all Faith.</hi> 4: Is the gift of <hi>healing</hi> Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases, which was one kind of miracles, as the rest fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. 5. <hi>The gift of working miracles,</hi> and powerfully casting out devils, and the enemies of the Church, of which wee have an example, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.11. 6. The gift <hi>of fore-telling things to come,</hi> and <hi>revealing secrets.</hi> 7. The <hi>gift of discerning impostures</hi> from the gifts of the Spirit. 8. The gift <hi>of speaking with divers kinds of Tongues.</hi> 9. The gift of <hi>Interpretation of Tongues,</hi> without the gift of speaking with those Tongues; for it will appear that some spoke with Tongues who could not interpret, and contrarily; for so it seemed good to God to distribute his gifts.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 11.</hi> But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally, as hee will.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 7. To the wise using of gifts. This diversity of gifts, and distribution of them, is according to the good will of God: Therefore wee must rest in his will, and use them without discord.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 12.</hi> For as the body is one, and hath many mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 8. Christ Mystical, or Christ is one Body with the Church, consisting of many members, and they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed with variety of gifts: Therefore as in the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, so in the Mystical Body there ought to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord in the use of gifts.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 13.</hi> For by one Spirit are wee all baptized into one body, whether wee bee <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wee bee bond or free: and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 9. All the faithful are joyned together in the Sacrament of Baptism, and the Lords Supper, or the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of all the Faithful into one Church, and partaking of one life, in one body, and one Spirit, is signified in the Sacraments: Therefore you ought not to disagree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst your selves about the diversity of gifts.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 14.</hi> For the body is not one member, but many.</p>
                  <p n="15">
                     <hi>15.</hi> If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; Is it therefore not of the body?</p>
                  <p n="16">
                     <hi>16.</hi> And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; Is it therefore not of the body?</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 10. Seeing the condition of the body requires necessarily plurality of members, and by consequence di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity, it will follow, that the meanest offices in the least gifts, are as well of the body, as the most excellent offices and gifts. And if they should exclude themselves, they would not do less foolishly, than if the foot should deny that it was the hand, or the ear deny that it was the eye; and for this cause should conclude that it is not of the body: Therefore there ought to bee no dissention a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst you, because of the diversity of gifts.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 17.</hi> If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?</p>
                  <p n="18">
                     <hi>18.</hi> But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him.</p>
                  <p n="19">
                     <hi>19.</hi> And if they were all one member, where were the body?</p>
                  <p n="20">
                     <hi>20.</hi> But now are they many members, yet but one body.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 11. Even as if the body was one member, <hi>three</hi> inconveniences would follow. (1.) The rest of the members should bee excluded, and the more noble sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, <hi>ver.</hi> 17. (2.) The change should bee made contrary to the wise dispensation of God, who hath otherwise ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed diversity of members, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. (3.) The change should bee contrary to the nature of an organical body; for the very organical body should bee destroyed, <hi>ver.</hi> 19. Because God hath made one organical body of many members, <hi>ver.</hi> 20. So in Ecclesiastical Functions, if there was but one Function, <hi>three</hi> inconveniences would ensue. 1. The other offices would bee extinct. 2. The
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:49391:35"/>
dispensation of God would bee destroyed. 3. The Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganical Church it self would bee overthrown, which now consists of many offices, united together into one body: Therefore concord and agreement is to bee regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 21.</hi> And the eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again, the head to the feet, I have no need of you.</p>
                  <p n="22">
                     <hi>22.</hi> Nay, much more, those members of the body, which seem to bee more feeble, are necessary.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 12. As in a natural body, the superiour and more excellent members cannot bee without the inferiour, which are most necessary; therefore they are friendly each to other; so it is in Ecclesiastical functions: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought they to bee assisting one to another.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 23.</hi> And those members of the body, which wee think to bee less honourable, upon those wee bestow more abundant honour, and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness.</p>
                  <p n="24">
                     <hi>24.</hi> For our comly parts have no need; but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 13. As in the body natural, that there may bee an agreement, those members which are more infirm are most honoured, and necessary, by the appointment of God: so ought it to bee in Ecclesiastical functions: Therefore in the chusing of Deacons rather than Pastors, care must bee had, that other things being alike, men of the fairest fortunes, may bee elected for the adorning of this inferiour office.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 25.</hi> That there should bee no Schism in the body, but that the members should have the same care one of another.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 14. As the Natural body would come to ruine by Schism, if the members should strive among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and should not regard each other: So in Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical functions: Therefore concord is to bee highly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 26.</hi> And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member bee honoured, all the members rejoyce with it.</p>
                  <p n="27">
                     <hi>27.</hi> Now yee are the body of Christ, and members in particular.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 15. As amongst the superiour and inferiour members of the body, there is a sympathy in joy and grief, so it ought to bee amongst the Governours and Ministers of the Church: Therefore the greatest ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord: Hee gives the <hi>Reason</hi> of it, Because yee (saith hee) are the body of Christ, and members in particular, <hi>i. e.</hi> such as ought as members to agree with the whole body, the Church, and amongst your selves: And here is the common <hi>Apodosis</hi> of the whole similitude, taken from the body, from <hi>vers.</hi> 12. to this 27. <hi>verse.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 28.</hi> And God hath set some in the Church, first Apostles, secondarily Prophets, thirdly Teachers, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, diversities of tongues.</q>
               <p>Now in order hee reckons up the Ministers of the Church, as much as might bee sufficient to restrain the ambition and envy that was among the <hi>Corinthians</hi>; The Authority of <hi>Paul</hi> by name, and of the other Apostles was prejudiced, by the subtil and Eloquent Doctors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the <hi>Corinthians</hi> (as is manifest in the <hi>second E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle.</hi>) Therefore hee asserts the dignity of the Apostles in the first place, as those that were appointed of God to lay the foundation of all the Churches. Concerning the Evangelists and Prophets extraordinary, either there was no question amongst them, or the dignity of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of the Gospel extraordinary, being asserted in the vindication of the Apostolical office, concerning the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and dignity of the Evangelists and Prophets ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary (whose Ministery was common to all the Churches, and subservient to the Apostles) it was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest and apparent enough.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Hee determines concerning Prophets (by which name (as shall appear, <hi>chap.</hi> 14.) hee understands Pastors) who applied in their Sermons the doctrine to usefulness, whose gift was the word of wisdome, as <hi>verse</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>third</hi> place hee names Teachers, who although they were not eloquent and prudent for the application of the doctrine to all the uses of the Church, yet they had a word of knowledge, that they were able to apply the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Doctrine to the capacity of the Church: These are the functions which were imployed in the Word and Doctrine, and therefore the more eminent.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>fourth</hi> place, hee sets down those, who in the Primitive Church, for the confirmation of the faithful, were indued with a power of working miracles, signs and wonders of all kinds, in great measure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Hee sets down those who had power miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously to heal diseases, in whom the gift was more straightned and restrained to this one kind.</p>
               <p>After this <hi>sixthly,</hi> hee names ordinary offices and gifts, <hi>viz. helps,</hi> or the office of Deacons, whose work it was to see to the maintenance of Ministers, and the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities of the Saints, and the dispensation of the publick revenues of the Church: which office, though it may seem the meanest, it appears to bee in no small account, and imposed not upon men of inferiour ranck, but upon those that were of tryed fidelity, and the more able, or men of fairest estate, as <hi>vers.</hi> 22, 23, 24. And that for the necessary use of it; for without the help of this office, the work of the Ministery would bee much hindered, for had there not been helps or Deacons, who undertook the care of collecting the stipends, that the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters might more freely attend the work of the Lord: It is necessary that the Ministers with the Levites, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 13. to whom a designed portion was not given, should betake themselves to their fields, and their work, or secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar businesses, and also to Law-sutes, being debarred of their due allowance, they might lose their zeal of labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in the Lords Vineyard, or the fruit of their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</p>
               <p>After these (unless perhaps there was no difference touching these inferiour offices) the Apostle is not solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous any further about the order; Hee names Governours, or Ruling Presbyters, who take notice of the peoples manners, and as presidents with the Pastors and Teachers, with the Ecclesiastical Assembly attend to the removing of scandals.</p>
               <p>In the last place hee sets down the gift of tongues, to wit, solitary, with which any one either spake that which hee could not interpret, in a language known to the people, or could interpret it, but could not speak in an unknown tongue; which gift, because above others it caused admiration, it seemed to bee affected among the other <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and to bee matter of boasting to the rest.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 29.</hi> Are all Apostles? are all Prophets? are all Teachers? are all workers of miracles?</p>

                     <hi>30.</hi> Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?</p>
               </q>
               <p>By all which fore-cited, hee sharply corrects and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves the ambition and envy of inferiours, as if they would all have the most eminent gifts, and the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent functions, which was most unreasonable, as the interrogations repeated to the peircing of their consciences shew.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 31.</hi> But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 16. Of Exhortation, that there bee no e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil emulation about their gifts, their ambition might bee better laid out, by coveting the most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent gifts, to wit, saving, or such as accompany sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, which kind of gifts first of all is Christian Charity, by which saving Faith is effectual (whereof hee promises to speak:) Therefore evil emulation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning

gifts and Ecclesiastical or Spiritual Offices, is to bee taken heed of.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>HEE shews that, that more excellent way of which hee spake in the <hi>last vers.</hi> of the <hi>Chapter</hi> going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, was the way of <hi>Charity,</hi> and proves by <hi>four</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, that the gift of <hi>Charity</hi> is the most worthy gift, which they should affect above all.</p>
               </argument>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 1.</hi> Though I speak with the tongues of Men and of Angels, and have not Charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling symbal.</q>
               <p>The <hi>first Argument,</hi> the gifts which you desire are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without Charity, and hee reckons up <hi>five</hi> sorts of gifts, before which hee prefers Charity. The <hi>gift of Tongues</hi> in the highest degree (which is, if any one could speak with all Tongues, or like unto Angels) would do nothing more to salvation without Charity, than an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable sound.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 2.</hi> And though I have the gift of Prophesie, and understand all mysteries, and all Knowledge; and though I have all Faith, so that I could remove Mountains, and have no Charity, it profiteth mee nothing.</q>
               <p>The <hi>second gift,</hi> is the gift of <hi>Prophesie</hi> in the highest degree (being joyned with knowledge and wisdome) which will not at all conduce to the salvation of the Prophet without <hi>Charity.</hi> The <hi>third gift</hi> is of a <hi>Faith</hi> miraculous in the highest degree (to the doing of those things which are most impossible) which if it should bee given, yet it would bee nothing without <hi>Charity.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 3.</hi> And though I bestow all my goods to feed the Poor, and though I give my body to bee burned, and have not Charity, it profiteth mee nothing.</q>
               <p>The <hi>fourth gift</hi> is the greatest <hi>liberality</hi> towards the poor, that can bee imagined. The <hi>fift gift</hi> is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test <hi>courage</hi> of <hi>Martyrdome,</hi> as any one can imagine, all which without <hi>Charity,</hi> will not at all profit to salvation: Therefore <hi>Charity</hi> is the most worthy gift which you can desire.</p>

               <p>The <hi>second Argument,</hi> from the famous properties or effects of <hi>Charity,</hi> which hee reckons to be <hi>fifteen.</hi> 1. <hi>Charity suffereth long.</hi> 2. And is <hi>kind.</hi> 3. <hi>Envyeth not.</hi> 4. Charity <hi>vaunteth</hi> not it self. 5. Is not <hi>puffed up.</hi>

               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 8.</hi> Charity never faileth, but whether there bee Prophecies, they shall fail; whether there bee tongues, they shall cease; whether there shall bee knowledge, it shall vanish away.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 3. <hi>Charity never faileth</hi>; therefore the most excellent and worthy to bee desired. This propriety hee illustrates, by comparing it with other gifts. <hi>First,</hi> With Prophecie and Tongues, which because wee shall not have use of them in the life to come, as means, they shall cease, being no further necessary. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares <hi>Charity</hi> with knowledge it self, and prefers it before knowledge, because knowledge shall vanish away, <hi>viz.</hi> that mediate knowledge, or manner of knowing, which is now obtained by books, by hearing and meditation, &amp;c. Therefore <hi>Charity</hi> is the most excellent gift which you can desire.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 9.</hi> For wee know in part, and wee prophesie in part.</q>
               <p>Which hee proves, because knowledge is now in part, and imperfect, not onely in respect of the measure, for so also is <hi>Charity</hi> imperfect, but chiefly in respect of the manner of knowing, <hi>viz.</hi> by means, which kind of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, because it is mediate, it is imperfect.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 10.</hi> But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall bee done away.</q>
               <p>This manner of knowing, <hi>viz.</hi> mediately, shall bee quite abolished when the perfect way of knowledge shall come, <hi>viz.</hi> the immediate. But <hi>Charity,</hi> although it bee imperfect, as to the measure, yet as to the manner of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, it is perfect; for it is immediately carried to God; and therefore this manner of loving shall never bee abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, but rather encreased.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 11.</hi> When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things:</q>
               <p>Hee shews that the present way of kno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ing is to bee abolished, by the similitude of the abolishing of childish sports, when any comes to bee a man.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 12.</hi> For now wee see thorough a glass darkly, but then face to face: now I know in part, but then shall I know, even as also I am known.</q>
               <p>Hee shews the same by another similitude, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>paring the present manner of knowing, to knowledge by a glass darkly, which kind of knowledge is mediate, but the knowledge to come is immediate, whereby any one kno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <hi>Vers. 13.</hi> And now abideth Faith, Hope, Charity, these three, but the greatest of these is Charity.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 4. <hi>Charity</hi> is more excellent than Faith or Hope (which are saving Graces, and gifts not to bee repented of.) Therefore the most worthy. Because <hi>Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> shall never fail, but shall also continue in the life to come, when Faith and Hope shall cease. In the mean time, let us remember that Faith in some respects is more excellent than <hi>Charity,</hi> because Faith is the cause of Love, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6. Wee are justified by Faith, and have peace with God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. And Christ dwells in our hearts by Faith, which works <hi>Charity</hi> in us, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3.17. But the Apostle regarding the concord and edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church, by right extolls Charity, as much as belongs to his purpose; hee knew also that no man could endeavour after the increase of Christian <hi>Charity,</hi> but hee must also labour after the increase of Faith, which is the cause of Love.</p>

                  <p>THere are <hi>two</hi> parts of the <hi>Chapter.</hi> In the <hi>first</hi> hee prefers the gift of <hi>Prophesie</hi> before the gift of <hi>Tongues, to vers. 26.</hi> In the <hi>other</hi> hee gives commands concerning that order that was to bee observed in their <hi>Assemblies,</hi> to the <hi>end.</hi>

               <p>Hee proved in the fore-going <hi>Chapter,</hi> that Charity
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:49391:36"/>
was the most excellent gift: In the beginning of this Chapter hee infers an Exhortation by way of conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that they would affect it, and have all both gifts and spiritual offices in honour; but because some were proud of the gift of tongues, and most despised Pastoral gifts in comparison of this gift, and too much admired the gift of tongues: Therefore hee compares these gifts together, and proves that the gift of Prophecie or Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is more excellent than the gift of tongues, separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the gift of interpretation. Hee gives <hi>thirteen</hi> Reasons.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 2.</hi> For hee that speaketh in an unknown tongue, speaketh not unto men, but unto God, for no man understandeth him: Howbeit in the Spirit he speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth mysteries.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <hi>3.</hi> But hee that prophesieth, speaketh unto men, to edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and exhortation, and comfort.</p>
               </q>
               <p>The <hi>first Reason</hi>; Hee that speaks in an unknown tongue, although by the gift of the Spirit, hee speaks the Mysteries of God, yet hee speaks without profit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause hee is understood by God alone, and not by men: But a Prophet or Pastor speaking in a known tongue, teaches, exhorts, comforts his hearers, and so speaks pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably: Therefore Prophecie is more excellent than the gift of tongues.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 4.</hi> Hee that speaketh in an unknown tongue, edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth himself: but hee that prophesieth, edifieth the Church.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 2. Hee that speaks in an unknown tongue, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difies none <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> himself; but a Prophet, the whole Church or Assembly: Therefore Prophecie is more excellent.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 5.</hi> I would that yee all spake with tongues, but rather that yee prophesied: for greater is bee that prophesieth, than hee that speaketh with tongues, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept hee interpret, that the Church may receive edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying.</q>
               <p>That hee might rightly bee understood, hee shews that hee doth not abolish tongues, though hee prefers a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet before him that speaks in an unknown tongue.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 6.</hi> Now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, except I shall speak to you, either by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophecying, or by doctrine?</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 3. From his own example; his Apostolical Ministery would not bee profitable to them, unless hee should speak to them in a known tongue by extraordinary Prophecie, by Revelation, or ordinary knowledge; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Prophecying, or exhorting, as a Pastor, or instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as a Teacher: Therefore the gift of tongues is infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to the gift of Prophecie.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 7.</hi> And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe, or harp, except they give a distinction in their sounds, how shall it bee known what is piped or harped?</p>
                  <p n="8">
                     <hi>8.</hi> For if the Trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself unto the battel?</p>
                  <p n="9">
                     <hi>9.</hi> So likewise you, except yee utter by the tongue words easie to bee understood, how shall it bee known what is spoken? for yee shall speak into the ayr.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 4. As a Trumpet, or any other instrument touched or blown, sounding confusedly, utters an unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable and an ungrateful sound, so also a tongue, not understood, gives no other than an uncertain and useless sound: But the Prophets in their Prophecying speak in a known tongue: Therefore the gift of tongues is inferiour to the gift of Prophecie.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 10.</hi> There are, it may bee, so many kinds of voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the world, and none of them are without sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 5. The voices of Brutes are many; whereof none is so inarticulate, but represents a certain species of the living creature to those that hear: It is therefore an unworthy thing, so to debase the gift of the Spirit, that it should profit no more, but should bee less valued than the blearing of a brute beast: In Prophecie it is not so: Therefore the gift of Tongues is inferiour to that of Prophecie.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 11.</hi> Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall bee unto him that speaketh a Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, and hee that speaketh shall bee a Barbarian un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mee.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 6. Because to speak things not understood, makes the Teachers and the Hearers Barbarians each to other: Therefore, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 12.</hi> Even so yee, for as much as yee are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek that yee may excell to the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of the church.</p>
                  <p n="13">
                     <hi>13.</hi> Wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue, pray that hee may interpret.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Hee infers an exhortation to what was fore-spoken, that they might bee zealous of the gift of Prophecie, for the good of the Church, and to that end, that hee which hath the gift of an unknown tongue might pray, that hee might have also the gift of interpreting that tongue.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 14.</hi> For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 7. If any one speak unto God, praying pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely in an unknown tongue, hee doth ill, because though hee that prayes understands, yet the understanding of him that prays shall bee unfruitful to those that hear and do not understand, and hee doth ill much more who speaks publikely to men in a tongue not understood: Therefore the gift of Tongues is inferiour to that of Prophecie.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 15.</hi> What is it then? I will pray with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and will pray with understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing also.</q>
               <p>Hence hee draws forth his exhortation, because a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst those who had the gift of strange tongues, some had the faculty miraculously to reason in divine mysteries, some had the faculty of praying, others did sing in those strange tongues, and others gave thanks; these gifts were divers, and for divers uses; hee commands them so to use them all, that they may bee understood by the hearers; for if any one pray by the Spirit, or from the gift of the Spirit, what profit shall it bee to the Church, unless hee pray also with understanding, <hi>i. e.</hi> so that the hearers may understand him?</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 16.</hi> Else, when thou shalt bless with the Spirit, how shall hee that occupieth the room of the unlearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, say Amen, at thy giving of thanks, seeing hee understandeth not what thou sayest?</q>
               <p>This hee confirms and adds the <hi>eighth Reason,</hi> from the unprofitableness of it, because when any one shall bless by the gift of the Spirit, those that occupy the room of private men in the Church, <hi>i. e.</hi> the rest of the hearers in the Assembly, cannot joyn their prayers with him, or say <hi>Amen,</hi> unless hee speaks in a known tongue. The matter is otherwise in Prophecying, where all things are uttered in a known tongue: Therefore, &amp;c.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 17.</hi> For thou verily givest thanks well; but the other is not edified.</q>
               <p>Hee gives a <hi>reason,</hi> because the hearers in the Church neither understand, nor are edified, although that which is spoken is most excellent.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 18.</hi> I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than you all;</p>
                  <p n="19">
                     <hi>19.</hi> Yet in the Church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that by my voice I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known tongue.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 9. From his own example, who was most ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in the gift of Tongues, and yet hee had rather speak a few words which might bee understood by the hearers, than many in a tongue unknown to the people: Therefore the gift of Prophecie excels that of Tongues.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 20.</hi> Brethren, bee not children in understanding;

howbeit, in malice bee yee children, but in under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing bee men.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 10. Backed with a Precept, because this abuse of the gift of strange Tongues, being no way profitable to the hearers, is a childish and foolish ostentation; whereas it became them to bee children indeed in respect to innocency, but not in respect to knowledge.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 21.</hi> In the Law it is written, With men of other Tongues, and other Lips, will I speak unto this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and yet for all that will they not hear mee, saith the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="22">
                     <hi>22.</hi> Wherefore Tongues are for a sign, not to them that beleeve, but to them that beleeve not; but prophesy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing serveth not for them that beleeve not, but for them which beleeve.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 11. Out of <hi>Isa.</hi> 28.11. and <hi>Ier.</hi> 5.15. because to speak with Tongues not understood in the Church, is set down of God as a threatning for a punishment of unbelief; But Prophecie serves for the edification of Beleevers: Therefore let unknown Tongues bee rejected out of the Church, and let Prophecie bee preferred.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 23.</hi> If therefore the whole Church bee come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into one place, and all speak with Tongues, and there come in those that are unlearned, or unbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, will they not say that yee are mad?</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 12. Taken from the avoiding of Scandal: Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleevers, or Professors of a private condition, will bee estranged from the Faith, and they will say that both the Preacher and the People are mad, if the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for publick worship bee spent in the hearing of an unknown Tongue: Therefore the gift of Tongues is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to the gift of Prophesying.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 24.</hi> But if all prophesie, and there come in one that beleeveth not, or one unlearned; hee is convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of all, hee is judged of all.</p>
                  <p n="25">
                     <hi>25.</hi> And thus are the secrets of his heart made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, and so falling down on his face, hee will wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship God, and report that God is in you of a truth.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 13. From the special fruit which would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue, If laying aside the use of strange Tongues, all the Prophets (for hee denies that all the faithful in the Church were Prophets, <hi>Chap.</hi> 12.29.) should prophesie, <hi>i. e.</hi> should propose the Oracles of the Prophets, and their Doctrine, to the edification of the Church: For in this case, if any unbeleever should come in, or a private Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian one of their hearers, should hear them prophesying, hee is convinced of sin, and condemned according to the sentence of the Law, by all that prophesie, and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret sins of his heart are manifest unto him, which when the hearer sees, and observes the Grace of God laid open by the Prophets in the Gospel, hee falls upon his face, adores God, and seriously gives testimony of Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence with the Prophets in the Church: Therefore Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie is more excellent than the gift of Tongues.</p>

                  <q>

                  <p>The other <hi>part</hi> of the <hi>Chapter,</hi> in which hee gives <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> Precepts concerning good order.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>first</hi> is, that if the Spirit shall suggest to any one of the Prophets any godly Psalm to the praise of God, or any Doctrine, or expression of a strange Tongue for the use of the Church, or revelation of a thing to come, or of a mystery not observed before, or the interpretation of a strange Tongue, or of the Scripture; Hee commands that the exercise of all these bee fitted to the edification of the Church, that all may go out of the Assembly better than they came.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Vers. 27.</hi> If any man speak in an unknown Tongue, let it bee by two, or at the most by three, and that by course, and let one interpret.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vers. 28.</hi> But if there bee no Interpreter, let him keep silence in the Church, and let him speak to himself, and to God.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>The <hi>second Precept.</hi> That of those who were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled with the gift of Tongues, should not speak in one Assembly more than two or three, and that in order, one after another, and unless there were some Interpreter pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, who could expound their sayings, otherwise they were to bee silent in the Church.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 29.</hi> Let the Prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge.</q>
                  <p>The <hi>third Precept.</hi> That the ordinary Prophets, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Pastors should speak in one Assembly, two or three, of whose doctrine the other Prophets should Judge, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining it by the rule of the Word.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 30.</hi> If any thing bee revealed to another that sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth by, let the first hold his peace.</q>
                  <p>The <hi>fourth Precept.</hi> If (as in those times it might u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually come to pass) any other Prophet being inspired by the Spirit, desired to bee heard out of order, hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands that hee bee silent, that time bee granted to the other to speak.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 31.</hi> For yee may all prophesie one by one, that all may learn, and all may bee comforted.</q>
                  <p>Hee subjoyns <hi>five</hi> Reasons of the Precept. 1. Because in such a case many, yea all the Prophets may bee heard (hee doth not here understand beleevers promiscuously, but the Prophets, and those that were truly extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily inspired by the Spirit) in which case all are to bee heard, but order is to bee observed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That all</hi>] The <hi>second Reason.</hi> Because so the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and consolation of the Church, and also of their Prophets might bee promoted, if many by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 3. Because the Spirits of the Prophets are to bee examined and judged of by the other Prophets, who might afterwards give their opinions concerning those things which were heard, whether any one hath seasonably interrupted another, and whether it were agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Word of God, which was delivered by him; and therefore there was no danger, if hee that spoke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, should give place to him that modestly interrupted him, and so more might speak in their order. When hee refers to the Prophets, the judging of the Spirit, or the Doctrine which the Prophet utters by the Spirit, hee does not exclude Spiritual men, <hi>i. e.</hi> the other Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of the Church, who were skilful in spiritual know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and judgement, such as all ought to bee in an Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Senate: For hee commands these, <hi>vers.</hi> 37. together with the Prophets, or Ministers of the Word, that according to their Ecclesiastical authority, they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge and defend their doctrine in the Church, that according thereunto they would judge and determine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning those that were disorderly.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 33.</hi> For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all Churches of the Saints.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 4. Because otherwise a tumult would arise, (which is hateful to God) while many should speak: Therefore in the case abovesaid let one speak after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in order. <hi>As in] Reason</hi> 5. Because this is the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome in all the Churches of the Saints; and therefore it ought to bee thus amongst them, that one speak in order after another.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 34.</hi> Let your Women keep silence in the Churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to bee under obedience: as also saith the Law.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Precept</hi> 5. Whereby hee forbids that Women should speak in the Church, <hi>i. e.</hi> teach publickly, or propound questions, because subjection is appointed in the Word of God, for the Sex of Women, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.16. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires.</p>

                     <hi>Vers. 35.</hi> And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their Husbands at home: for it is a shame for Women to speak in the Church.</q>
                  <p>That hee might prevent an Objection, hee commands them to learn at home privately of their Husbands, or elsewhere, that which they would demand publickly, adding another reason of the Precept, because it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seemly that a Woman should speak in the Church.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 36.</hi> What? came the Word of God out from you? or came it unto you onely?</q>
                  <p>Because hee knew that they who knew little, would take it ill, that they should bee kept within the compass of these Precepts, hee staies them, being ready to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer <hi>four</hi> waies. 1 By shewing, that they who do not submit to these Precepts, so behave themselves, as if they would equal themselves with the Apostles, by whom the Will of Christ came into the world. 2 Because they so carry themselves, as if they onely were Christians, to whom the Apostles were sent, and to whom onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed judgement concerning order and decency.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> By affirming that these Precepts are the Lords, and by commanding, that not onely they who are true Prophets in the Church, or truly spiritual, <hi>i. e.</hi> who are such, both by office and desert, acknowledge that they are divine; but also that they, who for an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and certain gifts of the Spirit, seem to themselves to bee Prophets, or spiritual, or skilful in discerning spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual things, or who are esteemed to bee such in the Church, by reason of their office in regarding spiritual things, acknowledge according to the reason, <hi>viz.</hi> of their office, that these Precepts are divine, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, that the Churches censure bee passed upon the contemners of these Precepts, as upon those who are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient to God. But that under the name of spirituals the Governours of Ecclesiastical Discipline was noted, it is plain, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.1. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.1. where hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends all Ecclesiastical Offices and gifts under the name of <hi>spiritual.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> By rejecting the judgement of affected ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, and after a Precept now given to the Governours of the Church, that they would acknowledge these Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts to bee divine, by referring the ignorant and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temners of these Precepts to the Moderators of Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, that according to the judgement of the Apostle, and of their Church (judging according to the Rule of the Apostle) they might bee ignorant of their own danger, who contemn these Precepts.</p>

               <p>That which belongs to the <hi>first.</hi> Because by denying of the Resurrection hee knew the whole Gospel was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrown; <hi>First,</hi> Hee confirms the <hi>Corinthians</hi> in the Faith of the Gospel in general, silently admonishing them, that they would not fall from it, using <hi>five</hi> Arguments.

                  <p>Hee further declares this <hi>Argument,</hi> shewing that by the purpose of God, two things are conjoyned in time, with the end of the world, <hi>viz. The</hi> delivering up the Kingdome by the Son into the hands of the Father, and the putting down of all rule, authority, and contrary power; whereof this is the meaning: After Christ shall have subdued and abolished all adverse power, as the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, the World, and the rest, of what kind soever, hee will
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:49391:38"/>
vanquish those powers so far forth, that they shall not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny longer bee injurious to his members, all of them being thrust down to hell; at <hi>last</hi> Christ shall present his Church (which is called the Kingdome of Christ, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him of his Father) every way perfect, and deliver it up, as it were, into the hands of his Father.</p>

                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 27.</hi> For hee hath put all things under his feet, but when hee saith all things are put under him, it is manifest that hee is excepted which did put all things under him.</q>
                  <p>That no man might quarrel at the word <hi>All,</hi> hee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts God from the number of <hi>All</hi> those things that should bee subdued unto Christ, because it is God who subdues all other things to Christ, except himself.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 28.</hi> And when all things shall bee subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself bee subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may bee all in all.</q>
                  <p>This hee further illustrates, because the Mediatory Kingdome of Christ being delivered up, as was now said, the Son himself is to bee subjected unto God, who hath subdued all things to him, that God may bee all in all, <hi>i. e.</hi> Christ as man having laid aside his Mediatory Embassage, will most fully manifest, that all things which were done by him as man, were done in the power, authority, and Name of God; and that hee, as man, is less than the Father, being for ever united to his Body, the Church, is subject to the Father; that the mediation, and means, and instruments, and helps which are now used being laid aside, God the <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> may supply all the necessities of the Saints immediately; and may by his power bee <hi>all means</hi> in all his Saints, and may altogether extinguish the necessity of all means, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments, and helps by his immediate presence with them most fully for ever; and hee will more than supply the room of all those; and hee himself by his power and efficacy, will bee more than all these, and what ever may bee needful for the most happy felicity of all his Saints.</p>
                  <q>

                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 13. That there is a future Resurrection, hee proves after this manner; Unless there bee a Resurrection of the Dead, what benefit will accrew to those that are tossed with the waves of Persecution, for some that are dead, <hi>i. e.</hi> for Christ and the Saints that are dead, whose Resurrection while they defend, they profess and assert the Resurrection of Christ past, and of the Saints here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after?

And it is absurd that they who suffer Martyrdome for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending the Resurrection of the Dead, should bee disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of their hope: Therefore there shall bee a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 14. Hee confirms in this the sense of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Argument: If it seem not absurd that other Martyrs should lose their labour, all Christians will at least think it absurd that wee Apostles should lose our labour, who Preaching and hoping for the Resurrection of the Dead, are in continual dangers: Therefore there shall bee a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection.</p>

                  <p>This <hi>Argument</hi> hee confirms by the testimony of his own experience, seriously affirming how certainly hee gloried with the <hi>Corinthians</hi> in Christ, so certainly did hee dayly undergo one death after another for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, being every day cast into new dangers of his life.</p>

                  <p>In particular hee gives instance of a notable danger, in fighting with beasts at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> in a plain sense, and as men ordinarily understand this phrase; for to condemn to the beasts was an usual kind of death, which Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were allotted to, as Histories make mention: What need the Apostle undergo this danger?

If the dead arise not, the gluttonous Religion of Epicures was best, <hi>Let us eat, and drink, for to morrow wee shall die,</hi> as some amongst them, like hogs, began to grunt: But this is absurd: Therefore the dead shall rise: Instead of the <hi>Assumption</hi> hee forbids that they attend not to these rotten kind of speeches, which might infect them either with false do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, or vicious manners.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>third</hi> part of the <hi>Chapter</hi> follows, wherein hee answers <hi>three</hi> Objections of the Adversaries.

                  <p>Hee answers to the <hi>first</hi> Objection, It is not impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that the dead should arise, because the seed dies year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and rises again as it were.</p>

                        <hi>43.</hi> It is sown in dishonour, it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power:</p>
                     <p n="44">
                        <hi>44.</hi> It is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual body.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> From the like difference betwixt Stars and terrestrial bodies: As God hath beautified celestial bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies with a celestial, and terrestrial bodies with a terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strial glory, and hath distinguished celestial bodies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst themselves with a different glory, as is to bee seen in the Sun, Moon, and Stars; So also the body in the resurrection, when it is raised it shall differ from it self falling into the grave, as that which is incorruptible from that which is corruptible, as that which is comely from that which is filthy, powerful from that which is weak, spiritual from that which is natural: That is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a <hi>natural</hi> body, which is quickened by the soul after the manner of living Creatures, by means of meats, ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, &amp;c. And that is a <hi>spiritual</hi> body, which retaining the soul, is supported by the Spirit of God without means, as the Angels.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 45.</hi> And so it is written, The first man <hi>Adam</hi> was made a living soul, the last <hi>Adam</hi> was made a quickning Spirit.</q>
                  <p>Hee explains this last difference betwixt a <hi>natural</hi> and a <hi>spiritual</hi> body, and proves it (because the phrase might seem somewhat harsh) by leading us to the first <hi>Adam,</hi> as to the Original of our <hi>first</hi> State in a natural body, and to CHRIST, the second <hi>Adam,</hi> as to the Original of our <hi>second</hi> State in a spiritual body, and compares these two in a three-fold manner. The <hi>first</hi> comparison is, in the opposite state of a natural and a spiritual body: The first <hi>Adam</hi> was made a living soul, not (giving life) which had a life indeed, but supported, as other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are, with meat and drink, &amp;c. And not such as could continue life to the body without nourishment; But Christ, the last <hi>Adam,</hi> is made a quickning Spirit, who could communicate virtue to those that were his, by his Spirit, that without nourishments of the body, the most blessed union of body and soul may bee preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 46.</hi> Howbeit, that was not first, which is spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual: but that which is natural, and afterward that which is spiritual.</q>
                  <p>The <hi>second</hi> comparison in respect to <hi>Order</hi>; The first <hi>Adam</hi> had the precedency in the natural state of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: The second <hi>Adam</hi> was latter in the spiritual state of the body; for the imperfect state ought to precede, so God is wont to proceed to the highest perfection: Hee saith not simply that <hi>Adam</hi> was before Christ, but that the Natural state of the first <hi>Adam,</hi> is first in time in <hi>Adam,</hi> in Christ, and in us: And our Spiritual state which is from Christ, is latter.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 47.</hi> The first man is of the earth, earthy; the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond man is the Lord from Heaven.</q>
                  <p>The <hi>third</hi> comparison in the order and dignity of the person: The <hi>first-Man,</hi> meer man, is of the earth, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, whose body rose out of the earth, and is resolved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain into earth, upon the substraction of food, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon hee could communicate unto us, nothing but a terrene life: But the <hi>second Adam,</hi> is both man and God from Heaven, who although hee hath a body from the earth, yet because hee is God from Heaven, and therefore is called <hi>heavenly,</hi> as hee could support his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, that it should not see corruption, though in its own nature terrene, and resoluble into dust, and as it being raised out of the grave, hee could make it every way glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, immortal, and heavenly, not needing earthly sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports: So in like manner can hee make our bodies such.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 48.</hi> As is the earthy, such are they that are earthy; and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.</q>
                  <p>From these hee proves the future mutation of the qualities of the body, from earthly to heavenly, from na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to spiritual, by <hi>four</hi> Arguments.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. Such as was the earthly <hi>Adam,</hi> the head of our stock, after the fleshly propagation, such it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came us to bee born, <hi>viz.</hi> mortal: Therefore as the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly <hi>Adam</hi> (our head in respect to regeneration and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification) is after his resurrection, <hi>viz.</hi> Spiritual, glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, incorruptible, immortal, such shall wee bee that are born again of him after our resurrection.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 49.</hi> And as wee have born the image of the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, wee shall also bear the image of the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. From its future certainty; As sure as wee bear the image of the first <hi>Adam,</hi> in the qualities of our substance, being made conform to him in soul and body; so sure shall wee bear the image of the second <hi>Adam,</hi> in the glorious qualities of our substance.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 50.</hi> Now this I say, Brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the Kingdome of God: Neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 3. The promises of glorifying our bodies, or of bringing us into the glorious Kingdome of God, ought to bee fulfilled: But flesh and blood, <hi>i. e.</hi> our bodies, as now they are corruptible, cannot enter into the Kingdome of God, unless they bee fitted for that glorious state: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our bodies shall bee made meet, by the mutation of their qualities, to enter into the Kingdome of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Corruption</hi>] By way of confirmation to this reason hee adds, <hi>Argum.</hi> 4. Corruption cannot inherit incorruption: Therefore necessary it is that our bodies bee changed in their qualities from corruptibility to incorruptibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 51.</hi> Behold, I shew you a mystery; wee shall not all sleep, but wee shall all bee changed,</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Objection</hi> 3. What shall become of those that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live at the comming of our Lord? How shall they arise, which shall not dye, but bee found alive by the Judge at his comming? Hee answers by opening the mystery, <hi>viz.</hi> that all shall not die, nor rise again, but they shall bee taken that remain alive at the comming of our Lord, and changed into an eternal state of immortality, either in glory, or torments, which change shall bee in stead of death and a resurrection.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 52.</hi> In a moment, in the twinckling of an eye, at the last Trumpet (for the Trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall bee raised incorruptible, and wee shall be changed.)</q>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="69" facs="tcp:49391:39"/>Hee shews the manner of this change, that it shall bee in the twinckling of an eye, <hi>i. e.</hi> in a moment, all that are alive and dead shall be summoned by a fearful alarum to the judgement of God.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 53.</hi> For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.</q>
                  <p>Hee gives <hi>two</hi> Reasons of this change. <hi>First,</hi> Morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity must bee swallowed up of immortality, and this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal body must put on immortality: Therefore they shall bee changed that are found alive at the comming of our Lord.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vers. 54.</hi> So when this corruptible shall have put on in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruption, and this mortal shall have put on immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, then shall bee brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up of victory.</p>
                     <p n="55">
                        <hi>55.</hi> O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 2. The Prophecie of <hi>Hosea</hi> ought to bee ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, <hi>chap.</hi> 13. <hi>v.</hi> 14. who fore-told our full victory o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver death and the grave: Therefore they that are alive shall bee changed at the comming of the Lord, which shall bee in stead of death.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 56.</hi> The sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the Law.</q>
                  <p>That this victory may appear the greater, hee inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates the victory wee shall have over sin and the Law, without which the grave cannot prevail any thing over us; for unless satisfaction bee given to the Law, sin, wrath, and death, remain in full power: But after satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction is made to the Law for us, sin and wrath are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, wherewith death is armed, as with a sting; which being disarmed is abolished and triumphed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 57.</hi> But thanks bee to God, who giveth us the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory through our Lord Iesus Christ.</q>
                  <p>Hee shews a twofold use of this victory: The <hi>first</hi> is, that thanks may bee given to God, who hath given us through Christ victory over death, sin, and the Law, yea verily hee hath imputed the victory of Christ to us, and hath made it ours; for hee hath died for us, and by his resurrection hath obtained for us victory over death, that hee might make us conquerours.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 58.</hi> Therefore my beloved Brethren, bee yee sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast, unmoveable, alwaies abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as you know, that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Another</hi> use of this doctrine is this, That under hope of the free gift, at the day of resurrection, wee would perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere constantly in the Faith of the Gospel, and diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly indeavour the bringing forth of the fruits of Faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in the resurrection the Lord will give us, whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver wee have lost with men, <hi>viz.</hi> the reward of good works.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>THere are three parts of this last <hi>Chapter.</hi> In the <hi>first</hi> is contained the last <hi>Article</hi> of the <hi>Epistle,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a <hi>Collection</hi> for the poor <hi>Jews, to vers. 5.</hi> In the <hi>second</hi> is contained the conclusion, shewing, for the most part familiar matters, <hi>to vers. 19.</hi> In the <hi>third</hi> hee mentions salutations of the Saints, <hi>to the end.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 1.</hi> Now concerning the Collection for the Saints, as I have given order to the Churches of <hi>Galatia,</hi> even so do yee.</q>
               <p>As touching the Collection: The famine which was prophesied by <hi>Agabus,</hi> Act. 11.28. as also the persecution, did much distress the Churches in <hi>Iudea,</hi> wherefore the Apostles living at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> exhort <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> that they would take care to make a collection amongst the Gentiles, to succour the need of the poor Jewes, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. hee speaks of this contribution, commanding that on the Lords Day (whereupon all Christians ceased from their labours, and met publikely to the Worship of God) that every one according to his ability, without vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory, should cast something into the Treasury.</p>
               <p>There are <hi>six</hi> reasons of his Exhortation: The <hi>first</hi> is from the example of other Churches, by name of those which were in <hi>Galatia,</hi> who were bound to the same du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, under the same Precepts.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 2.</hi> Upon the first day of the week, let every one of you lay by him in store, as God hath prospered him, that there bee no gatherings when I come.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 2. Because nothing is required of them unfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or burdensome, but that once every week, in conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient time and place, every one would contribute accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that measure wherewith God had blessed him: And the manner is plain, whereby the collection might bee made publikely every Lords Day, and yet every one should lay it by himself, <hi>i. e.</hi> no man knowing the sum: We may imagine that they imitated the example of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Church, a bored Chest being placed in the entrance to the house where they met for the Worship of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lest when I come] Reason</hi> 3. Because hee was about to come unto them, to enquire of their obedience. Here wee have the <hi>fourth</hi> Reason, lest upon their putting off, or neglecting the matter, they might bee found unprepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red when the Apostles should come, and might make their collection not so seasonable, with greater difficulty and prejudice.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 3.</hi> And when I come, whomsoever you shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove by your letters, them will I send to bring your liberality unto <hi>Jerusalem.</hi>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 5. Hee prevents an objection, lest there should bee any suspition of laying out their collection: Behold, I will commit your charitable contribution to bee carried to Jerusalem, unto men approved, chosen by your selves, whom I will send together with you, with letters.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 4.</hi> And if it bee meet that I go also, they shall go with mee.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 6. Because this business so well likes mee, that I am ready, not only to commend your messengers to the Churches which are in <hi>Iudea,</hi> by our Epistle, but if it shall seem meet, I also have determined to go along with those whom you commit the charge of this business to.</p>

That hee might restrain these, and finde all things at his comming better ordered in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> hee writ this <hi>second</hi> Epistle which is wholly Apologetical.</p>
               <p>Besides an <hi>Exordium</hi> and <hi>Conclusion,</hi> there are <hi>three</hi> parts of the Epistle: In the <hi>first,</hi> having removed the scandal of the Cross which was laid upon him, and the suspicion of his alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated mind from the <hi>Corinthians, Chap. 1. &amp; 2.</hi> Hee defends his Ministery, <hi>Chap. 2. &amp; 3.</hi> And proves his constancy and fidelity therein, <hi>Chap. 4. &amp; 5.</hi> Exhorting them to bring forth the fruits of his Ministery, <hi>Chap. 6.</hi> And that they would perswade themselves of his good will towards them, <hi>Chap. 7.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the <hi>second</hi> part of the <hi>Epistle,</hi> hee exhorts them to make a collection for the poor Brethren, the afflicted Iews, <hi>Chap. 8 &amp; 9.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the <hi>third</hi> part hee vindicates his Authority from contempt, and the aspersions of false Teachers, (who laboured to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Apostle vile amongst the <hi>Corinthians) Chap. 10.</hi> and holily boasts himself against them, <hi>Chap. 11. &amp; 12.</hi> endeavouring to render his Authority formidable, and also amicable to the <hi>Corinthians, Chap. 13.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The Inscription of the <hi>Epistle</hi> which is instead of an <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordium, vers. 1. &amp; 2.</hi> serves to prepare the minds of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> for receiving the things which hee wrote, intimating <hi>five</hi> Reasons to that end.</p>

               </q>
               <p>The <hi>first</hi> Reason: Because <hi>Paul</hi> the Author of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was an Apostle of Jesus Christ, and of chiefest Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in the Church. <hi>Reason</hi> 2. Because hee did not assume to himself this honour (as certain false Brethren feigned themselves servants of Christ, when they were not sent of God) but obtained it by the special Will of God. <hi>Reason</hi> 3. Because hee had brought in <hi>Timothy</hi> with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to witness against them, if they should not admit of this Truth of God, written by him. <hi>Reason</hi> 4. Because what hee was about to write, appertained not onely to the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> but to all the Saints and Churches in all <hi>Achaia, to wit,</hi> to know this asserted truth which hee was about to write.</p>

                  <hi>Reason</hi> 5. Comprehended in the salutation or Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical benediction: Because <hi>Paul,</hi> the Author of this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle, would not that the dignity of the Church of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth</hi> should any waies bee eclipsed (although hee knew there were most corrupt persons among them, not onely which lay hid, but openly shewed themselves enemies to the Apostle) but constantly accounted the Church at <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth</hi> a true Church, to which, by his Authority hee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the benediction of the Gospel, and doubted not to wish them all good things: Therefore they were obliged to receive the things which hee wrote, with that submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and readiness of mind that was fitting.</p>

Because in some measure (although not with that confidence as became them against the false A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles) the <hi>Corinthians</hi> boasted of their conversion by the Apostle, and the Apostle boasted of them, as the fruit of his Apostleship, and further, hee hoped to glory in the day of judgement: Therefore, &amp;c.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vers. 15.</hi> And in this confidence I was minded to come unto you afore; that you might have a second benefit:</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 5. Because hee had a purpose to go to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> in confidence of mutual good will, that hee might compleat the first benefit of their conversion, by confirming their Faith, as a second benefit; and that hee might receive expressions of their good will towards him, in the duties which hee reckons up, to the increase of their mutual love: Therefore, &amp;c.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 17.</hi> When I therefore was thus minded, did I use lightness? or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with mee there should bee yea, yea, and nay, nay?</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 6. By answering the Objection proposed, I have deferred my comming unto you longer than I would, not out of the levity of a mind changed, but, as afterwards it shall appear, out of love to you, that I might spare you, who ought to bee chastised with the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of the Church, had I come to you before: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought you not to suspect the alienation of my mind from you: The Objection is propounded in the same terms, in which his adversaries did reproach him, as vain
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:49391:41"/>
and light, speaking like carnal and unregenerate men, and promising what hee intended not to perform, as those that sleightly promise, and easily change their mind, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whose words (and by consequence) nor doctrine carryed any certainty, to whom therefore no credit was to bee given.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 18.</hi> But as God is true, our word toward you, was not yea, and nay.</q>
                  <p>Hee answers the Objection, and because hee is more careful that nothing should bee imputed to his Doctrine, as also to his Credit; hee answers first for his Doctrine, and confirms the truth thereof by <hi>five Reasons. Reason</hi> 1. Because his Doctrine was the Word of God, it must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity bee true: because God is faithful and true, whose dictates and precepts onely hee taught among them, not sometimes affirming, sometimes denying, as those that are not constant to themselves, use to do: Therefore they were to make no doubt of the truth of his doctrine.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 19.</hi> For the Son of God, Iesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, even by mee, and <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanus,</hi> and <hi>Timotheus,</hi> was not yea and nay, but in him was yea.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 2. My Doctrine, and the Doctrine of my companions contained nothing but Jesus Christ onely, who is the unchangeable Son of God, and the eternal ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity alwaies constant to himself: Therefore you are not to make any doubt of my Doctrine.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 20.</hi> For all the Promises of God in him are yea, and in him, <hi>Amen,</hi> unto the glory of God by us.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 3. Confirming the former. All the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of God in and through Christ are firm, unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and compleat; partly inasmuch as hee is the Son of God, by whom all things are made; partly inasmuch as hee is Mediatour, God-man, who compleated for us our Redemption, and procured it by his merit, that the good things promised might bee performed to us, and really hee applies them to us: Therefore our preaching which contains nothing else, is necessarily certain, and no doubt to be made of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To the glory of God] Reason</hi> 4. As the Promises of God are <hi>yea</hi> and <hi>Amen</hi> in Christ, <hi>i. e.</hi> that is, really and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ratified and compleat, and so they are acknowledged and preached by us, it makes to the glory of God, who will not have his Promises fulfilled but in Christ: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our preaching is so sure and firm, as the purpose of God is in glorifying himself in his Son, neither must you doubt any thing in the matter.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vers. 21.</hi> Now hee which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath annointed us, is God,</p>
                     <p n="22">
                        <hi>22.</hi> Who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 5. God is the Author of this our Faith in Christ, confirming both the preaching of us Apostles, and the Faith of you <hi>Corinthians</hi> (as many of you as are sincere) partly by communicating the several gifts of the Spirit, as it were an unction from Christ, partly by setting to his seal to our Faith, making us certain of the Truth of the Gospel, and stirs up ineffable and glorious joy in us; which is, as it were the earnest of our future happiness: Therefore our preaching is sure, nor ought you to make any doubt of it.</p>
                  <p>All these Arguments being weighed, upon no ground could the <hi>Corinthians</hi> suspect, that in the preaching of the Apostles, so many waies divinely confirmed, there could bee any uncertainty or falshood; and so hee prevents an Objection, as it tended to destroy the Truth of the Gospel.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 23.</hi> Moreover I call God for a record upon my soul, that to spare you I came not as yet unto <hi>Corinth.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>Here hee answers the Objection, so far as concerned his credit and carriage, by shewing the reason of his not comming unto them, <hi>viz.</hi> That time of repentance being granted to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> hee might spare them, <hi>i. e.</hi> restrain himself from a severe course with them, which at present hee was forced to use; and hee confirms his Word with an oath, because so the gravity of the matter required: Therefore not out of any levity did hee defer his comming unto them.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 24.</hi> Not for that wee have dominion over your Faith, but are helpers of your joy: for by Faith yee stand.</q>
                  <p>Hence arises another Objection: Therefore thou ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest thy self Lord of our Faith, as if thou couldest punish when thou wouldest. Hee answers by denying any Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, affirming the power of his Ministery, and that to bee imployed to the benefit of the Church, that timely Censures, according to the Will of Christ, being used, those that repented might at length rejoyce: Hee gives an account why hee denyed any dominion over their Faith, because Faith is the bond of conjunction with Christ, by which Faith wee stand fast in the Grace of God, in right and title unto Christ, in the possession of things present, and in hopes of future good things: Therefore Faith admits no Lord, besides God; it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of men onely as Ministers, and helpers.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>THere are <hi>two</hi> parts of this <hi>Chapter</hi>; In the <hi>first</hi> hee proceeds in his Apology for his constant good will towards the <hi>Corinthians, to vers. 14.</hi> In the <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> hee begins his Apology for his Ministery, <hi>to the end.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the <hi>first,</hi> to the former Arguments (whereby hee proves that his mind was not alienated from the <hi>Corinthians</hi>) hee adds <hi>eight</hi> signs of his good will towards them.</p>
               </argument>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 1.</hi> But I determined this with my self, that I would not come again to you in heaviness.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sign</hi> 1. That the cause why hee changed his purpose concerning his comming to them, was, lest hee should bring sadness to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> at his comming, being compelled more severely to correct their manners, which hee did desire might bee amended before his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 2.</hi> For if I make you sorry, who is hee then that maketh mee glad, but the same which is made sorry by mee?</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sign</hi> 2. That his sympathy was so much with the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi> that hee could not, unless they were glad, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, neither moderate himself from sorrow, so long as any one amongst them, by reason of him remained sad.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 3.</hi> And I wrote this same unto you, lest when I came I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoyce, having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sign</hi> 3. That the writing, not onely of the former E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle, but also of this second, was undertaken for this end, lest if hee had come to those, and had found them impenitent, besides his sorrow for their sin, hee might have been forced to a new sorrow, which necessary seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity would create both to them and himself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Having confidence] Sign</hi> 4. That hee was perswaded, that his joy was matter of joy to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and their joyes were both to him and them common.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 4.</hi> For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears, not that you should bee grieved, but that yee might know the love that I have more abundantly unto you.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sign.</hi> 5. That the former Epistle, which necessarily was more sharp, was not writ by him without tears, and truly for that end, that hee might testifie his ready mind towards them, not that hee might make them sorry.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 5.</hi> But if any have caused grief, hee hath not
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:49391:42"/>
grieved mee but in part: that I may not over-charge you all.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sign</hi> 6. His friendly mind towards the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> That the Apostle did esteem as nothing, that heaviness which the incestuous person had created to him, in comparison with that sadness which hee had caused to all the <hi>Corinthians</hi>: Hee addeth (<hi>in part</hi>) because his grief was now turned into joy through the incestuous persons repentance: Therefore by way of mitigation hee saith, that hee added (<hi>in part</hi>) for the incestuous persons sake now a penitent, lest hee should cast a burden on him already burthened in himself, if hee should too much ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate his sin.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 6.</hi> Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which was inflicted of many.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sign</hi> 7. That now hee was ready to receive the peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent incestuous person into favour, and so to give a proof of his lenity and meekness, that it might appear that the former severity came not, but from love and his desire of advantage to the Church of <hi>Corinth.</hi> To which end hee declareth that the chastisement of this Incestuous person, inflicted by the Authority of many (<hi>i. e.</hi> the Governours of the Church, the Church it self consenting) after his repentance appeared, was sufficient.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 7.</hi> So that contrariwise, yee ought rather to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give him, and comfort him, lest perhaps such an one should bee swallowed up with over much sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</q>
               <p>That hee might shew his meekness towards the peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Incestuous person, hee adviseth that hee may by the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Church bee again received into favour, for these six <hi>Reasons</hi> annexed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because they are bound to forgive the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent, and to comfort him, no less than they were bound to excommunicate him, being impenitent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lest perhaps] Reason</hi> 2. Because otherwise it was dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, lest hee should bee swallowed up with over much sorrow, except they should now receive the penitent into favour again.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 8.</hi> Wherefore I beseech you, that you would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm your love towards him.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 3. Because (especially they were so desired by the Apostle) they are bound to testifie their love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, to wit, by shewing themselves to have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated that man, not that they might destroy him, but that by repentance, they might save him.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 9.</hi> For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether you bee obedient in all things.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 4. Because by this means they were about to shew themselves obedient to the command of the Apostle in all things, as before in excommunicating, so now also, by absolving him from the bond of excommunication, wherein the Apostle did prove their obedience.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 10.</hi> To whom yee forgive any thing, I forgive also<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgave I it in the person of Christ.</p>
                  <p n="11">

               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 5. Because the Apostle, for the sake of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> had granted him pardon, and was about to forgive him: Therefore it was meet that they for the Apostles sake should forgive this man also.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Get an advantage] Reason</hi> 6. Lest through the craftiness of Satan, the Church should suffer harm: except now they should forgive him repenting; for by ever much severity sinners may bee brought into despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, or a depar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 12.</hi> Furthermore, when I came to <hi>Troas</hi> to preach Christs Gospel, and a door was opened unto mee of the Lord,</p>
                  <p n="13">
                     <hi>13.</hi> I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> my Brother, but taking my leave of them, I went from thence into <hi>Macedonia.</hi>

His constant good will towards the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi>; That hee could not any where rest, also that great hope of promoting the Gospel being offered, as in <hi>Troas,</hi> until hee had known of <hi>Titus,</hi> whom hee had sent to <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi> concerning their affairs, for the cause of meeting him hee went into <hi>Macedonia,</hi> that by him hee might bee made more certain concerning the affairs of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi> and that hee might learn, whether as yet it was a convenient time to come to the <hi>Corinthian<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The <hi>second</hi> part of the <hi>Chapter</hi> follows, in which hee defendeth his Ministery, and proveth it to bee commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, by <hi>five Arguments,</hi> intimating by the way, that hee, whilst hee was absent from them, was not idle, but was busied in the work of the Lord with success.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. Because Christ in his Ministery, and hee himself in Christ did triumph concerning his enemies, by snatching many out of the power of Satan, and by bringing them to the Faith of the Gospel.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The savour] Argum.</hi> 2. Because by his Ministery, (whatsoever the success were) the sweetness of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel and its efficacy was manifested in every place, whilst the knowledge of Christ did breathe a quickening life, by which sinners are quickened and converted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God.</p>

                        <hi>Vers. 15.</hi> For wee are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish.</p>

                  </q>

That notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the Apostles themselves with their Ministery, were acceptable unto God, and through Christ brought an acceptable savour to God, no less in the conviction and perdition of the Reprobates (to which the Gospel by accident was a savour of death) than in the faith and salvation of those that beleeve and are saved, to whom the Gospel, both in its own nature, and proper effect, was a quickening savour to life and salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

From the unlikeness betwixt himself, and many Preachers; if they did not mix false doctrine; yet they did mingle their own passions with true Doctrine, serving their ambition and covetousness, and bending the Doctrine to the favour of men: But the Apostle 1 In Sincerity, <hi>i. e.</hi> neither mixing false doctrine, nor

               <p>The efficacy of my Ministery is so apparent to all the Churches, that I need not any commendatory Letters from any particular person, or from you, or from others, neither do I say these things, because I care for vain-glory, but that I may defend my Ministery against my enemies for your good: Therefore my Ministery is commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable.</p>

                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 3. by confirmation of the former: Because my Ministery was effectual, not onely in bringing you to the profession of the Faith; but also to your saving regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, by the speciall operation of Christs Spirit, this is that which hee saith that they were the Epistle, which Christ himself by his Ministery hath written, by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his will in their hearts by the Holy Ghost, after a more excellent manner, than any thing was wont to bee writ with Ink upon Paper or Tables of Stone.</p>

The Ministery of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works, which is the Ministery of death to all that have sinned, was truly glorious, as it appeared in <hi>Moses</hi> (for justice is glorious in punishing of sin) But the Ministery of the New Covenant, which is the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of the Spirit quickening, is more glorious; for as in <hi>Moses</hi> pronouncing the curse of the Law against sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, his bodily glory did shine: but O how much spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual glory doth shine in the face of Christ, setting sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners at liberty by his Grace!</p>

                     <hi>Compar.</hi> 4. The Ministery of the Law, or the Old Covenant of Works is a Ministery of condemnation for sin, therefore indeed glorious: But the Ministry of the Gospel, or the New Covenant, is the Ministery of the Righteousness of Christ, and absolution from sin; and therefore so much the more glorious, by how much abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution and justification do excel condemnation and sin. Because by the Covenant of Works wee are all accused of sin, wee are all condemned, and made obnoxious to death: Therefore its Ministery is called the Ministery of sin, condemnation and death.</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>The Apostle observes that now blindness also may bee perceived in the <hi>Iews,</hi> who while they read the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, they see nothing besides the veil of ceremonies, because the veil of ignorance and infidelity remaineth upon their minds, which veil, represented by the type of the external veil covering <hi>Moses</hi> his face, by Christ is taken away from all the Faithful, for righteousness, life, virtue; and lastly, all grace and glory is published and communicated to the Faithful in Christ: But hitherto this veil doth remain upon the hearts of the unbelieving <hi>Iews.</hi>

                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 16.</hi> Nevertheless, when it shall turn to the Lord, the veil shall bee taken away.</q>
                  <p>Hee hath hope of the <hi>Iews</hi> Conversion, when by the Grace of God the heart of the <hi>Israelites,</hi> or the Doctrine of <hi>Moses</hi> now veiled, should bee turned by them to God, <hi>i. e.</hi> should bee brought according to this typical significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Christ, who is the end of the Law: Then the veil of ignorance, and of the darkness of ceremonies, should bee taken from them, as the veil was taken from the face of <hi>Moses,</hi> when hee entred in unto God sitting betwixt the Cherubins; chiefly that they might see God their Lord, and their Saviour Christ, and might ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him to bee the true end of the whole Law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <hi>Vers. 17.</hi> Now the Lord is that Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.</q>
                  <p>The reason of this is given: Because 1. Christ is the Spirit, or the Soul of all ceremonies, that a spiritual thing is signified by them. 2. Christ is also the Spirit, or the Soul of the Moral Law, because hee fulfilled the Law, in whom alone the perfect righteousness of the Law is to bee found. 3. Christ is the Spirit, because hee quickens those that believe to new obedience and life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting, and hee delivereth those from sin and misery: for when it is said, <hi>Where the Spirit of Christ the Lord is, or where Christ is, there is liberty</hi>; the liberty is to bee understood, not from the obedience of the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but from the ceremonial yoke, from the bondage of sin, and yoke of the Legal Covenant, and all evils which do follow from its violation: Liberty, I say, was given to the Faithful by the Spirit of the Gospel, at leastwise that which belongeth to them of <hi>right,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though not alwayes according to <hi>sense,</hi> nor ever before the end of life, as to a full <hi>possession:</hi> For although the Spirit with a loud voice proclaimeth, that there is a gate opened unto us, that wee may go out of prison, yet wee by reason of the weakness of Faith, do go slowly forth. And this is the Explication of the first part of the Comparison concerning the Ministery of the Law.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 18.</hi> But wee all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image, from glory to glory, even as by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Lord.</q>
                  <p>Here followeth another branch of the Comparison, concerning the Ministery of the Gospel in those that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, which is propounded in this sense: But wee that by the Ministery of the Gospel believe in Christ, the veil of ceremonies and ignorance, the veil of infidelity and hardness of heart also being removed, are freely admitted to the clear beholding of Christ, and the glory of the grace of God shining in the Gospel, as in a glass, and beholding Christ by Faith wee are sanctified, and more and more made happy in conformity with Christ, encreased daily by degrees, from one measure of glory and sanctity to another, and that by the powerful work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Holy Ghost. Sanctification is called glory, because Sanctification is the beginning of Glorification, for by that the Image of God is repaired in us, which is our glory.</p>

                  <p>Hee answers: 3. That all his afflictions are modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and hee himself is upheld by God in all things, that hee is not destitute of the help of God, doth not sink under his burthen, that hee doth not forsake God, nor dispair, is not forsaken of God, not left, or lost: Therefore it matters nothing how weak he is in himself. <hi>Wee are afflicted</hi> (hee saith) <hi>yet not distressed</hi>; i. e. on every side wee are troubled with adversity, but wee are not brought into such streights, as to bee over-whelmed, but wee are preserved by the help of God in the midst of afflictions. <hi>Wee are perplexed, but not in despair</hi>; i. e. wee doubt sometimes what may bee done in the dangers of this life, but wee are not so destitute, that wee are void of all counsel. <hi>Wee are persecuted, but not forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken</hi>; i. e. God permits us to bee vexed and evil intreated by the enemies of the Gospel, but hee neither permits us to bee slain, before the time by him determined, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth hee withdraw his consolations from us. <hi>Wee are cast down, but not destroyed</hi>; that is, wee sometimes seem presently ready to perish, but God helping us, wee are kept from perishing.</p>

                  <p>Hee answers: 4. That his afflictions make for the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Christ, because the Image of Christ suffering and dying may bee seen in them, and that the virtue and strength of Christ living, may appear in supporting him under so many afflictions: Therefore it matters not how weak hee may bee in himself.</p>

                  <p>Hee confirms this from hence, that the Apostles who lived in the midst of troubles by the strength of Christs Spirit, for the cause of Christ, daily undergo danger, that the quickning Virtue of Christ may more and more appear in sustaining their fleshly infirmities, obnoxious to that miserable condition.</p>

                  <p n="1">1.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Hee answers</hi> 4. That hee was not tyred nor wearied by his afflictions, whereof hee subjoyns three Reasons.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because as much as was diminished of those goods, that made for the maintaining the State of this present life, so much was added to his holiness for the increasing of his spiritual life.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 17.</hi> For our light affliction which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 2. Because it did procure an unspeakable weight of glory (to the promoting of which, afflictions help, as instruments and means both of mortification and glorification) so that no afflictions are to bee accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of, yea truly the lightness of afflictions, which is but for a moment, clearly vanisheth and becomes as nothing in comparison with future glory.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 18.</hi> While wee look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 3. Why hee doth not wax faint, is, Because (saith hee) by Faith I look at things eternal and invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, by reason of which, I despise all temporal and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, <hi>i. e.</hi> both Riches, Honours, and Profits, &amp;c. I do not look at, because those are onely durable for a time, but I have my mind intent upon those good and eternal things which God hath promised: Therefore I do not weigh the loss of temporal things; by all which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle confirmeth the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> lest they should bee offended at his afflictions.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>HEE goes on to shew more fully his faithfulness in the Ministery, by mentioning <hi>seven impellent causes,</hi> whereby hee was moved to faithfulness in the discharge of his duty.</p>
               </argument>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 1.</hi> For wee know that if our earthly house of this Tabernacle were dissolved, wee have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.</q>
               <p>The <hi>first</hi> impellent cause to faithfulness in the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery is his certain confidence of a blessed immortality, which after death remains for him, and all the rest of the faithful Ministers of Christ, of which felicity also the body shall bee partaker in the Resurrection. I am perswaded (saith hee) that after the dissolution of this my frail body, I shall continually injoy felicity of soul, and the glorious immortality of a raised body, why should not I therefore bee faithful, so long as I dwell in this mortal body.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 2.</hi> For in this wee groan earnestly, desiring to bee cloathed upon with our house which is from Heaven.</q>
               <p>The solidity of this his confidence or perswasion is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by <hi>seven</hi> Signs, all which did stir up his mind to faithfulness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sign</hi> 1. Is a desire of departing out of this life, that hee might obtain immortality, or bee endued, instead of a corruptible body, with immortal glory. An Argument certainly of a mind conscious of its sincerity, and certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied of future happiness.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 3.</hi> If so bee that being clothed wee shall not bee found naked.</q>
               <p>Hee limits this sign and priviledge of being endued with future glory, That it may belong to those onely, who departing out of this life to an immortal and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable state, are not found naked, <hi>i. e.</hi> not destitute of that true covering, whereby our filthy nakedness is cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, which covering is Christ, or Christs Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, which can alone cover our sins, wherein our naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness consists: This therefore is the <hi>second</hi> Sign of his solid desire of going out of this life, and of a mind ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conscious of the faithful administration of his office, that hee knew himself to bee in the number of those, to whom alone the certainty of being cloathed upon with glory belonged, to wit, of those, who are cloathed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready with that covering, whereby the foul nakedness of sinners is covered, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Righteousness <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>f Christ, with which, except a man bee cloathed in this life, hee shall bee found naked in the other, and shall remain naked for ever.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 4.</hi> For wee that are in this Tabernacle do groan, being burdened, not for that wee would bee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloathed, but cloathed upon, that mortality might bee swallowed up of life.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sign</hi> 3. That the desire of his departing this life ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing from this confidence, was holy, <hi>i. e.</hi> it was derived not so much from the weariness of natural life, but from the hope of a better: This is that which hee saith, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though hee groan and bee sorrowful in his body, yet hee would not bee uncloathed of this body, but that this body might bee cloathed upon with immortality, and that mortality might bee swallowed up of immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 5.</hi> Now hee that hath wrought us for the self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same thing is God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of this Spirit.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sign</hi> 4. That this desire is not natural, but the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural work of God, stirred up, and formed in the hearts of his own by the special work of God: <hi>It is God that hath wrought,</hi> formed and created us for this thing. His confidence therefore is solid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Who also] Sign</hi> 5. That this confidence of a better life is sealed by the earnest of the Spirit, having as it were a taste and experience of that life in the peace and joy of the Spirit, <hi>i. e.</hi> in the first fruits of that happiness which is to come.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 6.</hi> Therefore wee are alwaies confident, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that whilst wee are at home in the body, wee are absent from the Lord.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sign</hi> 6. That this confidence is firmly grounded in the certain perswasion of his nigher access to the Lord, which should bee vouchsafed to him after death, when doubtless, even as in one house, hee should dwell with God, who now in the body is as absent from the Lord.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 7.</hi> (For wee walk by Faith, not by sight.)</p>
                  <p n="8">
                     <hi>8.</hi> Wee are confident, I say, and willing rather to bee absent from the body, and to bee present with the Lord.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sign</hi> 7. Confirming the former, that hee knoweth himself to walk by Faith in this life, and not by sight of the beatifical vision, which abideth for us in the life to come, who in our sense are absent from the Lord, while wee are present i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> the body: Therefore more ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently and confidently hee did both desire and chuse to go to the Lord, rather than to remain in the body.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 9.</hi> Wherefore wee labour, that whether present or absent, wee may bee accepted of him.</q>
               <p>That this confidence confirmed by so many signs of sincerity was the impellent cause to his faithfulness in his Ministery, hee now expresly declares: Because what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever change towards life or death did happen to him, out of this confidence hee did indeavour to please God, with no less diligence than those which contend for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, that both in this life or pilgrimage, and in his death or approaching to God, hee might bee made acceptable to him.</p>
               <q>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:49391:44"/>
                  <hi>Vers. 10.</hi> For wee must all appear before the judgement seat of Christ, that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that hee hath done, whether it bee good or evil.</q>
               <p>His <hi>second</hi> impellent cause to faithfulness in his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, is the consideration of punishments and rewards which abide every one according to their works at the last judgement, in which God will inflict punishments upon the wicked, but to the godly (whose good works after their sins are pardoned onely remain) hee shall render rewards.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 11.</hi> Knowing therefore the terrour of the Lord, wee perswade men, but wee are made manifest unto God, and I trust also, wee are manifest in your consciences.</q>
               <p>He shews by calling God and the consciences of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> to bee his witnesses, that this Argument hath ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him to faithfulness in the Ministery: For the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of that future terrible judgement hath affected this, that he exhorted all to reconciliation with God by Faith.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 12.</hi> For we commend not our selves again unto you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that you may have somewhat to answer them, which glory in appearance, and not in heart.</q>
               <p>He solves <hi>two Objections,</hi> which his adversaries may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject against him so earnestly glorying of his faithfulness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 1. Thou O <hi>Paul</hi> gloriest (some one may say) whilst thou commendest thy self. Hee answers, that hee did not say these things for that end, but that the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> may have that for his defence, whereby to repress their vain and boasting Teachers, who did diminish the authority of the Apostle amongst them, and did glory in the presence of men, otherwise than their conscience and the truth of the matter did permit; For they being destitute of piety, or matter of glorying in heart, they gloried in their adulterated eloquence.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 13.</hi> For whether wee bee besides our selves, it is to God, or whether wee bee sober, it is for your cause.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 2. But O <hi>Paul,</hi> thou art besides thy self, who doest so openly confute such Teachers. Hee answers, that hee did not dispute, but give a reason of the fact, as it did become a wise man, to wit, that hee uttered those things for the glory of God and their salvation: For (sayes hee) if I praise my Ministery, which seems to bee the part of one besides himself; I do it for the Glory of God, lest my Gospel should bee undervalued: If I speak humbly of my self, as sober men use to do, I do it for your good.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 14.</hi> For the Love of Christ constraineth us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause wee thus judge: that if one d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ed for all, then were all dead:</q>
               <p>The <hi>third</hi> impellent cause to faithfulness containing a reason of the former saying, is his love, wherewith hee lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Christ, which did cast upon him, as it were bonds, and constrained him, that hee being unmindful of himself, did both speak and do those things onely, which might promote the Glory of Christ, and the good of the Church.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 15.</hi> And that hee died for all, that they which live, should not henceforth live to themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again.</q>
               <p>Hee giveth a reason of his love, and adds the <hi>fourth</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellent cause, to wit, the love of Christ to us: Christ (saies hee) when wee were all dead in respect of our desert, and the justice of God, alone died in the room of all of us, that beleeve in him: That wee being delivered from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served perdition, should not serve our selves, but Christ our Redeemer: why therefore should not I bee faithful in the business of Christ?</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 16.</hi> Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh; yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know wee him no more.</q>
               <p>Hee prevents an Objection, to this end, that hee might give account why hee checked those glorious <hi>Corinthian</hi> Doctors; not regarding his esteem with the ignorant; So that hee might promote the Glory of Christ, and the Churches safety. Some one might say, but it behoved him to regard the dignity of so many worthy Teachers amongst the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> who shined with Eloquence, Learning, Riches, Honours and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of Parentage: For some of these were of the Jews, and perhaps did boast, that they were of the Tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and did arrive to Christs kindred, as it is cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible from what follows<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Hee answers <hi>three</hi> waies, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every one of his answers as conclusions from <hi>vers.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. That hee doth not look at Riches, Honours, Parentage, Eloquence, and the rest, neither did hee esteem any man from outward things, by which the esteem of men is encreased or diminished with world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and those that are carnal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tea] Answ.</hi> 2. That hee did not judge any more of Christ himself, according to his external condition, or detract from his estimation, by reason of his poverty and ignominy in the world, as in times past hee esteemed being in a mistake: And therefore hee did not esteem any one more valuable, because of his Riches, Honours, and Parentage, &amp;c.</p>

                  <hi>Vers. 17.</hi> Therefore if any man bee in Christ, hee is a new Creature, old things are passed away, behold, all things are become new:</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 3. Shewing the duty of the faithful ingrafted into Christ to bee this, that as new Creatures they should labour for the newness of a right judgement, and an holy life. And that these worldly things should not bee so highly esteemed, hee proves from <hi>Isa.</hi> 65.17. where God promiseth an abolition of old things, and that hee will make a new Heaven and a new Earth; <hi>i. e.</hi> all things new under the Kingdome of Christ: Whence it follows, that those things onely are to bee had in estimation amongst Christians, which reach to a new Creature, or Regeneration; For all things are made new to those that are renewed, when they are reconciled to God, they have all Creatures as it were reconciled to them, and now they use them after a new manner, for the Glory of God, and their own salvation, setting a price upon every thing, according as it makes, or not makes, for the promoting of the Kingdome of God in themselves and others.</p>

                  <hi>Vers. 18.</hi> And all things are of God, who hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled us to himself by Iesus Christ, and hath given unto us the Ministery of reconciliation.</q>
               <p>The <hi>fifth</hi> impellent cause to faithfulness in his Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, is the grace and goodness of God towards him, which cause (returning to his purpose, and looking up to God) hee asserts the Author of the New Creature (whereof hee had even now spoken) and of all graces: Because the Grace of God towards him had brought to him a double priviledge, to wit, reconciliation by Christ, and a Ministerial office for the reconciliation of others; from hence hee acknowledges a twofold Obligation for his faithfulness in the Ministery: Why therefore should not hee approve himself faithful?</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 19.</hi> To wit, that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses unto them, and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation.</q>
               <p>The <hi>sixth</hi> impellent cause, is the excellency of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, of which hee propounds a short collection, wherein, 1 The Father, who by reason of sin was removed far from us, declares himself to come near unto us in Christ, who is the true IMMANUEL God with us. 2 The Father reconciled, as for his part, declares himself to do that in Christ, for the Elect world, that they behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their enmities betwixt themselves, and God, as for their part, may come again into favour, and bee recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled with God through Christ. 3 The means is shewn by which men may bee reconciled to God, <hi>viz.</hi> by remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, or a not imputing of sins, which God most graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously doth offer. 4 The instrument of applying the Grace of reconciliation obtained by Christ is shewn, <hi>viz.</hi> the word of reconciliation committed to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, and to the other Ministers. In which so excellent
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:49391:45"/>
and so necessary a Ministery, hee could not bee but faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full when hee set those things before him.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 20.</hi> Now then wee are Embassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us; wee pray you in Christs stead, bee yee reconciled to God.</q>
               <p>The <hi>seventh</hi> impellent cause to faithfulness is, the excellency of the person which hee represents, which cause hee propounds, and together with the whole precedent Doctrine hee makes use of, by which very thing shewing the endeavour of his faithfulness. To this end hee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunes all, and diligently urges all with his authority as an Embassadour, and also submissively and lovingly, as bearing the Image of God, that every one would more heartily accept the reconciliation offered of God, that the remainders of enmity being taken away, which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief cherisheth within, all may become the same Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit with God.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 21.</hi> For hee hath made him to bee sin for us, who knew no sin, that wee might bee made the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of God in him.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lastly,</hi> That hee may perswade to the obedience of Faith, and to the receiving of a fuller measure of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliatio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, hee sheweth that an open and expedient way to reconciliation, is because Christ the innocent Mediator, and pure from sin, by his consent and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the Father in a judicial manner, is accounted guilty of our sin, yea truly hee was made an Expiatory Sacrifice for our sin, expresly for that end, that wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in Christ may bee made partakers of Christs righteousness judicially by imputation, and so may bee made perfectly righteous, and as it were by that righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness which chiefly pleases God through this excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and divine way of reconcilement, which the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God hath invented, and grace hath made ours.</p>
               <p>But hee adds this <hi>(in him)</hi> that wee might necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily understand that wee are engraffed into Christ by Faith, by which this righteousness may bee ours, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause from our conjunction with Christ by Faith, follows our judicial union with Christ, from this union imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made of the obedience and righteousness of Christ to us, and at length the application of all his gifts, even to perfect felicity, which being considered, what can bee said more efficaciously to stir all of us up, that our enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties being acknowledged, and our necessities, wee may imbrace reconciliation offered in Christ.</p>
               <p>The sum therefore of these three verses is, That the Apostle when hee had weighed the dispensation of mans Redemption, and the reason of bringing the Elect to Reconciliation and Salvation, hee could not but imploy himself strongly and faithfully in his Ministery: For when hee knew by the Covenant, (concerning the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of the Elect) between God and his Son, (the second person of the Trinity invested with the office of a Mediator and a Surety) God being so abundantly satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, hee now becomes gracious to the world of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed, or Elect, concurring with Christ the Mediator for the applying of Reconciliation obtained for all the Redeemed; and hee importunes them by Christ, and by the Servants of Christ, the Ministers of the Gospel, no less seriously than the Redeemer himself, and prayes them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that now hee himself being reconciled, they would bee reconciled. When I say the Apostle knew these things, and that there was a charge committed to him, that hee should promote this reconciliation, what wonder then, if hee earnestly strived, that men might be turned to God? And when hee knew that by Covenant Christ had took upon himself all the sins of all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed, and was made a Propitiatory Sacrifice for the expiating of their sins imputed to him, under this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the Redeemed (such all the faithful shew themselves to bee) clothed with the Righteousness of God, or the Righteousness of Christ, should bee account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed most righteous in the mind of God, and at length should bee fully renewed by the Holy Spirit, what won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der then if hee confidently and constantly prosecuted the business of reconciliation, and shewed himself faithful in executing his Ministery?</p>

               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 1.</hi> Wee then as workers together with him beseech you also, that yee receive not the Grace of God in vain.</q>
               <p>The <hi>first</hi> Exhortation is, that they would receive the Grace of Reconciliation more seriously, and with fruit, and suffer not the Grace of God offered in the Gospel (by their fault) to want its full fruit in them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they may obtain Righteousness, Peace, Life, and all things which Christ hath obtained for them. The Proposition hee ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges is this. Yee ought not to receive the Grace of God in vain, <hi>i. e.</hi> in outward profession onely, without its inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal virtue; this hee proves by three Arguments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. Wee Ministers of God being co-workers, (that his work may bee promoted in you) granted from him to you by free gift promising our endeavour for the promoting of your salvation, earnestly desired that of you; Therefore yee ought not to receive the Grace of God in vain.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 2.</hi> (For hee saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in a day of salvation have I succoured thee: Behold, now is the accepted time, behold, now is the day of salvation.)</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. In a Parenthesis. Because now the time is acceptable in which, by the intercession of Christ, the Grace of God is efficacious to the producing of fruit in all those that receive the Gospel with serious affection of heart, and desire to bring forth fruit, which hee proves out of <hi>Isa.</hi> 49.8. where the Father speaketh to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour interceding for them, and by his Spirit breathing in them: Therefore you must beware lest this opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Grace bee in vain offered to you.</p>

                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 3. <hi>Ioyned</hi> with the <hi>first</hi> verse. Wee Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters which exhort you, and I by name <hi>Paul,</hi> wee are approved by all manner of waies, and wee are found faithful in the Ministery of the Gospel, not hindering you, but that you may profit by our Ministery, that so yee may pretend nothing, but that yee may persevere in the Grace of the Gospel: Therefore yee ought not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Grace of the Gospel in vain, but to contend for the receiving of, and expressing the virtue of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel: Hee confirms the <hi>Antecedent</hi> by an induction of the virtues which prove Ministers faithful, with which hee was first of all, by the Grace of God, adorned: There are <hi>five</hi> parts of the induction; In the <hi>first</hi> part hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves from himself those vices, whereby idle Teachers were wont to create offences to the Gospel, demolishing more by their manners in the edifice of God, than by their Doctrine they edifie, and yeelding occasion to the wicked of speaking ill of his Ministery, or of the office of Ministers.</p>

mentions his patience exercised in <hi>nine</hi> kinds of evils, in all which without murmuring hee patiently executed the offices of his Ministery, for hee strongly endured the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of his journies with want and dangers, the snares of his persecutors, prison, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In the <hi>third</hi> part hee adds other <hi>six</hi> virtues of his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, of which the <hi>first</hi> is his freedome from the pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the world, whilst hee conversed amongst those of the world. 2 His discretion in handling his auditors. 3 His forbearance in provocations. 4 His gentleness in his commerce with more difficult things. 5.

               <p>In the <hi>fourth</hi> part hee reckons the virtues which did belong to the discharge of his duty. 1. Hee preached nothing besides the truth of God. 2. Hee demonstrated the power of the Spirit in his speech. 3. Hee contended against all his enemies with spiritual weapons, <hi>i. e.</hi> with lawful means, on the right hand in prosperity; on the left hand in adversity; and in every change and vicissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of things, hee did remain constant, lest hee should either by enticements, or by terrours, turn out of the right way.</p>

               <p>When hee was accounted as ignoble and contemptible, hee did manifest himself by his deeds, that they who had eyes might acknowledge him to bee the Servant of the most High God: Hee seemed even as dead, and in the midst of death, hee triumphed notwithstanding, that hee performed his duty, as being alive: yea chastened with many stripes, even to death, hee was kept by God, lest hee should die: by reason of those evils which pressed him, sometimes under a pretence hee was sad, but by the Spirit in God, hee did alwayes rejoyce: Hee was count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed poor, but through the Gospel, by the manifold love of God, hee did enrich many, not only by shewing the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of contentation in the Gospel, but also instructing men to virtue and piety, which is profitable for all things.

The Proposition is clearly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, which is to bee confirmed. O <hi>Corinthians,</hi> yee ought to receive us, <hi>i. e.</hi> to bee perswaded of my love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you, yee ought to love mee again, and to lay up my exhortations in your enlarged hearts: <hi>Three</hi> Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are taken from the <hi>three</hi> Signs of the Apostles good will towards them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>No man] Argum.</hi> 1. That they should receive the Apostle, and the first Sign of his little ill towards them. Because I do not ill deserve of any one, either by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reproach, or corrupting by perverse Doctrine, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauding any one by any means.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 3.</hi> I speak not this to condemn you: for I have said before, that you are in our hearts to dye and live with you.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. <hi>Sign</hi> 2. Because when I speak of the things fore-going, it was onely for the clearing of my self; I am so far from condemning the Church of the beleeving <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that out of love I have determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the contrary, to cleave to you in prosperity and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity, in life and death, that no change at any time may draw my affection from you.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 4.</hi> Great is my boldness of speech toward you, great is my glorying of you, I am filled with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 3. <hi>Sign</hi> 3. Because news being received con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning your repentance, my heart so rejoyceth in the midst of afflictions, that I dare safely speak the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of my mind towards you, concerning your perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, and glory of you amongst others.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 5.</hi> For when wee were come into <hi>Macedonia,</hi> our flesh had no rest, but wee were troubled on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very side; without were fightings, within were fears.</p>
                  <p n="6">
                     <hi>6.</hi> Nevertheless, God that comforteth those that are cast down, comforted us by the comming of <hi>Titus.</hi>
                  </p>
               </q>
               <p>Hee being about to explain the experiment of his good will towards them, propounds his afflictions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with hee was pressed in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> whilst hee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected news from them hee was oppressed partly by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution of the enemies, partly by the intestine evils of the Church, partly by the anxiety of his mind, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so with the troubles of his body; that there was no rest to his outward man. Against all which troubles, by mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God, consolation was sufficiently administred to him by the comming of <hi>Titus,</hi> who had now returned from the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and brought joyful news concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their state.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 7.</hi> And not by his comming onely, but by the consolation wherewith hee was comforted in you, when hee told us your earnest desire, your moarning, your fervent mind toward mee, so that I rejoyced the more.</q>
               <p>The Apostle reckoneth <hi>eight</hi> causes of his joyfulness, whereof many were signs of his good will towards them. 1 Because <hi>Titus</hi> was returned safe. 2 Because <hi>Titus</hi> had received consolation from you <hi>Corinthians.</hi> 3 Because I had heard by <hi>Titus</hi> concerning your pious affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards mee, and desire of seeing mee; concerning your weeping for the wickedness committed amongst you, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning your zeal against the Incestuous person, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst my back-biters, from whence hath abounded joy to mee much surpassing all that grief, which I have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for that matter.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 8.</hi> For though I made you sorry with a Letter, I do not repent, though I did repent; for I perceive that the same Epistle hath made you sorry, though it were but for a season.</q>
               <p>Before hee propounds the <hi>fourth</hi> cause of his consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hee solves an Objection, which solution did make much to the purpose. They might say<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thou hast made us sorrowful in the former Epistle.</p>
               <p>The Answer is <hi>fourfold. Answ.</hi> 1. I was compelled, and not without grief have I made you sad, but this grief through your repentance hath ceased. For when the Apostle writ the Epistle, being uncertain concerning the event, hee was sad, <hi>i. e.</hi> that hee saith, that hee himself repented: but when hee saw the event, hee was freed from grief, <hi>i. e.</hi> Now hee saies hee did not repent. <hi>Answ.</hi> 2 That sadness which was moved by my Epistle was short.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 9.</hi> Now I rejoyce, not that yee were made sorry, but that yee sorrowed to repentance, for yee were made sorry after a godly manner, that yee might receive dammage by us in nothing.</p>
                  <p n="10">
                     <hi>10.</hi> For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation, not to bee repented of, but the sorrow of the world worketh death.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Hee <hi>answers</hi> 3. That sadness is turned into joy, both to you and mee, because it is found now good and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to repentance; which hee proves: because it brought forth repentance not to bee repented of, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise than worldly sorrow is wont, which onely encreaseth sin and misery, and bringeth death as well to the soul as to the body.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 11.</hi> For behold, this self-same thing, that yee sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulness it wrought in you, yea what clearing of your selves, yea what indignation, yea what fear, yea what vehement desire, yea what zeal, yea what revenge: in all things yee have approved your selves to bee clear in this matter.</q>
               <p>Hee proveth that their sadness was after God, or pious, because it produced <hi>seven</hi> Effects in them, even so many signs of their repentance, whereof the <hi>first</hi> was the shaking off security, with a carefulness to mend what was amiss. 2 Is an Apology, that now by no means they approve ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the fact of the Incestuous person, or their own negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. 3 Is an indignation against the sin, both of the Ince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stuous person, and their own in suffering him. 4 Is a fear, lest they should be compassed with divine justice, or a new sin. 5 Is a desire of taking off the scandal, and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:49391:46"/>
all good men. 6. His zeal and fervent desire in prosecuting all means for the removing of evil, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing of the damage. 7. Is his revenge in chastising the incestuous person, and all their dulness; in all which the <hi>Corinthians</hi> had declared their repentance, and had shewed themselves no ways delighted with wickedness, but that they were clear.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 12.</hi> Wherefore though I wrote unto you, I did it not for his cause that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear unto you.</q>
               <p>The <hi>fourth</hi> answer to the objection is: I have not written that Epistle either only or chiefly that in chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the incestuous person, satisfaction might bee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Father with whose wife the son had committed adultery, or that the incestuous person might bee cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, (which truly was not to bee neglected) but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially for this end, that my fatherly care towards you, O <hi>Corinthians,</hi> might appear to all, sincere and approved in the sight of God.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 13.</hi> Therefore wee were comforted in your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, yea, and exceedingly the more joyed wee for the joy of <hi>Titus,</hi> because his spirit was refreshed by you all.</q>
               <p>The objection being solved, hee adds the <hi>fourth</hi> cause of his consolation; I understand, sayes hee, that yee have taken in good part my reproof, and now have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved consolation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of titus</hi>]<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The <hi>fifth</hi> cause of his consolation, because all yee have endeavoured to refresh the spirit of <hi>Titus.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 14.</hi> For if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I am not ashamed: but as wee speak all things to you in truth, even so our boasting which I made before <hi>Titus,</hi> is found a truth.</q>
               <p>The <hi>sixth</hi> cause, That yee would prove in very deed, that which I boasting of you, confidently fore-told to <hi>Titus.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 15.</hi> And his inward affection is more abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly towards you, whilst hee remembreth the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling yee recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him.</q>
               <p>The <hi>seventh</hi> cause, Because you have engaged to you by your respects and goodness, the mind of <hi>Titus,</hi> which you may esteem as great gain. For they reverenced <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> as an Evangelist, and a servant of God, sent to them extraordinarily, and so they had reconciled the mind of <hi>Titus</hi> to themselves.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 16.</hi> I rejoyce therefore, that I have confidence in you in all things.</q>
               <p>The <hi>eighth</hi> cause of consolation, That I being incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by this experience, for the future, I may dare to promise the best things whatsoever, of you all, both to my self and others.</p>

                  </p>
               </argument>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 1.</hi> Moreover, brethren, wee do you, to wit, of the grace of God bestowed on the Churches of <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia.</hi>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. From the example of the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> the Churches of <hi>Macedonia</hi> have contributed: And therefore do yee the same thing, whose liberality hee commends, by <hi>nine</hi> reasons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Grace</hi>] The <hi>first</hi> Reason, Because it was the gift of Gods grace, that they contributed any thing for the use of the poor Jews.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 2.</hi> How that in a great trial of affliction, the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of their joy, and their deep poverty, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded unto the riches of liberality.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 2. Because Alms was given by them in that time, when they were tried with heavy afflictions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ioy] Reason</hi> 3. Because they contributed with joy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Deep] Reason</hi> 4. Because in poverty they were liberal.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 3.</hi> For to their power, (I bear record) yea, and beyond their power, they were willing of themselves.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 5. Because they were willing to give more bountifully, than they were able.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 4.</hi> Praying us with much intreaty, that wee would receive the gift, and take upon us the fellowship of the Ministering to the Saints.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 6. Because they offered freely, not provoked by others examples, but rather were Leaders to others, lest they should bee wanting in this duty of charity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>With entreaty] Reason</hi> 7. Because they were instant in prayers, that what they gave might bee received.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fellowship] Reason</hi> 8. Because they did entreat the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, that hee together with others, would take upon them the charge of gathering and dispensing that, which they and others were about to give.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 5.</hi> And this they did, not as wee hoped, but first gave their own selves to the Lord, and unto us by the Will of God.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 9. Because beyond the Apostles expectation, they consecrated themselves and all theirs to God, and did commit themselves to the Apostle; that they might bee ruled by him in all things, according to the Will of God.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 6.</hi> Insomuch that wee desired <hi>Titus,</hi> that as hee had begun, so hee would also finish in you the same grace also.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. To a liberal contribution; Because at the entreaty of the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> I have desired <hi>Titus</hi> that hee would take care to accomplish your alms, which thing hee hath undertaken already: Therefore take yee care, lest this our labour bee in vain.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 7.</hi> Therefore (as yee abound in every thing, in faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and in all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 3. Because seeing that you excel others in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny virtues, it becometh you to do your endeavour, lest in this yee fail, or seeing that the gifts of the Spirit abound in you, the faith of miracles, the gifts of knowledge and eloquence, endeavour concerning the Salvation of the Brethren, and charity towards mee, yee must have a care, lest this gift bee found wanting to you.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 8.</hi> I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of others, and to prove the since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of your love.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 4. Because now the sincerity of your Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an love is to bee proved in the distribution of this alms, for which thing sake I exhort you diligently, at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> commanding nothing imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously: Therefore shew a proof of your liberality.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 9.</hi> For yee know the grace of our Lord Iesus Christ, that though hee was rich, yet for your sakes hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came poor, that yee through his poverty might bee rich.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 5. Christ hath made himself poor; that you might bee rich: Therefore it is meet, that for his sake yee give alms, when it is required of you.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 10.</hi> And herein I give my advice, for this is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to bee forward a year ago.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 6. Because I know it is profitable for you, both in respect of your praise, and in respect of the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing that will follow, that in this business in no wise yee bee wanting, but at length yee accomplish this collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on already begun.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 11.</hi> Now therefore perform the doing of it, that as there was a readiness to will, so there may bee a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance also out of that which you have.</p>

               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Which yee have] Argum.</hi> 8. Because nothing is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, but that which your selves may see to bee equal, for it is desired that you give according to your abilities, out of equity, without your prejudice, a little from the poor sort, if they give with a willing mind, shall bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of God, Although they have not given much, which have it not: For if a willing mind bee not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, nothing is respected by God, how much soever is given: Therefore bee not here wanting.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 14.</hi> But by an equality: that now at this time, your abundance may bee a supply for their want, that their abundance also may bee a supply for your want, that there may bee an equality:</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 9. Because you may expect, that if there bee need, some retribution may bee made, and out of the plenty of the Churches in <hi>Iudea,</hi> your want may bee supplied, that so, that which is equal may bee done.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 15.</hi> As it is written, Hee that had gathered much, had nothing over, and hee that had gathered little, had no lack.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 10. Because it appears in the example of <hi>Manna,</hi> that no man ought to suppress his abundance with others wants, but so far equality is to bee observed, that so much as is necessary may bee wanting to none. For as it was done in the gathering of <hi>Manna,</hi> every one did measure to himself an Omer, the rest was given to those, who had gathered little, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.18, 19. so in gathering of riches, that which remaineth after your own uses, ought to bee given for the use of the poor.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 16.</hi> But thanks bee to God, which put the same earnest care into the heart of <hi>Titus</hi> for you.</p>

                     <hi>17.</hi> For indeed, hee accepted the exhortation, but being more forward, of his own accord hee went unto you.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 11. Because the faithful, the strong, and some Brethren of best fame, were stirred up by God (compare <hi>vers.</hi> 18.22.) and sent by mee to promote this whole bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness, not onely in gathering of Almes, but also in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to the hands of the poor Jews. The first of these Brethren was <hi>Titus,</hi> for whose care and willingness of mind for the perfecting of this business, hee praises God.</p>

                     <hi>Vers. 18.</hi> And wee have sent with him the Brother, whose praise is in the Gospel throughout all the Churches.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Glory] Argum.</hi> 12. Because this alms is taken into my care, and administred by mee, and others, to the glory of God, and demonstration of the willingness of your mind.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 20.</hi> Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance, which is administred by us.</p>
                  <p n="21">
                     <hi>21.</hi> Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but in the sight of men.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Hee gives the reason why hee had joyned to himself those companions, of such approved fidelity in this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of beneficence, collected for the use of the Church of <hi>Ierusalem, viz.</hi> that hee might take away the occasion of ill report from his adversaries, who might otherwise calumniate him, as if hee had diminished somewhat of the sum of money collected: And that hee might consult his reputation with all men, as hee had looked to his conscience before God, that hee might bee kept in the holy purpose of his integrity, in this business.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 22.</hi> And wee have sent with them our Brother, whom wee have oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, upon the great confidence which I have in you.</q>
               <p>Hee commends his third messenger, whether hee were <hi>Luke,</hi> or any other, it matters not, but from hence the force of the <hi>eleventh</hi> argument appears, whilst hee sayes, that hee hath sent them out of his confidence of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> liberality, such famous men that hee doth not fear, that their expectation will bee frustrated; from whence it follows, that yee ought to contribute liberally.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 23.</hi> Whether any do enquire of <hi>Titus,</hi> hee is my Partner, and fellow-helper concerning you; or our Brethren bee enquired of, they are the messengers of the Churches, and the glory of Christ.</q>
               <p>After hee hath set forth each of these messengers with his own commendation, hee commends them altogether, and especially <hi>Titus,</hi> because they are the Apostles of the Churches, <hi>i. e.</hi> assigned by the Churches for the gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his alms: And secondly, because they are the <hi>Glory of Christ,</hi> so called, because his grace did gloriously shine in them, and by them his glory was illustrated.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 24.</hi> Wherefore, shew yee to them, and before the Churches, the proof of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf.</q>
               <p>The Exhortation being repeated, hee adds <hi>Argum.</hi> 13. This liberality as it shall bee a proof of our charity, so also it shall bee the confirmation of my glorying of you no wise vainly, in the fight of those that were assigned, who in the name of the Churches being present, will behold your liberality in this business: Therefore yee ought to contribute liberally.</p>

                  <p>HEE goes forward to speak concerning the collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. There are <hi>two</hi> parts of the <hi>Chapter.</hi> In the <hi>first</hi> hee giveth the reasons why hee sent to them, <hi>three</hi> Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren assigned, <hi>where hee</hi> interposeth some arguments to perswade them to hasten the collection <hi>to verse 6.</hi> In the <hi>other</hi> hee adds more arguments to move them to give liberally, <hi>as it becomes Saints.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 1.</hi> For as touching the ministring to the Saints, it is superfluous for mee to write to you.</q>
               <p>That which belongeth to the <hi>first</hi> part, lest they should ill interpret his sending of those Messengers, as if hee should cherish a suspition of their willingness in this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness, hee sheweth, that the cause of sending his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, was not, that they should bee instructed, neither that they should bee made willing to make a collection, because for that it would have been needless to have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, at leastwise to have sent his Brethren to them.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 2.</hi> For I know the forwardness of your mind, for which I boast of you to them of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> that <hi>Achaia</hi> was ready a year ago, and your zeal hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked very many.</q>
               <p>Hee confirms his words with <hi>three</hi> Reasons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I know] Reason</hi> 1. Because hee had very well known their willingness of mind before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I boast] Reason</hi> 2. Because hee boasted of their readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Zeal] Reason</hi> 3. Because their endeavour in this busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness had provoked many to the like alacrity and zeal.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 3.</hi> Yet have I sent the Brethren, lest our boasting
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:49391:47"/>
of you should bee in vain in this behalf, that as I said, yee may bee ready.</q>
               <p>Hee propounds <hi>five</hi> true Reasons why hee sent the Brethren.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 1. That they would prepare for the more speedy conveying of their beneficence, and that now the mony gathered might bee found by the Messengers, as the Apostle had promised in their name.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lest our rejoycing] Reason</hi> 2. Lest the boasting of the Apostle concerning them should bee found in vain.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 4.</hi> Lest haply if they of <hi>Macedonia</hi> come with mee, and finde you unprepared, wee, (that wee say not, you) should bee ashamed in this same confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent boasting.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 3. Following from the former, left both you and I should bee ashamed, if you should bee found un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prepared, when I together with the <hi>Macedonians</hi> (who have heard mee glorying in your behalf) should come unto you.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 5.</hi> Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the Brethren, that they would go before unto you, and make up before hand your bounty, whereof yee had notice before, that the same might bee ready, as a matter of bounty, not of covetousness.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 4. I have sent unto you the Brethren, that you may bee assisted in your gathering the money by the Brethren, whereby all things may bee more ready.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Not as of covetousness] Reason</hi> 5. I have sent unto you the Brethren, who have taken care lest any one in gathering should bee urged to contribute more than hee was willing, and lest covetousness in those that collect, or parsimonie in those that contribute, should appear, but that they which give, may give liberally and freely, and so the whole collection being liberal, may appear at my coming as a blessing.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>second</hi> part of the <hi>Chapter</hi> follows, wherein hee adds <hi>ten</hi> arguments, that they would give their alms libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, and as it becomes Saints.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. Because whosoever shall give, either no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, or not according to his ability, or not out of the purpose of his heart (which is to sow sparingly) they shall reap also sparingly, <hi>i. e.</hi> shall get either nothing, or only a temporal reward: Therefore give yee liberally.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Liberally] Argum.</hi> 2. Because they which will give li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally, and out of love (which is to sow liberally) shall have a liberal harvest: Therefore give yee libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 7.</hi> Every man according as hee purposeth in his heart, so let him give, not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.</q>
                  <p>After hee hath expounded what it is to give liberally, or to sow in blessings, (to wit, to give out of purpose of heart, not out of sadness, or out of necessity: For hee which so giveth, giveth sparingly, whatsoever hee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, and would give nothing if hee might follow the purpose of his mind.)</p>
                  <p>Hee adds <hi>Argum.</hi> 3. God loves a cheerful giver<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and consequently a sad and unwilling giver, hee neither loveth, nor approveth of, nor blesseth: Therefore give yee liberally and cheerfully.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 8.</hi> And God is able to make all grace abound to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you, that yee alwayes having all-sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 4. Is tacitly propounded in the solution of an Objection. So far bee it from you, saies hee, that you fear want, if you contribute more plentifully, that on the other side yee may rather expect that God will give you of his Grace and Power enough of temporal things, that not onely you may bee contented with your condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but also that yee might abound in every good works for the helping of others: Therefore give liberally.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 9.</hi> (As it is written, Hee hath despersed a broad: hee hath given to the poor, his Righteousness remains for ever.</q>
                  <p>Hee confirms this Argument out of <hi>Psal.</hi> 112.9. where it is spoken, that the Righteous distributeth his goods, and giveth to the poor, and his Righteousness remaineth for ever; where <hi>Argument</hi> 5. is insinuated, That it is the property of the righteous man to distribute his goods, and to give to the poor, and that the ordinary blessing of God is upon them, that hee may have further to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow: Therefore shew your selves righteous by giving liberally.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 10.</hi> Now hee that ministreth Seed to the Sower, both minister Bread for your food, and multiply your Seed sown, and increase the fruit of your righteousness.)</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 6. Included in a wish and a similitude, as God both ministreth Seed to the Husbandman after sowing, and Bread after Harvest; So hee shall both mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister fruit out of your sowing, I wish that hee might both encrease your abilities for doing good, and for the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth fruits of Righteousness and Mercy: Therefore do not you doubt to sow in the giving of this Alms.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 11.</hi> Being enriched in every thing to all boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifulness, which causeth through us thanksgiving to God.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 7. Yee being enriched by the Grace of God, and abounding in all liberality, may cause that through us, who observe your charity, thanks may bee given to God: Therefore upon this account give yee liberality.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 12.</hi> For the administration of this service, not onely supplieth the want of the Saints, but is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant also by thanksgiving unto God.</q>
                  <p>Hee confirms this Argument from this, that the office of this undertaken Ministery concerning the gathering and contributing this Alms, will not onely supply the necessities of the Saints in <hi>Iudea,</hi> but will also cause by many Saints, that thanks bee given unto God.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 13:</hi> Whilest by the experiment of this Ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they glorifie God for your professed subjection unto the Gospel of Christ, and for your liberal distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution unto them, and unto all men.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 8. This your liberality will bee a sign of your Faith, and subjection of your obedient mind unto Christ and his Gospel, as also matter of glorifying God; and lastly a sign of your liberality towards all that are poor, when occasion is given: Therefore give yee libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 14.</hi> And by their prayer for you, which long after you for the exceeding Grace of God in you.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 9. The Saints in <hi>Iudea</hi> cherished by your li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality will pray to God for you: Therefore yee ought to give liberally.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Long after you] Argum.</hi> 10. This your liberality will stir up in the holy Jews love towards you, and will che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish a desire of seeing you, and will enkindle in them no small esteem of you, by reason of that eminent Grace of God in you: Bee yee not wanting therefore in this.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 15.</hi> Thanks bee unto God for his unspeakable gift.</q>
                  <p>As now having his desire, and beholding the manifold fruit of their liberality, which by the Grace of God, it would produce upon their refreshing the Brethren in <hi>Iudea,</hi> hee thanks God for his gift in the liberality of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> which hee could not sufficiently in words de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare as it deserved.</p>

               <p>Yee ought to beware, lest by your fault I am compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to exercise my power more boldly toward some of you, when I come, as I have determined to exercise against those, who being led by fear or hope, think of us, as if wee would change our carriage like carnal and irregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate men: Therefore I am not to bee despised.</p>

Although I do not live free from humane infirmity in this frail flesh, yet in the execution of my of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and my Ministerial warfare, I have not followed carnal lusts, being led by fear or affection, as they falsly lay to my charge, when sometimes I carried my self humbly, sometimes according to the dignity of my office and authority: Therefore I am not to bee contemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 4.</hi> (For the weapons of our warfare are not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, but mighty through God, to the pulling down of strong holds.)</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 4. Confirming the former. I have no need to use carnal weapons in the subtil changing of my carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, sometimes flattering, sometimes boasting, or using any other such like evil arts, but my Spiritual Weapons (such as they are) were sufficient in the truth, boldness in the exercising of Ecclesiastical Discipline, zeal, pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, Christian fortitude, and other virtues, wherewith being armed, I do manage my warfare: Therefore I am not to bee contemned. Hee shews a <hi>threefold</hi> virtue of these weapons. 1. <hi>Virtue</hi> is, That by divine power they are sufficient for the throwing down of all the strong holds of humane wisdome, and the demolishing of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til pretences, and all counsels, with which carnal men striving against the Gospel for their errours and vices, use to defend themselves.</p>

                  <hi>Vers. 5.</hi> Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth it self against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ.</q>
               <p>The <hi>second</hi> Virtue. Hee also reaches that these Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons are mighty, as to the throwing down the pride of mans mind, and the highness of worldly knowledge, so also to the converting or subduing high wits to the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and humble submission of themselves, as captives, to Christ by Faith. Understand it concerning the Elect, and those that are ordained to Salvation.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 6.</hi> And having a readiness to revenge all disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, when your obedience is fulfilled.</q>
               <p>The <hi>third</hi> Virtue. Those Weapons of the Word of God, and Ecclesiastical censures are sufficient, &amp;c. to revenge those that rebel and are disobedient, as doing ready execution, partly in this life, partly in that which is to come; which weapons the Apostle was making rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy against his adversaries, after hee had recalled the flock of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> seduced from him, into order and obedience: for hee intended prudently to exercise the Ecclesiastical censures.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 7.</hi> Do yee look on things after the outward appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance? If any man trust to himself that hee is Christs, let him of himself think this again, that as hee is Christs, even so are wee Christs.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 5. Whereby hee proveth that hee ought not to bee contemned, because judgement ought not to bee made concerning the Apostles dignity by the external ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of humility: For the interrogation hath the force of a negative duty, and is as much as <hi>yee ought not.</hi>

               <p>That which belongeth to the first, although hee had not determined to boast, unless hol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ly and purely in the Lord, yet because at the first sight the praising of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self had the appearance of folly; therefore hee wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and asketh, that they would a little bear with him, as foolish, speaking by way of concession (otherwise in very deed the Holy Ghost did speak in the Apostle) that hee might better discover to them in this the reasons of his prudence: for because hee saw them deceived by some vain and subtil men, not without the subtilty of Satan, hee was compelled for their good to this boasting.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 2.</hi> For I am jealous over you with godly jealousie: for I have espoused you to one Husband, that I may present you a chast Virgin to Christ.</q>
               <p>Hee produceth <hi>ten</hi> reasons, whereby hee demonstrates the necessity of his boasting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because I am driven with an holy zeal in the Cause of Christ to this boasting: Therefore boast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is necessary. Hee clears this reason, because as a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranymph hee did endeavour to marry the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> not to himself, but to Christ, as a chast Virgin, and to retain them in his society.</p>
               <q>

               <p>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 2. I fear, lest as <hi>Eve</hi> was seduced by the subtilty of the Devil, so you being corrupted by the false Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, should bee moved from that Virgin-like simplicity of the Gospel of Christ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> for the Wisdome of God, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing humane wisdome, and admitting the leaven of legal ceremonies to the corrupting the Doctrine of the Gospel of grace amongst you: Therefore this my boasting is necessary.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 4.</hi> For if hee that cometh preacheth another Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, whom wee have not preached; or if yee receive another spirit, which yee have not received; or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Gospel, which yee have not accepted, yee might well bear with him.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 3. You might deservedly bear with another Thrasonical Preacher, if hee could impart unto you ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Christ, which is impossible, or more excellent gifts of the Spirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or a better Gospel than you have accepted and received by our Ministery. Truly, seeing that is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, yee ought deservedly to bear with mee an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle boasting, by whose preaching yee are made partakers both of the gifts of Christ, and his Spirit.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 5.</hi> For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest Apostles.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 4. Confirming the former; I suppose they will not deny mee to be inferiour to <hi>Peter, Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> (those Apostles who were chiefly esteemed) because the Gospel being communicated with them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. they have contributed nothing to mee. Therefore my boasting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the false Apostles is necessary and just.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 6.</hi> But though I be rude in speech, yet not in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but wee have been throughly made manifest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you in all things.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 5. Because I will not contend with those that commend themselves for their excellency of speech or eloquence; but I will give place to none in the knowledge of the mysteries of salvation, which thing hee calls the Corinthians themselves to witness, who have very well understood his knowledge.</p>

               </q>
               <p>Lest hee should seem to repent of what hee had done, he determined that he will not afterwards be chargeable to them, or will not receive wages, which hee confirms with an oath, <hi>v.</hi> 10. And lest they should take it ill, as if it was for want of love, that he would not receive wages of them, hee professes that he had thus determined, out of special love to them, calling God to Witness concerning the truth of his words, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. and that for this end, lest the false Apostles should seem to exceed him in his boasting, from whom hee would have the occasion of reproaching him, so taken away, who otherwise would say that <hi>Paul</hi> preached to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> for the encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing his substance.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 13.</hi> For such are false Apostles, deceitful workers; transforming themselves into the Apostles of Christ.</p>
                  <p n="14">

               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 7. Shewing the necessity of his boasting, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the wickedness of his Emulators did compel him to this boasting; for they did feign themselves the Apostles of Christ, and Workers in the Vineyard of God, when in the mean while they only cared for their own business, not Gods; they preached the Gospel for profits sake, and their own honour, they feigned themselves Ministers of Christ, when they did only personate Stage-players, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. neither is it to bee wondered at, seeing these decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers were the Apostles of Satan, imitating the Devil (who sometimes puts on the form of some celestial An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, that under the pretence of zeal and piety hee might beguile men) whose manners his Emulators did follow, pretending the glory of Christ, when in the mean while they sacrificed all their labour to the belly, to their purse, to their honour, nothing solicitous what became of the Apostles, what of the Churches, so that they might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their desires: To whom therefore the Apostle threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens eternal death, according to their deserts.</p>

               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 8. Because they should find that it was wisely done, that hee was necessitated to this boasting, which hee desires them to take notice of; but if as yet for the present they could not perceive the just necessity and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his boasting, at leastwise hee desires, that they would bear with him patiently a little, as foolishly boast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, until hee could finish his Speech and Apology, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. Yeelding only, but not affirming that hee foolishly boasted, or that it was un-beseeming him to God-ward: for otherwise the Apostle, with the greatest Wisdome of the Spirit, did most justly boast to the glory of God, and the benefit of the Church in this whole business.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 18.</hi> Seeing that many glorie after the flesh, I will glorie also.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 9. Because the false Apostles did falsly glory against him; therefore hee contends that it is an equal thing, that hee himself should truly boast in his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 19.</hi> For yee suffer fools gladlie, seeing yee your selves are wise.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 10. Wise men were wont to bear with those that seemed more foolish, as you know by experience: Why should yee not therefore suffer mee of necessity to boast, although herein I may seem foolish to some amongst you?</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 20.</hi> For yee suffer, if a man bring you into bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, if a man devoure you, if a man take of you, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 11. Because yee suffer more harsh things (as it appears) than this foolishness of my glorying. For (1) Yee suffer those importunate men, who bring you into <hi>bondage.</hi> Such were the false Apostles, who exercised their power over them, dividing the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> into factions, and set up themselves Captains and Lords of their Followers amongst the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> as of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers and Servants. (2) Yee suffer those which <hi>devoure</hi> you; such were the false Apostles, affecting stately ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets, and eating up the substance of the <hi>Corinthians.</hi> (3) Yee suffer <hi>spoilers</hi>; such also were the false Apostles, who would not indeed take wages, but in the mean while, they coveted gifts, and did collogue and receive them from the <hi>Corinthians.</hi> (4) Yee suffer those that contemn you; such were the false Apostles, who because of the Stock and Hebrew Nation, which they were of, and some gifts of the Spirit given to them above the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> gathered out of the illiterate and ignoble Gentiles, did above measure exalt themselves. (5) Yee suffer those that <hi>smite you on the face,</hi> or those that use you reproachfully: Why therefore should not yee suffer this may just boasting.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 21.</hi> I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak: howbeit, wherein soever any is bold, I speak foolishlie, I am bold also.</q>
               <p>Hee expounds what it is to smite on the face, that it is not to bee understood of external violence, but in respect of reproach, which in some measure hee found amongst the <hi>Corinthians</hi> from those false teachers, when the false Apostles hit the <hi>Corinthians</hi> in the teeth with the lowness of their minds, in that they subjected themselves to <hi>Paul</hi> an handicrafts man: for what else was this, but to smite the <hi>Corinthians</hi> in the face, and insult over the holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle.</p>

                     <hi>Sign</hi> 1. Of his dignity, propounded in general: that hee was inferiour to them in nothing, whatsoever they looked upon in their glorying: In the mean while hee modestly grants a shew of folly in this his glorying, which yet hee wisely prosecutes.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 22.</hi> Are they <hi>Hebrews</hi>? so am I: Are they <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi>? so am I:</q>
                  <p>The <hi>second</hi> sign of his dignity more specially laid down, that hee is worthy to bee compared to them in the Nobility of his Linage: For if hee had sought glory from a Holy Nation, hee sprung from that family which had not mixt themselves with the Gentiles; hee was an Hebrew, from Hebrew parents: if hee would glory in the Nobility of his Race, hee sprung from the more No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Israelites,</hi> because from the Tribe of <hi>Benjamin; Benjamin</hi> was the Son of <hi>Rachel,</hi> a woman free-born: but some Tribes had their original from bond-maids: If
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:49391:50"/>
they strived for the Antiquity of Religion, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in the Covenant as true <hi>Abrahamites,</hi> here also hee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was equal to any one of them.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 23.</hi> Are they Ministers of Christ? I speak as a fool, I am more: in labours more abundant; in stripes above measure; in prisons more frequent; in deaths oft:</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sign</hi> 3. If they had striven for the dignity of office, herein modestly, as one compelled, hee prefers himself be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them in respect of his Apostleship, and office granted to him extraordinarily, I am greater, saies hee, because I am an Apostle.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In labours</hi>] The <hi>fourth Sign</hi> of his dignity, is sincerity in the administration of his office. Of this his sincerity hee produces <hi>nine Testimonies. First,</hi> His labours or his diligence. <hi>Secondly,</hi> His sufferings in general, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to his health and bodily liberty, and the dangers of his life.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 24.</hi> Of the Iews five times received I forty stripes save one.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Hee produces his special sufferings from the Jews, that hee was whipped by them five times according to the number of stripes inflicted upon malefactors by the Law: for the Jews, although they are cruel, yet they would seem to contain themselves within the Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 25.3.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 25.</hi> Thrice was I beaten with Rods: once was I stoned: thrice I suffered shipwrack: a night and a day I have been in the deep.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> His sufferings from the Gentiles bear testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that by their Lictours or Sergeants hee was beaten thrice with clubs, and whips, and once stoned. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That hee thrice suffered shipwrack, in one whereof, after hee was twenty four hours tossed by the waters in the deep Sea, hee was freed by the powerful hand of God.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 26.</hi> In journying often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils by mine own Country-men, in perils by the heathen, in perils in the City, in perils in the Wilderness, in perils in the Sea, in perils a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst false Brethren.</q>
                  <p>The <hi>Sixth</hi> Testimony of his sincerity comprehends the labours of his journying, and eight kinds of dangers, which hee found in sundry places, and from divers kinds of men.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 27.</hi> In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger und thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.</q>
                  <p>The <hi>seventh</hi> hath five sorts of troubles, with which, while hee fulfilled the work of the Ministery, hee was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry often exercised, wherein being wearied, hee was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of rest forced to take in hand new labours.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 28.</hi> Besides those things which are without, that which commeth upon mee daily, the care of all the Churches.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eighthly,</hi> His unconquerable patience in daily pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick businesses, a solicitous mind for all the Churches of Christ.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 29.</hi> Who is weak, and am I not weak? who is offended, and I burn not?</q>
                  <p>The <hi>ninth Testimony</hi> of his Sincerity, is, his sympathy with all that are afflicted, and offended by any scandal.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 30.</hi> If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern my infirmities.</q>
                  <p>Hee retorts the Objection of his adversaries: But all these things have made thee a contemptible and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable man. Hee answers, that hee purposely determined to glory in these, as the things which did more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend his sincerity, than the prosperous affairs of the false Apostle, adorned them.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vers. 31.</hi> The God and Father of our Lord Iesus Christ, which is blessed for ever more, knoweth, that I lye not.</p>
                     <p n="32">

               <head>CHAP. XII.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>HEE proceeds in his holy glorying: There are <hi>three parts</hi> of the <hi>Chapter.</hi> In the <hi>first</hi> hee explains the heavenly vision presented to him, together with the events of the same. <hi>To vers. 11.</hi> In the second hee proves that the <hi>Corinthians</hi> ought to have freed him from this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of glorying, or defended him. <hi>To vers. 19.</hi> In the <hi>third</hi> hee produces the causes of his troubles.</p>
               </argument>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 1.</hi> It is not expedient for mee, doubtless, to glory, I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.</q>
               <p>The Preface being Premised (that hee doth not glory for his own sake, because that was not expedient for him, (For this is here somewhat emphatical<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>for mee</hi>) but for the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and the Churches sake, whom it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, to preserve the authority of the Apostle intire) hee commeth to extraordinary revelations, one of which hee begins historically to declare.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 2.</hi> I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, whether in the body, I cannot tell, or whether out of the body, I cannot tell, God knoweth, such an one caught up to the third heaven.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>I knew a man</hi>] Hee discovers the excellency of this revelation, and his modesty, by <hi>nine</hi> Arguments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. That hee scarcely dare publish his name in this business, but lest hee may seem to arrogate much to himself, hee is compelled to speak of himself in a third person.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In Christ] Argum.</hi> 2. That although this revelation may seem to extol him above the common condition of men, yet hee doth not affect any other excellence, than to bee in Christ, or in the number of Beleevers, who have renounced themselves, that they may glory in Christ alone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourteen] Argum.</hi> 3. That silently with himself hee had suppressed the mention of this glorious revelation whole fourteen years, never intending to recite it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less hee was compelled by the importunity of his Emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators, who endeavoured to diminish his Apostolical au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, to the damage of the Gospel and the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caught up] Argum.</hi> 4. That hee was caught up to the upper heaven, above all the Stars, to the place of the blessed Spirits, where God chiefly manifests his glory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whether in the body] Argum.</hi> 5. That hee is ignorant, whether hee was caught up by the local translation of his body into Heaven, or whether his soul extraordinarily was separated for that time, and lifted up into Heaven, concerning the other, notwithstanding, I am certain.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 3.</hi> And I knew such a man (whether in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, or out of the body, I cannot tell, God know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.)</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <hi>4.</hi> Hee was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Into Paradise] Argum.</hi> 6. That hee certainly knew the matter done, and that hee was caught up into Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise, or into that blessed seat of the Glory of God, (wherupon hee repeats the second time, <hi>I kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>w a man</hi>) and there heard ineffable words, which is not lawful for a man to utter, <hi>i. e.</hi> of whom something could not bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:49391:51"/>
other things it was not lawful for him to utter, which otherwise had hee not been prohibited, might have been uttered, for those things which were revealed, hee is certain, did belong to his private confirmation, and preparations for those conflicts hee was about to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 5.</hi> Of such an one will I glory, yet of my self I will not glory, but in my infirmities.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 7. That indeed hee was ready to boast (to the glory of God) of such a man, <hi>i. e.</hi> of himself, as the servant of God, exalted after this manner: But not concerning himself, considered in himself, for that hee had nothing in himself, in which hee might glory, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept his infirmities.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 6.</hi> For though I would desire to glory, I shall not bee a fool: For I will say the truth. But now I forbear, lest any man should think of mee above that, which hee seeth mee to bee, or that hee heareth of mee.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 8. That although hee had sufficient matter of glorying offered upon this revelation, that truly and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidly, without vanity, hee might much more glory, but hee determined as yet sparingly to speak of this matter, lest hee should stirre up too much esteem of himself.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 7.</hi> And lest I should bee exalted above measure, through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to mee a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet mee, lest I should bee exalted above measure.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 9. That the excellence of the Revelation was so great, as that hee might beware of pride, the Angel of Satan was sent for the Apostles humiliation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Thorn<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>] Hee describes the reason of his humbling so, that hee intimates three Reasons of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 1. That the matter of his humiliation, was something of the reliques of sin in his flesh, or his corrupt nature as yet not quite abolished, <hi>viz.</hi> some motion of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence, tending to his further sinning, which motion hee compares to a Thorn left in lopped wood, because it was no less troublesome to him, than a Thorn was wont to bee fastened in the foot of a travellour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Messenger] Reason</hi> 2. Of his humiliation, that this motion carried along with it a special temptation opening a way to the Devil, making way to sin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To buffet] Reason</hi> 3. This Temptation sent from the Devil doth so much the more violently solicit him to sin, that hee was compelled to implore divine assistance, lest hee should bee overcome with the Temptation: which exercise, as it is not to bee wondred at by him that reads <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. <hi>Rom.</hi> So it is to bee acknowledged the most efficacious means for the humbling of the Apostle, for hee that was wont to bear all troubles, and fights, both with his bodily and spiritual enemies couragiously, hee is heard to howl and cry out in his combate with the flesh, <hi>O wretched man that I am, who shall deliver mee, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 8.</hi> For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from mee.</q>
               <p>The humiliation of the Apostle it self follows, of which hee brings four <hi>Signs. Sign</hi> 1. That hee had ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry often prayed unto God, that hee would deliver him from the Tempter.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 9.</hi> And hee said unto mee, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon mee.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sign</hi> 2. That hee rested in the answer of God, in which hee certified him, partly of the sufficiency of his Grace, for the sustaining of his combating servant, lest hee should bee overcome by the Tempter, and for the washing away of all pollution which hee had contracted in his combate: Partly concerning the end of his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose in the exercise of his servants, which is, that by how much any servant of God is found more weak in any combate, by so much the strength of God sustaining him, might more clearly and perfectly demonstrate it self.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Most gladly] Sign</hi> 3. That a more constant frame of humility would ensue upon this combate of his, wherein hee determined to acknowledge his infirmities, and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses in all things, to this very end, that hee might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience the power of Christ dwelling in him, and so much the more apparently manifested.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 10.</hi> Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christs sake: for when I am weak, then I am strong.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sign</hi> 4. That hee had now learnt, not onely to bear all afflictions couragiously for the Gospel, which might make him more humble, but out of them to take much pleasure. Because when hee perceived himself most weak, flying to Christ, hee had experience of his more powerful presence for the sustaining and comforting him, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise making him victorious.</p>
               <div n="2" type="part">
                  <head>The second Part.</head>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 11.</hi> I am become a fool in glorying, yee have compelled mee: for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing am I behind the very chiefest Apostles, though I bee nothing.</q>
                  <p>The <hi>second</hi> part of the <hi>Chapter</hi> contains his glorying in the manifestation of his Apostleship powerfully and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely administred amongst the <hi>Corinthians</hi>: Hee clears this glorying from that folly which some might object, laying the fault upon the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> from whose neglect the necessity of the Apostles glorying did arise: For they ought to assert his dignity against the false Apostles. Hee saies, <hi>I ought to bee commended by you,</hi> or it was your part to defend mee: hee brings <hi>nine</hi> Reasons of this Proposition, and also of his glorying.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For in nothing] Reason</hi> 1. Because although the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle was nothing in himself, yet by the Grace of God hee was not inferiour to the chief Apostles, the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> being his witnesses: Therefore hee ought to bee defended and commended by them.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 12.</hi> Truly the Signs of an Apostle were wrought among you in all patience, in signs and wonders, and mighty deeds.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 2. Confirming the former. Because amongst you the signs of my Apostleship appear, partly in my patient enduring of labours, troubles and injuries, partly in the effects and signs of my Apostleship, in miracles and powerful works: Therefore I ought to bee commended by you.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 13.</hi> For what is it wherein yee were inferiour to other Churches, except it bee that I my self was not burdensome to you? forgive mee this wrong.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 3. Because the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Church is endowed with such illustrious gifts of the Holy Ghost, by my Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery, as any other Church, founded either by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Apostles, or by my self: Therefore my Ministery ought to bee defended by you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Except it bee that] Reason</hi> 4. Because his zeal in propagating the Gospel amongst them, was so great, that hee preached the Gospel to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> freely, wherein if there was any wrong, by a civil Irony hee asks pardon, intimating the benefit which was vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed to them: Therefore hee ought to bee defended by them.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 14.</hi> Behold the third time I am ready to come to you, and I will not bee burdensom to you, for I seek not yours, but you: for the Children ought not to lay up for the Parents, but the Parents for the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 5. Confirming the former. Because the Apostle was still of the same mind towards them, not to take any wages of them for the future, when hee shall come to them, for now hee prepared himself for comming the third time, although his second in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:49391:51"/>
to come was hindered, As it is 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 1.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Yours] Reason</hi> 6. Confirming the former. Because hee sought the salvation of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and not to convert their goods to his own proper use: Therefore they ought to defend him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For I seek not] Reason</hi> 7. Because although hee bee their spiritual Father, who ought to bee nourished by his folk or his children, yet hee endeavoured to imitate na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Parents, who ordinarily lay up for their children. Otherwise if the Parents bee in want, it is not to bee doubted, but children ought to do their mutual duties to their Parents, and to honour them by nourishing them.</p>
                  <q>

Which exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations hee confirms by promising the divine presence in the fuller gifts of his Grace, which God, who delights in peace and love, is wont to give to those that indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour after peace and love.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>The Grace of our Lord</hi>] After his salutation in the name of the Saints, in the end hee applies himself to them by an Apostolical benediction, and wishes further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, that there might not onely bee granted a right to all the comfortable benefits of Christ, but also an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement, a sense and more full fruition; first, of the Grace of Reconciliation made by Christ; further of his divine Love, which by Christ descends upon us: and thirdly, all sorts of gifts of the Holy Ghost, sealing, even as with his Seal, his desire and hope.</p>

                  <p>In this <hi>Chapter</hi> hee gives <hi>six</hi> signs of this matter. <hi>Sign</hi> 1.

                     <hi>Sign</hi> 3. His wonderful and free calling to the Faith and Apostleship (the history whereof is contained in <hi>Act.</hi> 9.) powerfully derived from the predestinating counsel of God, which Grace God most clearly manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted in his embassage to the Gentiles, and his providence prepared a way to the manifestation of grace in his nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and education: That hee was born of such Parents, of such a temperament and constitution of body, that hee was brought up at the feet of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> that hee was a Pharisee, that the providence of God concerning him worthy of special observation was apparent in all things, and brought it so to pass, that hee may say, that hee was prepared from the womb, and ready to preach the Gospel to the Gentiles: so that all things by the counsel of God did make for the preparation of the Apostle to this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness.</p>

Scandal also is given to the Christian Gentiles, who are compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the example of so great an Apostle, either to take upon them the yoak of Ceremonies, or renounce the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of the Apostle; what could <hi>Paul</hi> do in this case? certainly as it became him, hee resisted <hi>Peter</hi> to his face, and reproved him publickly.</p>

               <p>The reasons of his reprehension are <hi>three. Reason</hi> 1. Because hee dissembled the freeing of Christians from the yoak of <hi>Moses,</hi> for fear of the hatred of some Jews, when hee ought rather to fear, lest hee should give scandal to the Jews or Gentiles.</p>
               <q>

                  <p>From the occasion of his contention with <hi>Peter, Paul</hi> commeth to the other part of the <hi>Chapter,</hi> wherein as in the Epistle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> hee confirms that Justification is not by Works of the Law, but onely by Faith; whilst hee affirms this Doctrine, hee repeats his discourse had with <hi>Peter,</hi> that all might know, that hee had taught no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else to the <hi>Galatians</hi> than that (many faithful both of the Jews and Gentiles hearing) speaking openly for the convincing of <hi>Peter,</hi> which hee had taught before and defended, <hi>viz. wee who are Iews by Nature, &amp;c.</hi> The sense whereof is, if referred to <hi>Peter,</hi> wee who are Jews by Nature or propagation, wee are holy in Gods account by the Covenant, and not sinners, <hi>i. e.</hi> strangers from the Covenant, as the Gentiles; wee, (sayes hee) Jews and Apostles, knowing that man is not justified by the Works of the Law, but by Faith in Christ, flie by Faith to Christ to this end, that wee may bee justified by Faith, and not by the Works of the Law: Therefore the Gentiles are not to bee compelled to Judaize, and to undergo the yoak of the Law, as if they were any way under the Covenant of Works.</p>
                  <p>But if these words bee referred to the principal intent, it is a Proposition of the Doctrine, and of the same kind with that, which hee had taught the <hi>Galatians,</hi> and to which hee exhorted them to return, to this sense; wee Jews, who by the Covenant are born the holy people of God, and not strangers from the Covenant, as you Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, wee are compelled to renounce the Works of the Law in point of Justification, and to seek Righteousness through Faith in Christ: Therefore much more to bee done by you gentile <hi>Galatians:</hi> Furthermore, hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms this Doctrine in this Chapter with <hi>three</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, by the way answering Objections.</p>

                  <p>Turning his speech to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> hee solves the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries Objection; The adversaries might say, If whilst yee seek to be justified by Christ, and not by the Law or Works, yee are found sinners, as from your own confession, and your own mouth wee may judge of you, then it will be lawful for you Christians, justified by the Faith of Christ, to give your selves liberty to sin, and through you Christ will bee the Author and Minister, or the Teacher of sin, that you may sin by his authority.</p>
                  <p>Hee answers by abhorring the Objection, as blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: <hi>God forbid</hi> (sayes hee) confidently denying it to follow from the Doctrine of Justification that it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for him that is justified by Faith, to sin, or that Christ can bee said to bee the Minister or Teacher of sin.</p>

                  <p>Hee gives four reasons of his Answer; The <hi>first</hi> is this, I betaking my self to Justification by the Faith of Christ, have entred upon a sure course for the destroying of sin, because I betook my self to Christ, that hee might both forgive my sin, and administer grace to the mortification of sin: Therefore if I should again give my self up to sin, (as is objected) and build the work of the Devil in mee, I should bee contrary to my self, I should transgress the means which is now laid for the destroying of sin, and so I should bee foolish and mad, not following the Doctrine of Justification by Faith: Therefore from the Principles of Justification by Faith it is impossible, that I should abuse the Grace or Name of Christ to sin more free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 19.</hi> For I through the Law am dead to the Law, that I might live unto God.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 2. I by the strength of the Law, am slain in the death of Christ, and in respect of the Law or Legal Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant I am dead to the Law, and so set free from the Covenant of the Law, to that end, not that I should sin, but that I should live unto God, and should obey him: Therefore from the Principles of this Doctrine I cannot indulge my self to sin. The Argument is of force, for if through the Law or Covenant of Works, Christ is dead, in the place of those that are to bee justified, to this end, that they being justified should live unto God; It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, that the justified, who in Christ are dead to the Law, and would bee accounted free from the Covenant of Works, should not also acknowledge themselves bound to live unto God, and consequently, that they ought not to indulge themselves in sin.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 20.</hi> I am crucified with Christ. Nevertheless I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in mee, and the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by the Faith of the Son of God, who loved mee, and gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self for mee.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 3. Confirming the former: I being justified by Faith, am judicially united unto Christ crucified, and in him I am judicially bound to dye unto sin, to crucifie the old man: Therefore I cannot consent to sin from the principles of the Doctrine of Justification by Faith. This is the Reason, Christ our Surety on the Cross, did not onely expiate the sins of the redeemed, but also for their sakes hee promised that they should dye to sin, and cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie their corrupt nature: Therefore hee which by Faith apprehending his judicial union with Christ crucified, it is necessary also that hee acknowledge his obligation, to dye to sin, or to crucifie his old nature by the virtue of Christ.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nevertheless I live</hi>] I justified by Faith, am a new Creature, by the Spirit of Christ living in mee, so that I

live not, as to the old man, but Christ dwelling in mee useth this natural life as his Organ and Member, and Effects, that by Faith, in his strength, I may lead this life, taking care of all my affairs, that I may, as it were, bring the Spirit into obedience unto God, and that out of his same love, by which hee dyed for mee: Therefore <hi>I</hi> cannot consent to sin from the principles of justifying Faith. The force of the Argument in short is this; The Spirit quickens us that are justified by the Faith of Christ to live holily: Therefore Justification by Faith doth not give liberty to sin.</p>

                     <hi>Vers. 21.</hi> I do not frustrate the Grace of God: for if Righteousness come by the Law, then Christ is dead in vain.</q>
                  <p>The Objection is removed: The second Argument for Justification by Faith, and not by the Works of the Law followeth: If Justification bee by the Works of the Law, the Grace of God is in vain, and made of none ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; for if Justification bee by Works, it cannot bee by Grace, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.6.

               <p>Because hee knew that the minds of the <hi>Galatians</hi> were prepossessed with a false opinion, Therefore lest they should faint upon the following disputation, he by a grave objurgation shaketh them out of their drowsiness, and pricks their consciences, as it were, with <hi>four</hi> stings. For <hi>first</hi> of all hee calls them <hi>foolish</hi> and unadvised, Because they suffer themselves foulely to bee deceived, although not out of malice, yet by their own imprudence. (2) He calls them <hi>bewitched, i. e.</hi> deluded by the delusions of Impostors. (3) Hee objects to them their defection from the saving Truth of the Gospel, concerning the Grace of Christ. (4) Hee amplifies their crime from this, that Christ was so <hi>evidently preached amongst them,</hi> and his sufferings with the causes of them so clearly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, as if the whole matter (as in a painted Table) had been set before their eyes. The Preface being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, hee goes on to confirm, that Justification is by Faith, and not by the Works of the Law; in <hi>four</hi> and <hi>twenty</hi> Arguments.</p>

                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. Although some Impostors have perswaded you that the beginning of Justification is by Faith, but the accomplishment of it is to be had from Works, yet this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion is to be condemned of folly, because it is impossible, that the spiritual way of justifying by Faith, should consist with that carnal way of justifying by Works, much less, that it should take its perfection from this: Therefore wee are not justified by Works, but by Faith. Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness by Works is called flesh. (1) Because although now this kind of Justification is impossible, yet it is a common and foolish surmise of corrupt nature, that wee are justified by Works, and by the pride and vaunting of the flesh, this is every where defended. (2) Because all the Works of the unregenerate, or a man not justified by Faith, all his Works, by which hee seeks Justification, are meer <hi>flesh,</hi> or the effects of corrupt flesh, as they come from those that are not justified: It is as absurd therefore to say that a man is justified by the continual violation of the Law, or can acquire Righteousness by sinning. But as touching Works which follow Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, or the remission of sins, they cannot bee the cause of a thing already past before they were or could bee, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept you take Justification for the declaration of Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion amongst men already passed and pronounced by God.</p>

For justification before men is nothing else but the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement and declaration of justification already made by faith in the sight of God, by reason of the fruits of faith that are manifested.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 12.</hi> And the Law is not of faith: but the man that doth them, shall live in them.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 11. Proving the consequence of the former Argument: The Law or the cause of justifying by Works, doth not consist with faith, or with justification by faith, because the legal promise is of giving life to him that doth, and performeth the Law, or to him who hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect inherent righteousness. For faith bringeth righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness imputed to them that beleeve in him who justifies the ungodly, or bringeth righteousness to him, who is destitute of Righteousness from himself: Therefore if any righteousness bee given, it is given by Faith, and not by the Law, and consequently righteousness of faith is alone to bee acknowledged.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 13.</hi> Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the Law, being made a curse for us; for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 12. Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the Law, being made a curse for us upon the Cross, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going a cursed death upon the Cross for us, as it is manifest from Scripture, which declares that kinde of death, which Christ by the Counsel of God was to undergo (to wit, the hanging on a tree) cursed: Therefore justification is not by the Law, but by faith in Christ, who freed us from the curse of the Law.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 14.</hi> That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Iesus Christ; that wee might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 13. For this end Christ was made a curse, that in Christ apprehended by faith, the blessing of <hi>Abraham, i. e.</hi> Righteousness, and life eternal in the blessed seed, might appear to the Gentiles, who are destitute of works to which they may pretend to trust: Therefore justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is by faith, and not by works.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That wee might receive</hi>] Hee changes the person, and joynes himself, and the other beleeving Jews to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving Gentiles, adding <hi>Arg.</hi> 14. Christ for this end, is made a curse, that all wee beleevers being Jews and Gentiles, becoming one seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> might receive the promised Spirit of adoption by faith. Therefore the justification of all us Gentiles and Jews is by faith, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less wee affirm that Christ was frustrated of his end.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 15.</hi> Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; though it bee but a mans Covenant, yet if it bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, no man disanulleth or addeth thereto.</p>
                  <p n="16">
                     <hi>16.</hi> Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made: Hee saith not, And to thy seeds, as of many, but as of one, and to thy seed, which is Christ.</p>
                  <p n="17">
                     <hi>17.</hi> And this I say, that the Covenant that was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed before of Christ, the Law which was four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and thirty years after cannot disanul, that it should make the promise of none effect.</p>
               </q>
               <p>In these three verses is <hi>Argum.</hi> 15. confirming the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: Covenants and Agreements justly performed, even amongst men, cannot bee made void, or bee changed by superaddition, <hi>vers.</hi> 15. But a Covenant is duely made betwixt God and <hi>Abraham</hi> for the uniting all the faithful, both Jews and Gentiles, into one seed, Christ, an incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration being made of Christ the head, and all his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, into one Christ mystical, by faith, <hi>vers.</hi> 16. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Covenant cannot bee made void, nor by the superaddition of the Law bee changed, and so justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by faith shall stand. That this Argument might bee understood, <hi>vers.</hi> 15. The Apostle prevents an Objection, some might say, That the way of justifying is changed, neither is there the same reason of justifying <hi>Abraham</hi> before the Law, and his posterity, with whom the Law was made. For latter things use to derogate from former. He answers, that in a ratified Covenant, and now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by Will and Testament, nothing even amongst men can bee made void or changed, much lesse in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Covenant, now established after the manner of a Will. Furthermore <hi>vers.</hi> 16. hee assumes, that so God co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanted with <hi>Abraham</hi> concerning a blessing freely to be given to those that beleeve in Christ, that hee might take into one body his seed (which consists both of Gentiles and Jews) by the words of the Covenant: This hee proves from the words of the promise, because God said not to <hi>Seeds</hi> (as if there should bee more seeds, to wit, Gentiles asunder, and Jews asunder) but hee said to <hi>thy Seed,</hi> as of one, <hi>viz.</hi> meaning Christ, in whom the faithful both of Jews and Gentiles become <hi>one seed, i. e.</hi> one Christ mystical by faith.</p>
               <p>Lastly, <hi>vers.</hi> 17. Hee concludes that this Covenant confirmed by a sacrifice after the manner of a Will, and established by God, with relation unto Christ, could not bee made void, or of none effect by the Law, which was given four hundred and thirty years after.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Promise</hi>] Hee includes a reason why this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant could not bee changed by the Law, <hi>viz.</hi> because the <hi>Covenant</hi> is Gods <hi>absolute</hi> promise, which, as it were, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeth God promising, that he cannot change it: But the Law hath the nature of a commandement, which bindes not the Legislators, but the subject: For the Legislator can change Laws, but hee cannot change absolute pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises. Therefore the Law after so many years made, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not disanull the Covenant, or the promise absolutely made to <hi>Abraham.</hi>

               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 18.</hi> For if the inheritance bee of the Law, it is no more of promise; but God gave it to Abraham by promise.</q>
               <p>Lest any one should object that the Law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise may be conjoyned: Hee answers, and adds, <hi>Arg.</hi> 16. If the inheritance be of the Law, or works, then not of the free promise, for the one of these takes away the other; but the inheritance is freely given to <hi>Abraham</hi> by a free promise: Therefore not of the Law, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, because the inheritance, or life eternal is not of the Law, or any works, neither shall justification bee by the Law, but only by grace through faith.</p>

                     <hi>Vers. 19.</hi> Wherefore then serveth the Law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come, to whom the promise was made, and it was ordained by Angels in the hand of a Mediator.</p>

               </q>
               <p>Hee moves a question concerning the use of the Law, inquiring to what purpose the Law was made; Hee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers and adds, <hi>Arg.</hi> 17. The Law is given, that trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions might bee manifest, and held in as it were with some bridle untill Christ should come, who is the seed to whom the promise of blessing is made. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore seeing that onely the manifestation of sin cometh by the Law, justification is not by the Law, but by Christ, or by faith: And it was necessary to the manifestation of
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:49391:55"/>
sin, that the Law should bee renewed, because the Jews sinned, and yet did neither acknowledge the power of sin, nor their own impotency to obey the Law: Therefore the Law was urged, until that compleat seed arose, made up of Jews and Gentiles, united (the partition Wall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Jews and the Gentiles being thrown down) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one body with their head Christ by Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ordained] Argum.</hi> 18. A terrible manner of giving the Law, by the Ministery of Angels, and by the hand of a Messenger or Mediator, it was a sign rather of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, than of peace and concord betwixt God and men: Because a Mediatour or a Messenger useth not to bee one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of one party (seeing no man disagreeth with himself) but of parties, whereof one hath made a breach with the other; But God is one, and alwaies constant to himself: Therefore the dis-agreeing party is man, and the manner of making the Law did both signifie and argue that; This is the force of the Argument; which being granted, reconciliation is not made, but discord betwixt God and man remaineth, by that Justification is not: But the Law being given, reconciliation is not made, but dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord betwixt God and the people remaineth, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from the manner of giving the Law: Therefore Justification is not by the Law.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 21.</hi> Is the Law then against the Promises of God? God forbid: For if there had been a Law given, which could have given life, verily Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness should have been by the Law.</q>
               <p>Hee propounds another question, whether the Law is contrary to the Promise, shewing to men the contrary waies of justifying.</p>
               <p>Hee answers by denying, and adds <hi>Argum.</hi> 19. If a Law had been given, which could communicate life to sinners, and strength for the performing those things that were commanded, surely Justification had been by the Law; wee may assume; But such a Law is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther given to sinners, nor can bee, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. Therefore Justification is not by the Law.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 22.</hi> But the Scripture hath concluded all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der sin, that the Promise by Faith of Iesus Christ might bee given to them that beleeve.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 20. The Law of God, and the whole Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath concluded all men, and whatsoever commeth from man, under sin, and renders all men guilty of sin, that now nothing else can remain to man, but Faith in Jesus Christ: by which the Promise of free blessing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to all that beleeve: Therefore Justification is not by the Law, but by Faith: For if all are sinners, no man by Works, no man, but by Faith can bee saved.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 23.</hi> But before Faith came, wee were kept un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, shut unto the Faith, which should af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards bee revealed.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 21. From the end and use of external Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, before the comming of Christ in the Church of the Jews, who were daily urged under a curse to perform Obedience to the Law, according to the Covenant. They were daily instructed by the yoak and observance of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies imposed touching due Obedience to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, of their impotency to obey the Law, and of their manifold sins; they were also daily taught that they should flie to the Altar, to sacrifice, to washings, that by this Discipline they might acknowledge themselves to be sinners, and not to bee freed, but by the oblation of the Lamb of God that was to come, and by expiation in his blood, or by Faith in the promised <hi>Messias.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From hence is the Argument, wee Jews before the comming of Christ, or before the full revelation of the Doctrine of Faith come, were kept under the external Discipline of the Legal Covenant, as under a Garrison circumscribed with boundaries, that wee might not by any way turn our selves from the curse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unless unto that Faith alone which was to bee revealed, <hi>i. e</hi> to seek Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, and a blessing in the promised <hi>Messias</hi>: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee are so far from Justification by the Law, that on the otherside, by the Discipline of the Law, the ancient Church was shut up in streights, and compelled to look unto Justification alone by Faith. But the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of the Law is abused by many to a contrary end; yet this was the end of the Legal Discipline instituted by God.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 24.</hi> Wherefore the Law was our School-Master, to bring us unto Christ, that wee might bee justified by Faith.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 22. Illustrating and confirming the former, The Law or the external form of the Legal Covenant like a School-Master sent to us by God, did instruct our childish Church, and lead it by the hand to Christ, that wee might bee justified by Faith: Therefore wee are so far from Justification by the Law, that on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side, unless wee bee justified by Faith, the Law is frustrated in its end. For what else did the Law do by propounding moral Precepts, than that, (as in a Glass) it might shew to the Church how far men are distant from Righteousness? what else did Legal Promises and Threatnings speak, if thou canst not perform these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions; if now thou dost shamefully violate all those, thou art undone, and utterly lost, unless thou takest ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther course for salvation? Lastly, To the same end did the Ceremonies tend. For what purpose were Sacrifices and Washings, but that they should bee exercised in the daily meditation of their filthinesses, and deserved dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and should behold in the image of an innocent Creature killed before their eyes, the necessity of their Redemption by a <hi>Messias</hi> (who is that immaculate Lamb of God) and beleeving in him to Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 25.</hi> But after that Faith is come, wee are no longer under a School-Master.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 23. From the abolition of the external Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of the Legal Covenant, which hee intimates, <hi>vers.</hi> 23. when hee determined that the use of his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline was before the <hi>time of the Gospel,</hi> and until the <hi>time of Faith</hi>; and <hi>vers.</hi> 24. when hee compared this Discipline to a <hi>School-Master</hi> (whose office is onely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for our childish age.) The <hi>Argument</hi> is propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; After Christ was manifested, and the time of the Gospel, the time of manifesting the free Covenant, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>or the time of Faith is now come, wee are no more under the pedagogie of the Legal Covenant, or the external Discipline wherewith the Church was exercised, onely until the comming of Christ, <hi>i. e.</hi> until, and not beyond the time of Faith: Therefore wee are so far from being justified by the Law, that the whole of the external Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Discipline is now abolished under the Gospel. Hee doth not say that the Moral Law is abolished, but hee saith that that pedagogical manner of urging the Legal Covenant, together with the appendages of Ceremonies, is abolished. For although the faithful are freed from the Law, as a Covenant, or as it imports the Covenant of Works; yet they are not freed from the Law comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, or as it is the rule of manners, but rather they are obliged with a nearer and sweeter tye by the Covenant of Grace to obey the Law.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 26.</hi> For yee are all the Children of God by Faith in Christ Iesus.</q>
               <p>Hee applies the former Argument to the faithful <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> and proves them not to bee under the Legal Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dagogie, but to bee exempted from the yoak of Leviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Ceremonies, by <hi>three</hi> Reasons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 1. All yee faithful <hi>Galatians</hi> are in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Children, <hi>i. e.</hi> of those that are grown to full age, by reason of your Faith in Christ now manifested: Therefore yee are not under the childish Pedagogie of Ceremonies or Legal Discipline.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 27.</hi> For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ, have put on Christ.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 2. Confirming the former. Now Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion being made void, yee by the Sacrament of Baptism,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:49391:56"/>
have so put on Christ the Son of God, and in the presence of God, you carry the name and person of Christ, that yee may bee esteemed to bee in him, and not in your selves: Therefore yee being the Children of God grown up, are exempted from the Pedagogie of the Law.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 28.</hi> There is neither Iew nor Greek, there is neither Bond nor Free, there is neither Male no Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male: for yee are all one in Christ Iesus.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 3. Preventing a tacit Objection, and shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Gentiles have no need of Legal Ceremonies, that by those they may bee joyned, after the manner of Proselytes with the People of God. Because in the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Faith there is no difference of Nation, whether thou bee Jew or Greek; nor of condition, whether thou bee a Servant, or Free; neither whether thou bee the Male, or the Female. For all you, whosoever are indued with true Faith, do constitute, and as it were, make up one person in Christ: Therefore yee <hi>Galatians</hi> are no less children grown up, than wee Apostles, or some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther faithful Jews: Therefore yee are exempted by Christ from the childish Pedagogie of Ceremonies,
<q>
                     <hi>Vers. 29.</hi> And if yee bee Christs, then are yee <hi>Abrahams</hi> seed, and heirs according to the Promise.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Hee prevents another tacit Objection, intimating as if they could not bee the seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> any otherwise, than by a being united to the People of God by Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision, and the observation of Ceremonies, and withall, hee brings <hi>Argument</hi> 24. to prove that Justification is not by the Law, but by Faith, which may bee thus for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: They that are united by Faith to Christ, and so made that blessed seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and heirs according to the Promise, and not according to the Law, or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works, they are not justified by the Works of the Law, but by the Faith of the Promise. But yee are united to Christ, and made <hi>Abrahams</hi> seed according to the Promise, and not Heirs hereafter according to the Law: Therefore yee are not justified by the Worke of the Law, but through the Faith of the Promise.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Third</hi> Part of the Chapter follows, in which hee confirms and illustrates the whole disputation from the history of the condition of <hi>Abrahams</hi> family, in which by a typical Allegory, God hath prefigured the whole matter now disputed. The summe of which is this. God in times past prefigured, that they who seek justification by Works, or a Covenant of works, are in a servile, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable, and cursed condition, and at length shall bee cast from the face of God, and society of the Saints, they that seek justification by grace through faith in Christ, are free Sons of the family of God, and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and at length shall certainly come to an inheritance of life eternal, why therefore are you so foolish, O <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latians,</hi> that yee willingly affect this servile, miserable, and cursed way of justification sought by the works of the Law?</p>
                  <p>For this end, the Apostle in this last part of the Chapter, <hi>First</hi> of all provokes them to the Law, or to the books of <hi>Moses,</hi> that the whole question may bee decided, <hi>vers.</hi> 21. <hi>Furthermore</hi> he propounds a typical history of the condition of <hi>Abrahams</hi> family, <hi>ver.</hi> 22, 23. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> he propounds the type, and opens the mystery, <hi>vers.</hi> 24, 25, 26. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> hee confirms the exposition out of <hi>Isaiah,</hi> vers. 27. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> hee applies the allegory or type to the truly faithfull Christians, and hee comforts himself and the rest against the persecution of the false brethren, strangers to the grace of God, <hi>vers.</hi> 28, 29, 30, 31.</p>

                     <hi>Tell</hi>] That which appertaines to the first, hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves the <hi>Galatians</hi> of a double errour. The <hi>first</hi> errour is, that willingly they had affected to bee under the Law, <hi>i. e.</hi> under the legal Covenant, or the Covenant of works, whose condition is this, that thou binde thy self to the perfect fulfilling the Law, and God deals with thee according to the Covenant of the Law, <hi>that is,</hi> hee saves thee if thou offend in nothing, but doth curse and destroy thee, if thou become guilty in the least tittle of that which is written in the book of the Law, or art found in the least to turn aside from the Rule: For o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise all the faithful are under the Law, as a rule and direction of life, and they are to endeavour obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to it sincerely in all things, through grace admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred by Christ. The <hi>second</hi> errour is, That they were very ignorant both of the sense and scope of the Law, or of books that were written by <hi>Moses.</hi>

                        <hi>Vers. 22.</hi> For it is written, that Abraham had two Sons, the one by a bond-maid, the other by a free-woman.</p>

                        <hi>23.</hi> But hee who was of the bond-woman, was born after the flesh, but hee of the free-woman, was by promise.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>In the <hi>second</hi> place hee propounds from <hi>Gen.</hi> 16. &amp; 21. the typical history of <hi>Abrahams</hi> family, wherein there were two wives that were mothers, <hi>Hagar,</hi> and <hi>Sarah.</hi> The conditions of the mothers twofold, <hi>Hagar</hi> was a servant, <hi>Sarah</hi> free-born: Two Sons, <hi>Ishmael</hi> a servant of his mother a servant, <hi>Isaac</hi> free of his mother free-born; a twofold principle of their Nativity, <hi>viz.</hi> The power of nature according to the flesh eminent in the nativity of <hi>Ishmael</hi> of a young woman, and the vertue of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, or divine supernatural vertue, in the nativity of <hi>Isaac</hi> of <hi>Sarah</hi> an old woman and conspicuously barren. From hence arose the unlike disposition of <hi>Ishmael</hi> and <hi>Isaac,</hi> so great a discord, that <hi>Ishmael</hi> persecuted <hi>Isaac,</hi> and the dissimilitude of both their conditions in the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shot: <hi>Ishmael</hi> is cast out of the family, but <hi>Isaac</hi> obtains the Inheritance, by which type God did figure out the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers conditions of the visible Church sprung from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers principles and causes. For (1.) As there are two wives <hi>Hagar</hi> and <hi>Sarah,</hi> so there are two Covenants of God with men, the Covenant of works or legal, the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace, or the Evangelical. (2.) Both the wives had off-spring, so both the Covenants had their worshippers and professors as born of the Covenant. (3.) As <hi>Hagar</hi> a young woman according to nature and the flesh brought forth; but <hi>Sarah</hi> barren, and an old woman according to the power of the divine promise. So the Law or Covenant of works hath the ordinary strength of nature, or the powers of free will for its foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; But the Gospel, or Covenant of grace, hath for its foundation, the special grace of God. (4.) As <hi>Ishmael</hi> was of a servile and malicious disposition that hee would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute his brother, but <hi>Isaac</hi> indued with an ingenuous and godly disposition patiently indured persecution, so how many justiciaries so ever, seeking righteousness by works, are of a servile and perverse disposition, and they do vexe the true faithful of God. But the truly faithful, and Sons of the promise worship God with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous piety, and do suffer persecutions as it behoves them.</p>

                  <p>Hee shews the convenience of the exposition: (1.) From this, because Mount Sinai situated in <hi>Arabia,</hi> and far removed from the promised Land, was called by the Arabians and Caldeans <hi>Hagar,</hi> by the special provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God. (2.) That it had affinity with the earthly <hi>Ierusalem</hi> (as it was in the Apostles time) or with the Jewish Synagogue, which is said to bee in bondage with her children, because shee was tenacious of the Covenant of works, and continued with her Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples in a servile condition, strangers to the Redeemer, and free deliverance by him.</p>

And the Synagogue of the Jews, unfaithful and tenacious of the Covenant of Works, is represented by fruitful <hi>Hagar</hi> dwelling with her Husband. But the Church of the faithful before the comming of Christ was compared, as it were to a barren Widow, because her Husband, the Covenant of Grace, was unknown almost to all, except a few, who dispersed hither and thither, did not make a company, neither did Grace appear, but lay hid, like an Husband absent or dead under the covers of Ceremonies. The Synagogue of unbeleeving Justiciaries is compared to a fruitful Wife, dwelling with her Husband, <hi>viz.</hi> the Covenant of Works conspicuous in the external dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of the Law. And it is fore-told by the Prophet that it should come to pass, that the Church of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, made fruitful by the Promises of God, shall bring forth more children under the Gospel, than the Synagogue hath brought Servants under the Law; and therefore is commanded to rejoyce and praise God.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 28.</hi> Now wee, Brethren, as <hi>Isaac</hi> was, are the children of Promise.</q>
                  <p>In the <hi>last</hi> place hee applies this typical history, and partly admonishes the truly faithful Christians, and partly comforts them, by four Arguments.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. That wee are redeemed children justified by Faith, and truly free born, and regenerated by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Evangelical Promises to the similitude of <hi>Isaac,</hi> who is elder than those other Citizens of the heavenly <hi>Ierusalem</hi> that were after him.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 29.</hi> But as then hee hat was born after the flesh, persecuted him that was born after the Spirit.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. Of consolation, That suffering persecution by false Brethren, Patrons of free will and Righteousness by Works; were finde nothing unlike to <hi>Isaacs</hi> condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: For when in <hi>Abrahams</hi> Family, hee who is onely begotten by the ordinary strength of nature persecuted him, who is begotten by a divine and spiritual way; what wonder then, if the same now bee usual amongst us?</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 30.</hi> Nevertheless, what saith the Scripture? cast out the bond-woman and her Son: for the Son of the bond-woman, shall not bee heir with the Son of the free-woman.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 3. That the persecutors of the faithful, and Patrons of Righteousness by Works, seeing they are not set at liberty by the Son, are to bee cast out of the socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Saints, and the inheritance of life eternal; as it was figured by the sentence of God, concerning the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting <hi>Ishmael</hi> with his Mother out of the family, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding him from the inheritance that was to bee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed with <hi>Isaac.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 31.</hi> So then, Brethren, wee are not children of the bond-woman, but of the free.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 4. From the comparing of this verse with the former, that seeing wee are not children of the bond-woman, but of the free, certainly wee shall obtain an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of life eternal: which Argument with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, as it hath the virtue of consolation, so also of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, that they would not adhere to their errour in seeking Righteousness by the Works of the Law, and moreover of an exhortation, that they hold fast Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness by Grace through Faith in Christ, unless they would exclude themselves from the inheritance.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>THere are <hi>two</hi> parts of the <hi>Chapter:</hi> In the <hi>first</hi> hee goes on to urge, that shaking off the yoak of the Covenant of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>orks, and Legal Ceremonies, they may defend their Christian Liberty, <hi>to vers. 13.</hi> In the <hi>other</hi> hee gives Precepts concerning the right use of Christian Liberty, <hi>to the end.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 1.</hi> Stand fast therefore in the Liberty where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Christ hath made us free, and bee not entangled again with the yoak of bondage.</q>
               <p>The Proposition to bee confirmed in the former part, is plainly proposed under the form of an Exhortation. Yee must stand fast in the Christian Liberty, which is the scope of the former Doctrine and disputation, and it is drawn from that as the conclusion. The Arguments for the proving this Proposition are thirteen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. Liberty from the servile yoak of the Legal Covenant or Ceremonies thereof, is obtained by the blood of Christ: Therefore you must stand stedfast in that.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 2.</hi> Behold, I <hi>Paul</hi> say unto you, that if yee bee circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. Is established by an Apostolical obtesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If you bee circumcised according to the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Law, now abolished, and add but this one Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to free Justification by Christ; Christ, whom you declare by this fact an imperfect Saviour, will not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage you to salvation: Therefore you must stand fast. For if they could not be justified except they joyned Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision together with the Grace of Christ, making Christ the half of their Righteousness, they destroy the whole; making him an imperfect Saviour, they made him none at all.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 3.</hi> For I testifie again to every man that is circumcised, that hee is a debter to do the whole Law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 3. Is established by the same obtestation. The Covenant of Works being abrogated, and the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial Law now abolished, if any one returns to Circumcision, the Sacrament of initiation to this Legal Covenant, hee by this means makes himself a debtor to the whole Law, and consequently obliges himself to the curse, unless hee perfectly with his whole strength ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil the Law, which is the condition of the Covenant of Works. The matter is clear. Because, although Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision by the purpose of God to the faithful, expecting the <hi>Messias,</hi> until Christ, was a Sacrament of the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of Faith (as <hi>Abraham</hi> was circumcised) and although in the time of toleration till the clear manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station of Christian Liberty to them that were born Jews, Circumcision was accounted amongst things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different (so <hi>Timothy</hi> born of a Jewish Mother is circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised, and <hi>Titus</hi> is not) yet to all the Jews and Proselytes of the Gentiles seeking Righteousness by Works, or by the Law, Circumcision is made part of the Legal Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, or of the Obedience of the Covenant of Works, yea, and the Sacrament of that Covenant. And after this manner the false Apostles did urge Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision amongst the <hi>Galatians,</hi> to whom religious Circumcision was every way unlawful. No wonder then if hee said Christ will not profit them, if they bee cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised, because they that were circumcised, by that very fact did imbrace the Covenant of Works.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 4.</hi> Christ is become of no effect unto you, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever of you are justified by the Law: yee are fallen from Grace.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 4. Confirming the former, whosoever of you return to Circumcision, and Legal Customes abolished, seeking Justification by the Law, ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> by that same fact renounce Christ, and the Covenant of Grace, because the Covenant of Works, and the Covenant of Grace in Christ, do mutually exclude one another, neither can they consist. For if Justification is by Works, it is not by Grace, and on the contrary: Therefore yee must stand in your liberty, except you would be separated from Grace and Christ.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 5.</hi> For wee through the Spirit wait for the hope of Righteousness by Faith.</q>
               <p>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:49391:58"/>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 5. Wee Jews and Apostles that are circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, after our conversion to the faith, being taught by the Spirit, renounce the Covenant of works, and legal customes, and do expect life eternal, as the fruit of justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by Faith: you that are Gentiles by nature can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not otherwise be justified or saved, either by the Law or Circumcision: Therefore you must stand fast in your Christian liberty.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 6.</hi> For in Iesus Christ, neither Circumcision, availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but faith which worketh by love.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 6. Confirming the former. In the Kingdome of Christ, or the new state of the Church under the Covenant of Grace, the difference of circumcision and uncircumcision is taken away; that neither helps, nor hinders any thing to justification: Therefore you must stand fast in your liberty from the yoak of the Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But faith] Arg.</hi> 7. True faith alone, or that which worketh by love, without respect to circumcision or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumcision, availeth to the act of justification: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this way of justification, yee that are in the Kingdome of Christ must necessarily stand fast.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 7.</hi> Yee did run well, who did hinder you, that yee should not obey the truth?</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 8. Not long since yee ran well in the course of the truth of this Doctrine, neither can any account bee given of your falling from the truth: Therefore you must as yet go forward, and stand fast in that course.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 8.</hi> This perswasion cometh not of him that calleth you.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 9. By answering an Objection. Although perhaps yee are perswaded, that yee continue in a right way, yet that credulity and perswasion to depart from that which you have received from mee, is not from God calling you, but some other way, <hi>viz.</hi> from impostors, from your inconstancy, and from the Devil: Therefore this perswasion is to bee rejected, and yee must stand fast in the liberty.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 9.</hi> A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 10. By answering an Objection. Although it may seem that wee mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> not contend about the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of some few customes, for peace sake, and that the Jews might the more easily bee won, yet this little legal leaven, or Judaism, doth corrupt the whole since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Doctrine of faith. Therefore yee must have a care of that, and stand fast in the liberty.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 10.</hi> I have confidence in you through the Lord, that you will bee none otherwise minded, but hee that troubleth you, shall bear his judgement, whosoever he bee.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 11. Although the danger of your errour, and inconstancy, make mee suspect the event, yet love, and the constancy of Divine grace commands mee to hope better things, which whilst I behold, I am perswaded that you will return into that opinion with mee concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the casting away the yoak of the Law, and defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your liberty by faith in Christ: Therefore it is meet to satisfie my expectation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Troubleth] Argum.</hi> 12. Your seducers, who trouble your faith, at length, howsoever they are esteemed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst you, shall bee punished by God: Therefore bee yee not intangled in the same snares, but repent, and stand fast in the liberty.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 11.</hi> And I, brethren, if I yet preach Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, why do I yet suffer persecution? then is the offence of the Cross ceased.</q>
               <p>Hee refutes the calumny of his Adversaries, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces <hi>Arg.</hi> 13. Thou thy self dost teach Circumcision, because thou hast circumcised <hi>Timothy</hi>: Therefore unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedly thou dost accuse us. Hee answers by denying that hee taught Circumcision, because although hee cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised <hi>Timothy</hi> born of a Jewish mother (for the use of Ceremonies with the Jews after the yoak of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity was broken by the Decree of the Synod, for a time it was left free) yet hee never preached that Circumcision was to bee observed, but hee both admonished the Jews concerning the abolition of Ceremonies, and taught that legal Ceremonies upon no account should bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived amongst the Gentiles; which hee proves, because upon this ground hee suffered persecution by the Jews; and because the Jews were not offended at the preaching of the Gospel, or the Cross of Christ, but freely tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated the Apostle, if withall hee would promote the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of Jewish customes amongst the Gentiles.</p>
               <p>The strength of the Argument is this, I had rather suffer persecution, than preach that Circumcision is to bee joyned with the Gospel; for if I should conjoyn them, the offence of the Cross would cease, the Jews would tolerate my preaching of Christ crucified: But I dare not in the least depart from the purity of the Gospel: Therefore yee must also stand fast in that.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 12.</hi> I would they were even cut off which trouble you.</q>
               <p>At length shutting up the whole Disputation, with an Apostolical Spirit, hee both imprecates and denounces destruction to the Impostors, by whom the <hi>Galatians</hi> were deceived.</p>

                  <head>The Second Part.</head>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 13.</hi> For, Brethren, yee have been called unto li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, onely use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.</q>
                  <p>The <hi>second</hi> part of the Chapter follows, wherein the reason of his imprecation is given, <hi>viz.</hi> because the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers called them back, and drew them again under the yoak, whom God called to liberty; under the form of an exhortation, hee gives <hi>three</hi> Precepts concerning the right use of Christian liberty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Onely</hi>] 1. That bridleing the flesh, or the sinful lusts of corrupt nature (lest that being unsubdued it should draw Christian liberty into a licentiousness to sin) they may serve one another in the duties of love.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 14.</hi> For all the Law is fulfilled in one word, even in this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy self.</q>
                  <p>Hee gives <hi>two</hi> reasons of this Precept, (1.) Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Law is fulfilled in love, and not in bare cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 15.</hi> But if you bite and devour one another, take heed yee bee not consumed one of another.</q>
                  <p n="2">(2.) Because unless they follow after love, they will mutually devour and destroy one another by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 16.</hi> This I say then, walk in the Spirit, and yee shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh.</q>
                  <p>The <hi>second</hi> Precept is for the confirmation of the former, that they follow the guidance of the Holy Ghost walking as hee himself out of the Scripture hath sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested to their hearts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And that which</hi>] The reasons of the Precept are <hi>six, Reas.</hi> 1. Because so the lusts of the flesh shall not rule over you, that yee may as servants obey its commands: Therefore follow yee the guidance of the Spirit.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 17.</hi> For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh, and these are contrary the one to the other.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 2. Confirming the former, because hee that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the guidance of the Spirit, will become victorious in the contest betwixt the flesh, and the Spirit. That this reason might bee plain, the Apostle presupposes <hi>three</hi> things: (1.) Hee that is lead by the Spirit hath his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture partly renewed, which is called the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and partly corrupt, which is called the <hi>Flesh.</hi> (2.) Hee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supposes these two contrary principles with contrary en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to fight with one another, that neither good, nor evill without opposition, and a mutual impediment can
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:49391:58"/>
bee put in execution. (3.) Hee presupposes that the Holy Ghost doth help Beleevers in their striving by the Word and Grace. From whence it is concluded, that hee which hearkeneth to the Spirit, will become victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in striving.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 18.</hi> But if yee bee led by the Spirit, yee are not under the Law.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 3. Confirming the former.

               <argument>
                  <p>HEE proceeds to prescribe Christian duties to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> much more excellent than those Legal Ceremonies, and more worthy of their practice. There are <hi>two</hi> parts of the <hi>Chapter;</hi> in the <hi>first</hi> hee adds to the former Precepts, <hi>two</hi> other, <hi>to vers. 11.</hi> In the <hi>other</hi> hee compares himself with the false Apostles, and deserved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prefers himself before them, lest the <hi>Galatians</hi> by the admiration of those should bee deceived.</p>
               </argument>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 1.</hi> Brethren, if a man bee overtaken in a fault<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yee which are spiritual, restore such a one in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of meekness, considering thy self, lest thou also bee tempted.</q>
               <p>The <hi>first</hi> Precept concerning dealing gently with the Brethren, who fall through infirmity, that they bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored in the Spirit of meekness by those, who seem more confirmed in the Spirit, but hee speaks especially to the Presbyters, upon whom it lyes by duty to recall those again to repentance that are fallen into scandalls, by ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical censures, and to restore again the dis-joynted members of the Church into their place. Hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth those to use me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>kness towards them, that through infirmity are fallen back, and not to deal severe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with them, which without doubt belongs to those, who have the power of punishing sinners. There are <hi>six</hi> reasons of the Precept.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because the same may happen through a temptation to any one, even to the spiritual them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 2.</hi> Bear yee one anothers burdens, and so fulfil the Law of Christ.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 2. Because seeing that it may bee presupposed, that sinning Brethren are sorrowful and grieved for their backslidings and sins: Therefore it is fitting that sinners which are dejected and cast down, in all moderation and sympathy, should bee succoured and relieved under their burden.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And so] Reason</hi> 3. Because the Law of Love renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Christ, requireth that from us.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 3.</hi> For if a man think himself to bee something, when hee is nothing, hee deceiveth himself.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 4. Hee that despiseth others that backslide through infirmity, and thinks himself more strong, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth himself, is amongst the weakest, yea, hee is a man of no strength at all.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 4.</hi> But let every man prove his own Works, and then shall hee have rejoycing in himself alone, and not in another,</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 5. Propounded after the manner of a Precept making for the quelling of self admiration, and shunning the casting contempt upon a backsliden Brother, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause if every one would try himself, and examine his actions according to the rule of the divine Law, no man would arrogate to himself the praise of holiness from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens sins, but onely from their good actions, if hee found any of them worthy of praise. This was said a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, who never cease to aggravate another mans sin, that they may seem more holy themselves.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 5.</hi> For every man shall bear his own burden.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 6. Confirming the reason fore-going. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause every one shall give an account of his Works to God, not compared with others, but considered with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self: Therefore it is not safe to despise those that are fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into sin, and to bee lifted up against them, because in like manner thou art not fallen thy self.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 6.</hi> Let him that is taught in the Word, commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate unto him that teacheth, in all good things.</q>
               <p>The second Precept belongeth to the people, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning liberality to bee exercised towards the Ministers of the Word, that wee communicate coporal goods to them, who communicate unto us by their office spiritual things, and give themselves to this Work.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 7.</hi> Bee not deceived, God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall hee also reap.</q>
               <p>Hee gives <hi>six</hi> reasons of the Precept, which are all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to liberality in general, and do confirm the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of Liberality to Pastors the more strongly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. Supposing these, who are ingrateful towards their Teachers, to bee also niggardly and slow to every good Work, because the excuses of niggardliness, are the delusions of covetous men, with which God will not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to delude themselves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>

                  <hi>Whatsoever] Reas.</hi> 2. Because every one shall receive fruit according to his deeds, hee that hath onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and refuseth to bee thankful, shall bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded according to his ingratitude, and on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 8.</hi> For hee that soweth to his flesh, shall of the flesh reap corruption: But hee that soweth to the Spirit, shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.</q>
               <p>Hee expounds this Argument in particular: Hee that bestows his goods or substance, and his actions to the fulfilling the lusts of the flesh, hee shall of his doing reap corruption: But hee that on the contrary layeth out himself, and all for the glory of God, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting the works of the Spirit, hee shall bee graciously rewarded with eternal life.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 9.</hi> As let us not bee weary in well-doing, for in due season wee shall reap, if wee faint not.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 3. Because whatsoever may bee said concerning liberality shewed by any one already, as if enough was done by him, yet hee must know, that good things past are not sufficient, unless wee persevere in well-doing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Due] Reas.</hi> 4. Illustrating and confirming the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. Because an harvest of rewards shall certainly in due time bee to those alone that persevere in well-doing, and faint not, or bee weary.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 10.</hi> As wee have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men, especially unto them who are of the houshold of faith.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 5. Because the time of exercising well-doing is short, therefore opportunity is to bee observed, whilst life and abilities last, and to reward them when they are dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is somewhat late.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Especially] Reas.</hi> 6. The common bond of nature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth that wee should bee liberal to all that are in want: The bond of brother-hood requires charity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the houshold of faith, therefore how much more doth the bond of a flock towards their Pastor require that hee bee nourished by the milk and the fleece of the flock?</p>

                  <p>The <hi>second</hi> part of the <hi>Chapter</hi> follows, wherein af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Doctrine compared with the errour of his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries, now hee compares the Teacher with the Teachers, <hi>i. e.</hi> Himself, with the Seducers of the <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> and that for their own edification, who admired those glorious Doctors, their Seducers.</p>
                  <p>Before hee compares himself, hee premises the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of his sincere love towards the <hi>Galatians,</hi> that hee writ this so large an Epistle with his own hand, without the help of any Scribe, as a most ample testimony of his solicitousness for their salvation.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 12.</hi> As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, they constrain you to bee circumcised: onely lest they should suffer persecution for the Cross of Christ.</q>
                  <p>Hee begins his comparison, and proves the hypocrisie of his Emulators by <hi>four</hi> signs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A fair shew] Sign</hi> 1. That they study nothing more, than to carry themselves fairly before men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Onely] Sign</hi> 2. That they compel the <hi>Galatians</hi> to admit of Circumcision, not out of love, but onely lest they should suffer persecution by the Jews for the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Cross, or free justification by the death of Christ, and not by the works of the Law.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>Vers. 13. <hi>For neither they themselves who are circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised, keep the Law, but desire to have you circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised, that they may glory in your flesh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sign</hi> 3. That although they were circumcised long since, yet they little care for the observance of the Law, which they required of others.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But desire] Sign</hi> 4. That they seek occasion from the circumcision of the <hi>Galatians</hi> to glory amongst the Jews, that they had converted many Proselytes to the Law.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 14.</hi> But God forbid that I should glory, save in the Cross of our Lord Iesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto mee, and I unto the world.</q>
                  <p>In the other part of the comparison the sincerity of the Apostle is shewn, in these two things, (1.) That hee onely glories in his free Redemption by Christ crucified, and in his sufferings for the Doctrine. (2.) That hee doth not affect earthly pomp, but contemn the world (with all its pomp and glory) which persecuted and despised him, for the Doctrine of the Cross sake, and by the Cross learnt daily more and more to contemn the world.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 15.</hi> For in Christ Iesus neither Circumcision a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaileth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.</q>
                  <p>Hee gives <hi>four</hi> Reasons of his endeavour, which are so many signs of his sincerity. <hi>Reason</hi> 1. I know that in the Kingdome of Christ, neither Circumcision nor Uncircumcision is respected by God, but a new creature, <hi>i. e.</hi> I know that it is necessary, when any one is admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by faith into the Kingdome of Christ and justified, that hee should bee more and more renewed and sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, but other priviledges are of no value without new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of life: Therefore I will onely glory in the Cross of Christ.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 16.</hi> And as many as walk according to this rule, peace bee on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 2. The rule of my intention is the summe of the whole Canonical Scripture, to which as to one onely rule, or one onely Canon, the Doctrine and life of all is to bee conformable: Therefore I will only glory in the Cross of Christ, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Peace] Reas.</hi> 3. I am perswaded, that whosoever shall order their faith and life by this rule, they shall also ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>peace, i. e.</hi> a sense of their reconciliation to God, all kinde of blessings, or an accumulation of good things, and <hi>mercy,</hi> or a remedy for the purging away all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills: Therefore I will onely glory in the Cross of Christ.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Israel] Reas.</hi> 4. They are alone the true <hi>Israel</hi> of God, that follow this Rule: Therefore all things laid aside, I will onely glory in the Cross of Christ, by, &amp;c.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 17.</hi> From henceforth let no man trouble mee, for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Iesus.</q>
                  <p>After the Comparison, as a Conquerour hee tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs over his Emulators, forbidding them to make him any further work, either by gain-saying his Doctrine, or by detracting from his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, because hee bare the ensign of his Felicity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Christ, <hi>viz.</hi> the mark of a servant most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to Christ, <hi>i. e.</hi> Hee hath all the signes of an Apostle, and a faithfull Witness, clearly to bee seen in him.</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>Hee shuts up the Epistle with his accustomed seal, wishing that the Grace of Jesus Christ, manifested, beleeved, and effectual, might abide in their mindes, hearts, and whole life, that from thence they may draw consolation both in life and death, to which <hi>Amen</hi> is subjoyned as a testimony of his vote, and the faith of an Apostle, and for a seal of the truth of the precedent Doctrine.</p>

                  <p>The Preface in the <hi>two</hi> first verses, contains a direction of the Epistle, and a salutation of the <hi>Ephesians:</hi> which is very short, because hee hath not to do here with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious persons, or enemies, but with conformable and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient men, to whom it would bee sufficient briefly to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate his divine authority in writing this Epistle, and the Apostles good will towards them, and opinion of them.</p>

               <p>After the Preface follows the Thanksgiving, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Proposition to bee proved in the first part of this Chapter, which is this; That the Grace of God in Christ ought to bee celebrated with an acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Gods blessing towards us, in the whole business of the Salvation of Beleevers: For our blessing, as it hath relation to God, is nothing else but an acknowledgement that God is every way the Author of all blessing or Grace towards us.</p>
               <p>In this Proposition hee puts a difference between God the Father, and Jesus Christ the Mediator God-man, that the person and office of the Mediatour might more manifestly appear. And hee calls God the Father the God of Christ, (1) Because of that Grace, whereby the humane nature of Christ was predestinated to the perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal union with the <hi>Word,</hi> his Son. (2) Because of the Covenant of Redemption made between God and Christ the Mediatour. And then hee calls him the Father of Jesus Christ, (1) Because of the eternal Generation of the Son, by which the Father hath from all eternity com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to him his whole infinite essence. (2) Because
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:49391:60"/>
of the personal union of the assumed humane Nature, by which the Son of man is made the Son of God. The chief Arguments to prove the aforesaid Proposition are <hi>Thirteen.</hi>

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is to be blessed, or his grace is to bee celebrated by us: To this purpose, that the grace of God might appear and bee celebrated, all the words of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment tend, every one whereof breathes ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> grace. For (1.) The giver of these benefits is called God, and the Father of Jesus Christ, and by consequence the God and Father of all us which are in Christ, and that from the Covenant made between the Father and Christ concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us; and consequently our Father, who with a fatherly affection gives us all things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hath blessed</hi>] 2. The giving of these benefits is actively called the blessing of God, that is, the actual or effectual demonstration of Gods grace (according to his word) in deed towards us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hath blessed us</hi>] (3.) And here is grace. For we whom God blesseth, are by nature the sons of wrath, and liable to the curse of God, in whom there is nothing, nor can be any thing, which can deserve any good.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>With all blessing</hi>] (4.) The nature and matter of the benefits themselves includes grace; for a blessing taken passively, is nothing else but a benefit, taking its rise from meer grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Spiritual blessings</hi>] (5) Here is grace also; For the benefits which are bestowed on us before others are spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, such as have reference to the eternal salvation of the spirit or soul, which do far exceed all measure of proportion to any earthly and temporal works, which wee can perform in this body, and therefore they are of grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>All blessing</hi>] (6.) This tends to grace too<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Because <hi>every</hi> spiritual gift, which pertains to the salvation of souls, is bestowed upon us; of which gifts there is none, which flows not from the fountain of grace and blessing, and is freely given to us without any merit of ours, or respect to our works, whether they bee knowledge of God, or acknowledgement of our sin, or repentance, or faith, or any effect of faith, or any good work, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of a good work: all this is freely given by him, who blesseth us with all spiritual blessing: Therefore they are of grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In heaven</hi>] Hear is a beam of grace too, because these benefits, with which wee, above others, are blessed, are heavenly, that is, they are such as take their original from heaven, are conversant in heaven, and shall bee compleated in heaven; nor do they any wayes savour any thing of our flesh, but yet do season to us our condition on earth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In Christ</hi>] Here the whole ocean of grace is opened for all these benefits are ours in Christ, who himself is ours, and all these are made ours in him, as in the root and fountain, as in our head and common parent, before they come to us, that so they may bee derived on us by him: in whom as wee are united together, wee possess those things wee have, and <hi>in whom</hi> wee have right to those things which as yet wee have not, and <hi>by whom</hi> wee shall hereafter receive those things which remain; and as hee hath obtained all things for us, so hee keeps both them in himself for our use, and us that wee may use and enjoy them. From all, and every one of which it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that all our spiritual benefits are free and gracious, or effects of meer grace, and therefore wee ought to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the grace of God as the fountain and cause of them.</p>

                  </gap>ds of this Argument also are proofs of his free and gracious electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: For,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) Our election was of God unto life, before o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers our companions, who were in the same condition, whom God leaving and passing by chose us: Therefore wee are chosen out of grace.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) Hee chose us in Christ, as in the head who was first chosen, as in the common Parent, root and fountain of the elect. <hi>After whom</hi> wee in the consideration of dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and order, and <hi>in whom</hi> wee, as his body, members, and off-spring, are afterwards chosen in the order of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: Therefore our election is free, there being no cause of it in us, which is to bee sought for in God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) Hee chose us before the foundation of the world, that is, from eternity, before the world was, much more before any works of ours were; Hee chose us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any matter of the created world was existent, much more before any matter of our works or workings could bee existent: for hee elected us in order of nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee decreed that the world should bee. For the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of the creation of the world, was subservient as a means to bring to pass the already decreed salvation of the elect: Therefore hee chose us of grace, and not for fore-seen works.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hee chose us that wee might bee holy</hi>] (4.) Hee did not choose us because wee were holy, or because hee fore-saw that wee would bee holy, but hee chose us without any consideration of any holiness at all in us, nay hee chose us as not having holiness; to the end, that being chosen, wee should bee made holy, and should become unblameable in his sight, that is, that being consecrated to God, wee should bee by degrees truly and sincerely sanctified, and should at last bee presented fully and perfectly holy in heaven: Yea further, that being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable without spot, without wrinkle, not onely of sin, but also of all misery, wee should at length appear together before him blessed and glorious: Therefore our election is not from faith fore-seen, or works fore-seen, but of meer grace, which as it is the cause of electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, so of all holiness, and happiness, which follows election.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In love</hi>] Love or charity is meerly free, in which as hee hath chosen us, that wee should bee made holy and unblameable, so also that in that his love we should per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect this our happiness; which love God will then fully put forth, when hee shall fully consummate our holiness and happiness. And so the charity or love of God is hoth the cause of election, and the completing or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of those good things which follow election, and by consequence election is not onely of grace, but is for the perfect possession of free happiness in the sight of God.</p>

                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. Thus God of his grace hath blessed us in time, so also of grace hee hath predestinated us to the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of Sons, which was to bee obtained by Christ in his own person, according to the good pleasure of his will: Therefore wee should celebrate his grace. The parts of this reason prove the same, that the whole reason it self doth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Having predestinated us</hi>] (1.) As our election be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore time was free, so is our predestination also before ages unto life eternal, and to fit means, which should bee effectual to bring us to that end: Therefore predestina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is free, in that it doth not onely assign the end and persons, but also appoints the means by which wee must attain that end.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Unto the adoption of children</hi>] (2.) Here also the Apostle manifests the grace of God. Wee are predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:49391:60"/>
not because wee are fore-seen as Sons, but that being not as yet Sons, wee should by Grace attain the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption of Sons. Now the Adoption of Sons includes these <hi>four</hi> things. (1) An effectual Calling, or Faith to imbrace the offered communion with Christ the onely begotten Son. (2) A towardliness and good disposition of Sons, or the renovation of our nature, that wee might love God as our Father. (3) The dignity and honour of Sons. (4) The Riches or Inheri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>By Christ</hi>] (3) And this doth make much for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of Grace: Wee are predestinated that wee may obtain the Adoption of Children <hi>by Iesus Christ,</hi> who is the first-begotten, and onely-begotten Son, that by his merit and efficacy wee might obtain all the fore-said degrees of Adoption: Therefore our predestination is from meer Grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To himself</hi>] (4) That Grace might appear, he shews the end of Adoption. God hath predestinated us that wee should obtain the Adoption of Children by Christ to <hi>himself,</hi> or <hi>to his use, viz.</hi> to the honour of him that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destinateth, or of Christ by whom hee communicates to us Grace, and the Glory of the Sons of God: Therefore our predestination is free, for otherwise honour would not accrew to God or Christ by our Adoption.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>According to the good pleasure of his Will</hi>] (5) Here hee excludes all causes besides God, and makes the Grace of God the onely cause. For hee predestinated us according to the good pleasure of his Will: Therefore onely Gods Grace, onely his Will, onely his good pleasure is the cause of our predestination, and not any work of ours.</p>

                  <hi>Of the Glory of</hi>] Words of this Nature have an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phasis; for (1) This Grace hath glory in it self, that is, it is every way glorious, and most worthy in it self that wee should highly esteem it, acknowledge and publish it, because who is most great and most good hath vouchsafed to advance us, who are most vile and most unworthy, unto the dignity of sons, &amp; the riches of the inheritance of sons.</p>
               <p>

In this Grace whereby God hath chosen and predestinated us to holiness and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, I say, in this very Grace hee hath made us wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come and acceptable to himself, in his beloved Son: Therefore wee should celebrate this Grace of God. In which reason hee intimates <hi>four</hi> things. (1) That God did of his Grace intend our salvation in election and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destination, and doth actually and in deed begin to put forth, and exercise Grace in our effectual Vocation to Faith. (2) That Christ not onely as Son, but as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour undertaking for us, and paying the price of our Redemption for us, is beloved and accepted with God, in whom the Father is fully satisfied and pleased, as one in our stead. (3) In him, and by him sin is removed, which might hinder the course of Grace towards us. (4) Hee intimates, that by Christ and in Christ, the cloud of sin being dissolved, the Grace of God shines up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, and wee are embraced and entertained, as reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, as now pleasing and acceptable in Christ, who a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>In whom</hi>] (2) Christ alone redeemed us without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny merit or help from us, the price of our salvation being both covenanted for, and paid by himself alone; lest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny praise should bee given to any thing besides his Grace.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>The forgiveness</hi>] (4) The Blood of Christ is that which procures for us in particular the pardon of our sins, in which wee lay polluted, and which was all the riches God saw in us, wee being void of every good work, that the Grace of God might bee more apparent in our sins and unworthiness.</p>

                  <hi>The Mystery</hi>] (1) The Will of God touching the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness of Salvation to bee accomplished by Christ, was a secret Mystery sealed up from all eternity in the breast of God, which neither Angels nor men could ever have brought to light, but that God out of his Grace revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it.</p>

                  <hi>Having made known</hi>] (2) God took care not onely that this Mystery should bee revealed, but out of his Grace, hee provided that the blindness, both of our minds and hearts being taken away, wee should understand it.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Good pleasure</hi>] (4) God freely brought this to pass, not being induced or excited thereunto by any external cause, but according to his good pleasure, or gracious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destination, and his eternal purpose in himself: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee ought deservedly to give praise to Gods Grace.</p>

The several particulars in this Argument confirm the same also.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the dispensation</hi>] (1) The Grace of God is to bee acknowledged, because here is an oeconomy, or, as the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of a Family, a free disposing of his domestick things, whereby every one orders them as hee pleases; which li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, as it is by right to bee granted to every houshol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, so to God also, that hee may act according to his own pleasure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The fulness</hi>] (2) There is a mature and fit opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of time, in which it is in Gods power alone to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, what and how much of his secret Will it is fitting to reveal to every age, and to each man. And therefore whatsoever and how much soever is revealed to us, it is of Grace. For the good pleasure of God which hee had purposed in himself, of which <hi>vers.</hi> 9. belongs to this ordering of the time: Therefore his Grace deserves here also to bee taken notice of.</p>

                  <hi>That hee might gather] Argum.</hi> 10. The gathering, and manifestation of this gathering the elect and redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together, into Christ their Head, otherwise wandring and separated from God, is the summe and end of the revealed Mystery: Therefore wee ought to render praise to Gods Grace, by which wee are gathered together as well as others. It is true that by the sin of Angels and Men, the whole world, like a mangled and almost dead body (whose members are pulled asunder, and torn one from another) was almost brought to destruction: but Christ confirmed the Elect Angels, and stayed the perishing world; but here the Apostle chiefly respects the restoring of elect men, whereby Christ reconciled the men gathered to him, unto God, and compacted as it were into one Kingdome the elect Angels and spirits of just men in Heaven, the Jews and Gentiles in Earth; with a most strict union amongst themselves.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 11.</hi> In whom also wee have obtained an Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, being predestinated according to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of him who worketh all things according to the counsel of his own Will.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 11. Applying it to the Jews. The Inheritance of eternal life in Christ is given to us elect Jews, not of works, or is it gotten by the power of our free will, but is bestowed by divine order and dispensation upon us, who are predestinated according to the purpose of God, who worketh all things according to the counsel of his will: Therefore wee Jews and all others ought to give praise to Gods Grace. These things make for the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wee have obtained an Inheritance</hi>] (1) Eternal life, or glorification is an Inheritance, which wee have not procured to our selves, but have attained to it by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine appointment and dispensation.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) Wee are not able of our selves so much as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this Inheritance, when offered to us; nor can wee so much as take possession of this Inheritance, though it bee setled on us; but wee are made possessors of it, by appointment, for <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> is a passive: What then is here which is ours, and is not of Grace?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Being predestinated</hi>] (3) Wee were predestinated by God, that wee should bee called to this Inheritance: God did not take us into counsel with him, when hee decreed our happiness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Worketh</hi>] (4) God who predestinated us to this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, worketh all things, not alone by preparing this happiness for us, nor onely by framing and fitting us for it, but also by effectually ordering all those means which should conduce to the bringing of us into the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>After the counsel</hi>] (5) Nor doth God go out of himself, to seek causes of his purpose, or of his opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but hee works all things after his counsel, or after his free and most wise will: Therefore our glorification or salvation is of Grace, and not of Works, nor from the choice of our free will; for that our will is carryed to the choice of good and of life, and that wee perform any good works, is of the meer, free, good pleasure of God, who worketh all good things after the counsel of his Will: Therefore Grace is praise-worthy.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 12.</hi> That wee should be to the Praise of his Glory, who first trusted in Christ.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 12. From the last end of the Calling of the Predestinated Jews, unto the possession of this Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. As God hath performed this Grace to us elected Jews, that first, or that before the Gentiles, wee should beleeve in Christ to come, and also that wee should first beleeve in him present or already come; so according to the prerogative which by grace is granted to our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, hee hath chosen us first into the right of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Inheritance, to the end that hee might obtain the glory of his Grace in us and from us: Therefore wee Jews and all others deservedly ought to bless and adore God, and to give praise unto his Grace.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 13.</hi> In whom yee also trusted after that yee heard the Word of Truth, the Gospel of your Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: in whom also after that yee beleeved, yee were sealed with the holy Spirit of Promise.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 13. This is applied to the Gentils, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to the <hi>Ephesians.</hi> You Gentiles also, lately strangers to the Common-wealth of <hi>Israel,</hi> are now called and chosen into the right of this Inheritance, to the same end, <hi>viz.</hi> the praise of the glorious Grace of God: Therefore both you Gentiles, and wee, should joyn together to declare and set forth the Grace of God. Now hee proves that the <hi>Ephesians</hi> were made partakers of this Inheritance as well as the Jews, by <hi>six</hi> Reasons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Yee trusted] Reason</hi> 1. Yee have beleeved in Christ,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:49391:62"/>
Therefore yee are made partakers of this inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Heard] Reas.</hi> 2. God hath sent the word of his truth, or saving Gospel to you, that hearing yee should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve and obtain salvation: Therefore you are not now as of old, like Proselytes, but had in equal honour with the Jews, you do partake of the same inheritance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sealed] Reas.</hi> 3. Taken from the pledge and earnest of salvation, given them, and from its first use. After that yee had beleeved, yee were sealed as peculiar ones to God, by the gift of the Holy Ghost: Therefore you are partakers of the same inheritance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of promise] Reas.</hi> 4. From the other use of sealing. The promises of the inheritance are sealed to you by the promised Spirit, who confirms the promises to beleevers. Therefore you also, &amp;c.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 14.</hi> Which is the earnest of our inheritance, untill the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 5. From the third use of sealing, or of the pledge of salvation given to us. The gift of the Holy Ghost is the earnest of our inheritance, to wit, the pledge and part of our happiness which shall bee consummate hereafter: Therefore, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Untill the Redemption] Reas.</hi> 6. From the fourth use of sealing. The Spirit shall remain with you for your comfort, and not depart from you untill the covenanted Redemption bee fully perfected and compleated, in an absolute freedome of your souls and bodies from all the bonds of sin and misery: Therefore you have a right unto this inheritance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To the praise</hi>] In the last place hee shews us that the end of all these benefits is the praise of Gods glorious grace, that God should bee blessed and acknowledged, and his grace have the praise in all the fore-mentioned particulars, <hi>viz.</hi> in our Election, Predestination, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, Vocation, Donation of Faith, remission of sins, Adoption, gathering unto Christ, and fellowship with his people, participation of the inheritance, and sealing by the holy Ghost.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 15.</hi> Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Iesus, and love unto all the Saints,</q>
               <p>The Apostle proceeds to the second part of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, where hee endeavours to strengthen the <hi>Ephesians</hi> faith; the proposition to bee confirmed may bee taken into this sense, in this or the like Rule; you <hi>Ephesians</hi> ought to bee confirmed in the faith of the Gospel. The Arguments to prove this proposition are <hi>Fifteen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Faith in] Argum.</hi> 1. Your faith in Jesus Christ is not that dead and hypocritical faith, but the lively faith effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually working by charity towards all Saints, and openly manifested to mee an Apostle, and others: Therefore you <hi>Ephesians</hi> should bee confirmed in the faith.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 16.</hi> Cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. You are esteemed worthy that thanks should bee daily given unto God for you, even as I do: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you ought to bee strengthened in the faith of the Gospel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mention] Argum.</hi> 3. Because the sincerity of your faith is manifested in the love of the Saints, I continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally keep you in my memory, and make daily mention of you in my prayers, begging that the work of God may bee perfected in you, and your faith confirmed: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unless you think the motion of the Spirit in mee, who pray for you, bee in vain, you ought to have your faith strengthened.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 17.</hi> That the God of our Lord Iesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the Spirit of Wisdome and Revelation, in the knowledge of him.</q>
               <p>Now hee comes to set down the summe of his prayers which hee put up for them, wherein are contained the other Arguments for the confirmation of their faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Give unto you] Arg.</hi> 4. In praying that God would give them the Spirit of Wisdome and Revelation, hee intimates that they have more and greater causes (<hi>viz.</hi> in the Scripture, which is the fountain of Wisdome, and the summe of saving Revelation) for the confirmation of their faith, than they did yet understand. You have such and so many Arguments in Scripture for your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation in faith, that I cannot wish any thing more to the strengthening of faith, than a larger measure of the working of the Spirit of God, that having more wisdome given you, and the mysteries of the word being more clearly disclosed to you, you may know what is the mind of God and Christ towards you: Therefore even from this my evidence and prayer for you, you ought to bee confirmed in the faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The God of our Lord] Arg.</hi> 5. Drawn from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of God, of whom this gift is craved. God who bestows the Spirit of faith, or of wisdome on the Saints, is the glorious God and Father of our Lord, and of all us the servants of Christ, who both out of Covenant, as hee is our God, and out of fatherly affection, as hee is our Father, will give the Spirit of faith to you, upon our request for it: Therefore even from those relations which pass between God, Christ, and you, you should bee strengthened in faith.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 18.</hi> The eyes of your understanding being inlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; that yee may know what is the hope of his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and what the riches of the glory of his inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance in the Saints.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 6. It is not possible that I should express with tongue, what and how great those good things, which God by calling you to Christ hath commanded you to hope for, or how glorious the riches of that inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance are, which is prepared for you in the sanctuary of heaven, I only beg, that your eyes may bee inlightned, that yee may apprehend them: Therefore, &amp;c.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 19.</hi> And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward; who beleeve, according to the working of his mighty power.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 7. That power of God is unspeakable, which hee hath put forth into act in the converting you to, and in thus long upholding you in the faith, and which hee hath in a manner bound himself that hee will put forth, that so by the infinite power and efficacy of his strength, beleevers may bee carried on to salvation, I onely pray for the illumination of your eyes, that yee may know it: Therefore, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This Argument hee confirms by a threefold compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: (1.) Of the power of God with the adversaries power, and with the <hi>Ephesians</hi> weakness, in which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect hee calls the greatness of that power <hi>super-excellent,</hi> which was actually apparent in them, that they might know there was no power in Satan, the world, sin, death, or any other hindrance without them, which the greatness of the power of God doth not, and will not for ever overcome. (2.) Of the powerful work of God in their conversion, with the original of that work, that is, Gods Omnipotency, in which respect hee makes mention of the efficacy, or working of his mighty power, that they might know the work of God in converting them, and induing them with faith and holiness, was such a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation of that working, which proceeds from the actual and exerted power of the Omnipotent God, as was suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Omnipotency, and becoming an Omnipotent God, in a word, it was a work very well befitting God. (3.) Of the power of God, now actually declared in their conversion, with that power which God had shewn in raising Christ from the dead. (1.) That they might know that as a great power was required to a mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, regeneration, and endowment with faith, and other saving graces, as to revive one dead and buried. (2.) That they might know the very same power was exercised in our conversion, as in Christs Resurrection. (3.) That they might understand, it was no less easie for
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:49391:63"/>
God to bring to pass all other things which pertained to the perfecting of our salvation, than it was for him to perform the fore-mentioned particulars.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 20.</hi> Which hee wrought in Christ when hee raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in heavenly places,</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 8. Taken from the raising up of Christ our Head. Christ our Head who was killed in our stead, God raised from the dead, in our stead, and for our good, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to eternal life: Therefore you who are his members, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the midst of afflictions, and in death it self, should bee stedfast in Faith touching your deliverance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And set him] Argum.</hi> 9. From Christs ascension and sitting at the right hand of the Father. Christ our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer is ascended into Heaven, and reigns with the Father, being partner in that great authority, that hee might take us into fellowship in that happiness, and make us partners of that condition in which hee is: Therefore you ought to bee confirmed in the Faith and hope of your future glorification in Heaven, unless you imagine Christs dominion is to no purpose.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 21.</hi> Far above all Principality and Power, and Might, and Dominion, and every name that is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, not onely in this world, but also in that which is to come.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 10. Christ even in his flesh is exalted far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, both Angels and Men, so that nothing should bee so high, so powerful, so excellent, either in the earth, this present world, or in Heaven, the world to come, as that Christ should not bee infinitely higher even as hee is man; and therefore there is not any thing wanting in him to the perfecting, nor can any thing oppose him to hinder him from perfecting our salvation: Therefore you should bee strengthened in the Faith of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 22.</hi> And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to bee the Head over all things to the Church.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 11. All our enemies, the Devil, the wicked in the world, Persecutors, Hereticks and Impostors, the power of sin in us, prisons, banishments, all kinds of death are put under Christs feet, that hee may order them and dispose of them to our good, and put them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our feet: Therefore, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Head] Argum.</hi> 12. Christ is appointed Head o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all things in the Church, that is, the Father hath committed the full power and administration of all things unto him, that hee onely should bee the most near Head of the Catholick Church, for the illumination of the Church and all its members, for the vivification, exciting to all spiritual duties, and preservation of spiritual life in them, by the immediate presence and operation of his Spirit in the whole Church, and its several members: Therefore unless you will doubt of your Heads Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, Power, and Faithfulness in his office, you should bee strengthened in Faith.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 23.</hi> Which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 13. The Church is the mystical body of Christ, and all beleevers are his members: Therefore you should not doubt but hee will look to, and have a care of your salvation, unless you will deny that Beleevers are his members.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The fulness] Argum.</hi> 14. The Church is the fulness of Christ, so far as hee is its mystical Head, so that hee doth not judge himself to bee perfected, and completed, till all and every of the Elect bee gathered into one, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him, have attained that full encrease suitable to, and appointed for every member, and till at last they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy with him a plenary happiness: Therefore you should bee as sure of the perfecting of your salvation, as you are that Christ will not suffer himself to bee incompleat, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect and maimed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Filleth] Argum.</hi> 15. Christ filleth all in all, that is, according to every Creatures capacity, as hee is the God of Nature, hee works all things, as hee is the Head of the Church hee perfects all things which belong to the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Life, Sanctification and Salvation of Beleevers, filling all his members by degrees: Therefore it is not to bee questioned, but hee will accomplish the begun work of Faith, Sanctification and Salvation in you. This, that <hi>hee filleth all in all,</hi> is adjoyned by way of correction or exposition to the former phrase of <hi>the fulness of Christ,</hi> by the Church, lest wee should conceive that Christs or our perfection depends upon any besides himself, who of his own free love hath brought this necessity upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, of communicating himself to us unworthy wretches, who stirred up this desire of us in himself; who himself hath the power to satisfie this his own desire, and who by degrees fulfills his desire of sanctifying us, and induing us with Faith, and will proceed to fulfil it, till hee hath performed all things necessary to the perfecting of salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that in all the faithful, the greatest and least: To him bee the glory of his Grace, his power, and his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy for ever and ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

If you, O <hi>Ephesians,</hi> are considered in the common State of Nature, you will bee found to have been in that condition, that you could not have recovered thence but by Grace. There are <hi>seven</hi> parts of this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, every one whereof heightens our first misery, and proves Grace to bee the onely cause of salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dead</hi>] (1) In the State of Nature you were not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defiled with, but dead in sin; and not onely judicially dead, because guilty of, or liable to death, but also real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in effect spiritually dead, so that the dead could as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily raise themselves to life, or perform actions of being, as you could free your selves from this death, or do any good deed: Therefore you are saved by Grace.</p>

                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 3. In the instant of our Redemption by Christ, and Regeneration by the Spirit of Christ, wee as dead in sins were quickned together with Christ, that is, in Christ, and by Christ: Therefore wee are saved by grace; For it is of grace that in the Covenant made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and the Mediator, wee who were dead in sins, were given to the Son the appointed Redeemer, that by him we might be restored to life. It is of grace that in the payment of the agreed-upon price of our Redemption, life in Christ (who was raised from the dead) should be adjudged to bee given to us. It is of Grace that in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of Redemption, and in the moment of Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, life should bee communicated to us in, and from Christ, that together with other Saints wee should bee grafted into Christ, enjoy the common spiritual life with them, and thrive and waxe stronger in him; For which reasons our life ever depends on the life of Christ, and coupled with it in an indissoluble knot.</p>

God in Christ, who was raised up, hath raised us up also, and in Christ who is placed in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, hath placed us together with him: Therefore hee hath saved us of his grace. For as whatever Christ ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did or suffered in our name and place is reckoned ours in Gods account, so what ever Christ received in our name and place is reckoned ours also: Therefore in the Resurrection of Christ, by the Covenant of Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Redeemed did also rise with him judicially, or in a judicial way. In Christs ascension into heaven, the Redeemed judicially ascend with him; In Christs sitting, or glorious possession of eternal life, the Redeemed in a judicial way do sit, and are placed with him. This right is obtained for beleevers, by Christ before faith bee actually given: but in conversion this right before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by faith by a special act is applied to us, that as Christ ascending might say from the Covenant made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and the Mediator, or from the Covenant of Redemption, I ascend in the name of the Redeemed, for whom I have gotten this right that they may bee rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned to ascend in mee; so those that flye to, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in Christ may say, now I have gotten right, from the Covenant of salvation made by the Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Christ and the Church, that I may reckon the Resurrection of Christ rightfully mine, I may reckon the ascension of Christ rightfully mine, and so in the rest. What abundance of grace is here?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 5. The end for which wee lost sinners both Jews and Gentiles, even after wee have so wickedly led our lives, should have salvation bestowed upon us in Christ, is, that those which shall live in after-ages may see, and acknowledge the superabounding grace of God; and that by our example they may learn to come unto God who is the fountain of salvation in Christ, that they also might in like manner, though most unworthy, obtain Grace: Therefore you are saved onely by Grace.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 8.</hi> For by Grace are yee saved, through faith, and that not of your selves, it is the gift of God.</q>
               <p>Hee repeats the proposition to bee proved in the very terms, and adds <hi>Arg.</hi> 6. Yee are saved by faith, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by Grace: for faith disclaimes our merits, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies only upon the free and gracious promise of God, and that God hath appointed faith to bee an instrument of our salvation (the nature whereof requires that forsaking our own works and strength, our own wisdome and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, wee should go out of our selves, and seek salvation in God) is also of Grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is the gift] Arg.</hi> 7. Neither our salvation, nor our faith is from our selves, or our own natural strength, but like as salvation so is faith the free gift of God: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee are saved by Grace. For when the Spirit of God begins to work conversion in us, it findes us dead in sins, and unless wee are quickned by him, wee cannot contribute any thing to our own regeneration or salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; nay wee are not able so much as to act faith on the promises of God, unless faith, and the act of this faith bee granted us from above.</p>

So far as wee are regenerated, so far as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with spiritual life, wee are grafted into Christ, wee are the work of God, and a new creature, being anew created by the power of God alone, before wee are able to do any good work: Therefore wee are not saved by the merit of works, but by meer Grace.</p>

The end of these prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red good works is, that being quickned, and planted into Christ, and new born, and justified, and having got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a full right to obtain Righteousness and Salvation in Christ, wee should walk in them, as in the Royal way and rode to the possession of salvation, already bought

               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 11.</hi> Wherefore remember, that yee being in time passed Gentiles in the flesh, who are called uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision by that which is called circumcision in the flesh made by the hands,</q>

                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 14. Which contains an amplification of Grace towards the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> in respect of their former condition in Gentilisme. If you <hi>Ephesians</hi> bee conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in your special estate, as yee were Gentiles, your condition will appear so miserable and deplorable, that you could not bee otherwise delivered from it, than by Grace: Therefore the very changing of your condition will evidently shew that your salvation is of Grace. Hee sets forth this miserable state in these <hi>eight</hi> things. (1) They were in the <hi>flesh,</hi> living after the <hi>flesh,</hi> so that they could not please God. (2) They were <hi>uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised,</hi> that is, had in reproach by the Jews, who boasted in an external circumcision made with hands.</p>

                  <hi>Vers. 12.</hi> That at that time yee were without Christ, being Aliens from the Common-wealth of <hi>Israel,</hi> and strangers from the Covenants of Promise, having no hope, and without God in the world.</q>
               <p n="3">(3) They were without Christ, or destitute of all actual communion with Christ in the Spirit. (4) <hi>Aliens</hi> from the Common-wealth of <hi>Israel,</hi> that is, without the Church of God. (5) Strangers from the <hi>Covenants</hi> of <hi>Promise,</hi> that is, from all right to apply unto themselves the Covenants and Promises of God. (6) They were without any certain hope of future good. (7) They were <hi>without</hi> the true <hi>God,</hi> that is, without his knowledge and worship. (8) They were <hi>worldly,</hi> or a part of the world, which wallows in sin, and which is the Kingdome of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan: Therefore that yee are delivered from this so mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable a condition, cannot bee any thing else but of Grace.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 15. If the happiness of this present state were compared with the former state, it would bee found to bee so great, that it could proceed from nothing but Grace. There are <hi>eight</hi> parts of this Argument, every one whereof hath the same tendency. (1) The <hi>Ephesians</hi> who were far off from the Covenant and from the Church and its priviledges, are now <hi>made nigh,</hi> their way unto the Covenant, and to the Church, being laid open, which benefit hath for its meritorious cause the <hi>blood of Christ,</hi> for its instrumental, Faith, whereby they are implanted into Christ, and consequently it is of Grace.</p>

               <p n="2">(2) Christ hath <hi>reconciled</hi> the <hi>Gentiles</hi> and <hi>Iews to</hi> one another; hee is a peaceable Mediatour, and the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cause of Peace; hee hath joyned both his people into one body; hee took away the Ceremonial Law, which as a body or partition-wall, did divide betwixt Jews and Gentiles, and was a cause of enmity, by his suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in the flesh, hee hath procured this Peace: And are not all these of Grace?</p>

               <p n="3">(3) This is propounded more specially, and in express words; Christ hath abrogated the Law of Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, consisting in Ordinances, that is the positive Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial Law, which was fulfilled by his comming; thus that Law being taken away, which stirred up enmity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two people, hee joyned them both, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled, to one another, as one new man in himself the common head, making one mystical Christ, or joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Jews and Gentiles as the members of one mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal body, into one body, hee himself being the Head thereof.

               <p n="4">(4) Here hee brings another end of the abolished Law, that hee might reconcile in this his own body, not onely both people to one another, but unto God, paying the price of their Redemption from their sins by the death of the Cross, and removing the enmities between God and his redeemed people by his own death: Here Grace also is very conspicuous.</p>

               <p n="5">(5) Here hee declares how this Peace was made known to the world, <hi>viz.</hi> in the preaching of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel by Jesus Christ, who as hee was the Author of Peace, so hee was the first publisher of this Peace in the Gospel, to the consolation and salvation of the Jews (who were called such as were <hi>nigh,</hi> because of the Covenant) and to the salvation of the Gentiles (who were called <hi>Aliens,</hi> because they were <hi>strangers</hi> to the <hi>Covenant.</hi>) Here also Grace shews it self.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 18.</hi> For through him wee both have an access by one Spirit unto the Father.</q>
               <p n="6">(6) Here hee gives the reason why this Peace was preach'd to both, because the price being paid by one Christ, there is one way and access opened to both Jews and Gentiles, that Gentiles as well as Jews might call upon one Father through one Spirit; and therefore Peace was preach'd to Jews and Gentiles. Here is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Grace.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 19.</hi> Now therefore wee are no more strangers and forreigners, but fellow-Citizens with the Saints, and of the houshold of God:</q>
               <p n="7">(7) In this hee gathers by way of a Corolary, that the <hi>Ephesians</hi> are now no more guests or strangers, but Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens of the City of the Saints, and of the family of God, which also is the priviledge of all us that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve.</p>

And here is a graphical description of the Church in its likeness to a Temple; the parts whereof are three. (1) The Church is like to the Temple of God, whose foundation is Christ, not onely upholding the whole building, but also joyning together the several walls, the Jews and Gentiles, and uniting them in himself. (2) The Apostles and other faithful Ministers after them, are the builders, who teach that Christ (who alone is able to bear the whole business of Redemption and Salvation) is the onely foundation of this Temple, and by thus teaching, do edifie and build the Saints up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Christ, according to the Doctrine of the Prophets and Apostles. (3) The stones of this Temple are the Elect, or all true Beleevers, who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Hee proceeds in his allegorical description of the true Catholick Church, and explains <hi>four</hi> conditions and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of the Church, or Temple of God. (1) This Temple is said to bee artificiously made, or fitly compi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, because the whole building of the Church and all
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:49391:64"/>
its members are then fitly compacted with the greatest wisdome, when Christ and his will is so preached, that every Beleever, hath his proper place and function, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the quality of the gifts of the Holy Ghost, so that some in publick office, some in their private calling, and all in their several places concur to the edification of the whole Temple. (2) This Temple is living, because Christ who is the foundation is living and quickening: and his true members, all Beleevers are living stones, being quickened and preserved in spiritual life by Christ the living foundation. (3) This Temple is vegetable or growing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and thriving like a Tree, because the whole building encreaseth by the addition of stones, or conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Beleevers, and by the nourishment of the Word of God, which all the living stones (as boughs from a tree) draw from Christ by the Holy Ghost, and holding Christ the Head, and being fastened to Christ the root, do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually grow in holiness. (4) This Temple is rational and spiritual, because it is a holy Temple, that is, not a society of earthly, prophane, and unclean men, but a spiritual society of holy men, as it were a heavenly habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, in which God truly dwells, is truly known, loved, called upon, and worshiped.</p>

                  <hi>Vers. 22.</hi> In whom you also are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit.</q>
               <p>Hee applies these to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> contracting all the parts of the Argument into one, that the happiness of their condition in Christ might at once appear, that they might know they were Gods dwelling-place, or a part of this Temple, and communicated with the Catholick Church; and that themselves were partakers of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of the Church by the Holy Ghost dwelling in them: from all which wee may conclude, that the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians</hi> had so much and so great happiness, that nothing else but Grace could bestow upon them.</p>

That part of the Mystery, which is touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the accomplishment of all the Promises of Grace in Christ, and touching the calling of the uncircumcised Gentiles into the fellowship of the heavenly Inheritance, that they should bee admitted by God equally with the Israelites themselvess into the union of the Israelitish Church, and the participation of Christ by the Faith of the Gospel, without circumcision and other ceremonies; I say, this part was not before manifested: Therefore, &amp;c.

That the blinde may bee illuminated to see and understand things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed. (3.) That all men may know they are to be made partakers of salvation onely by the faith of Jesus Christ, without Circumcision, and the works of the Law. (4.)

The use of my Ministry is glorious, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause by it the manifold wisdome of God, in declaring his counsel touching the gathering of a Church out of the circumcised, and uncrcumcised, is more clearly laid open then ever before, even to the holy Angels in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, much more to men on earth: Therefore, &amp;c. For the Angels know nothing of the mystery of mans salvation but by the revelation of it to the Church.</p>

The fruit of this Ministry is glorious, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause by the preaching of the Gospel to Jews and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles beleeving on Christ, there is equally afforded liberty in Christ, of going to God in confidence, and of freely pleading with him, for all our necessities, as with a most loving Father: Therefore my Ministry ought to bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted with you.</p>

               <p>From all these fore-going things, as from one ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent, the Apostle infers this consequent conclusion, That they should not bee offended in his bonds or captivity, that is, they should not faint, nor become weary, or slothfull in the cause of faith for his afflictions, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther constantly persevere, and make proficiency therein. To which Exhortation, hee adjoyns two Reasons, (1.) Because hee suffered these afflictions for them, that is, for vouching their priviledges in Christ, and for the confirmation of their faith. (2.)

               <p>Christ descended into the lower parts of the earth (by this very phrase <hi>David</hi> describes his conception in the womb, <hi>Psal.</hi> 139.18.) and also ascended again, for the gathering of the Church into one, and uniting it to God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Therefore, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>From the same prophecie hee gathers that Christ God who descended to bee incarnate, or that hee might take flesh, was not made another, or any other person when hee ascended as God incarnate, or having taken flesh up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him; that the humane nature assumed, did not add a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing to the constituting or perfecting the person of the Son of God, but onely was taken into the unity of the person: and therefore Christs descending and ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding was the same, even as hee that puts on a garment is the same as hee was when naked. Furthermore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to shew the end of his Ascension hee adds,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 10. Christ ascended into Heaven, that hee might accomplish all things which were to bee accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished, <hi>viz.</hi> that hee might gather and preserve the Church, and communicate unto it, what was necessary for it: Therefore, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>Hee in part shews how Christ hath accomplished all things, as much as is sufficient to his purpose, by ennu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merating the several orders of Ecclesiastical Ministery, some temporary and extraordinary, as Apostles, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Evangelists ordained for the laying the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of all Churches; some ordinary and perpetual, as Pastors and Teachers, instituted for the continuing of the Church.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 12.</hi> For the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Ministery, for the edifying of the body of Christ:</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 11. From the end and use for which Christ did bestow these offices and gifts. (1) That the Saints might bee restored even as members loosened and out of joynt set and brought to their proper place. (2) That the Ministers avoiding idleness, and tyrannizing go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, should follow the work of their Ministery, that so every of the Elect, as straying sheep might bee brought home to Christ their Shepheard and abide in him. (3) That the whole body of the Church might bee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dified and built up; and every one make proficiency in Faith and Holiness, and to this purpose Christ appointed Offices in the Church, that by the help and Ministery of men, all the Saints might so grow up together, as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute one mystical body of Christ: Therefore, &amp;c.</p>
               <q>

               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 12. From the term of the duration of the Ministery. This Ministery must continue until all wee Elect come unto the unity of the Faith and the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Christ, that is, not onely until wee bee united to Christ by Faith and Knowledge which is of Faith, but also until all wee that are redeemed, or that are elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as many as do live or shall live, I say, until wee all come one after another, to a present Knowledge in an immediate vision, or to a perfect regeneration, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporation in Christ, when all the Elect being now united and perfected, shall constitute one Mystical Christ, who shall bee every way compleat and perfect, and attain his full stature, which shall bee in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection: Therefore for this end and purpose that this business may bee advanced, wee should strive for uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and concord.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 14.</hi> That wee henceforth bee no more children, tossed to and fro, and carryed about with every wind of Doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiness whereby they lye in wait to deceive:</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 13. From another end of the institution of the Ministery. Christ appointed the Ministery, that wee should not bee alwaies children, ignorant of those things which wee ought to know, that wee should not bee wavering and inconstant, tossed with the wind of contrary Doctrines, that wee should not bee separated from Christ and his Church through unsetledness in Faith; that wee should not bee deceived by the subtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, deceit, and treacherous seducing of corrupt men: Therefore for the furtherance of this end, wee should as much as in us lyes, endeavour the unity of the Church.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 14. From the third end of the institution of the Ministery. Christ ordained the Ministery in the Church, not onely that wee might shun seducing, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so that wee might follow the Truth of the heavenly Doctrine with charity, and so by truth and charity wee might thrive in all virtues into one Christ mystical: Therefore for this end wee should study the unity of the Church, and charity, that Christ our Head might appear excellent among us, and wee, who cannot otherwise en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, should become <hi>strong</hi> and mighty in him.</p>
               <q>

               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 15. Taken from the description of Christ mystical, or of Christ and the Church, wherin by a si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of the natural head and body, hee illustrates what hee said touching encrease in charity, and the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Truth, to the advancing the glory of Christ, and the good of the Church: In this description hee shews,</p>
               <p n="1">(1) That the whole body of the Church depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Christ as its head and original, and from him all the nourishment of its body, that is, all saving Truth, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the living Spirit of Christ, is derived upon all its true members, so that no man knows any thing unless hee bee taught by Christ.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) That for the diversity of the gifts of the Spirit, of the offices, and of the condition of every member of the Catholick Church, the body should bee fitly framed, or composed in the most beautiful and most befitting or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and should bee tyed to him, and joyned in him by the most strict bond of the Spirit of Faith and of Love, also by the several relations, partly betwixt Christ and us (such as are of the Head and Members, the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom, the Advocate, the Surety, &amp;c.) Partly betwixt one another (such as are the relations of Brethren and Sisters, of co-heirs, of Pastors and the Flock, of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and Children, &amp;c.) by all which wee are daily tyed more strictly to Christ, and among our selves.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) That there are several bands for the administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of nourishment, through which, as through chanels, or veins, the knowledge of saving truth, faith, experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and power are conveyed by Christ, in the several functions and offices in the Church; in which are the Apostleship, Pastorship, Eldership, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="4">(4) That the meer Administration or Ministration is in the members: for the dispensation of a blessing, of power and virtue, depends immediately on Christ alone.</p>
               <p n="5">(5) That a distribution among the members is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, who in regard of their finite measure and capacity have need of mutual communication, that they may mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually edifie one another.</p>
               <p n="6">(6) That encrease is to bee had by the effectual ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the same Head Christ in the Ministration, and by the mutual communication of the members among themselves.</p>
               <p n="7">(7) That for the measure and capacity of every member, every one doth encrease, and make progress in the life of God, in holiness, in true Religion, as it pleaseth the Lord to distribute to every one.</p>
               <p n="8">
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:49391:66"/>(8.) That that increase onely is profitable, and by the vertue of Christ advantagious, which adds some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the whole body, and brings something to the Church in general, but not that increase which seems to profit some members with the hurt of others, or some Churches with prejudice to others.</p>
               <p n="9">(9.) Lastly, That this communication of knowledge, and of the Christian Doctrine, and the edification of the body, is effected by the love of the members to one another, and without love it cannot bee done. Hence the Argument: As it is in the natural and organical body, so in the Church, Christ who is the head of the Church bestows not the same, but divers gifts upon his members, distributing to every one, as the place which it bears in the body requires, that by this means the whole may grow, whilest the several members every one in its place, uses its gifts to the common good, which cannot be done unless there bee concord: Therefore for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose every one should carefully endeavour the concord and unity of the Church.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Precept</hi> 1. That they should not any longer walk as other Gentiles, but as became those who were effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally called from the state of sin, unto Christ. The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of this Precept or Exhortation are <hi>four.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>In the vanity] Reas.</hi> 2. From the miserable condition of the Gentiles, and of all those that are unregenerate; which condition is couched in these <hi>seven</hi> particulars: (1.) That they were led by a vain minde, which doth not dictate any thing certainly in divine things, nor directs humane actions to any profitable end, <hi>vers.</hi> 17.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Darkned</hi>] (2.) That the reason of unregenerate Gentiles, in things pertaining to God and happiness, is darkned and blinded. (3.) That they are alienated from the spiritual life of God, and from all communion with God. (4.) That they have no saving knowledge of God, but are quite ignorant of God as to salvation, or as hee is in the Church revealed in Christ. (5.) That they have a heart hardened by natural, voluntary, and judicial obduration; for when they do willingly harden themselves in sin, they are also by the just judgement of God, further hardened in sin, and the blindness of their mindes, <hi>vers.</hi> 18.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Past feeling</hi>] (6.) That being buried in unsensible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and griefless quietness, they do not any more fear sin, or feel the natural bitings of conscience. (7.) That the Gentiles are freely, and unrestrainedly carried away in the lust of sinning, not onely to a meer desire, but also to a full commission of all uncleanness with greediness, and to follow their pleasures with an unsatisfiable desire and study to fulfill them, <hi>vers.</hi> 19. Hence the <hi>second</hi> Reason holds good, the condition of all other Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles is most miserable: Therefore walk not as they do.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vers. 20.</hi> But yee have not so learned Christ:</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>If so bee</hi>] Hee limits the former Reason, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strains it to the truly regenerate, who have sincerely and truly heard Christ, and are effectually taught by his Spirit what that true holiness in Christ is, what that right manner of living prescribed by Christ is, and how great the virtue and spiritual power in him is to make his true and genuine Disciples live according to his orders (I say) with these at least the former Reasons will bee va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, <hi>vers.</hi> 21.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vers. 22.</hi> That yee put off, concerning the former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation, the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts:</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 4. The Doctrine of Christ doth expresly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of beleevers that they perform these three things. (1.) That following repentance, they should more and more put off, and lay aside the old man, or that corrupt nature, which shewed it self in their former conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which corrupt nature, or old man is daily made worse, and more corrupt through deceitful lusts, and so it doth more and more corrupt and destroy man, <hi>vers.</hi> 22. (2.) That they should bee more and more renewed in the spirit of their minde, that is, that beleevers should do their endeavour, through the Word and Spirit of God, to make their understanding more and more spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, which of its own nature is repugnant to the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, and argues against it. (3.) That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers should put on the new man, or should study to manifest and declare in themselves the actions and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of the new creature, renewed after the Image of God, and therefore should carefully yeeld obedience to the divine Law in those things which respect God and their neighbour.

they should not at all give place, either in the allowance of this or any other sin.</p>

                  <p>

Hee urges this reason, and renders it more strong, and weighty, in that by the Holy Ghost they were sealed to the day of Redemption, and by his presence, they were in a manner noted and marked for Gods proper and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar ones, that in the day of their perfected redemption, which is the day of resurrection, they may bee brought into Gods Mansion-place: Therefore they ought to shew their thankfulness to this Spirit in another manner, than by thus offending him with their uncleanness.</p>

To which is added the most weighty reason, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God in Christ hath forgiven you your sins, and hath shewn abundance of grace to you in Christ: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you should be bountiful and merciful to one another.</p>

                  <p>THere are <hi>two</hi> parts of this <hi>Chapter,</hi> the former contains nine general Precepts touching the practice of holiness, which indifferently concern all beleevers, <hi>to vers. 21.</hi> The latter contains <hi>four</hi> more special Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts touching Oeconomical, or houshold offices, <hi>unto the end.</hi>

               </argument>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 1.</hi> Bee yee therefore followers of God as dear children.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Precept</hi> 1. Touching holiness in general, That they should study to imitate God in holiness: The reason is, because yee are the beloved Sons of God: Therefore you should imitate God your Father, who is holy.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers: 2.</hi> And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us, an offering, and a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling savour.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prec.</hi> 2. That they should walk in mutual love; hee adds the reason thereof, because Christ hath so loved us, that hee offered himself a sacrifice for us, that God might forgive us our sins; the power of this sacrifice ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in this, that it hath pleased and appeased God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us: These two Precepts also may serve to confirm the preceding exhortation in the end of the former Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, concerning forgiving one anothers faults.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 3.</hi> But fornication, and all uncleanness, or cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness, let it not bee once named amongst you, as becometh Saints.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prec.</hi> 3. That they should beware and avoid fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and all kinde of uncleanness and covetousness, yea that they should not bee so much as named among them without detestation, much less committed: The reason thereof is, because it becomes Saints thus to carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, who have devoted themselves to the service of the most holy God.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 4.</hi> Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jeast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which are not convenient, but rather giving of thanks.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <hi>5.</hi> For this yee know, that no Whoremonger, nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean person, nor covetous man who is an Idolater, hath any inheritance in the Kingdome of Christ, and of God.</p>
                  <p n="6">
                     <hi>6.</hi> Let no man deceive you with vain words, for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prec.</hi> 4. That they should avoid filthiness of speech, foolish talking, and scoffing. Of these two Precepts, hee gives five Reasons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Which are not] Reason</hi> 1. Because filthy speech doth not at all become Saints.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But rather] Reas.</hi> 2. Because wee have other matters of joy afforded us to take up our talk with, <hi>viz.</hi> Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving for Gods benefits, <hi>vers.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This yee know] Reas.</hi> 3. Because uncleanness and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness are excluded from the Kingdome of heaven, which is called God the Fathers and Christs, because it is a Kingdome common to both.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Idolater] Reas.</hi> 4. Because covetousness is Idolatry, substituting the creature in the place of the Creator. Wee may understand the same of other vices, <hi>vers.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>No man] Reas.</hi> 5. Because whoever are addicted to these vices, are reckoned among the sons of disobedience, or Rebels against God, and shall feel the most heavy wrath of God, whatever Seducers may say to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, <hi>vers.</hi> 6.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 7.</hi> Bee not yee therefore partakers with them.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prec.</hi> 5. This hee adds as an inference, wherein hee generally disswades them from partaking in these afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said vices, and all others wherewith the sons of disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience defile themselves. The Reasons hereof are <hi>eight</hi>: The <hi>first</hi> went before, lest they bee made partakers of the future wrath hanging over the disobedient.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 8.</hi> For yee were sometimes darkness, but now are yee light in the Lord, Walk as children of light.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 2. From their changed condition, because before your conversion to faith, you were slaves and bond-men to ignorance and wickedness, but now in Christ yee are beautified with the light of wisdome and holiness, that yee should commend this light to others (where hee gives a hint of the same Precept affirmative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>viz.</hi> That they should not walk as the sons of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, but as the sons of light, obeying the word of God, which affords light to the right ordering of our lives) therefore you should not bee companions of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 9.</hi> (For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness, righteousness, and truth.)</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 3. Because the fruit of the Holy Ghost, by whom yee are translated from darkness to light, consists in goodness, righteousness, and truth: Therefore yee should bring forth these fruits, and not bee companions of the obstinate, in the fruits of the flesh.</p>
               <q>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:49391:67"/>
                  <hi>Vers. 10.</hi> Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 4. In which hee explains the Precept touching walking in the light, Because endeavouring to walk as Sons of the Light, yee may experimentally know, and certainly try what is acceptable to God, what not: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bee not yee, by walking in darkness, of the fellowship of the disobedient.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 11.</hi> And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 5. Here also the Precept is repeated and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained. Because walking as the Sons of Light, yee will not onely not partake of the sins of others, but by the example of your holy life you will condemn the sins of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: Bee not yee therefore their companions, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther abhor their manners.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 12.</hi> For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 6. Because the works of darkness, which the rest of the unconverted Heathens secretly commit, for their filthiness are not worthy of a Christians ear: Therefore you ought not to have any intercourse with their sins, but rather reprove them, as the Sons of Light.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 13.</hi> But all things that are reproved, are made manifest by the Light: for whatsoever doth make ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, is Light.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 7. Because the rebuke of secret sins, which is given by your openly-declared holy life, doth prick the consciences of the wicked, and doth manifest that their works are evil: and this doth very much conduce to their conversion; for thus it brings them to the knowledge of themselves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Is Light</hi>] Hee confirms this reason, and proves that an holy life is Light. Because it hath the property of Light, so far as it manifests to the wicked, that their works are evil.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 14.</hi> Wherefore hee saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee Light.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 8. Confirming the former. Because the voice of the Holy Ghost in the Scriptures, or the Prophetical and Apostolical Doctrine, both taken together, have this tendency and drift, that those that sleep and are dead in sins, should bee raised to repentance, and come unto Christ by Faith, that so they may bee enlightened and saved by the Light of Christs Grace: Therefore all the Sons of Light ought both in words and deeds to commend this Doctrine to others, and propagate it to the salvation of others, shunning in the mean while all intercourse with sinners.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 15.</hi> See then that yee walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise;</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prec.</hi> 6. Making for the observation of the former. That they should take care to walk accurately, as becomes those who are indued with the Wisdome of God revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the Gospel, and not being deceived, decline from the way, as those who are ignorant of Gods Will.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 16.</hi> Redeeming the time, because the daies are evil.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prec.</hi> 7. Having the same drift. That they should not suffer their time to bee spent in idleness and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, and to pass unfruitfully, but with the loss of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, or of sluggish idleness, or unprofitable business, they should take hold of, and as it were redeem oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of well doing: Hee gives the reason, Because the times are full of dangers, through the malice of men, who (no one knows how soon) may take away their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, goods, yea life it self, and deprive them of all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of doing good.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 17.</hi> Wherefore, bee yee not unwise, but under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand what the Will of the Lord is.</q>
               <p>From this reason hee inferrs a conclusion: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (saith hee) bee wise, and not fools, observing what God requires of you, that yee should perform it diligently without delay, while time is afforded.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 18.</hi> And bee not drunk with Wine, wherein is excess: but bee filled with the Spirit:</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prec.</hi> 8. Forbidding them to bee drunk with Wine, or any other drink. The reason is, because in this drunkenness is the destruction of estates, credit, body and soul.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bee filled] Prec.</hi> 9. This is delivered by way of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis; that rather they should bee filled and exhilerate themselves with the saving water of the Holy Ghost, that is, they should strive to abound in the experience of joy, which is from Gods Spirit: in which fulness there is no excess.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 19.</hi> Speaking to your selves in Psalms and Hymns, and spiritual Songs, singing, and making melody in your heart to the Lord,</q>
               <p>The reason of the Precept is from those better fruits which spiritual joy produceth, such are all sorts of spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Songs, especially those which are in the holy Scriptures, with which they should mutually edifie one another, and glorifie God from their heart or spiritual affection. A Psalm is a sacred song in general, especially that which is by playing on the harp. A Hymn properly contains Gods praise. An Ode or Song, is a common name.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 20.</hi> Giving thanks alwaies for all things unto God and the Father, in the name of our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ,</q>
               <p>Hee shews the special use and end of Christian Songs, that wee should alwaies, in what condition soever wee are, through Jesus Christ, give thanks to God our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for all his benefits.</p>

                  <head>The Second Part.</head>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 21.</hi> Submitting your selves one to another, in the fear of God.</q>
                  <p>The <hi>second</hi> part of this <hi>Chapter</hi> follows, wherein that hee may descend to oeconomical Precepts, hee premises an exhortation touching submission to one another in general, that still keeping that order which God had placed them in, they should each one in his office help one another; for where-ever there is love, there will bee care to serve one another: Hee adds in the fear of God, because it is requisite that from this fountain should flow sincere obedience of this Precept from the heart, to the glory of God; for is is onely the fear of Christ which can bring our fierceness into subjection, that wee should not refuse the yoak, and can bring down our pride, that wee should not bee ashamed to serve our neighbours.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 22.</hi> Wives, submit your selves unto your own Husbands, as unto the Lord.</q>
                  <p>Now follow the oeconomical Precepts. (1) That Wives should bee in subjection to their own Husbands, chastly, sincerely, and in lawful things. The reasons whereof are <hi>four.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>As unto the Lord] Reason</hi> 1. Because Christ com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that the Wife should bee subject to her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and accounts of that subjection as if shee yeelded obedience to himself, and in like manner looks upon the Wives rebellion against her Husband, as rebellion against himself.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 23.</hi> For the Husband is the Head of the Wife, even as Christ is the Head of the Church: and hee is the Saviour of the body.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 2. Because the Husband is in honour and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over the Wife, as the head is over the body. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is meet that the Wife <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ould bee in subjection to him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>As Christ] Reas.</hi> 3. Because <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> will have the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands authority over the Wife to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>And hee is] Reas.</hi> 4. The same similitude is illustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. As Christ is the Head of the Church for its good: so the Husband is the Head of the Wife for her good, whom hee ought in all things to defend, ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>rish and

comfort: And as it is expedient for the Church to bee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient to Christ; so it is for the Wife to bee obedient to her Husband.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 24.</hi> Therefore as the Church is subject unto Christ, so let the Wives bee to their own Husbands, in every thing.</q>
                  <p>From these reasons hee inferrs the conclusion: that it is necessary for the Wife to bee obedient to her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band in all things, which hinder not her due subjection unto God and Christ.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 25.</hi> Husbands love your Wives, even as Christ also loved the Church, and gave himself for it.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prec.</hi> 2. Which is given to men, that they should love their Wives; the reasons thereof are <hi>five.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>As] Reas.</hi> 1. From the example of Christs love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Church, which love the Apostle commends from these <hi>four</hi> marks.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1) That Christ out of his love offered himself for the Church which was then lost.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 26.</hi> That hee might sanctifie and cleanse it with the washing of water, by the Word;</q>
                  <p n="2">(2) That hee loved his Church, and offered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self for it, to the end that hee might sanctifie it, or of a prophane and impure Church make it a holy one.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Washing</hi>] (3) That Christ doth effectually cleanse his Church by virtue of his blood, and of his free pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, which hee applies to us by the ordinary means of Baptism, and of the Word, as by instruments of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ordained for the confirmation of Faith, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of virtue.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 27.</hi> That hee might present it to himself a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Church, not having spot or wrinckle, nor any such thing; but that it should bee holy and without blemish.</q>
                  <p n="4">(4) That hee hath loved his Church for this end, that hee might at length present it glorious in Heaven, without any mark or token either of sin or misery, and hee will ever prosecute this his work till hee hath brought it to pass.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 28.</hi> So ought men to love their Wives, as their own bodies; hee that loveth his Wife, loveth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 2. Of the Precept given to men touching lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their Wives. Because Wives are the bodies of their own Husbands, according to that Law of God, They two shall bee one flesh.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hee that loveth] Reas.</hi> 3. Because hee which loveth his Wife, loveth himself, and performs the office of love unto himself, for that love of a mans own Wife, doth every way redound to the Husbands good.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 29.</hi> For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the Church:</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 4. Because it is as unnatural to a Wife and good Husband not to love his Wife, as it is to hate his own flesh, and it is as agreeable to reason, to favour and make much of his Wife, as it is to regard his own flesh.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>As</hi>] Hee confirms and illustrates this reason by the example of Christ, which hee wills us alwaies to have in our eye, as the most perfect example of love.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 30.</hi> For wee are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.</q>
                  <p>Hee proves that Christ loved us as his own flesh, and that it was not possible for him to hate us, but hee was as it were constrained out of love to maintain and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish us: because wee are members of his body, flesh of his flesh, and bone of his bone, that is, wee are as nearly joyned to him, as <hi>Eve</hi> was to <hi>Adam:</hi> for what <hi>Eve</hi> owed to <hi>Adam</hi> in the flesh, wee owe to Christ in the regeneration of our spirit, and much more. In the forming of <hi>Eve, Adam</hi> lost onely one rib: but in the reforming of the Church, Christ lost his life. Onely the matter of <hi>Eve</hi> was from <hi>Adam</hi>: but the Church hath from Christ its natural formation, and spiritual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, in respect of both the body and soul of every member.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 31.</hi> For this cause shall a man leave his Father and Mother, and shall bee joyned unto his Wife, and they two shall bee one flesh.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 5. Where hee proves both that the Church owes its beginning to Christ; and that Husbands ought to love their Wives, even from the institution of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, which requires that by reason of the streight knot between Husband and Wife, a man shall leave Father and Mother, and bee joyned to his Wife, and they two shall bee united into one flesh, by the bond of wedlock, by which they now have a mutual right to, and power over one another: the words of this institution have a typical sense: for God, in that saying, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.23. Thou art flesh of my flesh, and bone of my bone, intended to represent the union of Christ, and the Church, and to shew that wee are bone of Christs bone, and flesh of Christs flesh, that is, that wee are most nearly united to Christ, because in the speech of <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Eve,</hi> it was prefigured, that Christ (as hee was one flesh with us, and made us one flesh with himself by a spiritual wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock) did as it were leave his own Father (laying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side after a manner that glory which hee had with the Father, abasing himself when hee was in the form of God, and taking upon him the form of a servant.) Also it was prefigured that Christ should leave <hi>Mary</hi> his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that by dying hee might buy the Church to bee his Spouse, with which hee would bee one flesh.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 32.</hi> This is a great mystery: but I speak concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Christ and the Church.</q>
                  <p>The Apostle viewing this last thing, not the carnal wedlock, but the union of Christ with the Church, calls it a great mystery: and lest any one should otherwise understand his saying, hee signifies in express words, that hee doth not speak this of the mystery touching the carnal marriage of Husband and Wife, but concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the spiritual conjunction of Christ and the Church, which is made by virtue of the Spirit, not of the flesh, by Faith, and not by any natural bond or tye.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 33.</hi> Nevertheless, let every one of you in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, so love his Wife even as himself, and the Wife see that shee reverence the Husband.</q>
                  <p>Letting the mystery pass, hee returns to the Precepts touching the duties of Husband and Wife, and in the last place adds <hi>Precept</hi> 3. wherein hee reduces all the duties of the Husband to sincere love, such as is the love wherewith hee loves himself, and this love hee presses upon them; On the other side hee reduces all the duties of the Wife to fear, and reverence towards her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, that shee offend him not, but indeavour in the Lord to please him in all things.</p>

               </argument>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 1.</hi> Children, obey your Parents in the Lord: for this is right.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Precept</hi> 1. to children, that they should honour their Parents, and yeeld reverence and obedience to them in all things, so far as is possible, and pleasing to God: the reasons hereof are <hi>four.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">(1) Because it is required by all Law both of God, and of Nature, that children should obey their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 2.</hi> Honour thy Father and thy Mother (which is the first Commandement with Promise.)</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 2. Because the obedience of children is express<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:49391:68"/>
mentioned in the Commandements, as a part of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour due to Parents, and commanded in the Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Which is] Reas.</hi> 3. Because this is the first command which hath a particular promise particularly apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 3.</hi> That it may bee well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 4. Because the obedience of children towards their Parents, conduces to the childrens good, and hath a special blessing, the lengthening of temporal life: which Promise is either simply fulfilled, or else by change of the benefit, for one much better, of a better life.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 4.</hi> And yee Fathers provoke not your children to wrath; but bring them up in the nurture and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition of the Lord.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prec.</hi> 2. Touching the part and duty of Parents to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their children, that on the one side, by too much severity towards their children, they abuse not their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly power (lest they drive their childrens affection from them) and on the other side, that by too much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, they do not nourish any childish malepertness in their children, but that rather they strive to correct their vices, and instruct them in good manners in the fear of the Lord.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 5.</hi> Servants bee obedient to them that are your Masters according to the flesh, with fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ:</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prec.</hi> 3. Of the duty of Servants towards their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters: the parts whereof are <hi>six.</hi> (1) That they obey their Masters, acknowledging their external servile condition to bee from God, and that they are not freed from a political servitude by Christ, who neither takes away, nor changes Governments. (2) That they remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that their Masters are not Masters of their conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but of the flesh or outward man, and in things which concern this life. (3) That they serve them in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, and in fear of their anger. (4) That laying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side deceit, they deal truly and sincerely with their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters. (5) That they serve them with reference to Christs command, and so in obeying them they will serve Christ.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 6.</hi> Not with eye-service, as men-pleasers, but as the servants of Christ, doing the Will of God from the heart:</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <hi>5.</hi> With good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men:</p>
               </q>
               <p n="6">(6) That without flattering deceit, they take care of their Masters business, no less in their absence, than when they are present to over-look them, and not onely that they may please their Masters, but that they may please God. <hi>Lastly,</hi> That they serve, not out of self-love, or meer fear, but out of good will, as those that serve God, and not men: for hee serves God, who obeyes him commanding him to serve his Master.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 8.</hi> Knowing that whatsoever good thing man doeth, the same shall hee receive of the Lord, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hee bee bond or free.</q>
               <p>Besides the Arguments which are tacitly couched in what went before, to confirm this Precept, hee adds the hope of reward, which they shall receive from God, who liberally rewards the works of his servants whether they bee free or bond in the flesh.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 9.</hi> And yee Masters do the same things unto them, forbearing threatning: knowing that your Master also is in Heaven, neither is there respect of persons with him.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prec.</hi> 4. Concerning the duty of Masters towards their servants. That proportionably making use of the same virtues, they should exercise their masterly power over their servants after a Christian manner: and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly that they should bee moderate in threatnings, lest they rule tyrannically over them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Knowing</hi>] Hee adds <hi>two</hi> reasons. (1) Because they have the Lord above them, who is able to revenge their weak tyranny. (2) Because God is just, who doth not respect the person of the Master or servant, but beholds the cause and work of both according to equity.</p>

                  <p>The other <hi>part</hi> of the <hi>Chapter</hi> contains the conclusion of the Epistle; which hath in it <hi>four</hi> points. In the first hee exhorts them to constancy in Faith and Holiness of life, and to put on the spiritual armor against our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, with whom wee must grapple as long as wee live, <hi>Brethren</hi> (saith hee) <hi>bee yee strengthened in the Lord.</hi> The Arguments to press on this Exhortation are <hi>three.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. Because they have communion with the Lord, in whom is power and strength, in whom, if yee continue by Faith, and make use of his Grace, hee will bee ready to help you, with his power and effectual ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; that so you will both dare to venture on, and bee able valiantly to oppose all your enemies and hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances: Therefore bee yee strengthened in the Lord.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. Because you are armed with all sorts of weapons, which are necessary for your war; which wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons hee exhorts them to put on, that they may bee able to stand in the fight against the Devils assaults and treachery.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 12.</hi> For wee wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual wickedness in high places.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 3. Because our strife is not meerly with men, or against our own flesh, or against men onely (such a fight might seem tolerable) but wee are to fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the author of all these evils, the Devil, and the whole army of unclean spirits, who are no weak and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary souldiers, but all of them principalities and powers, or spirits which bear rule over worldly men: and govern the wicked (who are here and elsewhere cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led darkness) and stir them up against us: these also as they are very powerful and very crafty, so they are most wicked and malicious: And lastly, they are spiritual, such as wee cannot discern with our eyes, and flye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout in the open air, so that they can when they will set upon us at unawares, unless wee watch.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 13.</hi> Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that you may bee able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.</q>
                  <p>Here hee repeats the Exhortation, that they would put on the whole armour of God, that they might bee able to stand in the evil day, or the day of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and in the day of victory, expecting new on-sets of the enemy, and at length having overcome him, might triumph.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 14.</hi> Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with Truth, and having on the breast-plate of Righteousness.</q>
                  <p>Hee takes a similitude from bodily weapons, and names those helps against the Devil, which answer to bodily armour, fitted to defend us from, and to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the enemy; to this end hee bids every one stand, that is, keep himself within his general and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar calling, and watch against the enemy. The parts of the armour for the defence of the Truth, are <hi>seven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Loyns</hi>] (1.) Constancy in the Doctrine of Truth, which hee compares to a girdle, which bindes the looser parts of the body that they do not fall asunder; for knowledge strengthens us, that wee do not waver through weakness.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Having on</hi>] (2.) The breast-plate of righteousness
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:49391:69"/>
by which wee understand the righteousness of Christ ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to us, which is alwayes accompanied with an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour after a holy life, and a good conscience; which as it were fortifies our breasts against the adversaries assault upon our faith, and manifests it to bee sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 15.</hi> And your feet shod with the preparation of the Gospel of peace.</q>
                  <p n="3">(3.) A readiness of minde to acknowledge and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the Gospel in our place, against all hindrances and difficulties; this is, to have our feet shod with the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Gospel.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 16.</hi> Above all, taking the shield of faith, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with yee shall bee able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.</q>
                  <p n="4">(4.) The shield of faith, or trust in Christ, by which as by a shield are received, and kept off all those poysoned temptations of the Devil, which hee, our great enemy, doth brandish against us as his weapons.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 17.</hi> And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God.</q>
                  <p n="5">(5.) The helmet of salvation, or a certain hope and assurance of our salvation, by which being armed and assured of the victory, wee may confidently continue the fight.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The sword</hi>] (6.) The sword of the Spirit, or the Word of God, wherewith drawing and brandishing it, wee may repell the Devil himself, and put him to flight.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 18.</hi> Praying alwayes with all prayer and suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance, and supplication for all Saints:</q>
                  <p n="7">(7.) Prayer, wherewith a Christian souldier betaking himself to his General, Christ, begs his assistance, not once onely, but at any time when necessity urges; not coldly, and with his lips onely, but with a fervent Spirit; not faintly, as if hee feared not the enemy, but watching and attending to this duty with greatest earnestness; not for himself onely, but also for the whole Church, or for Gods whole Army, and for every one of the Saints, so far as hee shall bee acquainted with their neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 19.</hi> And for mee, that utterance may bee given unto mee, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the Gospel:</q>
                  <p>The second point of the Conclusion is an exhortation to pray for the Apostle, that God would inable him to declare and preach the Gospel, fully, plainly, and boldly.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 20.</hi> For which I am an Ambassadour in bonds; that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.</q>
                  <p>There are three Reasons of this Exhortation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. Because for this very end I am sent an Apostle with Authority, that I may declare the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Vers. 21.</hi> But that yee may also know my affairs, and how I do, <hi>Tychicus</hi> a beloved brother and faithful Minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things.</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>The third point is about the sending of <hi>Tychicus</hi> unto them, for which hee gives a reason from the end, <hi>viz.</hi> That so the <hi>Ephesians</hi> might bee acquainted with the Apostles business, and might receive comfort by reason of Gods presence with him in his bonds, and so might bee confirmed in the faith.</p>
                  <q>

                  </q>
                  <p n="4">(4.) Point is an Apostolical benediction, wherein under the form of a wish, hee prayes that peace and love, with faith, may bee still bestowed and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated from God and Christ to the beleeving bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</p>
                  <p>And then hee pronounceth grace on all those who love Christ with a sincere affection; which grace is the fountain of that faith which worketh by love, and by which wee have peace with God for ever.</p>

               <p>The Preface is taken up in a direction of the Epistle, and a salutation of the <hi>Philippians.</hi> The direction of the Epistle is from <hi>Paul,</hi> and from <hi>Timothy</hi> a Disciple, as it were a witness of the Apostles diligence, in this his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition to the Church of the <hi>Philippians,</hi> and its Bishops and Deacons, that is, Pastors and other Ecclesiastical Rulers, who were joyned to the Pastors, to take care of the life and manners, and other necessaries of the Church.</p>

                  <hi>Vers. 2.</hi> Grace bee unto you, and Peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Iesus Christ.</q>
               <p>The salutation contains an Apostolical benediction, wherein hee wisheth them Grace and Peace from God through Christ, as his custome was to other Churches which hee wrote to. This Church was well enough ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Apostles authority: for hee was very much esteemed and favoured by the <hi>Philippians</hi>; therefore it was meet that hee should bee brief in confirming his authority over them, and winning their good will to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards himself.</p>

                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. Your condition in the Grace of God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves that I should continually give thanks to God for it, as often as I remember you: Therefore you should bee strengthened in the Faith.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. I am so certainly perswaded of your sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that I cannot pray for you but with joy: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, &amp;c.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 5.</hi> For your fellowship in the Gospel from the first day until now;</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 3. You have carryed your selves stedfastly ever since yee were called unto the fellowship of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; even as it becomes Beleevers and Saints; so that your communion and fellowship in the Gospel was ever most pleasing to mee: Therefore, &amp;c.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 6.</hi> Being confident of this very thing, that hee which hath begun a good work in you, will perform it until the day of Iesus Christ:</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 4. I am perswaded that God hath begun the work of special Grace in you, and that hee will not leave off that his work in you, till hee hath perfected it in your perseverance, and manifested it to bee perfected in the comming of Christ: Therefore, &amp;c.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 7.</hi> Even as it is meet for mee to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart, inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of the Gospel, yee are all partakers of my Grace.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 5. Confirming the same. It is fit that I should think this, because I assuredly find by certain marks, that you are true Beleevers, and living members of Christ. A sign whereof is, that yee were in heart and deed partakers with mee of the Grace bestowed on mee (that is, of my sufferings, which through the Grace of God, I underwent for the Gospel, when I was in bonds) and partakers also of my labours, which I performed in the defence and propagation of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel: Therefore, &amp;c.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 8.</hi> For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all, in the bowels of Iesus Christ.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 6. God, who hath united my soul to you, is witness how greatly I love you in the bowels of Christ, or in the most near affection of Christian love, and how I desire to enjoy your fellowship.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 9.</hi> And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge, and in all judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 7. As I must needs confess there is no small Faith and Love, and experimentally-confirmed know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of divine things in you, so upon hope of your fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture encrease, I begge that your love may abound more and more, from a more full knowledge and feeling of Gods love towards you in Christ: Therefore unless you will disesteem and vilifie my hope of you, and continual prayer for you, more than is fitting you should, you ought to bee strengthened in Faith.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 10.</hi> That yee may approve things that are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, that yee may bee sincere and without offence till the day of Christ,</p>
                  <p n="11">
                     <hi>11.</hi> Being filled with the fruits of Righteousness, which are by Iesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Hee shews <hi>four</hi> ends of this his prayer, and also adds as many more points of his prayer. (1) That yee may bee able to prove those things which differ, that is, that yee may discern truth from fashood in doctrine, and good from evil in framing your lives: and to chuse that which is most excellent. (2) That yee may bee sincere without any mixture of humane traditions in worship and heart, and also pure in life and manners. (3) That yee may walk inoffensively, and without occasioning scandal to others, and make progress in the Faith unto the meeting of the Lord. (4) That yee may bee filled with the fruits of Righteousness, which arise from Faith in Christ, and tend to the glory of God.</p>

                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 12.</hi> But I would you should understand, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, that the things which happened unto mee, have fallen out rather to the furtherance of the Gospel.</q>
                  <p>The <hi>second</hi> part of the Chapter follows, in which the Apostle removes that scandal which they might take from his afflictions, which hee suffered for the Gospel; and this hee doth by <hi>nine Arguments,</hi> which prove that the <hi>Philippians</hi> ought not to bee offended at the Apostles afflictions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. Generally. My afflictions have occasioned the furtherance of the Gospel, and not its hinderance: Therefore you should not bee offended at them.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 13.</hi> So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other places.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. More specially. The cause of the Gospel for which I suffered, is by my afflictions made more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous both in <hi>Neroes</hi> Court, and other places: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you should not bee offended at them, but rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by my constancy under bonds.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 14.</hi> And many of the Brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the Word without fear.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 3. More Brethren are encouraged more freely to declare and preach the Gospel: Therefore there is no reason you should bee offended at my cross, but being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed by others example, rather that you should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in the Faith.</p>

                     <p n="16">
                        <hi>16.</hi> The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds:</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 4. Proposed by way of redargution to an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection: Though it bee true that some envy my glory, which I get by constancy under my bonds, such as are the Jewish false Apostles, who were wont to contend with mee about their Legal Ceremonies, and who preach the Gospel of Christ, mixing it with their leaven, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to trouble and vex mee, and to breed envy in their hearers; partly, lest I should seem to surpass them in any thing; and in the last place, partly that by these means they may add affliction to my bonds: yet there are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who preach Christ with an honest mind, and out of love indeavour to uphold my cause, knowing that Christ hath appointed mee an Apostle for the defence of the Gospel; and now honoured mee with the glory of bonds: Therefore you ought not to bee ashamed of my chain, or offended at my cross.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 18.</hi> What then? notwithstanding every way, whether in pretence, or in truth, Christ is preached, and I therein do rejoyce, yea, and will rejoyce.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 5. Every way I occasion the preaching of the Gospel by those that envy mee; for this I rejoyce, that the name of Christ is made famous by my bonds, and by others preaching, let it bee what it will: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you also should rejoyce with mee, and not bee of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at my bonds.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 19.</hi> For I know that this shall turn to my sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation through your prayers, and the supply of the Spirit of Iesus Christ,</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 6. I am so far from being dejected at my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions; that I am fully perswaded, that even this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction shall turn to my salvation, and that by the help of your prayers the Spirit of Christ shall daily bee more plentifully bestowed upon mee: Therefore, &amp;c.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 20.</hi> According to my earnest expectation, and my hope, that in nothing I shall bee ashamed, but that with all boldness, as alwaies, so now also Christ shall bee magnified in my body, whether it bee by life or by death.</q>
                  <p>He explains this perswasion more particularly, and adds,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 7. In Christ my advanced Head, I do with hope expect, not onely that I shall never bee ashamed, as being destitute of Christs help, but also that Christ shall bee glorified in mee by a free preaching and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of the Gospel, whether my life bee further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed or ended by Martyrdome: Therefore, &amp;c.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 21.</hi> For to mee to live is Christ, and to dye is gain:</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 8. I am prepared to dye for Christ, and am indifferent whether I live or dye, whether I bee afflicted or no, so that Christ bee glorified: for Christ is gain to mee, if I live longer, because being alive, I shall preach Christ, Christ is gain also though I dye presently, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause then I shall go to Christ, and for ever continue with him. And therefore you, regarding nothing but what advanceth the glory of Christ, ought not to bee offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at my chain.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 22.</hi> But if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labour; yet what I shall chuse, I wot not.</q>
                  <p>Hee confirms this Argument, in that it would bee very difficult for him to chuse what to do, if hee had his liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </gap>y, either to dye or live; for the fruit of the work of his Ministery encouraged him still to live; but his desire to enjoy Christ perswaded him to dye, so that hee could not easily determine which of these hee should chuse. Hence it is plain, that the Apostle was not troubled at his bonds, as long as they made for the glory of Christ.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vers. 23.</hi> For I am in a straight betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to bee with Christ, which is far better:</p>

                  <p>Hee further illustrates the same, shewing that hee is mightily straightned on the one side with a desire to enjoy Christ, than which nothing could bee more desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable if hee respected his own advantage, but on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side hee saw it would conduce to the Churches pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, if his bodily life were yet continued. 'Tis there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore evident that not onely affliction, but death also would bee acceptable to him for Christ.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Vers. 25.</hi> And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all, for your fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance and joy of Faith,</p>

To remove the scandal of the cross lying upon him, hee further adds, that although I am prepared to dye, yet I am assured by revelation I shall not dye yet, but shall live to further your salvation, and the joy of your Faith, and that I shall return to you, and bee with you, that your glorying in Christ may abound, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and seeing the power of Christ in my freedome and return: Therefore you ought not to bee offended at my bonds, but to bee confirmed in the Faith.</p>

                  <p>There are <hi>two</hi> parts of the <hi>Chapter:</hi> The <hi>first</hi> contains an exhortation to mutual peace, <hi>unto vers. 19.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>second</hi> their comfort: To perswade them to peace, hee propounds fifteen Arguments: All which prove that they ought to imbrace agreement in faith, love, and the study of good works.</p>
               </argument>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 1.</hi> If there bee therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies:</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. Is very swasive and pathetical, it runs thus, I earnestly intreat, that yee would maintain concord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong your selves, ingaging you thereunto by your du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and by what ever is most dear to you: Therefore, if either my Apostolical exhortation have any weight with you, or if you have ever found any consolation in Christ; if I who am bound may expect any comfort from you, if there bee any communion of the Spirit betwixt mee and you, if you will shew any mercy towards mee, you must preserve mutual peace among you.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 2.</hi> Fulfil yee my joy, that yee bee like minded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind:</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. You have already many wayes occasioned my joy, as to what remains, if yee maintain peace, you will fulfill and compleat my joy: Therefore let it bee your endeavour that yee beleeve the same things, and will the same things, or that being unamimous in love, yee may approve the same thing, and being alike affected, you may bee united together in mindes and hearts. Here the exhortation is expresly mentioned.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 3.</hi> Let nothing bee done through strife, or vain-glory, but in lowliness of minde, let each esteem other better than themselves.</q>
               <p>Hee subjoyns four Helps which will make the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his Exhortation more facile and easie, and which may bee reckoned as members of the Exhortation, and may serve also as Arguments to prove the Position.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) That they would shun contention and vain-glory, to which if any one give way, he will presently dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continue peace. Hence <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. If ye will shun contention and vain-glory, you will preserve peace: Therefore unless yee will profess these vices, you must maintain peace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But in</hi>] (2.) That they would study in lowliness of minde from their heart to prefer others before them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, as better than themselves; which thought may consist with truth, and bee without deceit, because this our opinion of other our brethren, doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire an absolute judgement, but is contented partly with a suspended, partly with a negative judgement, by which wee may say, that happily one thing being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with another, hee is better than I, or for as much as I know of him, and my self, I will not prefer my self before him; but him before me, because I am ignorant of the secrets of his heart, but I know the perversness of my own heart. Hence <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. If from the humbleness of your minde, you judge others to excel you, you may preserve concord: Therefore unless you will manifest your pride, you must preserve concord: For the excellency of a man is not valued according to the measure of his gifts, but according to the measure of his faithfulness, since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and honesty.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 4.</hi> Look not every man on his own things, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man also on the things of others.</q>
               <p n="3">(3.) The next Help for the maintaining of humility and concord, That every one should consider not his own vertues onely, and what makes for his own advantage onely, but the vertues of others also, and those things which conduce to the profit of all; thus wee shall esteem others more, and our selves less, and bee less offensive in all things. Hence <hi>Argum.</hi> 5. I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> yee will respect the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and good of others, you will easily preserve unity: Therefore unless you will bee envious, and bee account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed so, Follow peace.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 5.</hi> Let this minde bee in you, which was also in Iesus Christ:</q>
               <p n="4">(4.) The example of Christ which hee proposeth for imitation, that they would learn humility, and exercise a true love unto concord: Here hee first generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires that they would have the same minde which was in Christ. Hence <hi>Argum.</hi> 6. Yee ought to bee like-minded towards one another, as Christ was minded to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, imitating his modesty and sweetness of beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour: Therefore, &amp;c.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 6.</hi> Who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to bee equal with God:</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 7. Here hee more particularly handles the imitating of Christs example before proposed, in these six and seven verses, to this purpose, though Christ was equal to the Father, yet hee abased himself unto the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ath of the Cross, that hee might procure a peace and concord betwixt the Father and us: Therefore much more you ought to humble your selves for concords sake. The excellency of Christ is described in this verse, and his humiliation in the two following.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the form of God</hi>] The excellency of Christ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his assumption of the flesh is branched out into <hi>five</hi> particulars; (1.) That hee was a subsisting person. (2.) That he was in the form of God, that is, that he had the Essence of God endued with the natural properties of a Deity, or that hee was true God. (3.) That hee was the substantial Image of the Father. (4.) That hee was equal to the Father in all things, because hee had the same Deity which the Father had. (5.) That hee did fully know hee offered no injury to the Father in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining himself to bee equal with the Father, nor should hee at all injure him, supposing his humiliation had not been before decreed, though hee had pleased to manifest himself to the world in the glory of his Deity: This is the excellency of Christ.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 7.</hi> But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:</p>
                  <p n="8">
                     <hi>8.</hi> And being found in fashion as a man, hee humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the Cross.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Here follows Christs voluntary humiliation, which is called his exinanition or emptying of himself, not that hee did in himself cease to bee what hee was, but that hee laid aside the manifestation of his Glory and Majesty, and so hid it under the form of a servant, as if hee had had none, or as if hee had so left it off, that it could not bee perceived by the world (nay nor by his servants that were eye-witnesses) unless it were so much of it through the chinks of his Words and Works, as was requisite for the dispensation of the Work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</p>
               <p>The degrees or parts of this voluntary humiliation or exinanition are <hi>five</hi>; (1.) That hee took or assumed the form of a servant, or the true humane nature (such as is found in the vilest servants, or in men of the lowest rank) and united the humane nature to himself by a
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:49391:71"/>
personal union; thus hee debased himself from Heaven to Earth. (2) That in the humane Nature hee debased himself below the condition of free men, to an external condition most reproachful among men, which is servile: for hee took upon him the form of a servant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The likeness</hi>] Hee shews the truth of his incarnation in that hee was made like to us, as one of us in the essential parts of humane nature, body and soul: like in the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral properties of the humane nature, and in all the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; like in the common infirmities which follow man-kind: Lastly, that hee is like to us in all things, sin onely excepted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Being found in fashion</hi>] Hee confirms the truth of his incarnation, that hee was found in fashion as a man, for all that were conversant with him, both good and bad, by all waies whereby a man is known to bee a man, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served and found that hee was true man, and they did certainly know it, from the true shape and substance of his humane body, from the true actions of humane life, and from the true properties of one truly man, and from every fashion that any man is found in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hee humbled himself</hi>] (3) That being now made man, though hee was not obliged but by his voluntary Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant (because hee was not meerly man, though truly man, but God in the flesh, whose flesh was the flesh of God; and therefore being Lord of the Law, hee was not subject to it) to stay in the earth, or to undergo the yoak of the Law, (imposed upon those that are meerly men) yet hee humbled himself, or by his voluntary disposition and order, hee made himself in the state of humiliation less than his Father (for in respect of the Divine Nature, which is the same in both Father and Son, hee could not bee less) and took upon him the yoak of the Law, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for meer men, and not onely so, but hee also ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely submitted himself to perform all things which the Father should command for the perfecting the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Became obedient unto</hi>] (4) That hee did all his life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time patiently bear the yoak hee took upon him, fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his Fathers commands in all things, even unto death, or the laying down his humane life for his sheep, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his Fathers command.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of the Cross</hi>] (5) That hee was obedient to the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, cursed, most dishonourable death of the Cross.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 9.</hi> Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name.</p>
                  <p n="10">
                     <hi>10.</hi> That at the name of Iesus every knee should bow, of things in Heaven, and things in Earth, and things under the Earth.</p>
                  <p n="11">
                     <hi>11.</hi> And that every tongue should confess, that Iesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Here in these <hi>three</hi> verses wee have Christs reward according to his humane Nature, for his being humbled for us, which is by his exaltation, and that for us too: Whence wee may gather; <hi>Argument</hi> 8. to this purpose, As Christ after hee had humbled himself to reconcile men unto God, and to procure the confirmation of peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the parties, was exalted by God, and crowned with glory: so you may expect exaltation, if you humble your selves that yee may maintain the Churches concord: Therefore if yee will keep the true way to glory, you must imitate Christ, and humble your selves: for the preservation of unity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wherefore</hi>] The meaning is this. Because Christ of his own accord hath humbled himself for our sakes in our flesh, being made obedient even unto death, God hath for our sakes, and in our flesh also advanced him to the highest honour: For having raised Christ from the dead to a glorious and immortal life, hee lifted him up to the highest Heaven, and placed him at his own right hand, in dignity and authority above all creatures; hee hath according to his gracious will, and the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous dispensation of the business of our salvation, given him a name above every name, glorifying him with that glory which hee had from the beginning with the Father, (to wit, by manifesting the glory of the deity, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was obscured, and by making known the hypostatical union of the humane Nature) commanding and causing that Christ crucified should bee preached, rule, bee ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, bee called upon every where as true God, and the onely begotten Son of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>At the name</hi>] The Apostle shews how the efficacy and effect of this exaltation of Christ doth follow, <hi>viz.</hi> That every creature shall at length bee subject unto Christ, so that unless it willingly submit, it shall at last bee compelled to acknowledge his name, or his power, autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and dominion (which is expressed by a Metonymy of bending the knee.) As to heavenly things, there is no doubt but Angels and the spirits of just men shall bow the knee, that is, submit to him; for spirits properly have no knees. As to earthly things, all men shall at last, if not willingly, at least unwillingly and compelled confess Christ crucified to bee the Judge, the Lord, and the Son of God. And lastly, for things under the earth, (by which name are understood the Devils, and the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the damned, who are in prison) All those un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean spirits shall appear before his tribunal, whether they will or no, and shall yeeld to the sentence of the Judge with acknowledgement of his dominion and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty. And thus all his enemies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whoever they bee, that now oppose him, shall bow the knee unto him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And every tongue</hi>] Lastly, lest all acknowledgement of the name and power of Christ should wholly seem to bee deferred till the last judgement; hee shews that it shall come to pass, that every tongue, or that of every Country and Nation Christ shall receive glory, either in the voluntary confession and profession of the converted Gentiles, that Christ is the Lord, and that to the glory of the Father (who will bee honoured in the glorifying of his onely begotten Son) or, seeing that many shall not bee converted, it shall come to pass at last in the judgement of God, that the dominion of Christ shall bee clearly and fully manifested, when all creatures in Heaven, in Earth, and Hell, shall acknowledge him to bee the Lord.</p>

                  <hi>Vers. 12.</hi> Wherefore, my Beloved, as yee have alwayes obeyed, not as in my presence onely, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.</q>

               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 11. Yee have nothing in you that yee should boast of, or for which through contention yee should contemn one another: But every good thing in you is from God, who of his own free and gracious good will causeth in you both to will that which is good, and to perform it: Therefore yee should preserve agreement in Faith, Love, and the study of good works, and finish your begun voyage of salvation in fear and trembling, lest yee provoke and anger God working in you.</p>

                  <p>Hee adds <hi>four</hi> causes of sending him back, which would serve also for his commendation. (1) The Pastoral love of <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> towards the <hi>Philippians.</hi> (2) His trouble for the <hi>Philippians</hi> grief, because hee knew they would hear certainly of his sickness, but nothing of his recovery.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 27.</hi> For indeed hee was sick nigh unto death, but God had mercy on him; and not on him onely, but on mee also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.</q>
                  <p>Hee confirms the tydings of <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> his sickness, and commends the special grace of God shewn to <hi>Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phroditus</hi> and himself, whereby God was careful to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> to health, lest the Apostle should bee too much afflicted.</p>

                  <p n="3">(3) The joy of the <hi>Philippians</hi> was another cause. (4) The ease of the Apostles sickness, who for the <hi>Philippians</hi> sake would deprive himself of <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> his service, otherwise very necessary to him, rather than hee would suffer them any longer to want their Minister.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>IN this <hi>Chapter</hi> the Apostle exhorts them joyfully to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye upon Christ alone, or onely upon his Righteousness, Grace, and Vertue, as abundantly sufficient for holiness and happiness, that they would beware of false Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, and follow the examples of the Apostles and faithful Ministers of Christ.</p>
                  <p>There are three members of the first Exhortation contained in the three first verses. (<hi>1.</hi>) That they would rejoyce in Christ alone. (<hi>2.</hi>) That they would take heed to themselves of false Iewish teachers. (<hi>3.</hi>) That they would imitate the example of the Apostles and faithful, who do wholly adhere unto Christ.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Arguments</hi> of this Exhortation are <hi>nine,</hi> all which do urge, that cleaving unto Christ, they should follow the example of the Apostles.</p>
               </argument>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 1.</hi> Finally, my brethren, rejoyce in the Lord, to write the same things to you, to mee indeed is not grievous, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ut for you it is safe.</q>
               <p>The <hi>first</hi> member of the Exhortation, That they would rejoyce in Christ, that is, that with joy they would rest upon his Righteousness and Vertue, nor seek for any other helps to their salvation besides him: This is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded as the end of the whole former Doctrine, and as a brief of all Christian duties.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The same things] Argum.</hi> 1. By prevention of an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection. This Exhortation is so profitable for you, that it is not at all troublesome to me to inculcate &amp; repeat it often to you, nor should it bee tedious to you to hear the same often: Therefore cleave unto Christ, earnestly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing this Doctrine of his sufficiency.</p>

                  <hi>Vers. 2.</hi> Beware of Dogs, beware of evil workers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of the concision.</q>
               <p>The second member of the Exhortation is, That they would beware of false Apostles, who endeavouring after an impossibility, would joyn righteousness by the works and ceremonies of the Law, with free justification by faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dogs] Argum.</hi> 2. These false Apostles that act the part of Jews, confounding the righteousness of the Law with the righteousness of faith, and so teaching that wee must not rest only on Christs righteousness, are not holy worshippers of God, as they pretend, but <hi>unclean Dogs,</hi> barking at the pure Doctrine of the Gospel, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faming the sincere servants of Christ, with their revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings: They are not upholders of good works, but <hi>evill workers,</hi> they are not worthy to have the honour of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision, but they shall bee called authors of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision and perdition, because that by their false doctrine, they do ruine and separate both themselves and others from Christ, and of these you must take heed by reason of the imminent danger: Therefore you must relye only upon Christs Grace and Vertue.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 3.</hi> For wee are the Circumcision, which worship God in the Spirit, and rejoyce in Christ Iesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.</q>
               <p>The <hi>third</hi> member of the Exhortation is, wherein hee proposeth the example of the Apostles and faithful, who do wholly cleave unto Christ, first in general, then more particularly, further repeating the Exhortation, unto <hi>vers.</hi> 18.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wee are] Argum.</hi> 3. Onely wee Apostles, and other beleevers who rest upon Christs righteousness, are to bee honoured with the title of truly Circumcised, <hi>viz.</hi> Those (1.) who worship God with an internal and spiritual af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the heart. And (2.) who glory in Jesus Christ as the only and sufficient Saviour. (3.) Who do not place our confidence in Ceremonies, in carnal Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision, in any external priviledges, or any other such Helps: Therefore you should, as wee do, onely rest upon the Grace and Vertue of Christ, if yee will bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted truly Circumcised.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 4.</hi> Though I might also have confidence in the flesh; if any other man thinketh that hee hath where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of hee may trust in the flesh, I more.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 4. From the particular example of the Apostle, preventing an Objection: I <hi>Paul,</hi> who have more cause to glory in fleshly, or external priviledges, than any false Apostles can have, do nevertheless, renouncing all confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in priviledges, or my works, only relye on Christ, and endeavour through Christ alone to make progress in holiness unto salvation: Therefore you ought to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiesce with mee in the Grace and Vertue of Christ alone.</p>

I am circumcised, and so brought into the number of Gods people. (2.) I was circumcised the eighth day, exactly according to the Law, not as a Proselyte, but as a born Jew. (3.) I am of the most famous people of <hi>Israel.</hi> (4.) And of one of the nobler Tribes of <hi>Israel, Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min,</hi> who with <hi>Ioseph</hi> was born of the free mother, <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel,</hi> out of which Tribe, <hi>Saul</hi> the first King was chosen, after whose name it may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eem that the Apostle was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Saul.</hi> (5.) I am an <hi>Hebrew</hi> of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> that is, of such a family that hath not mingled it self by mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with the Gentiles. (6.) I was a Pharisee, which is the most famous sect among the Jews. (7.) I was forward in zeal above other Pharisees, even unto perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting the Church; this zeal though it were worst in it self, yet it was highly accounted in the eyes of those who did glory in the zeal of the Law. (8.) In outward righteousness, which may bee obtained by the Law, I was before men blameless:
<q>
                     <hi>Vers. 7.</hi> But what things were gain to mee, those I counted loss for Christ.</q>
               </p>
               <p>First hee reckons up all his priviledges, and more matter of boasting, than any false Apostles could have. And then hee casts away all these ornaments of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which were highly esteemed by the Jews: And though formerly before his conversion to Christ, hee had prized these, falsely thinking they did much conduce to salvation, yet now after hee had attained the knowledge of Christ, being instructed by the Holy Ghost, hee did vilifie them, yea for Christ, hee did account them all hurtful to him, so far as they drew him from the faith of Christ, or so far as they cost him some trouble and labour, that hee should renounce them all, and keep himself pure, lest they should any wayes hinder his faith in Christ: For it is a very difficult thing for those who excel in any thing, and have any priviledges, not at all to trust and relye upon them.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 8.</hi> Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Iesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung that I may win Christ.</q>
               <p>In the <hi>third</hi> place, besides these things which in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daism he did excell others in, hee throws away all things else: For it is known that hee converted many thousand
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:49391:72"/>
souls unto God, that hee did, and suffered many things for Christ, in which if any one might glory, hee more: yet in the matter of justification hee rejects all his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent righteousness, or all his own works which hee had done since faith, or should do, as losses and hindrances, not that it repented him of his labours, or that hee did not expect the reward, through grace promised unto them, but that those priviledges, and confidence of works would altogether hinder the application of Christs righteousness, if in the matter of justification hee should bring them to Gods Tribunal, where works exclude grace, and grace excludes works: nor did it grieve him for this loss, because it was exceedingly recompensed by the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Christs righteousness, which was imputed to him, and should bee more and more applied to him by faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For whom</hi>] Hee proves the sincerity of his purpose in rejecting all things, for the desire of having Christs righteousness, by two Signs; (1.) That hee forsook Friends, Country, and all things which could bee dear to him in the flesh; when hee first betook himself to the preaching of Christ, and the bearing of his Cross. (2.) That being rejected, hee did despise them as base things, in respect of Christs righteousness, or in respect of Christ applied by faith unto righteousness. Here the force of the Argument more clearly appears, I who may trust to outward priviledges and works, if any one may, do renounce them all, that I may relye upon the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness and Vertue of Christ: Therefore you, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That I may win Christ</hi>] Hee gives several Reasons of this his settled resolution, which may serve as Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to confirm the Exhortation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 5. I renounce all priviledges, and the merits of my own works, that I may gain Christ, who doth not communicate himself, and his Righteousness to any, but such as have renounced their own righteousness, and throw aside all confidence in their own works and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiness: Therefore you must do the same with mee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less yee will lose Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That I may win] Argum.</hi> 6. By renouncing confidence in my own works and priviledges, and imbracing Christ in their stead, I gain Christ, and all things that are Christs, so far I am from losing any thing, by this renouncing my own works and priviledges: Therefore do you likewise, as well as I, cast aside all carnal confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and win Christ by relying on him.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 9.</hi> And bee found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the Law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the Righteousness which is of God by faith.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 7. This explains the former. When God comes to judgement, I cannot bee found in Christ, but by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing my own merits, being void of all confidence in the inherent righteousness of my own works, and indued with that Righteousness of Christ, which God gives by grace, and wee apply by faith: Therefore you, as well as I, must renounce your own merits, and relye upon Christs Vertue and Righteousness, unless you will bee found out of Christ at the day of Judgement.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 10.</hi> That I may know him, and the power of his Resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death.</q>
               <p>This Verse depends upon <hi>Vers.</hi> 8. The meaning is this, I account all matter of confidence out of Christ as dung, to the end that I may know Christ, &amp;c. Whence wee have <hi>Argum.</hi> 8. I shall never bee able by experience truly to know how faithful, good, powerful, &amp;c. Christ is, unless I more and more renounce all matter or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of confidence besides Christ, nor shall I otherwise ever experimentally finde the vertue of his Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to free mee from the guilt and power of sin, nor the fellowship and vertue of his sufferings, in which consists conformity with his death; therefore I count all things but dung, that I may more and more have the benefit of this fruit: Therefore do you likewise rest upon Christ, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing your own excellencies, that yee may more and more finde his Grace and Vertue.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 11.</hi> If by any means I might attain to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of the dead.</q>
               <p>Hee explains what hee had said of the Communion of Christs sufferings and conformity with his death, and adds <hi>Argum.</hi> 9. To this purpose. After that I have now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced all my priviledges, and all the worth of my own works, as dung, that I might win Christ, though I know I must tread Christs steps in my journey to salvation, by the continual sorrows of the Cross, and the communion of his sufferings, yet I shall think I have done well if I may any waies at length attain the perfection of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and happiness in the resurrection of the dead: Bee yee therefore of the same mind with mee, and do as I do.</p>

And in this place hee proposeth himself for an example to them, by removing an objection. Some one might say, O blessed <hi>Paul,</hi> who hath renounced all things, that hee might know Christ, and gain him, and who is now made so conformable to Christ, that there is nothing wanting to him, but the reward of immortality: Hee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers that this is not the meaning of his words: as if hee should have said, I do not speak this as if I had attained the perfection of Holiness, or were already perfected, but I follow after the prize of perfection.

                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 5. Besides mee you have other servants of God which tread the same way that I do in the matter of doctrine and conversation, who teach nothing but Faith in Christ, and holiness to bee obtained by him: Therefore follow yee those examples.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 18.</hi> (For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ:</q>
                  <p>

There are many Teachers, false Apostles, and false Brethren, who are enemies to the Cross of Christ, that is, who teach that sins may bee expiated, and men saved, otherwise than by the Cross of Christ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and who will not profess the truth of Christ where there is any danger of the Cross, or of persecution: Therefore do yee the more diligently observe and imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the manner of my doctrine and life, and of other such Pastors like mee.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Told you often</hi>] Hee confirms this Argument touching their shunning of Impostors (who did draw men from the Righteousness and Holiness, which is by the Cross of Christ) with <hi>seven</hi> Reasons.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. Because this is not the first time, But I have often formerly fore-warned you of the comming of these vile fellows.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Weeping] Reas.</hi> 2. Because now weeping I advise you to beware of them, seriously grieving that such men have crept into the Church, and are received by some for true Teachers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Enemies] Reas.</hi> 3. Because they are Christs enemies in this very thing, that they are enemies to the virtue of Christs sufferings: and who will not bear the Cross of Christ for the defence of the Truth.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 19.</hi> Whose end is destruction, whose God is their belly, and whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things.)</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Whose end] Reas.</hi> 4. Because those Impostors shall perish, and as many as follow their waies: Therefore shun them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Belly] Reas.</hi> 5. Because they are servants and lovers of their own belly, that is, they care neither for God, nor the salvation of men, but onely their own gluttony and pleasures.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Glory] Reas.</hi> 6. Because that glory which they seek among men by their riches, prosperity, and carnal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives, shall bee their disgrace.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Earthly things] Reas.</hi> 7. Because they onely savour earthly things, as riches, honours, friends, gluttony, pleasures, and such like: Therefore yee that desire a spiritual and heavenly life must shun them.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 20.</hi> For our conversation is in Heaven, from whence also wee look for the Saviour, the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ,</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 7. Our condition is very heavenly, who trusting onely in the grace and virtue of Christ, strive for profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency in holiness: Wee are true Inhabitants of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and therein wee are conversant in mind and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, where wee shall sometime bee glorified: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore follow our example. But the happiness of true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers is declared in these <hi>four</hi> things. (1) That wee have right unto the heavenly City, wherein wee are now conversant in mind and affection, as Citizens of the Kingdome which is above. (2) That knowing Christ is corporally and locally in Heaven, wee expect him to come from thence at the last day, not as a Judge, who will condemn us, but as our Saviour, who will perfectly accomplish our salvation.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 21.</hi> Who shall change our vile bodie, that it may bee fashioned like unto his glorious body, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the working whereby hee is able even to subdue all things.</q>
                  <p n="3">(3) That though our bodies are now corruptible, vile and miserable, yet Christ will hereafter throughly change them, as to the condition which they are now in, and free them from corruption.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fashioned</hi>] That (4] Christ will make our bodies conformable unto his glorious body, that as Christs bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy continues the same, as to substance and lineaments, as it was in the earth, but is changed in qualities; so our bodies also shall remain the same in substance, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing freed from their base, shall bee adorned with glorious qualities.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>According to the working</hi>] Hee confirms the certainty of this future condition from Christs power and efficacy, whereby hee can destroy death and the grave, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject all creatures unto himself, and therefore is able to endow our bodies with what qualities hee please.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>THere remains now the <hi>last</hi> way of confirming the <hi>Philippians</hi> in Faith and Holiness, by some Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations, and a Commendation of their liberality to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him.</p>
                  <p>There are especially <hi>two</hi> parts of the <hi>Chapter</hi>: In the <hi>first</hi> hee exhorts them unto Christian virtues, <hi>unto vers. 10.</hi> In the <hi>other</hi> hee shews his gratitude towards the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippians</hi> for that present which they sent him, <hi>to vers. 20.</hi> After these follows the conclusion of the whole <hi>Epistle.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 1.</hi> Therefore, my Brethren, dearly beloved and longed for, my Ioy and Crown, so stand fast in the Lord, my dearly beloved.</q>
               <p>The Exhortations to Christian Virtues are <hi>seven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">(1) That they would safely keep the Doctrine of Christs Grace and Virtue, stedfastly persevering in Faith and Holiness. The Arguments hereof are two, (1) From the earnest love which the person exhorting bears towards them, which hee discovers by various compellations. (2) Yee have hitherto been so constant, and have so profited in the Faith of the Gospel, that you have brought both joy and credit to mee your Teacher: Therefore hold on still.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 2.</hi> I beseech <hi>Euodias,</hi> and beseech <hi>Syntiche,</hi> that they bee of the same mind in the Lord.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Exhort.</hi> (2) Is particular, unto two women that were no mean ones in the Church, who, as it seems, did not agree with the Church in matters pertaining to Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and were at variance betwixt themselves, these hee entreats by name, that laying aside disagreement in opinions and affections, they would maintain such a holy and sincere peace, as God should approve of.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 3.</hi> And I intreat thee also, true yoak fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, help those Women which laboured with mee in
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:49391:73"/>
the Gospel, with <hi>Clement</hi> also, and with other my fellow-labourers, whose names are in the book of life.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Exhort.</hi> (3) To some one of the Pastors, who was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate with the Apostle, and better known to him than others, that hee would do his indeavour to reduce these women to the right way, and to agreement betwixt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. The reason i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, Because that when the Apostle did first gather a Church at <hi>Philippi,</hi> these two women did earnestly labour and strive, according to their place, to promote the business of the Gospel, together with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther brethren, whereof <hi>Clement</hi> was one, and some other private beleevers who were the Apostles helpers in ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering the Church of the <hi>Philippians,</hi> all which though it were needless to name, yet hee sayes their names were written in the book of life, that is, they are of the Elect, which may suffice them.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 4.</hi> Rejoyce in the Lord alway; and again I say, Rejoyce.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Exhort.</hi> (4.) That acknowledging the matter of joy in Christ, they would rejoyce with stedfast gladness in both prosperity and adversity, and in every change of their condition whatsoever.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 5.</hi> Let your moderation bee known unto all men. The Lord is at hand.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Exhort.</hi> (5.) That they would not deal in strictness of Law with their neighbours, but rather considering their condition, lose something of their own right, that every one might take notice of this their moderation. The reason is, because the Lord is in the midst of us, by the presence of his Spirit, and also his visible coming to Judgement is not far off.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 6.</hi> Bee carefull for nothing: but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, let your requests bee made known unto God.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Exhort.</hi> (6.) That endeavouring to fulfil their duties, they would take heed of having a distrustful carefulness in any business, and that in prayer and supplication with thanksgiving they would cast their cares into the lap of God.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 7.</hi> And the peace of God which passeth all under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, shall keep your hearts and mindes through Christ Iesus.</q>
               <p>The reason of the Exhortation is, because by this means they might gain that peace or tranquillity of minde (transcending any capacity of natural reason) which God hath granted to beleevers, as if thereby hee would guard their hearts by a kinde of Military engine, against the temptations of the Devil and the world, and would preserve their mindes stedfast in Christ.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 8.</hi> Finally brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there bee any virtue, and if there bee any praise, think on these things.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Exhort.</hi> (7.) That they would not bee averse from any vertue which they observed among the Heathens, but on the other side, after a serious examination would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace whatever they found true, grave, or honourable, just, and pure, and whatever was lovely in manners, or worthy of commendation.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 9.</hi> Those things which yee have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in mee, do; and the God of peace shall bee with you.</q>
               <p>Hee confirms this Exhortation by <hi>two</hi> Arguments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. From his own example, that the Apostle had both taught and done these things when hee was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, as they themselves could witness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the God] Argum.</hi> 2. From the blessed effect, that by this means, they should finde the peace of God, and communion with the God of peace more firm and constant.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>second</hi> part of the Chapter follows, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in that hee may shew his thankfulness to the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippians,</hi> for the money they sent him by <hi>Epaphroditus,</hi> hee commends this their action by ten Arguments. (1.) Because that relief sent from them was very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to him. (2.) Because the sending of that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent did proceed from the vertue and habit of Christian liberallty which was in them, which habit like a living root, had manifested it self in this action. <hi>Argum.</hi> (3.) Because hereby it might bee perceived their backward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to send this succour, was not caused by any defect of charity, but want of opportunity.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vers. 11.</hi> Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned in whatsoever state I am, therewith to bee content.</p>
                     <p n="12">
                        <hi>12.</hi> I know both how to bee abased, and I know how to abound; every where, and in all things I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed, both to bee full, and to bee hungry, both to abound and suffer need.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>By the way in preventing an Objection, hee removes a suspicion of himself, as if hee had been more sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full before the receiving of this succour, or that for his own sake hee was glad of the money sent to him: This hee proves by his own equanimity and moderation of minde in every condition, that hee was one who had learned to bear both prosperity and adversity with an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual minde, and was ever content with the present main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of his life.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 13.</hi> I can do all things through Christ which strengthneth mee.</q>
                  <p>Hee ascribes the glory of this equanimity and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate minde in all things unto Christ, by vertue of whom he was inabled thereunto.</p>

                     <hi>Vers. 14.</hi> Notwithstanding, yee have well done that you did communicate with my affliction.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> (4.) Hee commends their deed, in that it was a communicating with his affliction.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 15.</hi> Now yee <hi>Philippians</hi> know also, that in the beginning of the Gospel, when I departed from <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia,</hi> no Church communicated with mee, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning giving and receiving, but yee only.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum</hi> 5. Because they only of all the Churches in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> from the first preaching of the Gospel, until that time, had communicated with him, by way of giving and receiving.</p>

               </p>
               <p>In the <hi>second</hi> part hee gives common Precepts pertaining to the right instruction of the faithful in their conversations, wherewith hee mixes certain special directions, serviceable to the directing of all orders in the Family, <hi>Chap. 3. and 4.</hi>

               <p>In the direction of the Epistle, <hi>First</hi> of all the persons saluting, <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Timothy,</hi> are described: <hi>Paul</hi> from the authority of his embassage, granted immediately from Christ, and from God the Father, through the mediation of Christ, by whose will hee executed his Apostleship: But <hi>Timothy</hi> (whom hee took to bee the witness of his Apostolical diligence for the confirming the <hi>Colossians</hi>) is described from his fellowship with <hi>Paul,</hi> as his Brother, not onely for profession of Faith, but also for the office of preaching the same Gospel.</p>
               <q>

               <p>Furthermore, the persons saluted are described, or the Members of the <hi>Colossian</hi> Church, and are called.

                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:49391:74"/>
is by giving thanks for their sincere conversion. Of this kind there are <hi>seven</hi> Arguments, all which do prove that the <hi>Colossians</hi> ought to bee strengthened in Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. You gave mee much cause of thanksgiving and prayer to God, after I heard of your conversion to the Faith: Therefore even upon this account you ought to bee stedfast in the Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And love] Argum.</hi> 2. The sincerity of your Faith in Christ appeared openly in your love towards all the Saints, the report whereof came to my hearing: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is fit you should bee stablished in the Faith.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 5.</hi> For the hope which is laid up for you in Heaven, whereof yee heard before in the word of the Truth of the Gospel,</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 3. I know of a truth that the happiness yee hope for is laid up in Heaven for you, and as it were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon you, I give thanks to God for that favour: Therefore, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Yee heard] Argum.</hi> 4. Confirming the former; You have the unquestionable Word of God, the Word of Gospel-Truth, for the foundation of your Faith and Hope: Therefore ought you to bee stedfast in the Faith.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 6.</hi> Which is come unto you, as it is in all the world, and bringeth forth fruit, as it doth also in you, since the day yee heard of it, and knew the Grace of God in truth.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 5. The Word of the Gospel, whereby yee are converted, is the same Gospel which was dispersed abroad to the rest of the world, and hath the same effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy to make you fruitful from the day wherein by Faith yee imbraced the Grace of God, which hee hath communicated to other Christian-Churches: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is fitting you should bee established in the Faith.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 7.</hi> As yee also learned of <hi>Epaphras,</hi> our dear Fellow-servant, who is for you a faithful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of Christ:</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 6. Your Pastor <hi>Epaphras,</hi> taught you no other things than wee Apostles every where teach, who therefore willingly acknowledge <hi>Epaphras</hi> our fellow-servant, and a faithful Minister of Christ: Therefore, &amp;c.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 8.</hi> Who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 7. You have given a special token of your sincere Faith, <hi>viz.</hi> the demonstration of your Christian love towards mee, whereof I have the testimony of <hi>Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phras</hi> your Minister; which, as all the former, affords mee Arguments of thanksgiving unto God, and of the confirmation of your Faith towards God.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 9.</hi> For this cause wee also, since the day wee heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that yee might bee filled with the knowledge of his Will, in all wisdome and spiritual understanding.</q>
               <p>The <hi>second</hi> way of confirming the <hi>Colossians</hi> Faith, and of the Apostles love towards them, is his earnest and constant prayer for them, excited upon the report of their Faith in Christ, and love towards the Saints; there are <hi>six</hi> branches of his prayer.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) I pray that yee may obtain a large measure of knowledge of the Divine Will revealed in the Word of the Gospel concerning Christ and his benefits.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In all Wisdome</hi>] (2) I pray that this knowledge may abound in you in wisdome and spiritual understanding, <hi>i. e.</hi> in an holy contemplation of the mysteries of Faith, and in a prudent application of knowledge received to practice in the exercise of every virtue.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 10.</hi> That yee might walk worthy of the Lord un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God.</q>
               <p>I pray (3) That you may walk, or lead your lives, worthy of the Lord, or as it becomes those that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted in the sight of God, that in all things you may please him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Every</hi>] I pray (4) That you may bee fruitful, not in one, but in all kinds of good works.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>May increase</hi>] I pray (5) That you may grow up in experience, and acknowledgement of the Divine Virtue through obedience of his Will, endeavouring more and more to know, love, and cleave to him more and more.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 11.</hi> Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience and long-suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, with joyfulness:</q>
               <p>I pray (6) That such a measure of heavenly strength may bee vouchsafed to you, out of the rich treasury of his glorious power, that you may bee able to endure any burden of afflictions, or persecution, with a good cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and that so long as it shall seem good to the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of God, not onely without disturbance of mind, but with the greatest delight, and rejoycing: Therefore yee ought to bee established in the Faith, unless you think the prayers which the Holy Ghost stirs up in my heart for you are in vain.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 12.</hi> Giving thanks unto the Father which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light.</q>
               <p>The third way of confirming their Faith, is a thankful declaration of the certainty of our Redemption, founded in the Grace of God, and the excellency of Christs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. The reasons of the thanksgiving are <hi>five.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. Because God the Father hath prepared us to enter into the Kingdome of Heaven: This benefit is more especially seen in the following Reasons. (1) The donor of the benefit, is God the Father, the Author and first Fountain of all good, bearing a Fatherly affection towards us. (2) When wee are said to bee made meet, &amp;c. Our misery is presupposed, and that wee are unfit by nature, born wretched, and pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by sin, and the sons of wrath. (3) Although wee were unmeet, yet the Grace of God hath made us meet by an efficacious vocation, and regeneration of us. (4) The felicity whereunto wee are called, is an endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring inheritance, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which is given by lot, it is not obtained by any humane merit, but by free election, and once given, it is not taken away. (5) It is called the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of Saints, because by that wee shall have socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with the Saints alone, whose communion makes the Inheritance more delightful to us. (6) This Inheritance consisteth in the most perfect light, <hi>viz.</hi> of Knowledge, Holiness, Joy, Glory, immortal and eternal life.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 13.</hi> Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the Kingdome of his dear Son,</q>
               <p>The 2. <hi>Reas.</hi> Of his thanksgiving explaineth the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, because the Father hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Son of his love; This benefit is commended to us by these <hi>four</hi> things. (1) Because power is used to our perverse nature, and the power of Satan, by whom wee are kept bound, from whence God by force hath delivered us. (2) Because hee hath delivered us from the darkness of ignorance, sin and misery. (3) because hee hath not suffered us, being delivered, to wander and erre without a King and defender, without governance and society, but hath translated us into a better King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Kingdome of Light, Knowledge, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity, and spiritual life, where wee may safely and secure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inhabit, that wee fall not back, or bee brought again into darkness. (4) Because the Kingdome into which wee are translated, is the Kingdome of his Son, a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome most pleasant to God, wherein the Son of God, the Son of his love, ruleth and reigneth, whom the Father intimately loves, and doth represent himself a Father in his love towards us, whose Kingdome and all things are most beloved by God, yea in whose Kingdome all sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects are beloved Sons.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 14.</hi> In whom wee have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins.</q>
               <p>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:49391:75"/>The 3. Reason of his thanksgiving is the benefit of his liberty from the revenging Justice of God; this benefit more especially appears in these <hi>five</hi> things. (1) Wee are not onely kept by force in the power of darkness, that wee might bee delivered from thence, a greater strength was required, but also wee were captives to the Law and Righteousness, from whence without a price paid, wee cannot bee freed, and where that price is already paid, there is made already a lawful redemption. (2) Wee have this our redemption made by the consent of parties upon the <hi>best right.</hi> (3) Wee have the same redemption in the person of the Son, who is our Advocate, and hee who keepeth us and all ours. (4) Wee have that by the blood of the Son, who existing in the image of God, <hi>i. e.</hi> true God, hath taken upon him our nature, and in that made obedient unto the death of the Cross, hath paid the price of Redemption for us. (5) This Redemption is free in respect of us, who have paid nothing, and yet obtain the remission of sins, and consequently also free liberty from wrath and death which follow upon sin.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 15.</hi> Who is the Image of the invisible God, the first born of every Creature.</q>
               <p>The 4. Reason of his thanksgiving, shewing the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity of the foundation of Redemption in the description of the excellency of Christ the Redeemer, of which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription there are twelve Articles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Image] Artic.</hi> 1. Christ is the most perfect Image of the invisible God, not onely because hee is the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial Character of the Fathers person, substantially representing the Father, that so the Father cannot bee beholden unless in the Son, and brightness of him, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so because the incarnate Son hath represented to the world, in word and deed, in sanctity, power, and mercy, the Fathers Nature, Will, and Goodness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The first born] Artic.</hi> 2. Christ is the first born of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Creature, <hi>i. e.</hi> begotten from eternity before every Creature, and because of his eternal Generation of the Father, hee is the Lord of all Creatures by right, as the first born, in the Law, is Lord of his Brethren, and the Family.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 16.</hi> For <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y him were all things created that are in Heaven, and that are in Earth, visible and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible, whether they bee thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Artic.</hi> 3. Illustrating the former: Christ is the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cause, or the Creator of all Creatures, For by him were all things created: hee amplifies this Article by a threefold distribution of the Creatures. (1) From the place wherein they are, in Heaven and in Earth. (2) From their nature, into visible and invisible. (3) From the division of Angels, both from their dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, office, and honourable names: From which the glory of Christ appeareth who hath created all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>From him] Artic.</hi> 4. Christ is the end of all; for whom, and for whose glory all things were created: For all things whatsoever, and of what sort soever were created, all these were created for the glory of Christ, God-man, hee is the beginning and end of all, to whose glory it is necessary all things whatsoever in their manner should be serviceable, as the means to the end.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 17.</hi> And hee is before all things, and by him all things consist.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Artic.</hi> 5. Christ is eternal, because hee in himself was before all Creatures, neither is hee any thing changed, by the Creatures, as to his subsistence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>By him] Artic.</hi> 6. Christ is not onely the Creatour, but is the preserver and conserver of all.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 18.</hi> And hee is the head of the body, the Church: who is the beginning, the first born from the dead, that in all things hee might have the preheminence:</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Artic.</hi> 7. Christ is the Head of the Church, <hi>i. e.</hi> of his body, from whence the vital spirits, sense, and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual motion floweth through all the members, who both governeth and defendeth all of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The beginning] Artic.</hi> 8. Christ is the beginning, fountain, and spring of the Church, <hi>viz.</hi> that new <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> the root and principle of the regeneration of the Saints, by whose virtue all Saints are begotten.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The first born] Artic.</hi> 9. Christ is the first born from the dead, and the first fruits of them that slept; because hee alone hath risen by his own strength, and is the cause of the resurrection of the dead to life everlasting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That in] Artic.</hi> 10. Hee hath the preheminence in all, and ought to have amongst Angels and men, amongst the living and dead; And this is the end of the former degrees of the excellency of Christ.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 19.</hi> For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell,</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Artic.</hi> 11. Confirming the preheminence of Christ, and the dignity of his preheminence, because from the good Will of God, not onely the fulness of the gifts of the Spirit dwell in the Man Christ, but also the God-head it self, most fully comprehending all fulness.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 20.</hi> And (having made Peace through the blood of his cross) by him to reconcile all things unto himself, by him, I say, whether they bee things in Earth, or things in Heaven.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Artic.</hi> 12. Christ by the good will and purpose of God is a Mediatour, by whom God would have expiation for sin made (his life being laid down upon the Cross) and expiation being made by his death, hee would that reconciliation and a renewing of friendship betwixt God and them should bee made, that are the members of the Church: no less betwixt God and those members which are in the Earth, than betwixt God and those that are in Heaven: yea, hee would have reconciliation made in himself, or by the intuition of his glory amongst the heavenly Angels, and earthly men, amongst whom, by reason of sin there is a natural disagreeing. Lastly, Hee would have the Elect Angels to bee confirmed, whose various and changeable nature is already demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated by the fall of wicked Angels, and that by a ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of them together to himself. For the Angels are added to Christ as a surplusage in the Covenant of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, for the use of his body, that is, the Church, that they might bee ministring spirits for the use of the redeemed ones. All which as they did confirm the solidity and certainty of Redemption, so the Faith of the <hi>Colossians</hi> very much in Christ, and ought also to confirm ours.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 21.</hi> And you that were sometimes alienated, and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath hee reconciled,</p>
                  <p n="22">
                     <hi>22.</hi> In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy, and unblameable, and unreprovable in his sight.</p>
               </q>
               <p>The 5. Reason of his thanksgiving is the grace of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation made with the <hi>Colossians</hi> by name. Hee am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifies this benefit by nine Arguments. (1) Hee saith, that you were sometimes alienated from God, strangers from the Common-wealth of <hi>Israel,</hi> and the life of God. (2) Yee were not onely born strangers, but were made more and more strangers by the custome of sinning. (3) Neither this onely, but yee were enemies, and with an hostile mind did both disdain and speak against God. (4) That you were enemies, not only in your sensitive appetite, and your affections, but also in your mind, which should bee the most excellentest faculty, the Mistress and Captain of all the rest. (5) That yee have expressed the enmities conceived in your mind by wicked works. (6) That nevertheless Christ now hath recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled you. (7) That hee hath obtained reconciliation in taking upon him, in the body of his flesh, the humane nature, like to us in all things, sin onely excepted. (8) That by his death hee hath paid the price of your Redemption and Reconciliation. (9) That Christ hath determined with himself that at length you should remain holy in his sight, and the sight of God, without any spot of sin and misery, <hi>viz.</hi> to the day of his comming, all which did chiefly make for the upholding of their Faith.</p>

                  <hi>Vers. 23.</hi> If yee continue in the faith, grounded and settled, and bee not moved away from the hope of the Gospel, which yee have heard, and which was preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to every creature which is under heaven, whereof I <hi>Paul</hi> am made a Minister.</q>
               <p>The <hi>fourth</hi> manner of confirming the <hi>Colossians</hi> faith follows, by an exhortation to perseverance in the faith of the Gospel, to which hee passeth, giving a caution for this end, that hee might suspend the benefit commonly applied to them, given, as it were, the Characteristical note of them, to whom the benefit of reconciliation belongs, <hi>viz.</hi> That they who have right to these benefits may remain in the faith of Christ, upon which the other degrees of perseverance depend. The Arguments of the Exhortation are chiefly <hi>three.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If] Argum.</hi> 1. It is contained in the condition of perseverance. Your constancy in the faith of Christ, and hope of the Gospel, is a sign, not onely of your reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation made through Christ, but also of your holiness and salvation to bee perfected by him: Therefore per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severe yee. In the mean while three things are required to their perseverance. (1) That they bee grounded in the faith, that is, that they lay hold upon the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of faith solidly laid in the truth, goodness, and power of God. (2) That they bee settled, <hi>i. e.</hi> Now they are grounded in Christ, they may fixedly abide, may adhere to Christ, and bee joyned to this truth. (3) That they resist all temptations, with which they may by any manner bee moved from the hope of eternal life, or the good things promised in the Gospel: The force of this Argument is, you shall not possess the good things fore-spoken of, except you have persevered in the faith: Therefore persevere yee.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Preached] Argum.</hi> 2. Of his exhortation to perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance: The Gospel which you have heard from <hi>Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phras</hi> your Pastor, is the same with the Gospel preached by the other servants of God to every creature through the whole world, or all kindes of men, Jews and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles without difference: Therefore abide you founded and settled in the same faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whereof] Argum.</hi> 3. I <hi>Paul</hi> my self am made a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster to preach this Gospel to the Gentiles, with great ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation from God, and his blessing poured upon all that are faithful amongst the Gentiles. Therefore per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severe yee in that faith.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 24.</hi> Who now rejoyce in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behinde of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh, for his bodies sake, which is the Church.</q>
               <p>Hee insists in this Argument, and commendeth his Ministry to them, by <hi>fourteen</hi> Arguments, all which confirm his glorious Ministry.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. I <hi>Paul</hi> in the administration of this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel do bear afflictions with joy: Therefore my Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry is glorious.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. I bare those afflictions for the sake of you <hi>Colossians,</hi> or for your confirmation in the faith: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my Ministry is glorious amongst you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 3. Seeing that after the personal sufferings of Christ for our redemption, the suffering of the Martyrs remain for a testimony of the truth of Christs doctrine, I <hi>Paul</hi> in some part do so fill up the appointed measure of those afflictions, that I am prepared to seal this my Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, even with my death: Therefore this my Ministry is glorious.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 4. I suffer these afflictions for Christs honour, and his whole Churches edification, <hi>viz.</hi> That his mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal body may bee knit together in faith: Therefore my Ministry is glorious. All these make to the taking away the offence of the Cross incumbent upon the Apostle.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 25.</hi> Wherefore I am made a Minister, according to the dispensation of God which is given to mee for you, to fulfil the word of God:</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 5. I am appointed a Minister of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, and am made an Apostle of the Gentiles, both by special authority, and divine dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Therefore is my Ministry glorious.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To fulfil] Arg.</hi> 6. I am constituted an Apostle, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for this end, that fully manifesting the Gospel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Gentiles I might fulfil by my Ministry, not onely my Office, but also the Decree of God, and the Prophecies concerning the calling of the Gentiles, and the grace of Christ which was to come unto them: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this my Ministry is glorious.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 26.</hi> Even the Mystery that hath been bid from ages, and from generations, but now is made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest to his Saints:</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 7. This word of the Gospel administred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst you, and the preaching of it afterwards amongst the Gentiles, was in times past a mystery; But now is laid open to the faithful by us Apostles more plainly than ever since the beginning of the world: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, &amp;c.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 27.</hi> To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Would] Argum.</hi> 8. The revelation of this mystery by my Ministry is made to the Saints, not from their merit, but from the good pleasure of God: Therefore, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The riches] Argum.</hi> 9. Glorious and rich is the grace of this mystery now revealed, opening clearly all things which make for our compleat felicity: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Christ] Argum.</hi> 10. The summe of this glorious and rich grace manifested by my Ministry, is Christ received by faith, and dwelling in you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The hope] Argum.</hi> 11. Christ preached by mee, and dwelling in you by faith, is the hope of future glory, now manifested in the earnest and first fruits, <hi>viz.</hi> Because Christ is the author, pledge, and finisher of our faith: For the faithful seek no other glory than that they may enjoy Christ more and more in this life, and at length fully in the life to come.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 28.</hi> Whom wee preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdome, that wee may present every man perfect in Christ Iesus.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 12. The end of my Ministry and Christ preached, is this, that I might admonish and instruct men of all sorts in the Doctrine of the Gospel, which is the most perfect wisdome, that at length I may present be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers perfect in all points of holiness and happiness in Christ, in the sight of God: Therefore this my Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry is glorious.</p>

                  <hi>Vers. 29.</hi> Whereunto I also labour, striving according to his working, which worketh in mee mightily.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 13. Hitherto by the grace of God I do earnestly prosecute my Ministry, striving against all ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and impediments that were laid against mee. From whence my Ministry is made glorious.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>According to his working] Argum.</hi> 14. Lastly, through the grace and power of God working in mee, my Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry is made powerfull and effectuall to the appointed effect, <hi>i. e.</hi> to the salvation of the elect, and conviction of others: All which, as they are Arguments of the commendation of <hi>Pauls</hi> Ministry, so also they are so many Arguments of exhortation to the <hi>Colossians,</hi> That they would persevere in the faith of the Gospel preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Paul.</hi> For it follows upon all: Therefore abide yee constant, and go forward in the faith of the Gospel, the Ministry whereof is so glorious.</p>

                  <hi>All</hi>] (4) I wish, and I have no mean conflict, that all those Churches may bee joyned together in Faith and Hope. This more especially is explicated, for hee endeavoured, that they might get <hi>understanding</hi>: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Faith ought not to bee blind, or ignorant, nor that they might onely have some taste of Faith, but that they might obtain a <gap reason="foreign">

Lastly, Hee most specially in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured, that they might profit in acknowledging the mystery concerning the unity of the divine essence, and the distinction of persons, and the offices of the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour Christ, and more and more applying those things to their use, might aquiesce in the knowledge, and first fruits of so great a good, until they should injoy a full felicity by Christ.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. It is in vain to seek any thing necessary to salvation out of Christ, seeing that in him, or in his person, the fulness of the God-head hypostatically united to the humane nature, is founded, so that, hee necessarily seeks something to salvation out of God, who seeks things that may bring salvation out of Christ: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee must not depart from Christ.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. Christ is not onely a most full fountain in himself, but also hee fills all the faithful beleeving in him, insomuch that hee communicates to them righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness and life eternal (which hee hath in himself) first by way of imputation, further by the infusion of grace for grace, till at length they are perfected. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee must not seek for any thing out of him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The head] Argum.</hi> 3. Hee is the head of all Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality and Power, even of the most excellent creatures in heaven and earth, partly because hee created and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns all things, even the Angels themselves; partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause by the influence of his power, hee upholds even the Angels, and also men, communicating to them whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they injoy: Therefore from him alone, and in no wise from the most excellent Angels, do wee expect any good.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 4. The truth of all Legal ceremonies is in Christ; for in him the faithful have that which is prefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured by them; as for example, they have spiritual Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision wrought by the Spirit of Christ in the heart, which consists in the subduing of the old man, or the flesh, or the body of sin, which Circumcision was prefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured in the carnal Circumcision, made by hands: Therefore it is not fit that you should in the carnal Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision of those that Judaize, seek anything out of Christ.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 12.</hi> Buried with him in Baptism, wherein also you are risen with him through the faith of the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of God, who hath raised him from the dead.</q>

                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 5. Yee that beleeve in Christ are baptized, which is the lawful sign of internal Circumcision, set up in the place of Circumcision by Christ; so that neither the internal thing, yea, nor the external sign of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal thing is to bee sought after without Christ: Therefore you must not depart from Christ.</p>

This benefit is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a quickning together with Christ (although Christ had risen some years before they were converted) because in what moment soever any one is by faith united to Christ, in the same moment is hee united to him, now reigning in heaven, yea in his dying, burial, and rising again after a judicial or forinsical manner, so that in all things, in which hee hath, or doth sustain our person, it is no less than if wee had in a Physical manner, been present, and consented to every act of his, in our behalf.</p>

The Covenant of works is an hand-writing, established partly in threatnings, partly in appointed positive Ceremonials (excluding the Gentiles from the Church) was against us, and contrary to us. But Christ hath blotted out this hand-writing, taking it out of the way, and nailing it to his Cross: Therefore you must not look back to the legal Covenant or ceremonial appointments in them, to seek for any thing, neither must yee depart in the least from the death of Christ (by which yee are delivered from that hand-writing.) Hee compares this Covenant of works, with its appurtenances, to an hand-writing, by which any one bindes himself for the paying of a debt; for whosoever are convicted of sin by the light of nature, are also by the force of the Covenant of Works, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to wrath, and as often as wee are convinced of sin, so often also by nature wee confirm the punishment of sin, or the condition of the legal Covenant, by the judgement of our consciences against our selves, as by an hand-writing: The conscience of every one performs this much more, which hath received the written Law, and daily bears the punishment of the Law, for the breaking of it. But chiefly all justiciaries are compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to subscribe to this hand-writing, who acknowledge no righteousness besides inherent, or that which is by works: Of which number were those that Judaized,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:49391:77"/>
and observeers of Ceremonies, who adhered to this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, seeking Righteousness by works, and the appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Ceremonies: For by how much they did indeavour by this means more manifestly to establish their own Righteousness, by so much the more openly they did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive the punishment of the Law broken, by the force of the Covenant, upon themselves: For no man enters a Covenant, but hee also admits all the conditions of the Covenant.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>hand-writing</hi> is said to bee in Ordinances, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther subscribed to Ordinances, so far as they took upon them those commands, or Legal Ordinances, that they might bee perfected in themselves, they did withall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige themselves to bear the punishment of the breach of those commands.</p>
                  <p>Hee calls it the hand-writing <hi>against us,</hi> or contrary to us, partly because it separated the Jews from the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, and the Gentiles from the Jews; Partly because it was a yoak, which neither they nor their Fathers could bear; Partly because as often as they did any work of the Law, either moral or ceremonial to bee justified thereby, so often by the imperfection of their work, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of their imperfection in the use of the Levitical Ceremonies, they did argue themselves guilty, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did acknowledge themselves guilty of death. As for example, when they offered Sacrifices, and did repeat them, they not onely acknowledged themselves sinners a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Moral Law, but did also really confess that their frequent Sacrifices could not purge their conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from sin, and so the hand-writing of the Covenant of works was alwaies contrary to them: But Christ hath blotted out this hand-writing, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his Cross, insomuch as hee for the sake of them that were his, hath paid for the redeemed the penalty due upon the hand-writing by the death of his Cross, and hath compleated and abolished the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive Ordinances concerning those vanishing Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, by the real Sacrifice of his own body once offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>

Christ hath brought all the Devils, who exercise their power and tyranny upon the Elect, overthrown by the price of Redemption paid upon the Cross, and gloriously triumpheth over them openly in the sight of God, Angels and men (whose eyes are open) unto their own disgrace, and our deliverance: Therefore it remains that nothing is to bee sought out of Christ.</p>
                  <p>The Devils are called <hi>Principalities</hi> and <hi>Powers,</hi> (1) Because in the world they potently exercise autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over all the reprobate children of disobedience, and all the unregenerate, which do nothing else, but exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the will of the Devil. (2) Because they are Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geants executing the judgement of God, holding those captive that are not reconciled to God in Christ. (3) Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they fight against Christ the Redeemer, neither do they dismiss the redeemed and reconciled from the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of darkness, unless compelled by the stronger power of Christ.</p>
                  <p>They are said to bee <hi>spoiled</hi> by Christ on the Cross, (1) Inasmuch as Christ, paying the price of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, hath obtained by Covenant of the Father, that all the redeemed should bee delivered from the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of darkness, ignorance, sin and death. (2) Inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as Christ, infinite in power, when hee had once satisfied justice on the Cross, broke the bars and chains of sin, judgement, and the Law, wherewith the Devil, held the redeemed bound, that henceforth they cannot have any power. (3) Inasmuch as hee hath made his redeemed his possession, and peculiar people, that they might not any longer bee the flock of Satan.</p>
                  <p>Christ is said to have made <hi>a shew of the Devils,</hi> and to have openly triumphed on the Cross, (1) Inasmuch as hee hath valiantly received, overcome, and extinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all their temptations and poisoned darts, whether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately cast by them against him hanging on the Cross, or hurled by the poisonous tongues of furious ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries, or brandished by the provocation of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude of his Disciples flying from him. (2) Inasmuch as Christ hath turned the malice of the Devils, all their subtilties and machinations (by which they sought his life, incessantly stirring up their slaves to crucifie him till hee hanged upon the Cross) to their own destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and to the most open ruine of their dominion. (3) Inasmuch as hee hath shewn himself Lord of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, by signs and wonders in the very time of his crucifying. (4) Inasmuch as hee hath shewn open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his power by converting the thief hanging at his right hand, and the Centurion standing at his feet. (5) Inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the price of Redemption being already paid, the Conqueror, not onely in the sight of God, and Angels, but also in the sight of these Devils, and also in the bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of all beholders, cryed out, that his work was finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that to his own eternal glory, and the perpetual ignominy of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The <hi>third</hi> part of the <hi>Chapter,</hi> in which by way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence hee brings in a special admonition to beware of some special corruptions of the false Apostles.</p>
                  <p>The admonitions are three. (1) That they do not regard the judgement and censure of any who shall dare to condemn them for not observing of <hi>Mosaical</hi> Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies; as for example, for meat or drink, or for neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting an holy-day, or an part of any holy-day, or for not observing the Sabbath of the Jews.</p>

                  <p>The reason of the admonition is, Because those Legal Ceremonies were the shadows of future things, which were onely to remain until the body, or Christ the truth and substance of them should come; which therefore ought to cease after his comming.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 6. Because whosoever teacheth the worshipping of Angels, is void of true faith, hee is not joyned, nor cleaves unto Christ; although hee know all other things, yet hee is ignorant of the vertue of Christ, and the grace that is in him, yea hee is divided from Christ our head, and doth renounce him.</p>
                  <p>

Because in Christ alone is the storehouse from which all grace, and whatsoever is required to life and spiritual growth, is abundantly derived to all his members, so that neither is it necessary to ask any thing of the Angels, neither can any thing be done in that kinde without dishonour done to Christ, either by invoking the Angels, or by worshipping them after any other manner: Therefore ye are to beware of the invocation of Angels.</p>
                  <p>In this Argument by the comparison of the humane natural head, Christ is described by a <hi>sixfold</hi> Similitude; (1) As the humane natural head hath a body subject to it; so Christ hath the Church subject to him as his my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical body. (2) As sense and motion is derived from the humane head to the whole body, and so to all its members; so sense and spiritual motions are derived from Christ to all the members of the Church. (3) As from the humane head the conjunction of the nerves and ligaments which go through the whole body, are extended; so from the head Christ the holy Spirit flows, and faith in Christ, and love towards our neighbour, which are diffused through the whole body mystical. (4) As by those junctures, life, sense, and motion is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred to the whole body; so by these all spiritual grace is administred to the faithful. (5) As by these the members are compacted with the head, and amongst themselves; so by these Christ and his members are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. (6) As by these in the natural body, so by these in Christs body mystical, first of all there is made an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of every member, and also of the whole body mystical. (7) As there is the increase of nature, so here of grace, the increase of God, <hi>i. e.</hi> great and solid, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the measure given to every one.</p>

                     <hi>Vers. 20.</hi> Wherefore if yee bee dead with Christ from the Rudiments of the world; why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to Ordinances?</q>
                  <p>The <hi>third</hi> Admonition follows with a reprehension, because they had subjected themselves to decrees or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane traditions and doctrines of men, determining Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, in those things which God hath not determined. There are five Arguments of the Admonition or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension: (1) Because yee are freed by the death of Christ from all carnal rudiments of Religion, such as Judaical ceremonies, so that you have no further to do with them, yee ought not to admit the decrees and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of men, as if as yet after the manner of children under Rudiments, yee were obnoxious to such sort of Elements.</p>
                  <p>The force of this <hi>first</hi> Argument consisteth in these <hi>five</hi> things: (1) Christ hath fulfilled that which was prefigured by <hi>Moses</hi> his ceremonies, and by his death hath abrogated those typical ceremonies, and that sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowy manner of teaching the Church and worshipping God, so that the legal Covenant cannot exact any thing more from him, than that which was paid and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in his death. (2) Christ dying, all in Covenant are dead judicially with him, whose person Christ hath born: Therefore the legal Covenant could exact no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more from them, for whose sake Christ dyed, than the Laws of men required of those that are dead: For all in him are reckoned as dead. (3) All ceremonial Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts in respect of the authority commanding, were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and heavenly untill Christ: But now abolished through Christ, they cease to bee divine, and begin to bee humane elements, or rudiments worldly and carnal, not so much in respect to the things commanded, as to the mundane authority commanding them. (4) So long as the <hi>Colossians</hi> were not converted to Christ, but did live in the world as worldlings free from righteousness, so they were slaves to devils and men, obnoxious to all manner of servitude, and to all kinde of evil. (5) But now after they were one body with Christ, they were made free by faith, and also were set at liberty from all evill, neither ought they to submit themselves to any yoak, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less to that which Christ would have them subjugated, and consequently they ought not to bee subject in the business of Religion to the opinions and traditions of men.</p>

Although your life, <hi>i. e.</hi> your Adoption, your Righteousness, your Inheritance, your full Sanctification, and Glorification, is hid to the world, yea, to you your selves for the most part (for now you receive them onely by Faith, and a little possession of first fruits) yet it is preserved in Heaven in its causes, with Christ, hid in God: Therefore yee ought to savour and seek those things which pertain to life eternal.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 4.</hi> When Christ who is our life shall appear, then shall yee also appear with him in glory.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 6. By answering an Objection arising from the former Argument; although your life is now hid, yet fully and openly it shall bee communicated to you, and wee shall bee gloriously brought forth in the sight of Angels and men, when Christ shall bee manifested in his second comming; The reason whereof is given, because Christ is <hi>our life,</hi> so called (1) Because hee hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured life eternal for us. (2) Because hee hath in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self that life to communicate. (3) Because hee hath actually begun to communicate that life by his Spirit to us, which at length hee will fully perfect. (4) Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause hee is the object of this our life: For our felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty consists in communion with him, to know him, to bee, and converse with him, and at length fully to enjoy him: Therefore seek yee things above, under the hope of life, that is to bee revealed to us.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 5.</hi> Mortifie therefore your members, which are upon the earth, fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affections, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is Idolatry.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Exhortation</hi> the <hi>second,</hi> as a corrolarie, inferred from the fomer, by which hee commands to mortifie the viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous motions and affections of corrupt nature, through which the deformed body of sin dwelling in us, as mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, works all actual sins, and doth so put forth it self in the members of the body, that it makes them as it were members of it self, and the instruments of vices. This mortification is done, not onely by not committing the external acts of sin, but also by killing in the very beginning those wicked internal motions exciting to those sins.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fornication</hi>] Hee reckons up <hi>five</hi> vices, whereunto the Gentiles chiefly were addicted, the last of which, <hi>viz.</hi> Covetousness, hee calls by the name of Idolatry, that hee might stir them up to the hatred of Covetousness: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause almost all accounted it frugality, and very many trust in riches.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Which are upon the earth</hi>] The Arguments of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation are <hi>three.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. Because these vices are earthly members, or vicious parts of that nature, which onely savours of earth, and doth altogether alienate men from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 6.</hi> For which things sake, the wrath of God commeth on the children of disobedience.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. Because although these sins may seem light, yet they bring the anger of God upon those, who are disobedient, and do not repent.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 7.</hi> In the which yee also walked sometime, when yee lived in them.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Yee walk] Argum.</hi> 3. Because in times past yee have served too much these vices, walking and living in them, no less than they who still are defiled in this mire.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 8.</hi> But now you also put off all these, anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth.</p>
                  <p n="9">
                     <hi>9.</hi> Lye not one to another, seeing that yee have put off the old man with his deeds;</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Exhortation</hi> 3. Drawn from the next Argument, in which hee commands them to put off, lay aside, and cast away <hi>six</hi> vices not to bee resumed again, which are, (1) Unjust anger. (2) Indignation or wrath, which is an higher degree of anger. (3) Malice or malicious envy and hatred, which becomes permanent or lodging anger. (4) Reproach or blasphemy against any ones fame. (5) Filthy speaking or scurrility, and (6) and lastly, Lying.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Put off</hi>] The Reasons of the Exhortation are <hi>two.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">(1) Because in Baptism the Sacramental Vow, and Obligation, and in the beginning yee have put off the old man, with all his actions, <hi>i. e.</hi> yee have renounced your old corrupt nature, and its bondage: Therefore yee must renounce these vices.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 10.</hi> And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the Image of him that created him.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 2. Because by the Gift of God, Faith, Vow, and Newness of Life begun in Regeneration, yee have put on the New Man, <hi>i. e.</hi> new spiritual qualities, as it were a new Nature: Therefore yee must renounce these vices.</p>
               <p>But hee describes the New Man in <hi>four</hi> things. (1) That there is a renovation in Christ of the Holiness of our Nature lost in <hi>Adam.</hi> (2) That it consists in the acknowledgement of the Mystery of the Gospel, <hi>i. e.</hi> in the same illumination, which so changes the heart, and also the outward conversation, that the Grace of God in Christ is really acknowledged by us, in mind, affection, and deed. (3) That the Archetype, or exemplar, according to which this New Man is created and renewed, is the Image of God, the Creator, who alone made man that hee might have a being, and hee alone hath also created man again that hee might bee new.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 11.</hi> Where there is neither Greek, nor Iew, Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision nor Uncircumcision, <hi>Barbarian, Scythian,</hi> bond nor free; but Christ is all in all:</q>
               <p n="4">(4) That it is enough to the New Man to have Christ (which one thing sufficeth for all things requisite to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation) or that in this business of renovation by Christ, our external condition neither hindereth, nor promoteth, nor in this work is any respect had to an external condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with God, (bee there any of the Gentiles or Jews circumcised or uncircumcised, born in this or that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, learned or unlearned, bond or free) which is fitly spoken by reason of the false Apostles, who did urge Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:49391:78"/>
Ceremonies, and the traditions of men, as if all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things had been nothing, except they would Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daize.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 12.</hi> Put on therefore (as the Elect of God, holy and beloved) bowels of mercies, kindness, humble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of mind, meekness, long-suffering:</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Exhortation</hi> 4. To five Virtues, <hi>viz.</hi> (1) To a tender pitty towards the afflicted. (2) Towards the poor. (3) To humility and modesty in all things. (4) To meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, gentleness in conversation with others. (5) To long-suffering where injuries fall out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Elect</hi>] There are <hi>three</hi> Arguments of the Exhortation.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) Because yee are the Elect of God, not onely se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated by special vocation from the world, but also by eternal decree from Reprobates.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Holy] Argum.</hi> 2. Because yee are holy and consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Beloved] Argum.</hi> 3. Because yee are beloved of God: Therefore adorn your selves with these virtues, that yee may yeeld your selves worthy of so great commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 13.</hi> Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any; even as Christ forgave you, so also do yee.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Exhortation</hi> 5. That not onely in long-suffering they mutually bear one anothers infirmities, and harsh beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours, but also that they mutually forgive injuries one to another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As Christ</hi>] The Reason of the Exhortation is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Christ hath forgiven you your more grievous of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences: Therefore do yee forgive injuries one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 14.</hi> And above all these things, put on Charity, which is the bond of perfectness.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Exhortation</hi> 6. That in the first place they put on Charity, and that before all other virtues, Because it springs from the root of Faith, (as the trunck of a tree) and sends forth all other virtues as branches, and both cherisheth and nourisheth them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Which is</hi>] The Reason of the Exhortation is, Because Charity is the mutual bond of perfect binding together, whereby all the faithful are joyned into one body, and whereby all are perfected, <hi>i. e.</hi> made partakers of all gifts growing in the Church, so that whatsoever either the priviledges of the whole body are, or the gifts of some member, may become as to use and profitableness, of good to all the members.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 15.</hi> And let the Peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also yee are called in one body: and bee yee thankful.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Exhortation</hi> 7. That if any contention should arise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them, the Peace of God should bee appointed the Moderatour of contention, and all affections, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, as it were, a reward in its hand, should determine what is to bee done.</p>
               <p>Hee calls <hi>the Peace of God,</hi> that which is from God, that which pleases God, and that which doth not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the loss of truth, or any virtue, but of our carnal affections.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To which</hi>] The Reasons of the Exhortation are <hi>three.</hi> (1) Because God hath called you to peace with himself, and that you should follow it amongst your selves. (2) Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause yee are all members of one body. (3) Because yee owe this thankfulness to God, who hath made peace with you, when hee might have dealt with you, as enemies: Therefore following peace amongst your selves, bee yee thankful.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 16.</hi> Let the Word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdome, teaching and admonishing one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Psalms, and Hymns, and spiritual Songs, singing with Grace in your hearts to the Lord.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Exhortation</hi> 8. To study the Word of God, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy your selves in it; there are <hi>five</hi> branches of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation. (1) That they derive the Word of Christ, or the Christian Doctrine propoun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed in Scripture from the fountains, and as a most acceptable guest entertain it in their minds and hearts: that afterwards it might not depart from thence, but there constantly abide. (2) That they content not themselves, that they have tasted the Word of Christ, or that they have in some sort known it, but they do their endeavour for the procuring a rich and plentiful measure of it to themselves. (3) That from thence they learn to bee wise to their own salvation, and the benefit of others. (4) That they suffer the Word of Christ not to bee idle in them, but that they prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put it forth for the use of their neighbours, that with mutual instructions they promote one anothers know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, with mutual admonitions they may better order their conversations, and every one stir up his own and others affections to the singing of holy Psalms, Hymns, and spiritual Songs, composed of some spiritual matter, by the Spirit, and made for mutual edification. (5) That they sing with their affections composed to holiness ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the measure of Grace given to them, so that the Song may bee acceptable to God, and may administer Grace to the hearers, they beholding in the sincerity of their hearts the glory of God in their singing.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 17.</hi> And whatsoevr you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Iesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Exhortation</hi> 9. That they do all things <hi>in Christ, i. e.</hi> in his name, and authority, through him or his grace, and to him and his glory: And because that cannot bee done, but forthwith they must have new experiences of divine good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness towards themselves, that they may give thanks to God alwaies in all things through Christ, without whom God the Father will not bee praised by us, nor will hee grant any thing to us, but through his Son, and in whom whatsoever things are sent in to us by God, are turned to our good: And these are the general Exhortations to common duties.</p>

                     <hi>Exhort.</hi> 1. Is to Wives, with whom hee begins, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause their condition is harder and more difficult than mens, and therefore it is no wonder if God speak first to them: Hee requires of them, that they bee subject to their own Husbands, <hi>i. e.</hi> that they give them obedience, honour, and reverence, but with a limitation, <hi>in the Lord,</hi> that their obedience bee in things lawful, and for the command of the Lord, to whom Wives are first sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and do owe obedience.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>As it is fit</hi>] The Argument of the Exhortation is from equity and comeliness, for what is commanded is fitting from divine Ordination, and from the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 19.</hi> Husbands, love your Wives, and bee not bitter against them.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Exhort.</hi> 2. To Husbands, whom hee commands in the first place, that they love their own Wives, and that with a singular and holy affection, and to rest satisfied in one Wife: Further, hee forbids them, that they bee not bitter towards them, either in word or deeds, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they bee provoked by their infirmities, but that they prudently rule them, as it becomes Husbands.</p>
                  <q>

To Children, with whom hee begins as before with Wives, and afterwards hee will begin with Servants, because their condition is harder, and they have need of the instruction of God, that they do that which is necessary for them to do, of their own accord, hee requires of these obedience from the heart, toward their

parents in all things, <hi>viz.</hi> which their heavenly Father hath not prohibited: The Argument of the Exhortation is this, because the performance of this duty is most ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable unto God.</p>

                     <hi>Vers. 21.</hi> Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they bee discouraged.</q>

                     </gap>ranches of the Exhortation are <hi>six:</hi> In the <hi>first,</hi> hee mitigates the condition of servitude, from this, that it onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the carnal duties of this life, and doth not infer any necessity of obeying in things unlawful. In the <hi>second,</hi> hee commands, that they obey and serve in all things lawfull, even when the commands are hardest. 3. That they do that sincerely and faithfully, not onely in the sight of their Masters, but also when they are absent, lest they bee accused of negligence. 4. That they in sincerity of heart serve in the fear of the Lord.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 23.</hi> And whatsoever yee do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men.</q>

                     <hi>Vers. 24.</hi> Knowing, that of the Lord yee shall receive the reward of the inheritance; for yee serve the Lord Christ.</q>
                  <p>The Arguments of the Exhortation are <hi>four:</hi> 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God will give them a better reward, than their Masters agree with them for, or can give them, <hi>viz.</hi> Life eternal, for a free inheritance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For] Arg.</hi> 2. Because they may bee certain of a free reward, from this, that they serve Christ, who cannot neglect his servants.</p>

(2) That they warn him to execute the Ministry, as one that was to give an account of his Embassage committed to him of Christ.

(2) Hee shews the characteristical note of his Epistles, lest they should acknowledge any Epistle, as sent from him; which hee himself with his own hand had not subscribed. (3) Hee exhorts them, that praying for him now lying in bonds, they would learn patience, and faith, being invited to it by so illustrious an example. (4) Lastly, Hee wisheth them the grace of God, from whence, as from a fountain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all good things may flow to them, and hopes it will bee communicated to them: Sealing all things which hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto hee had writ, as it were with the seal of faith. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <p>

               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 3.</hi> Remembring without ceasing your work of Faith, and labour of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Iesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. Your sincere Faith, which hath shewed it self lively, and efficacious by works; your indefatigable charity visible in your daily labours, and diligence, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in your liberality towards the Saints: And lastly, your lively hope shewn in patience and suffering afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for Christ, have left in mee an indeleble impression, that I cannot but make mention of them before God and man: Therefore it is meet that yee bee strengthened in Faith: But hee calls them the virtues of Christ, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they did spring from Christ, and tend to him, But hee saies in the sight of God, because they were of that sort which were in the sight of God, genuine and no waies counterfeit.</p>

                  <hi>Vers. 5.</hi> For our Gospel came not to you in word one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance, as yee know what manner of men wee were among you for your sake.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 4. Confirming the former. I plainly perceive that my Gospel hath been efficacious amongst you, for there did accompany my preaching unto you, (1) Strength and spiritual virtue to the begetting of Faith in you. (2) The Holy Ghost by his inward testimony and gifts withal bestowed upon you, did seal the truth received by you. (3) Much assurance and perswasion in your hearts did ensue, which hath freed you from all doubting. (4) Such was the work and presence of God in you that heard, as was to bee seen in us Apostles that taught, as yee your selves have known: Therefore it is, that yee ought to bee strengthened in Faith.</p>

Yee, by imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Gospel, and firmly retaining it with joy, are made in the midst of afflictions, both like unto the Lord Christ, and us his servants, preaching that Gospel with joy in the midst of oppressions: Therefore yee ought to bee strengthened in Faith.</p>

                  <hi>Vers. 7.</hi> So that yee were ensamples to all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in <hi>Macedonia</hi> and <hi>Achaia,</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 6. Confirming the former. Yee were made exemplary to all inhabiting the neighbouring Countries, both of invincible Faith, and great alacrity and patience in receiving and holding fast the Gospel: Therefore it is, that yee ought to bee strengthened in Faith.</p>
               <q>

                  <hi>Vers. 8.</hi> For from you sounded out the Word of the Lord, not onely in <hi>Macedonia</hi> and <hi>Achaia,</hi> but also in every place your Faith to God-ward is spread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, so that wee need not to speak any thing.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 7. Your Faith became most famous, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the neighbouring Countries, but also in those that are far distant, that there is no need of any larger proof: Therefore it is, that yee ought to bee confirmed in the Faith.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 9.</hi> For they themselves shew of us, what manner of entring in wee had unto you, and how yee turned to God from Idols, to serve the living and true God.</q>

                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 8. The wonderful power of God appeared in your conversion; that the faithful in every place have published the history of the <hi>Thessalonians</hi> conversion, <hi>viz.</hi> how the Apostle with manifest peril of his life preached the Gospel amongst you, and how yee hearing him, after a wonderful manner renounced feigned Idols, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted your selves to the service of the true and living God: Therefore it is, that yee ought to bee strengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Faith.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 10.</hi> And to wait for his Son from Heaven, whom hee raised from the dead, even Iesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 9. Your conversion to God was not, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his Son Christ, as the unbeleeving Jews falsely boast of their conversion: But to God in Christ, or to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to Christ, as the incarnate Son of God, the Redeemer, dead, and risen for us: who shall come from Heaven, a Judge to destroy all unbeleevers, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver his own from the wrath which is to come upon the rest; which Faith alone is saving: Therefore yee ought to bee confirmed in Faith, reminding those works of God in you.</p>

                  <p>HEE proceeds for the confirmation of their Faith, to commend the sincerity of his Ministery, and the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy of it amongst them, and to shew his kind affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction towards them.</p>
                  <p>There are <hi>three</hi> parts of the <hi>Chapter.</hi> In the <hi>first</hi> hee puts them in mind of the manifest signs of his embassage to them, <hi>to vers. 13.</hi> In the <hi>second,</hi> hee shews the clear marks of divine Grace in their conversion, <hi>to vers. 17.</hi> In the <hi>third,</hi> hee confirms his kind affection toward them, lest they should think themselves not enough re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded by the Apostle.</p>
               </argument>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 1.</hi> For your selves, Brethren, know our entrance in unto you, that it was not in vain.</q>
               <p>Hee recites <hi>thirteen</hi> signs of his spiritual, sincere, and divine embassage to them, and the faithful administration of his office from the whole time wherein hee first of all preached the Gospel among them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sign</hi> 1. Yee your selves are witnesses that our entrance unto you, had nothing of vanity, nor my Ministery was not without fruit, when I began to preach the Gospel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst you.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 2.</hi> But even after that wee had suffered before, and were shamefully entreated, as you know, at <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippi,</hi> wee were bold in our God to speak unto you the Gospel of God with much contention.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sign</hi> 2. The great persecution, which not much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I suffered at <hi>Philippi,</hi> hath not hindred, but that I dare preach to you in this present danger: For I boldly use liberty of speech, trusting in the power of God alone, striving earnestly against all enemies.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 3.</hi> For our exhortation was not of deceit, not of uncleanness, or in guile</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sign</hi> 3. Confirming the former, The Doctrine, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, and Consolation administred by mee, was not like the Doctrine of the false Apostles, for (1) It was not adulterate and framed to deceive, but sincere, without any imposture. I did neither use nor suffer im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity (as the false Apostles in their Doctrine) but my Doctrine was without all mixture, not handled after a deceitful manner, as it uses to bee handled by them, which in their preaching endeavour their own glory and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 4.</hi> But as wee were allowed of God to bee put in trust with the Gospel, even so wee speak, not as pleasing men, but God, which trieth our hearts.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sign</hi> 4. From the knowledge of my Election, and Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to so excellent an office (wherein the preaching of the Gospel was committed unto mee) I have determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to preach the Word of God with an holy and sincere mind, and not to please men, but God, who searcheth the hearts, and doth bear mee witness as his faithful servant.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 5.</hi> For neither at any time used wee flattering words, as yee know, nor a cloak of covetousness, God is witness.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sign</hi> 5. More especially explicating that which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I never used flattering words amongst you, of which thing I call you to witness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nor] Sign</hi> 6. I never did any thing for the sake of covetousness under the cloak of piety, as the false Apostles were wont, of which thing hee calls God to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 6.</hi> Not of men sought wee glory, neither of you, nor yet of others, when wee might have been burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, as the Apostles of Christ.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Neither] Sign</hi> 7. I was so far from ambition, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so covetousness, that I never required the honour due to mee, or an honourable stipend, either of you, or of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, when as an Apostle of Christ I could have lawfully been burdensome unto you.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 7.</hi> But wee were gentle among you, even as a Nurse cherisheth her children.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sign</hi> 8. Whilst I was conversant amongst you, I did carry my self gently, as one of you, yea, as one equal to the lowest of you, laying aside all haughtiness, morosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and imperiousness, and all respect either to the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of my Kindred, or the excellency of my office and gifts vouchsafed to mee, and all other priviledges, the consideration whereof uses to bee accounted of in civil conversation.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 8.</hi> So being affectionately desirous of you, wee were willing to have imparted unto you, not the Gospel of God onely, but also our own souls, because yee were dear unto us.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sign</hi> 9. As a mother cherisheth her children, warmeth them with her breath, nourisheth them with her milk, and (if shee could) is ready to communicate her soul to them: So I affectionately taking care of all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments of the Church, with the greatest satisfaction, together with the preaching of the Gospel, I was willing to impart unto you, as it were my soul, because of my ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement love towards you.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 9.</hi> For yee remember, Brethren, our la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>our and travel: for labouring night and day, because wee would not bee chargeable unto any of you, wee preached unto you the Gospel of God.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sign</hi> 10. Explaining and confirming the former; the whole time which remains to mee from the preaching the Gospel, I did bestow labouring with my hands, lest any one of you bee burthened by allowing mee maintenance, as an Apostle.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 10.</hi> Yee are witnesses, and God also, how ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily, and justly, and unblameably wee behaved our selves among you that beleeve.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sign.</hi> 11. I carried my self amongst you in all things, justly, holily, and unblameably, whereof I call you to witness as to external things, and I call God to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of my more inward sincere love to you in all things.</p>
               <q>

                  <hi>Vers. 11.</hi> As you know, how wee exhorted, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, and charged every one of you, (as a Father doth his children)</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sig.</hi> 12. As yee may remember, I did exhort and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort privately every one of you, no otherwise than as a Father is wont to exhort and comfort his children.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 12.</hi> That yee would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his Kingdome and Glory.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sig.</hi> 13. I left nothing undone that might shew greatest faithfulness and diligence, that yee might lead an holy life, and that yee might please God in all things, who hath called you by his grace to a participation of his Kingdome, and celestial Glory. These are the Signes of <hi>Pauls</hi> celestial Ambassage, and of his Apostolical Office faithfully administred by him amongst the <hi>Thessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians.</hi>

                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 13.</hi> For this cause also thank wee God without ceasing, because when yee received the Word of God which yee heard of us, yee received it not as the word of men, but (as it is in truth) the Word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve.</q>
                  <p>The <hi>Second</hi> part of the Chapter, in which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained manifest Signes of the Divine grace towards the <hi>Thessalonians</hi> in their conversion, which afterwards hee publishes with Thanksgiving, and confirms them against the scandal of the Cross and persecution, which they suffered from the enemies of the Gospel, which were of the same Tribe. The Signes of the Divine grace to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Thessalonians</hi> in their conversion are <hi>three.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Sign</hi> 1. That you have attentively heard (sayes hee) the word of the Gospel preached by mee, not as the word of man, but as the word of God, and yee have received it with a true faith.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Which also] Sign</hi> 2. That the word of God received by faith efficaciously works in you, and testifies it self to bee Divine by its efficacy, no less in you, than it hath manifested it self in other beleevers.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 14.</hi> For yee brethren, became followers of the Churches of God, which in Iudea are in Christ Iesus; for yee also have suffered like things of your own Country-men, even as they have of the Iews:</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sign</hi> 3. Confirming what was said before: That hitherto yee have been constant in bearing persecutions from your friends, kinsfolks, &amp; those of the same Tribe, for the Gospels sake, and have shewn your selves like to the Christian Churches in <hi>Iudea,</hi> who did constantly suffer persecutions from the other unbeleeving Jews, of whom some are spiteful to you.</p>

                  <p>That hee may remove the scandal of persecution whereby the Christian Churches were vexed by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeving Jews, who called themselves the people of God, hee takes off the vizard from those perverse enemies of the Gospel, setting out their sins with a most severe accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, whereof there are seven branches. (1) The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeving Jews killed Christ himself. (2) They have not spared their own Prophets being their Country-men. (3) They persecute us Apostles which say that the <hi>Thessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians</hi> should receive consolation from the fellowship of the sufferings of Christ, and the sufferings of his servants. (4) They are adversaries unto God, and then they think that they please God most, when they persecute his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.

                  <p n="6">(6) They are enemies to the Gentiles to their utmost, forbidding the Apostles to preach the Gospel of salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Gentiles, lest they should bee saved, so far as it lyes in them. (7) By doing these and many other things, they daily more and more fill up the measure of their sins.

                  <p>
                     <hi>More abundantly] Arg.</hi> 4. By how much the more I am troubled for my absence from you, so much the more abundantly I desire to see you.</p>

And unless yee were to bee esteemed such, of whom, I pray you, could I hope well, rejoyce, or glory?

The Doctrine concerning the resurrection and last judgement being by the way taken in amongst them.</p>

               <p>The <hi>first</hi> part of the Chapter containeth <hi>seven</hi> Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. <hi>First</hi> Is general, That they bee mindful of those things which they heard from the Apostle, and daily more and more profit in the endeavour of living holily, and pleasing God, that they may daily, as it were, excel themselves; Hee adds four Reasons of the Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>

               <p n="3">(3) That they endeavour to extinguish the feverish heats and flames of inward concupiscence. Of which Exhortation there is a reason given, lest they bee like the Gentiles, which have not known God, and that they may bee distinguished from them by honesty, or purity and holiness.</p>
               <q>

               <p>
                  <hi>For a Revenger</hi>] Hee adds five Reasons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. God will revenge such kind of injuries.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 2. As I have before admonished you, so I also again admonish you, and I beseech you for Gods sake, that yee take heed.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 7.</hi> For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 3. From the end of our calling, to the Grace of Christ, which is not that wee defile our selves with any kind of sin, but that wee bee sanctified in all manner of virtue.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 8.</hi> Hee therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath also given unto us his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 4. Because hee that doth not obey this Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, is guilty of rejecting divine authority.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Who also] Reas.</hi> 5. Because God hath given the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to us true Christians, whereby wee may discern what is from God, what is an abomination to him, and what judgements hang over sinners.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 9.</hi> But as touching Brotherly love, yee need not that I write unto you: for yee your selves are taught of God to love one another.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Exhort.</hi> 4. To brotherly love, and to exercise, for the future, kindness towards all: The Reasons are three.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. Because yee are so propense to this brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly love, that it is not much necessary to urge this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 2. Yee are already taught, that yee love one another.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 10.</hi> And indeed yee do it towards all the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, which are in all <hi>Macedonia:</hi> but wee beseech you, Brethren, that yee increase more and more,</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 3. Confirming the former. Now yee have real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shewn this kindness towards all your Brethren near about you: Therefore go forwards, and excel in this duty.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 11.</hi> And that yee study to bee quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, (as wee commanded you.)</p>
                  <p n="12">12. That yee may walk honestly toward them that are without, and that yee may have lack of nothing.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>To work] Exhort.</hi> 6. That yee bee not idle, but take care about your private matters, and do your businesses, work with your own hands, as I have commanded you before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That yee] Exhort.</hi> 7. Carry your selves decently to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards those, and before those, that are not in the Church, and in all these duties strive amongst your selves, as it were for matter of honour; for this end especially besides others, that yee may have no need to beg any thing from the houshold of Faith, or of those that are without.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>second</hi> part of the Chapter containeth matter of consolation against the immoderate mourning for the death of friends, which hee disswades them from by <hi>two</hi> Arguments.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. Immoderate mourning belongs to Heathens and Infidels, who have no hope of the resurrection: Therefore immoderate mourning doth not become you.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 14.</hi> For if wee beleeve that Iesus died, and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Iesus, will God bring with him.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. How certain soever wee beleeve that Christ is risen from the dead, so certainly wee may also know that the faithful dead in Christ shall rise again, and bee presented alive in the company of Christ at the day of judgement: Therefore yee must have a care of immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate mourning.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 15.</hi> For this wee say unto you by the word of the Lord, that wee which are alive, and remain unto the comming of the Lord, shall not prevent them which are asleep.</q>
                  <p>That this consolation may bee strong, by revelation from the Lord, hee fore-tells the manner of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Christ, and the resurrection; which is contained in these <hi>six</hi> Articles.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Artic.</hi> 1. The faithful that are alive at the comming of Christ, shall not prevent the resurrection of those that are dead in Christ.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 16.</hi> For the Lord himself shall descend from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with a shout, with the voice of the Arch-Angel and with the Trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first.</q>
                  <p>

                     <hi>With the voice] Artic.</hi> 3. The manner of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming shall bee with much expression of authority and majesty, for as the chief Judge hee shall command by his authority, that every element give up their dead, from whereupon all the dead shall bee gathered together to his Tribunal, but his command shall bee promulged by some chief Angel, the Trumpet shall sound, or a voice in stead of a Trumpet, and the sound shall bee heard in all places where the dead are to bee raised.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And they] Artic.</hi> 4. The dead in Christ shall arise, before the living shall bee changed.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 17.</hi> Then wee which are alive and remain, shall bee caught together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the Air; and so shall wee ever bee with the Lord.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Artic.</hi> 5. The faithful that are alive at the comming of the Lord, being changed suddenly, in a moment, in the twinckling of an eye, from mortality to immortality, shall bee caught up together with the Saints that are rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, to meet the Lord in the Air.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And so] Artic.</hi> 6. The Saints after judgement shall go with the Lord into Heaven, and shall remain with him to eternity. Hee speaks nothing concerning the Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, because consolation doth not pertain to them; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther concerning them, when they dye, can any comfort bee taken.</p>

               <q>

               <p>
                  <hi>Artic.</hi> 2. Containing the reason of the former. No less suddenly will Christ come, than a thief in the night is wont, suddenly to creep into other mens houses.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 3.</hi> For when they shall say peace and safety, then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travel upon a woman with childe, and they shall not escape.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Art.</hi> 3. Explicating the former, and applying it to impenitent. As unawares, certainly and necessarily the pains of travel ceize upon those that are with childe; so the unexpected day of the Lords anger shall ceize upon impenitent secure sinners on the sudden.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 4.</hi> But yee, Brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Art.</hi> 4. In which hee further explains this Doctrine, and applies it to the consolation of the faithful; Yee beleevers need not fear that day, because yee lye not in the darkness of sin and ignorance: The last day cannot (as a Thief in the night) take hold of you.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 5.</hi> Yee are all the children of light, and the children of the day: wee are not of the night, nor of darkness.</q>
               <p>Hee gives a reason, because as many as truly beleeve in Christ, are the sons of light, and of the day, living in the light of faith and godliness: And therefore none of us can bee in bondage to ignorance and sin.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>second</hi> part of the Chapter containeth thirteen Exhortations to Christian duties:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Exhort.</hi> 1. An Exhortation inferred from the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the last Judgement, to watchfulness and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety, that wee may expect that day without fear. That wee may not (sayes hee) sleep or indulge our selves in our sins, as Infidels, but on the contrary, studying mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in all earthly things, wee may earnestly endeavour after works of holiness.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 7.</hi> For they that sleep, sleep in the night, and they that bee drunken, are drunken in the night.</q>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. Because they which sleep securely, and give themselves to drunkenness, use to do that in the night, and in darkness, which doth not become you.</p>

                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 12.</hi> And wee beseech you brethren, to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you:</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Exhort.</hi> 3. Which appertains to the people; That they observe the Pastors and Presbyters, with the whole assembly of the Elders, teaching &amp; governing those which laboured amongst them in the Word and Doctrine, and who were over them in the Lord, ruling in Ecclesiastical affairs, and according to their duty, did admonish, when there was need: Concerning these hee commands them, that as Saints, and as it became thankful persons, they acknowledge in heart, words, and deeds, all the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters appointed for the Ministers of Christ to their sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
                  <p>There are three Reasons of the Exhortation:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. Because I an Apostle do lovingly and earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly desire this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Did labour] Reas.</hi> 2. Because Ministers are worthy of this honour, in as much as they labour for your edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and are over you, or govern you, in the name of Christ, in all Ecclesiastical matters, and those things which pertain to the worship of God, and do with autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity admonish you of your duties both privately and publickly.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 3. Because the work of God for the salvation of beleevers, which the faithful Ministers earnestly endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, requireth, that after a singular manner they bee beloved by the people, and esteemed very highly,</p>

(3) His glory shall surpass all our hope and apprehension; for Christ shall bee admired in the greatness of his glory communicated. (4) Hee will shew his glory in all that beleeve, so that there shall bee no beleever, wherein Christ shall not bee admired: by the way hee gives the reason of this consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion applied to them, Because the <hi>Thessalonians</hi> had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved the Testimony of the Apostle preaching the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel: Therefore hee dare confidently apply the afore-said consolation to them, which indeed they shall finde in that day: Therefore, &amp;c.</p>

                  <hi>Artic.</hi> 1. I pray, that God, (who is ours by a free Covenant) would vouchsafe to make you meet for the vocation or glory whereunto you are called. This Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle ascribes as well the glory unto which wee are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, to the grace or favour of God, as well as all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration which leads us to it.</p>

                  <hi>And fulfil] Artic.</hi> 2. I pray that God would fulfil all the good pleasure of his goodness according to his free bounty towards you. In which Article hee shews that not onely salvation, but all means to salvation, are foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the good pleasure of God, acknowledging nothing except the Grace of God in the whole course of salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and in all the parts of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the work of Faith] Artic.</hi> 3. I pray, that God would compleat the work of Faith with power in you. In which Article hee affirms Faith to bee the work of God, which hee works in his, and hee determines the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, increase, and perfecting of Faith, as part of his good pleasure. Lastly, Hee shews that Faith is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not a work of our power, but exceeds whatsoever can
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:49391:84"/>
bee in us, and requires the power of God, without which it can neither bee begun, or continue, or bee increased, or compleated.</p>

I pray that both in this life, and in that which is to come, Christ may bee glorified in you, as in his members, and yee may be glorified in him, as in your head, which is the end of the former Articles. Neither in this Article will hee have the grace of God conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but teaches that the whole glory which Christ re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth from his, or which hee communicates to them, is to bee ascribed to the grace of God and Christ onely; In all which the <hi>Thessalonians</hi> had no mean supports for their consolation and confirmation in the faith.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>In the <hi>other,</hi> hee confirms the faith of the <hi>Thessaloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 1.</hi> Now wee beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Iesus Christ, and by our gathering to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unto him,</q>
               <p>An errour had crept in amongst the <hi>Thessalonians</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Christs coming immediately, whilst they were alive, which errour the Devil cherished, that as for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther causes, so also for this, that at leastwise after that age hee might expose the whole Christian Doctrine, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with this Article, to a mockery; therefore the Apostle admonishes them, that they suffer not themselves to bee moved from the sound sense and faith of this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle. In the mean while hee affirms two things, as most certain, whereof hee would not have them doubt: The <hi>first</hi> was, That Christ will come, as he had taught before, in his appointed time. The <hi>other</hi> was, It will come to pass that all the faithful should be gathered together from the four quarters of the world to meet the Lord: But hee beseeches them, if they would bee wise for themselves in that day, that they would have a care of that errour, whereof wee speak.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 2.</hi> That yee bee not soon shaken in minde, or bee troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand.</q>
               <p>Because Impostors did brag partly of some Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from the Spirit, partly some speech of the Apostle, which they affirmed they had heard, they did partly say, that it was manifested by the former Epistle written by the Apostle to the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> as if in the fourth and fifth Chapters, hee had taught that Christ would come while they were yet alive, the Apostle commands to take heed, lest they should bee by this, or any like imposture de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, troubled, or by any other means bee moved from the faith.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 3.</hi> Let no man deceive you by any means; for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin bee revealed, the son of perdition.</q>
               <p>Hee gives a reason of his dehortation, Because Christ would not come before the Antichristian defection should bee, and Antichrist should bee revealed, the chief Captain and Patron of this Apostasie: Therefore it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoveth two things to precede Christs coming, a falling from the faith received (whereof 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1.) and the revelation of the <hi>chief</hi> or <hi>great</hi> Antichrist: That which concerns the falling away, hee doth not understand the falling away of one or a few, or of many in many Churches, for day by day in those times there were not a few Runagates from the tents of Christ, almost through all the Churches, and many followers of many errours; but hee understands the universal falling away of the external or visible Church; so that false opinions contrary to the Gospel should bee received, and openly defended, and that commonly in the visible Christian Church, by those that should boast in the name of Christians.</p>
               <p>As concerning him, who should bee the head of this Apostasie, hee fore-tells that hee shall bee revealed by God, partly by permitting him to erect his Kingdome in his Church, and openly, and in very deed, shew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to bee Antichrist, partly by making of him manifest by the Doctrine of the Gospel (which should make his impostures manifest, and open to all those that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to bee deceived) of which Antichrist, or head of Apostates, that hee may bee better discerned in his time by those that were circumspect, The Apostle pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds <hi>seven</hi> Articles, which are exactly to bee obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>

For the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire must bee taken away in the West: <hi>Caesar</hi> was to bee taken away from that City before Antichrist could bee revealed, wherein wee have also the Pontificians consent: Touching this hinderance, our Apostle in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press words had before admonished the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> and knew that they understood and remembred it, but the reasons were weighty, wherefore the Spirit of God was unwilling to express that hinderance to them in this Epistle: For it was not much matter to them that hee should discover it, nay, this mystery ought to bee kept se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret from the world: Partly, that more easily the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of this mystery of iniquity decreed by God might bee fulfilled: Partly, lest from hence hee should give a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny occasion of persecuting the Christians: For if the Emperors had understood that any one amongst the Professors of Christ, would erect unto themselves a Throne at <hi>Rome,</hi> and that hee should extinguish the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire, and that Emperour; All of them might have thought it very just to shew their cruelty against the whole name of Christ.</p>

The <hi>Romane</hi> Emperour did possess <hi>Rome,</hi> which was to bee the seat of Antichrist, and being vacant Antichrist would invade, and also assume to himself the dominion both of God and men.</p>

               <p>What pertains to the beginning of his Kingdome, So soon as the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire, or the <hi>Romane</hi> Emperour shall bee removed from that which was to bee the seat of Antichrist, <hi>i. e.

               <p>
                  <hi>Exhort.</hi> 1. That they ask these two things:</p>
               <p n="1">(1) That by the Apostles Ministry, the Gospel might bee speedily and fruitfully propagated, and bee magnified amongst other Nations, as it was magnified amongst them.</p>

               <p n="2">(2) That God would keep the Apostle, and deliver him from the snares of his enemies, who without all reason perversely opposed themselves against him: Hee gives the reason of their hostile minde, because many were destitute of true faith: Therefore that they might bee delivered from them, there was need of Divine as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance.</p>

               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 9.</hi> Not because wee have not power, but to make our selves an ensample unto you to follow us.</q>
               <p>The confirmation of the reason, by preventing an Objection, from that, that the Apostle might use his own liberty, and require wages due to him from them, yet hee of his own accord departed from his right, that he might propose an example to them: Therefore these sloathful Drones, profitable to none, were bound to work, that if they would not bee helpful unto others, at least-wise they should not bee burdensome to them.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 10.</hi> For even when wee were with you, this wee commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should hee eat.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 4. Because it is meet, that hee should not eat, who withdraws himself from honest labour, as I have heretofore advised you.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 11.</hi> For wee hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly, working not at all, but are busie bodies.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 5. Wherein hee alleadges the cause why hee urges this Precept. Because sloathful idleness nourisheth busie curiosity, as they had sufficient testimony of it by some examples amongst themselves: For some known well enough to them worked not honestly in their affairs, but busie bodies, wandring up and down, were curious about the affairs of others, which did nothing belong to them.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 12.</hi> Now them that are such wee command and exhort by our Lord Iesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread.</q>
               <p>For the sake of this idle sort of persons hee repeats and applies the Exhortation.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Exhort.</hi> 6. Lest in the mean while they should bee weary of well-doing to them that had need (poor indeed, who were not brought to poverty by idleness, but by ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity) lest they waxe sloathful in the actions of any vertue, but go couragiously forward to do th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Exhort.</hi> 7. That they note the refractory, and brand them, that obey not the Apostolical doctrine, that is, that they excommunicate those, which is manifest from this, that hee commands that they have no society with him that is thus noted, which is the consequent of excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, and for this end commands that the excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate person, segregated from the society of others, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ashamed might enter into himself, and repent.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Apostle departing from <hi>Ephesus</hi> into <hi>Macedonia,</hi> did not think it sufficient to commit the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> now publickly founded, to the care of <hi>ordinary Pastors,</hi> but desired the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelist Timothy</hi> that hee would tarry there a while to establish the Church in all things that appertained to <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Discipline:</hi> which work being accomplished, the Apostle intended to call him back, and imploy him, for the confirming of other Churches, as appears in the end of the Epistle, and other places. But because <hi>Timothy</hi> was young as yet, and might seem not sufficiently furnished with authority, for the restraining of unruly men, which pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly might make insurrection against him, in this <hi>Epistle,</hi> hee doth not onely admonish him concerning his office (as one that hee knew very well instructed already) but all the <hi>Churches,</hi> and their <hi>Governours,</hi> are informed touching the Authority of <hi>Timothy;</hi> and their own duties.</p>
               <p>The special parts of the <hi>Epistle</hi> are <hi>six,</hi> according to the number of the Chapters: In the <hi>first Chapter</hi> hee laies down the manner of his preaching the Law and the Gospel duly, and with profit.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>second Chapter</hi> hee sets down how Pastors, and Hearers, Men and Women, ought to behave themselves in their publick prayers and Ecclesiastical meetings.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>third Chapter</hi> hee treats of the right institution of Pastors and Deacons, and concerning the Heads of Doctrine whereof they were to take special care.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>fourth Chapter</hi> hee speaks of avoiding the Apostacy that was comming, and touching the diligence which ought to bee used by a faithful Pastor to that end.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>fifth Chapter</hi> hee treats of private admonitions to bee performed by the Elders, and how they ought to carry themselves toward Widows, and other Elders.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>sixth Chapter</hi> hee delivers Precepts to <hi>Timothy,</hi> wherein hee is instructed what hee ought to teach concerning Christian duties, as well of private persons, as of Ministers.</p>

                  <hi>Vers. 3.</hi> As I besought thee to abide still at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> when I went into <hi>Macedonia,</hi> that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other Doctrine.</q>
               <p>The <hi>first</hi> part of the Chapter follows, touching the

right manner of teaching, wherein after hee had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to <hi>Timothy,</hi> not an ordinary Episcopacy in the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> but a special, temporary and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Commission, hee repeats the command given him, about restraining certain perverse Zelots of the Law, and admonishing them that they teach no Doctrine diverse from that which is Apostolical.

                  <hi>Endless</hi>] The Reasons of his admonition are <hi>six.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. Because those vain speculations are idle, and endless, whereof there is no use.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Which rather] Reas.</hi> 2. Because they beget curious and contentious questions, nor do they promote the knowledge of piety, which lead unto God, for edification proceeds not from probable and dubious questions, but by the solid beleeving of the Word of God.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 5.</hi> Now the end of the Commandement is chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty out of a pure heart, and a good conscience, and of Faith unfeigned.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 3. Because those Teachers that are wholly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised in discussing of smaller matters, which may bee fetched from the Law, though they seem to bee carried with a Zeal to the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> yet they refer not the Law to its true end, or to the proper scope of the whole Scripture, which is, that men by the Law being led to the knowledge of sin, and deserved misery, may seriously betake themselves to Christ, by Faith unfeigned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Charity</hi>] This Faith hee describes from a three-fold effect. (1) That true Faith in the propitia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ory blood of Christ renders the conscience good, or peaceable and quiet. (2) That the conscience being now pacified, Faith will not suffer that the heart bee any longer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in evil, but rather endeavours after purity, and that it may bee purged from all evil affections. (3) That true Faith is not idle in that which is good, but stirs up a man diligently to labour in the obedience of every Precept, by love to God and men.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 6.</hi> From which some having sw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 4. Confirming the former, Because it is appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the experience of some, that unless Teachers ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain from their vain curiosities, and intend more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly the edification of m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n, in Faith and Charity, they cannot but bee drawn away from the simplicity of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, into vain babling; for where there is vanity, there verity is not.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 5. Because it is also known by experience, that those ambitious Teachers, while they affect a new kind of teaching, and seek after applause from their knowledge of the Law, betrayed their ignorance, whilst they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood not the questions whereof, nor the Arguments from which they disputed; Therefore avoiding idle spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations, <hi>Timothy</hi> was to take care, that in the Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Doctrine, or the manner of teaching it, no innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was made by any one.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 8.</hi> But wee know that the Law is good, if a man use it lawfully.</q>

               <p>Hee confirms the Answer with <hi>three</hi> Reasons: The <hi>first</hi> is, from the end of the Law, or the Legal Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, so far as it is opposed to the Gospel; the Law is established, not that the faithful, justified by Faith in Christ, should bee justified by the Law (as the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse Teachers of the Law intended) but that the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous, and unbeleevers, as are all wicked and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane persons, condemned by the Law, might acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge their unrighteousness, and deserved condemnation, repent, and flye unto Christ: Therefore the Apostles Doctrine detracts nothing from the Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>According] Reas.</hi> 2. All sins which are forbidden by the Law, are also prohibited by the sound Doctrine of the glorious Gospel; and all the duties which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Law, are earnestly urged and taught in the Gospel, so much as concerns the performance of our obedience unto God, the demonstration of our thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, and the proof of the sincerity of Faith in the fruits of holiness: Therefore the Doctrine of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel detracts nothing from the Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Committed] Reas.</hi> 3. I an Apostle, to whom the Gospel of God (in himself most blessed, and the Author of all blessings towards us) is committed, do no less urge this wholesome doctrine of Sanctification, and all good works which in the Law are commanded, than any Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot of the Law, although not to the same end: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apostolical Doctrine nothing at all detracts from the Law.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>IN this Chapter hee delivers <hi>four</hi> Precepts, wherein all the faithful are to bee instructed, how they ought de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently to behave themselves in their publick Assemblies, both men and women.</p>
               </argument>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 1.</hi> I exhort therefore, that first of all supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks bee made for all men.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Precept</hi> 1. That prayers in the publick Assembly espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, might not bee neglected, but that supplications ought to bee made for the turning of evils away, and prayers for the obtaining of good things, intercessions for other men, and thanksgiving for benefits received in publick prayers, which the whole Church, the Pastor going before, ought to conceive, and that for all sorts of men, bee they of what condition they will.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 2.</hi> For Kings, and for all that are in authority, that wee may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.</q>
               <p>Hee expounds the special Precept, and in particular commands them to pray for Kings, and all Magistrates in great places, who because they sit at the helm of the Commonwealth, ought to bee most dear to us, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that account ought they to bee mentioned by us in the prayers of the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Peaceable</hi>] The <hi>Reasons</hi> of the Precept are <hi>nine:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. From the profitable end, because the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates being safe, and managing their offices in peace, the faithful may lead a quiet and peaceable life,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In godliness</hi>] or obedience to the first Table:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And honesty</hi>] or obedience to the second Table: Therefore must wee pray for them.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 3.</hi> For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 2. To pray for Kings, and all orders of men, is good or acceptable unto God: Therefore ought wee to pray for them. God is said to bee <hi>our Saviour,</hi> because although Christ is our Saviour by special office, yet in the effecting and execution of his office hee doth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually save us, but with the Father, and the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 4.</hi> Who will have all men to bee saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 3. Confirming the former, God will have all sorts of men (therefore some amongst Kings and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, and all orders of men) to bee saved, and come to the Faith of the Gospel: Therefore hee wills that wee pray for all sorts or men, and by name for Kings, and those in authority, concerning whom wee are obliged to hope well.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 5.</hi> For there is one God, and one Mediatour between God and men, the man Christ Iesus.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 4. Although men are distinguished several waies amongst themselves, and there are divers orders, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of many are strangers to the Faith, and many enemies, yet it is enough to engage our prayers for all, because God is one; under whose power and dominion all are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, and that God is the God of the Jews, as well as the Gentiles, without acception of persons: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought wee to pray for all sorts of men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And one Mediatour] Reas.</hi> 5. What ever distances there are amongst men, by which they may bee distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished from each others, it is enough notwithstanding to ingage us to pray for all, because to all Nations, and all conditions of men, there is <hi>one Mediatour</hi> appointed, betwixt God and men, by whom an access is open to all that come unto him: Therefore ought wee to pray for all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The man] Reas.</hi> 6. Wee have reason to pray for all men, inasmuch as that <hi>One</hi> Mediatour of all men, is <hi>Man</hi>; By the incarnation of the Word, by the common bond of humane nature hee is united to all m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 6.</hi> Who gave himself a ransome for all, to bee testified in due time.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 7. Christ gave himself a full and sufficient price of Redemption, for men of all kinds: Therefore ought wee to pray for all sorts of men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Testimony] Reas.</hi> 8. The Gospel or Testimony of Christs redeeming all sorts of men, which God had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed in due time to reveal, is now made manifest: Therefore in making prayers for all men, the testimony of this truth is to bee produced in Christian Churches.</p>
               <q>

               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 9. The preaching of this Testimony or Gospel, and the Doctrine of the price of Redemption paid for all sorts of men by Christ, is in special manner committed unto mee, that I might bee also a Teacher of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, to instruct them in the Faith, and all Truth, which leads to eternal life; seeing therefore I know, that many of the Gentiles are to bee saved, and now I pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly teach you this, prayers ought publickly to bee made in all Christian Churches for all sorts of men. In the mean time, because hee knew that some amongst the Jews would take ill the mentioning of his Apostle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and his embassage to the Gentiles; hee confirms that expression of his being sen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to the Gentiles with a grave asseveration, lest any one should doubt.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 8.</hi> I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> without wrath, and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</q>
               <p>Those things that follow belong to the circumstances of publick worship: Therefore the <hi>second</hi> Precept follows, touching persons fit for conceiving publick prayers in the Church; Also concerning the place and dispositions both of the soul and body, accommodated to that matter.</p>
               <p>As for the persons; Hee commands the men onely, not women to speak in the Church, and to precede the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in their prayers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In every place</hi>] As to the place, hee shews, (according to that prediction of Christ, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.) that all difference of places, which was in the Old Testament (when they were thrice a year to meet at the Temple in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and their face was to bee turned to the Sanctuary, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were near or afar off from the Temple) is taken away, and that now liberty is granted, that Christians in every place may honestly and decently celebrate their Assemblies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lifting up</hi>] As to the body, hee requires that the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture should bee such, as may testifie reverence to the divine Majesty, and may enkindle our devotion, which kind of gesture is the lifting up of the hands, whether they bee spread abroad, or closed together.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Purely</hi>] As for the whole man, and chiefly the soul, hee requires, <hi>first,</hi> Integrity and innocency of life, which h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e means by purity of hands. (2) That wrath bee laid aside, strifes, and all evil affections, that they all bee of one accord. (3) That they make no doubt whether God will hear or grant those things which wee (who come to him by Jesus Christ) ask of him according to his revealed will.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 9.</hi> In like manner also, that women adorn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in modest apparel, with shamefastness, and sobriety: not with broidered hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Precept</hi> 3. That women while they pray together with the Assembly, and are present in other sacred performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, in their cloaths, and other habits, compose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to honesty and modesty, which will prove a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ornament to them, than if they should come into the publick with broidered hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:49391:88"/>
apparel: In which if there bee superfluity, the adorning is unlawful, and forbidden in this place.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 10.</hi> But (which becometh Women professing god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness) with good works,</q>
               <p>Hee requires further to the adorning of women, both private and publick, that they bee eminent in good works: the reason whereof is given from their Christian profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, whereby in Baptism they promised to renounce the vanity and pomp of the world.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Precept</hi> 4. That women alwaies in Church-Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies undertake the part of learners, of teachers never: And that they learn with silence, and that in the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of their infirmity, and the natural subjection of their sex, although in personal indowments some wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mee may excel many men.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 12.</hi> But, I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to bee in silence.</q>
               <p>Hee explains the special Precept, and according to his authority <hi>forbids</hi> women to teach in publick.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Usurp Authority</hi>] The reasons of this prohibition are <hi>three</hi>: The <hi>first</hi> reason is contained in the latter part of the prohibition, because should a woman teach publickly, the woman should have authority over the man: shee should bee over, and instruct the man, who ought with silence to bee in subjection to her own Husband.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 13.</hi> For <hi>Adam</hi> was first <hi>formed,</hi> then <hi>Eve:</hi>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 2. Confirming the former, The manly sex is more worthy than the female: for the man <hi>Adam</hi> was first formed, and not for <hi>Eve</hi> the woman, but <hi>Eve</hi> was last formed for the man <hi>Adam</hi>: Therefore a woman ought to bee prohibited the office of teaching in the Church.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 14.</hi> And <hi>Adam</hi> was not deceived, but the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man being deceived, was in the transgression.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 3. The first seducement and sin was not by the man, or <hi>Adam,</hi> but by <hi>Eve,</hi> who deceived by the Devil, perswaded her Husband, to transgress the command: Therefore is it appointed of God, that afterward shee should bee in subjection to her Husband, and not pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly teach the man: And these reasons are sufficient that the woman in the Church at least, where the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter concerns souls, should not have the preheminence.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 15.</hi> Notwithstanding shee shall bee saved in child-bearing, if they continue in Faith, and Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Holiness with Sobriety.</q>
               <p>Hee answers an Objection, and comforts the woman against this seclusion from the Pastoral office in the Church, against the entrance of sin into the world by her, against the subjection of her sex, and against other inconveniences, which are consequent to her sex: So that her exclusion from the office of a Teacher, nor the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils recited should hinder the salvation of women, if so bee they were indued with true Faith, and continued therein, constantly maintaining charity, holiness, and modesty, and the other fruits of true Faith in their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mestick calling, which for the most part and ordinarily is imployed in bringing forth, and educating children (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which office, figuratively all other duties are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, which pertain to a family, to which the woman is designed, that shee attend according to her office in domestical affairs;) And the Apostle promiseth that true beleeving women, no less than beleeving men, or faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Pastors of the Church, should obtain eternal life in this their subjection, as certainly and easily, as if they had been admitted to the Ecclesiastical office of teaching, in which they cannot bee saved, unless they had such a Faith, which shews forth its efficacy by love and good works.</p>

It is called the Mystery of godliness, because it hath for its end Christian piety, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in faith and obedience to the commands of Christ, or in faith which worketh by love.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Great</hi>] It is called <hi>Great,</hi> because it treats of God, Christ, the great work of Redemption, of the glory of Righteousness, and Divine grace, and our salvation, which of all things are the greatest.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>God</hi>] The <hi>second</hi> fundamental Doctrine is this, In the person of Christ, God was <hi>manifested</hi> in the flesh.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>God] viz.</hi> The onely begotten Son of God, and consequently truly and eternally God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Manifest] viz.</hi> To the whole world visibly and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shewed forth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In the flesh] viz.</hi> In the humane nature, even mortal and frail, but free from sin, hee shewed forth himself the true <hi>Immanuel,</hi> and God with us: And here the two Natures are pointed out, the <hi>Divine</hi> which did assume, and the <hi>Humane</hi> which was assumed, and the whole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>basement of Christ in the flesh is herein contained.</p>

In the person of Christ, <hi>God was manifested in the flesh, justified by the Spirit, i. e.</hi> Christ by his Divine power (which shewed it self forth in his doctrine and life, also in his Miracles, especially in his glorious Resurrection from the dead) was not onely just and true, but also abundantly declared the onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son of God, and the supreme Prophet of the Church, and King and Priest eternal; and acquitted from all the calumnies and reproaches of the Jewes, and all his enemies.</p>
                  <p>

God manifested in the flesh, was <hi>seen of Angels, i. e.</hi> acknowledged of the Angels, and by the clearer manifestation of his Majesty, and also of the Divine will, Christ, God incarnate, was more apparently seen; and therefore the Angels are made use of by God, as fit witnesses of the Conception, Birth, Suffering, and Resurrection of Christ, who hitherto admire this my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, amazed with the excellency of the matter, desire further to look into it, stooping down to behold the things which are revealed to the Church by the Spirit, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.10.

God manifest in the flesh, and <hi>preached</hi> to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> is a great mystery, for it is a wonderful thing, that the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> (who as yet wandred in the blindness of their mindes) should have the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of the Son of God, which Doctrine was at first concealed from the Apostles themselves, as also the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of Heaven.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>In the <hi>latter part,</hi> hee sets down the duties of a good Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor, and Governour of the Church, whereby they might preserve themselves and their people free from that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and Apostacy.</p>
               </argument>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 1.</hi> Now the Spirit speaketh expresly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of Devils:</q>
               <p>As to what concerns the Prophecie of the future Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie from the faith, or sound doctrine of the Gospel, hee premises <hi>four</hi> things: Whereof the <hi>first</hi> is concerning the certainty of the Defection, because the Holy Ghost, not obscurely, or darkly, but expresly forewarned them of this Apostacy, and foretold them of the times imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately following, wherein the defection from the faith should begin, and should prevail in the visible Church.</p>
               <p>The <hi>second</hi> contains <hi>three</hi> causes of their defection; Cause (1) <hi>Deceiving spirits, i. e.</hi> Devils, authors of all kinde of errors and impostures; Cause (2) <hi>False teachers,</hi> who taught and propagated by the inspiration of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, false doctrines, or doctrines of Devils, invented by him in the Church: Cause (3) Attention, hearkning to, and miserable men, giving credit to those Teachers and Devils.</p>

(1) There shall bee <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> counterfeiting themselves lovers of the truth in all things, even then when they obtrude their false opinions upon the Church.

               <p>In the <hi>fourth</hi> place, hee propounds <hi>two</hi> Examples of these Diabolical doctrines in things indifferent, by which Doctrines, as by certain marks wee may know those Diabolical teachers with their Apostate followers. The <hi>first</hi> is, forbidding to marry, which errour, it matters not what authors it hath besides the Devil, it hath the Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificians patronage, with whom it hath of a long time been favoured, and still is, from the time that all their
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:49391:89"/>
Clergy was enjoyned singleness of life. <hi>Another</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Devils, is, about the choice of meats, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staining from some, as impure, which errour amongst the <hi>Romanists</hi> is urged, observed, defended with more Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, than the most exercises of Piety and Justice pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed by God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Which God</hi>] Hee proves by <hi>six</hi> Reasons the latter branch of this Doctrine, touching the forbidding of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain meats for Religions sake, to bee false and diabolical; <hi>First,</hi> From the end of the Creation, Because God had created all kinds of meat, to that end that wee should par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of them, and feed upon them: Therefore it is a diabolical Doctrine, which gives Precepts about the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding certain meats, when God affords them, and their use is seasonable and convenient.</p>

The use of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, whensoever it is convenient, is allowed of God, to Beleevers, or to those who have the knowledge of the Gospel: Therefore to prohibit any meats to Christians, to which they have right granted, and may bee conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to nature, is the Doctrine of Devils.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 4.</hi> For every Creature is good, and nothing to bee refused, if it bee received with thanksgiving.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 4. Generally, Touching upon the forbidding of marriage, and meats; whatsoever God hath created is good, in its lawful use, as meat, marriage, and the rest of the creatures: For God looked upon what hee had created, and behold it was very good: Therefore the Doctrine that prohibits the natural lawful use of the creatures of God is diabolical.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nor any thing] Reas.</hi> 5. None of the creatures or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of God are to bee rejected, if they bee used lawfully, and with thanksgiving: Therefore the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine that rejects Marriage or Meats, when the use of them may bee lawful, and convenient, is the Doctrine of Devils.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 5.</hi> For it is sanctified by the Word of God, and Prayer.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 6. Confirming the former; Every Creature of God, as Meat, Marriage, &amp;c. is sanctified to us for a lawful use, joyned with a good conscience, by the Word of God and Prayer (for by the Word of God, or the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Ordinance, wee understand a liberty and right re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored to us by Christ, and by Prayer wee acknowledge the gift of God, and desire his blessing:) Therefore the Doctrine which commands us to abstain from the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and makes them impure, when God hath sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and prepared them for a holy use, and vouchsafeth them to us, is diabolical.</p>

                     <hi>Vers. 6.</hi> If thou put the Brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt bee a good Minister of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, nourished up in the words of Faith, and of good Doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained.</q>
                  <p>The <hi>second</hi> part of the Chapter follows, containing the duties of <hi>Timothy</hi> in the execution of his present em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassage. The Exhortations are <hi>four.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mind] Hort.</hi> 1. That hee propose to the Brethren the admonitions hitherto expounded, and remember them of them: There are <hi>two</hi> Reasons of the Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A good] Reas.</hi> 1. If thou do these things thou shalt shew thy self a famous Minister of Christ, and careful that all things bee managed in the house of God, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his will.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nourished up] Reas.</hi> 2. Thou shalt demonstrate thy self nourished up in sound Doctrine, as it were with whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some food, which thou hast attained from my teaching, (from whom thou hast never been absent.)</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 7.</hi> But refuse old wives fables, and exercise thy self rather unto godliness.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Exhort.</hi> 2. That rejecting humane traditions, and the inventions of men, devised to support their traditions (as it were prophane fables, with which old women, and children are taken, rather than wise men) hee exercise himself in solid virtues, which are prescribed of God, to the promoting of piety, and the worship of God, and that hee take care that others exercise themselves therein.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 8.</hi> For bodily exercise profiteth little, but godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is profitable unto all things, having the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of the life that now is, and that which is to come.</q>
                  <p>The Reasons of this Exhortation are <hi>four.</hi> 1. Because those bodily exercises, in watchings, and abstinence from meats, and such like voluntary kinds of afflicting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, which are prescribed by the Precepts of men, are profitable to little, <hi>i. e.</hi> they do not recompence the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour with their advantage, but are altogether unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, for the due use of such exercises, when God calls us extraordinarily to them, are profitable helps, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by men, as superstitious, they are disadvanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Godliness] Reas.</hi> 2. Christian Piety which is exacted by divine Precepts, is profitable to all things, whether to our selves, or others, whether wee regard the present, or the world to come, because it hath the divine promise of happiness, in this and that life which is eternal.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 9.</hi> This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 3. Confirming both the exhortation and the precedent reason: Because this Doctrine touching the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting the inventions of men, and following the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises of true godliness, is a true saying, which will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no man, and indeed a saving Doctrine, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore such as all men ought to embrace and defend.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 10.</hi> For therefore wee both labour, and suffer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, because wee trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, especially of those that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 4. Confirming the former Reasons. Because wee suffer afflictions and streights, labours and reproach enough from unjust persecutors, for rejecting the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions of men, and defending of true godliness, which consists in the exercises of Faith and Obedience, and those afflictions wee bear valiantly, from the hope of the promises, which are made to us that walk in this way of godliness: Therefore rejecting the inventions of men, follow after godliness.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Living</hi>] Hee amplifies this Reason, and confirms it from <hi>two</hi> properties in God, in whom wee trust: The <hi>first</hi> is, God is the Living God, not onely subjectively, or as to the subject <hi>Actuous,</hi> but also effectually, or in respect of us, hee that <hi>gives life,</hi> who so performs his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, that wee know him to bee the author of truth and life. <hi>Secondly,</hi> God is the <hi>Saviour</hi> of <hi>all men,</hi> as it is said, <hi>Psal.</hi> 36. <hi>Thou preservest man and beast,</hi> by his general goodness nourishing and supporting all men, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his Sun to rise upon the just and unjust: But chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and upon a more special ground, the Saviour of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, who relying upon his promises concerning the happiness of the life to come, renounce and reject hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane inventions and opinions even in the dangers of persecution, and follow after the exercises of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 11.</hi> These things command and teach.</q>
                  <p>Hee repeats and amplifies this Exhortation; Hee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats <hi>Timothy,</hi> according to his authority, that hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend this Doctrine to his Brethren to bee taught, and urged, and that hee himself also diligently press it.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 12.</hi> Let no man despise thy youth, but be thou an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Beleevers, in word, in conversation, in cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Exhort.</hi> 3. That hee endeavour to maintain his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:49391:90"/>
and to this end, Lest any one should have just cause of despising his youth, hee commands him to shew himself a Pattern, and as it were, a speaking. Rule, in life and Doctrine, in word and deed, in whom love to God and his neighbour, spiritual affection, fidelity in his office, chastity or purity from defilements (with which they who are given to carnal pleasures, use to pollute themselves) may shine forth.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 13.</hi> Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Exhort.</hi> 4. That hee diligently apply himself to his office of teaching: partly by diligent reading the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, partly in frequent exercising himself in preaching, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially so long as hee may abide in one place; and by name so long as hee should continue at <hi>Ephesus</hi>: for such an occasion could not easily bee expected, after the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles coming, by reason of his travels with the Apostle.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 14.</hi> Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by Prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the Presbytery.</q>
                  <p>The reasons of his Exhortation so often repeated and pressed, are <hi>five.</hi> 1. Because that holy office of an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelist, whereunto hee was called, is the gift of Gods Grace, and therefore not to bee neglected.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Given] Reas.</hi> 2. Because this office of preaching is committed to thee, by a special Prophetical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, which God put into the Prophets, that <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> should bee taken into the Ministery of the Gospel: Therefore thou oughtest not to manage it negligently.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laying on of hands] Reas.</hi> 3. Because thou art also called by the Church to this office, by the laying on of the hands of the Presbytery, that is, the Colledge of Presbyters: Amongst whom for the time <hi>Paul</hi> himself was President, who in the name of the Presbytery, and together with other Presbyters, laid his hands upon him, as it appears by comparing 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6. By which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of hands, they intimated that the man was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated and dedicated unto God: Therefore the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thy office so solemnly committed unto thee, is not to bee neglected by thee.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 15.</hi> Meditate upon these things, give thy self wholly to them, that thy profiting may appear to all.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 4. This Ministery is to bee heeded so, as that thy profiting, in Doctrine, and also in Life, or in all the parts of thy Ministery, may evidently appear unto all: Therefore it is thy duty seriously to attend to thy Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, with mature deliberation and meditation.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 16.</hi> Take heed unto thy self, and unto the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, continue in them: for in doing this, thou shalt both save thy self, and them that hear thee.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 5. Because so, as an instrumental cause, thou shalt bring those that hear thee to eternal salvation: Therefore it behoves thee constantly to attend to thy Life and Doctrine in this thy Ministery.</p>

That hee should not burthen the Church in providing for those Widows, who might bee provided for by their Children or Nephews, but take care that the Children and Nephews, performed the duty of Piety, first, towards their own families, their Mothers and Grandmothers: There are <hi>two</hi> Reasons of the Precept.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>R.</hi> (1) Because so they should requite their Parents, who had trained up their children with this hope, that their Children (if need were) might <gap reason="foreign">

                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 5.</hi> Now shee that is a Widow indeed, and deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, trusteth in God, and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day,</q>

                     <hi>Precept</hi> 3. That hee observe in the choice of Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, that shee which is chosen bee not without the qualifications of a true Widow, or a Christian Widow to bee provided for by the Church: Here hee sets down <hi>four</hi> qualifications. (1) It is required that shee bee alone, <hi>i. e.</hi> destitute of Children and Nephews, and all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane supply. (2) That shee bee faithful, trusting in God, not getting her living by evil courses, but relying upon God. (3) That shee bee daily given to the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises of Piety.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 6.</hi> But shee that liveth in pleasure, is dead while shee liveth.</q>
                  <p n="4">(4) That shee bee not of the number of wanton Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, who indulge themselves in idleness and pleasures, not regarding the exercises of godliness.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dead</hi>] The reason of this qualification is given, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause those unprofitable women, are as it were, dead while they live, both in respect to God, whom they do not serve, and in respect to humane society, whom they no waies indeavour to benefit by their work.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. Because there is danger, lest being pampered with the Churches bread, they begin to waxe wanton a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Christ (as some younger Widows have done al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready) and despairing of Marriage in the Church, they think of falling away from the faith of Christ, and afterwards openly revolt, that they may marry some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidel out of the Church.</p>
                  <q>

                  <p n="2">(2) Because it is found by experience that some youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Widows have declined the true Religion, and have betaken themselves to the Tents of Satan, out of the Territories of the Church.</p>
                  <q>

                     <hi>Vers. 17.</hi> Let the Elders that rule well, bee counted worthy of double honour, especially they who labour in the word and doctrine.</q>
                  <p>The <hi>third</hi> part of the Chapter concerning Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters contains <hi>five</hi> Precepts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Precept</hi> 1. That an honourable stipend bee afforded to the Presbyters, who well discharge their duty in feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Church. And it is said, <hi>Let them hee accounted worthy,</hi> because if perhaps in some poorer Churches, the maintenance bee not sufficient, or if it shall seem good to some Elders, upon reasons known to themselves, to serve the Church freely, in such a case it is fitting, that they bee <hi>accounted at leastwise worthy of double honour,</hi> or a liberal stipend, whether they exact it or not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Especially</hi>] Hee makes <hi>two</hi> orders of these Elders, <hi>one</hi> that labour in the word and doctrine, such are Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors and Doctors: <hi>Another</hi> of those that rule well<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>i. e.</hi> That endeavour to govern the Church in life and manners, but labour not in the word and doctrine, such are Elders, which are called Rulers, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.8. Hee would have both these kindes of Elders, rightly managing their Offices, accounted worthy of double honour, but especially those that labour in the word and doctrine, because they are wholly set apart to the word and prayer: Therefore it is fitting that they should bee liberally maintained. Hee calls the stipend given them by the name of <hi>Honour,</hi> because of such moment is their work, that it cannot bee valued at any rate: And because the stipend which is allowed them, is to bee given not upon the account of wages, but an Honorary, or an honourable reward.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 18.</hi> For the Scripture saith, Thou shalt not muzzle the Oxe that treadeth out the corn; and the labourer is worthy of his reward.</q>
                  <p>Hee layes down <hi>two</hi> Reasons of the Precept; (1) From <hi>Deut.</hi> 25.4. Where from the Allegory of an Oxe, treading out the corn with his feet, God commands that the Pastors of the Church should bee maintained, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning from the greater to the less.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Worthy</hi>] 2. From <hi>Levit.</hi> 9. or <hi>Luke</hi> 18.7. Where from the Precept of giving a due reward to the labourer, it is gathered from the less to the greater; Honour is much more to bee repayed to him, who is not an hireling, but a Father, and a laborious Pastor.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 19.</hi> Against an Elder receive not an accusation, but before two or three witnesses.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Precept</hi> 2. That an accusation against an Elder bee not received, or taken for true, unless upon the testimony of three witnesses, or at the least two, (worthy of credit) it bee affirmed: And that which is here spoken to <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi> alone, is spoken to all that sit in the Presbytery, because other where, judgement is committed to the whole Presbytery; yea what is spoken here to <hi>Timothy,</hi> is

spoken to the whole Presbytery at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> touching the administration of the whole Discipline of the Church, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28. <hi>Timothy</hi> the Evangelist, in the mean time might exercise extraordinary power, as hee was an Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist, and the Apostles Legate.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Precept</hi> 3. Of avoiding scandals; If the Elders, or any other in the Church should offend openly, that they bee publickly reproved: The reason is, That the rest may bee afraid, being admonished by their example, and may take heed to themselves that they do not offend.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 21.</hi> I charge thee before God, and the Lord Iesus Christ, and the elect Angels, that thou observe these things without preferring one before another, doing nothing by partiality.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Precept</hi> 4. In which (by way of <hi>Epiphonema</hi>) hee most gravely charges <hi>Timothy,</hi> and in him all Ecclesiastical Judges, that nothing bee done in Church affairs, or censures, with pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 22.</hi> Lay hands suddenly on no man; neither bee partakers of other mens sins: Keep thy self pure.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Precept</hi> 5. That hee do not rashly receive any one into the sacred Ministry, without mature deliberation, and examination preceding, hee do not lay hands (which was the sign of Ordination) upon any one: Hee gives <hi>two</hi> Reasons of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Neither] Reas.</hi> 1. Lest if hee should ordain one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitting, in this very thing hee should communicate with him in his sins, and by consequence in his punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thy self] Reas.</hi> 2. Because thou oughtest to keep thy self pure from defilements; and therefore from the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining of an unworthy man; If happily the rest of the Presbytery at any time shall determine to admit an unfit man to the Ministry, or one that is not approved, keep thy self pure, neither consent thou, but labour by all means so to preserve purity and holiness, that thou keep off from all affinity with sin, as much as in thee lyes. Hee explains the parts of this Precept in the two next follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing verses, the meaning of the latter part, <hi>of being himself pure,</hi> vers. 23. and shews the meaning of the former part, vers. 24.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 23.</hi> Drinke no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomachs sake, and thine often infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</q>
                  <p>As to the latter part of the Precept, of keeping him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self pure; because the Apostle knew that <hi>Timothy</hi> by reason of his earnest endeavours after purity and chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, had been injurious to his own health, therefore by the way hee adviseth him, that hee do not so understand the Precept of keeping himself pure, as to neglect his health and render himself unfit for the works of his Calling, but use an holy prudence, and in subduing his body, by drinking of water, to use a little wine as it were phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sically, and for the necessity of health, lest if hee should proceed in not favouring his weak stomach, and his body labouring under often infirmities, immediately the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle of his body should fall to decay, and the Church should bee deprived of so profitable an instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 24.</hi> Some mens sins are open before hand, going before to judgement: And some men they follow after.</q>
                  <p>As to what concerns the meaning of the former part of the Precept, <hi>Lest hee should partake of other mens sins</hi>; hee shews that hee spake of open sins, which may bee known, and avoided, not of private, which fall not under observation; and that hee beware, lest hee par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of other mens sins, and in laying hands rashly on no man; hee shews in this, that using examination, and tryal, the open sins of any one that is unworthy may bee known, as also the open virtues of men meet to bee admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Ministery of the Gospel. For the sins of some Candidates of the Ministery are so manifest, that they prevent the examination and judgement of the Church, that they may easily bee rejected. For before the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church can determine about them, there is matter in readiness, in their open sins, for their condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, or rejection from the Ministery, by the opinion of the Ecclesiastical Senate: And the sins of other<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, upon examination premised, and the judgement of the Church concerning them being given, are brought forth into the light.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 25.</hi> Likewise also the good works of some, are manifest before-hand, and they that are otherwise cannot be hid.</q>
                  <p>In like manner the virtue of some that are Candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates to the Ministery, and their good works, are so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly known, that it is easie for the Church to judge them fit to bee admitted. But the works of those that are otherwise, or upon examination had, and inquisition made, are not manifest, or so secret, that they cannot bee known of men, they are to bee left to God, nor can they long bee hid, but in their own time will bee brought to light, that if the Church cannot prevent, but those hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites are admitted to the Ministery, yet care may bee had, where they are already made manifest, that they bee dealt with according to the Discipline of the Church.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Precept</hi> 1. Concerning the instructing of Christian servants, who are servants by condition, and under the yoak of another, the Precept is this, That they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count their own Masters, though Infidels, worthy of all honour, whom they serve, as those that are pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, by the providence of God, in a degree above them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the name of God</hi>] The reason of the Precept is this, lest if they should do otherwise, the Gospel might bee evil spoken of, and reproached by Infidels, through the miscarriage of Christian servants.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 2.</hi> And they that have beleeving Masters, let them not despise them, because they are brethren: but rather do them service, because they are faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and beloved, partakers of the benefit. These things teach and exhort.</q>
               <p>But if their Masters bee beleevers, Hee retorts what servants were ready to object; And because being Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in Christianity, doth not take away diversity of conditions in civil policy, hee forbids servants to despise their Masters upon that account, because they are equal in Christ, and he commands that they serve them so much the more readily, because their Masters were faithful, and beloved of God, and for this cause so much the more worthy to receive the fruit of their service. Hee enjoyns <hi>Timothy</hi> himself to teach these things, and to exhort o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Pastors to teach the same.</p>

Christ, or God the Father, Son<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Holy Spirit, whose Ministery thou hast in hand, is alone in himself Blessed, and Powerful, who can bless his own, and destroy his and their enemies, so that the friendships or enmities of all Kings compared with his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour

                  <hi>Whom no man hath seen] Arg.</hi> 6. Although the reasons of his commands should not bee manifest to us, yet for our Obedience and Faith it is sufficient to know, that God in himself is a light which cannot bee approached, and an hidden Majesty, having his peculiar and proper essence, which our understanding cannot apprehend, nor see with a beatifical vision in this mortal life: Therefore it becomes us to adore, observe, and extol the pleasure of his will, rather than curiously to search into it: To him bee honour and power for ever.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Precept</hi> 6. Of admonishing the rich, touching a <hi>two-fold</hi> duty which belongs to them; The <hi>first</hi> is, That as to the inward man, they bee not puffed up because of their riches, despising the poor in comparison with themselves, nor trust in their riches, but in the Living God; of this duty hee gives <hi>three</hi> Reasons. (1) Because riches are uncertain. (2) Because, not riches, but God is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of life to them that trust in him. (3) Because God gives and takes away riches at his pleasure, as also all other things.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 18.</hi> That they do good, that they bee rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate,</q>
               <p>Another duty of rich men is this, That as to external works, they exercise liberality towards the poor, and also study to abound generally in good works, free to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate the use of their possessions and goods unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>

               <p>The Argument to this duty is, the promise of a free reward, because by bestowing their uncertain riches, they shall lay up for themselves in Heaven, a more enduring and solid treasure, and walking in the way of good works, they shall lay hold upon eternal life.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 20.</hi> O <hi>Timothy,</hi> keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding prophane and vain bablings, and oppositions of science, falsely so called.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Precept</hi> 7. And last: Wherein hee seriously commends to <hi>Timothy</hi> the Doctrine of the Gospel hitherto delivered, that hee faithfully keep it, as that which is committed to his trust, and that hee restrain the prophane wranglings of sophisters about divine matters; upon <hi>three</hi> reasons. (1) Because true Doctrine is as precious as a treasure. (2) Because wrangling disputations are vain and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy the name of Philosophy or Science.</p>

               <p>That <hi>Paul</hi> might commend <hi>Timothy</hi> (to whom hee writes) to all the Churches, Hee calls him beloved Son, most especially, because hee preached the Doctrine which
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:49391:92"/>
hee had learned of <hi>Paul</hi> faithfully, as <hi>Paul</hi> himself, and resembled him as a Father in the whole course of his conversation; Therefore hee was beloved of <hi>Paul,</hi> and had in estimation by him, as a Son, to whom hee wishes all excellent things from God, as hee had done in the former Epistle.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Remembrance] Argum.</hi> 1. Because hee continually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members <hi>Timothy</hi> in his prayers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I thank God] Argum.</hi> 2. Because hee values it as a favour given him from God, that hee remembred <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,</hi> for whom hee acknowledgeth that thanks are to bee rendred unto God: for it is an excellent benefit, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vouchsafed to the Saints, to love the Saints, or those whom God loveth: These two Arguments hee explains and confirms from this, That with a sincere unfeigned mind hee prayed, and gave thanks to God for <hi>Timothy</hi>; and hee proves his sincerity from this, That not onely in his whole life past, hee endeavoured to keep a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science inviolated, lest hee should do any thing against it, but also that after his conversion to the Faith, in a pure conscience, <hi>i. e.</hi> illuminated by the Holy Spirit, and purified by the blood of Christ, hee endeavoured to serve God, the God of <hi>Israel,</hi> or of <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> and the God of all the rest of his faithful Ancestors: for hee that serves Christ with a sincere mind, serves also the Holy One of <hi>Israel,</hi> the Father and the Holy Ghost: hee serves the true God three in One, and maintains the same true Religion with all the holy Patriarches.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. Because hee had an earnest desire to see the face of <hi>Timothy,</hi> that hee might enjoy his company. Hee illustrates this Argument from <hi>three</hi> Reasons of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire. <hi>Cause</hi> 1. The remembrance of <hi>Timothies</hi> tears, or his most tender affection, as well towards God, as to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards himself for Gods sake, from whom when hee was departing, <hi>Timothy</hi> could not bee drawn away, but with tears. <hi>Cause</hi> 2. The hope of rejoycing exceedingly when hee should see him.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 5.</hi> When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother <hi>Lois,</hi> and thy mother <hi>Eunice,</hi> and I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded that in thee also.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cause</hi> 3. It was the remembrance of his sincere faith, such as was in his Grandmother and mother, who dyed in the faith of the Mediator (whether before Christ was revealed to them, God manifested in the flesh, is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, but certain it is that they beleeved in Christ that was to come according to the promises) in which hope <hi>Timothy</hi> was brought up from a childe by his mother, and was instructed by her in the Scriptures.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 6.</hi> Wherefore I put thee in remembrance, that thou stir up the gift of God which is in thee, by the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on of my hands.</q>
               <p>After the Preface, <hi>four</hi> Admonitions follow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Admon.</hi> 1. Inferred by way of consequence from the former, That hee would stir up in himself those sparks of his ability in preaching the Gospel, and the gifts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon him, to this end, by the prayers of the Church, when in the name of the Presbytery <hi>Paul</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained him to bee a Preacher: And that hee would boldly manifest the vertue of the gifts conferred upon him, in the execution of his Ministry, notwithstanding all lets, which the flesh, the world, and the devil might oppose against him.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 7.</hi> For God hath not given us the spirit of fear, but of power, of love, and of a sound minde.</q>
               <p>There are two Reasons of the Admonition: (1) Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the spirit of fear (by which any one dare not speak and do what hee ought, and what hee would speak and do in his Ministry, was hee not subdued by fear) is not from God, nor becomes the Minister of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of power</hi>] (2) Because the gift of the Spirit which God vouchsafes to his Ministers, is a Spirit, (1) Of power and efficacy, which dares, and is able to oppose it self against every thing that exalts it self against Christ: And (2) a Spirit of love, which is not drawn away from true love to men. And (3) the Spirit of a sound minde, which neither with preposterous zeal, nor by foolish and carnal love is drawn away from the truth of sound Doctrine, but such as renders the minde sound in the Doctrine of faith, and the heart filled with charity, and enkindles a zeal in the heart boldly to manage the things of Christ, and contains all these gifts conjoyned amongst themselves with a sacred tye.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Admon.</hi> 2. That <hi>Timothy</hi> bee not ashamed of the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of the truth of the Gospel, nor of the Cross of Christ i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> his servant <hi>Paul,</hi> but that hee prepare himself to bear afflictions for Christ, and accompany himself with those that bear the Cross.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>According to the power</hi>] The Reasons of these Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions are <hi>eight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. Because if any thing bee laid upon us to bee born for Christ above our strength, <hi>The power of God</hi> will bee present to help and deliver us, trusting in whose power, and supported by his aid, wee are bound to bee confident, and relye upon him above our own strength.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 9.</hi> Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his own purpose, and grace, which was given us in Christ Iesus before the world began.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 2. Confirming the former. Because God hath given us eternal life, and by his holy calling hath sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated us from the world, to this very end, that wee might confess Christ: Therefore wee ought not to bee asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of his testimony or cross.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Not according] Reas.</hi> 3. Because God freely doth all these things, not respecting our works, but his own grace, and gracious purpose: Therefore it is not fitting that wee should bee ashamed of the testimony of Christ, or his cross, or afflictions for his sake.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Before] Reas.</hi> 4. Confirming the former. Grace is given to us in Christ, before the world began, before wee, or our works could have any being, <hi>i. e.</hi> before all time: Therefore it is not meet that wee should bee asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the testimony or cross of Christ. It is called <hi>Grace given to us in Christ,</hi> Because although wee had not any being, yet Christ the designed Mediatour, the second person of the Trinity, subsisted from eternity, who co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanted with his Father, for us his Elect, before all time, and afterwards in time paid the price of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and in our name received the grace assigned to us, by which in time wee should bee called, justified, and freely saved in due season.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 10.</hi> But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Iesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the Gospel.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 5. Proving the position, shewing also that all the favours which are bestowed upon us are from Grace, Because the abolishing of death, life and immortality, and the rest which concern our salvation, were unknown to us, till revealed by Christ, and brought to light, being all acted and finished by him: Therefore consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering this Grace conferred upon us, wee ought not to be ashamed of his Gospel.</p>

                  <hi>Vers. 11.</hi> Whereunto I am appointed a Preacher, and an Apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 6. God so much esteems the Testimony of the Gospel, that hee appointed <hi>Paul</hi> an Apostle to declare it to the whole world, and specially to the Gentiles: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let not <hi>Timothy</hi> bee ashamed, or any other, of this Gospel, or of <hi>Paul</hi> a Minister of it, although afflicted for the Testimony of the Gospel.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 12.</hi> For the which cause I also suffer these things; nevertheless I am not ashamed; for I know whom I have beleeved, and I am perswaded, that hee is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 7. From the example of the Apostle; I my self suffer bonds for the Gospel, and yet I am not ashamed: Therefore in like manner ought <hi>Timothy</hi> to bee of good courage, and not bee ashamed in the cause of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel.</p>

I <hi>Paul</hi> have committed my body and soul to God who is faithful and powerful, to keep what I have betrusted him with to the day of judgement: And I am perswaded that I shall bee kept: Therefore neither ought I to bee ashamed, nor thou, O <hi>Timothy,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever befalls us, for the Testimony of the Gospel.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Admon.</hi> 3. That hee retain and follow that same way of teaching (both as to Doctrine, and the manner of teaching) which hee had learnt from <hi>Paul,</hi> and that hee set it forth as near as hee can to the quick: Hee adds in <hi>faith and love which is in Christ Iesus,</hi> that hee may set forth the Summary of Doctrine, which may bee wholly reduced to Faith and Love, flowing from the knowledge of Christ.</p>
               <q>

               <p>The Arguments of the Exhortation are <hi>five</hi>; all which prove that the form of sound Doctrine is to bee held fast.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. This form, is that which is deposited, or that which God hath committed to thy trust, who will take an account of thee for what hee hath committed to thee: Therefore this form of Doctrine is to bee held fast.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>By the Holy Ghost] Argum.</hi> 2. Although thy own strength should fail thee in the defence of thy Doctrine, yet the assistance of the Holy Ghost dwelling in thee will bee at hand for the upholding of his sincere servant, if thou implore his aid: Therefore this form of sound Doctrine is to bee held fast.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. On this hand temptations are in readiness, by which thou mayest bee drawn away unawares from the defence and profession of the Gospel, as thou hast been taught by the example of the brethren of <hi>Asia,</hi> by name <hi>Phygellus</hi> and <hi>Hermogenes,</hi> by whose example, thou and all other the Ministers of the Gospel being warned, shouldest bee watchful: Therefore, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 5. On the other side, the Spirit and grace of God is so prevalent in thee, and others that are faithful, to constancy in trialls, that if yee bee watchful, yee need not fear the losing of sound Doctrine: Therefore yee ought to endeavour the holding fast the form of sound Doctrine.</p>

                  <hi>Vers. 1.</hi> Thou there fore, my son, bee strong in the grace that is in Christ Iesus.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Admon.</hi> 1. That hee endeavour the propagation of the Gospel, not onely by himself, but also by others, that were to succeed him in the Ministry, standing upon no pains, that were requisite for the promoting of it. There are three branches of this Admonition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Branch</hi> 1. That hee arm himself with strength to the work of the Ministry, and put on courage, and address himself to manage his affairs well. Hee insinuates <hi>two</hi> Arguments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Son] Arg.</hi> 1. Because it becomes <hi>Pauls</hi> Son, to put on courage, and bee valiant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the grace] Arg.</hi> 2. Because the grace which is in Jesus Christ alone, will not bee wanting to thee, when thou preparest thy self for thy work.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 2.</hi> And the things that thou hast heard of mee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall bee able to teach others also.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Branch</hi> 2. That hee teach not the people only Sermon-wise, but also Scholastically instruct the Candidates in Divinity, or those that are designed for the Ministerial function, by opening the Apostolical Doctrine, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusting it, as it were, with faithful Depositaries, which may teach others the same Doctrine, that so the Doctrine of the Gospel may bee delivered and propagated from hand to hand. Hee adds an Argument from his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, who had instructed <hi>Timothy,</hi> and many others, his fellow-disciples, in this Doctrine, not onely teaching them publickly together with the people, but also in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing them Scholastically apart from the people.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 3.</hi> Thou therefore indure hardness, as a good soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier of Iesus Christ.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Branch</hi> 3. That hee neither fear nor flye from the pains, which was required to this double work, nor the afflictions or persecutions that followed it, but receive and bear them with a good courage.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As a souldier</hi>] The Arguments of the Exhortation or Admonition, are <hi>eleven,</hi> all which prove that hee ought valiantly to manage his warfare in the Ministry of the Gospel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. Because thou are a souldier of Jesus Christ, to whom as to thy General, thou hast bound thy self by a
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:49391:93"/>
Military oath: And it becomes a Christian souldier to follow the example of Christ, not fiercely to strive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his Adversaries, but patiently inuring himself to the Cross, and in the carrying on of his work (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending with difficulties) to proceed forwards. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou oughtest to behave thy self couragiously in managing thy warfare in the Ministry of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 4.</hi> No man that warreth, entangleth himself with the affairs of this life, that hee may please him who hath chosen him to bee a Souldier.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. Propounded by way of comparison, because otherwise thou canst not please thy General Christ, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less (setting aside all thy occasions that might call thee away from the work of Christ) thou addict thy self wholly to his service: Therefore, &amp;c.</p>
               <q>

               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. Propounded by way of comparison to the sports, and noble striving which were amongst the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, because thou canst not bee crowned, if (wearied in the first onset) thou retreat out of the field to rest and ease, but it behoves thee to strive lawfully, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute the contention so far as the Law prescribes, <hi>i. e.</hi> persevere so long as thou livest, in this Christian war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, that a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. Propounded by way of similitude, as the former. Because it is necessary that thou first labour, if thou wilt receive fruit, which (as an Husbandman) without doubt thou shalt reap, if thou followest thy work with a good courage: Therefore, &amp;c.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 7.</hi> Consider what I say, and the Lord give thee understanding in all things.</q>
               <p>That <hi>Timothy</hi> may gather and conceive more by these similitudes than could bee set down, or need to bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, hee leaves the applications of these similitudes to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and further prayes unto God, that hee would open his eyes to see those lessons which here and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where hee might learn for the discharging of his duty; for these comparisons were weaker than to reach the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the Christian warfare, and the reward of those that labour in the Ministry.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 8.</hi> Remember that Iesus Christ of the seed of <hi>David</hi> was raised from the dead, according to my Gospel:</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 5. Because Christ the General, and Captain of the Army, hath conquered all adverse power, and death it self, by the vertue of his Deity, rising again from the dead for us, in the same flesh which hee assumed from the Seed of <hi>David,</hi> as I have preached: Therefore, O <hi>Timothy,</hi> thou mayest hope to bee delivered from all evills, and from death it self, by the power of Christ, very God, and very man. To which end also, hee commands <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi> to remember and keep in minde this Doctrine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this is the chief foundation of faith, hope, and Christian consolation.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 9.</hi> Wherein I suffer trouble as an evil doer, even unto bonds, but the word of God is not bound.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 6. From the example of <hi>Paul</hi> himself. I suffer bonds and disgrace willingly in the work of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry: Therefore do thou prepare thy self to suffer the like.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the word] Arg.</hi> 7. All the endeavour of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries of the Gospel comes to nothing, while they persecute us the servants of Christ, even unto bonds, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause although they may overcome us professours of the Gospel, yet they overcome not, nor doth the Gospel suffer bonds, or is it hindred in its course: Therefore let us confidently carry on our warfare.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 10.</hi> Therefore I indure all things for the Elects sake, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Iesus, with eternal glory.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 8. The Elect of God are worthy, for whose edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and confirmation in the faith, to eternal salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion purchased by Christ, wee who are the Ministers of Christ, suffer all kindes of evills: Therefore, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 11.</hi> It is a faithful saying: For if wee bee dead with him, wee shall also live with him.</p>

Although the flesh hardly admits this saying, yet certain it is, That our communion with Christs death in induring the Cross, is annexed to our communion with the life of Christ; And certain it is that they shall reign with Christ, who suffer with, or for him: Therefore must wee bee of good courage in our warfare, that wee may live and reign with Christ.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 11. They that are unfaithful, although they bring destruction upon themselves, yet they shall detract nothing from the truth, or glory of Christ, who will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend his truth against the power of Adversaries, and the perfidiousness of Apostates, and will establish whatever hee hath said for his servants, and against their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: Therefore, &amp;c.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 14.</hi> Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them before the Lord, that they strive not about words to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Admon.</hi> 2. That <hi>Timothy</hi> do not onely inforce the things that are spoken, but also take care that the word of God bee wisely handled, both by others, and himself also for example unto others. There are three Branches of this Admonition:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Branch</hi> 1. That in the Name and Authority of Christ, hee refrain unprofitable disputations, such as theirs use to bee, who seek after applause for their accuteness in their Sophistry.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Unprofitable</hi>] The Reasons of this Branch are <hi>two: Reas.</hi> 1. Because such contentions produce no profit at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Subverting] Reas.</hi> 2. Because the faith of some is overthrown, who lose the truth in wranglings, or giving heed to perplexed disputations.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 15.</hi> Study to shew thy self approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to bee ashamed, rightly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding the word of truth.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Branch</hi> 2. That hee shew himself an example in a prudent administration of the word of God, studying to approve himself to God, when others look after publick applause; shewing himself a faithful workman, when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers boast themselves as vain disputers: Alwayes doing his endeavour, that he neither do nor speak any thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming, whereof he may be ashamed in the presence of God, whilst others fiercely strive amongst themselves, only because they are ashamed to bee overcome, or to bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted unlearned: Lastly, imploying himself in preaching, not in mincing of words, whilest the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance is neglected, but in a prudent dividing and distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of their plain meaning, and applying them to the advantage of the hearers, in faith and obedience to the truth.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 16.</hi> But shun prophane and vain bablings, for they will increase unto more ungodliness.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Branch</hi> 3. That hee decline the lofty and sophistical manner of speech, new, unusual, and prophane phrases: Hee subjoyns three Reasons of this Branch.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prophane] Reas.</hi> 1. Because as those insolent speeches proceed from the prophaneness and impiety of the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:49391:94"/>
mind, so they foster and increase ungodliness in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 17.</hi> And their word will eat as doth a canker, of whom is <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Philetus.</hi>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>R.</hi> 2. Because the manner of teaching, and the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Sophisters will eat up the Church, as a Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene consumes the body, which (as Physicians teach) unless it bee very suddenly cured, it invades the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous parts, seizes upon the very bones, and till the man is extinct it proceeds without ceasing.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 18.</hi> Who concerning the truth have erred, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That the Resurrection is past already, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow the Faith of some.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>R.</hi> 3. Because experience hath demonstrated this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, in the persons of two Hereticks: (whom he names to their disgrace, that they may be avoided as Rocks.) Who onely acknowledge an Allegorical Resurrection, erring from the Doctrine of Truth, overthrow the Faith of some, and while they insinuated their perverse opinion into others, gave occasion to some, not well setled in the Faith, to renounce the profession of the Christian Religion.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 19.</hi> Nevertheless, the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, the Lord knoweth them that are his, and let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Admonition</hi> 3. Of holding fast the Doctrine of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance of true Beleevers, although the Faith of some was overthrown: which admonition is propounded by way of consolation and confirmation of Faith, against the scandal of Apostates, especially of the famous Doctors: whose levity and perfidiousness ought indeed to stir up all to watchfulness, but it ought not in any wise to weaken the assurance of Faith in the Saints. The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to bee maintained by <hi>Timothy,</hi> in this, Although the Faith of some bee overthrown, yet the building of the salvation of the Elect, or true Beleevers, abides firm, or, The perseverance of the Saints is certain. This hee proves by <hi>six</hi> Arguments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sure] Argum.</hi> 1. By way of comparison from a build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: The building of the Faith, and salvation of the Elect, hath a sure foundation, laid by God, which stands unmoveable, and this it is, The free Election of God, the constancy and stability whereof hee compares to a foundation laid upon a Rock: Therefore the perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance of the Saints is certain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seal] Argum.</hi> 2. By way of comparison from a <hi>Seal,</hi> to this sense, The salvation of the Elect, is kept in the secret custody of God, as with a signet, so that, though it appear not to the world, who they are that are elected, yet it is certain that they were not of us, or the number of true Beleevers, who went out from us that truly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved, or revolted from our society: Therefore the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance of the Saints is certain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Knows] Argum.</hi> 3. Those are known unto God, who in a special manner are his, or belong to him, as his pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar ones; hee knows them and their names, and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and embraceth them with his special favour, that hee will not suffer them to bee pulled from him: To know them as his own, is to acquiesce in them by his special love, as his peculiar ones: Therefore the perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Saints is certain.</p>
               <p>

                  <p>In the <hi>second</hi> part (after hee hath treated about private matters, which concerned himself and <hi>Timothy)</hi> hee concludes the <hi>Epistle.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 1.</hi> I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Iesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing, and his Kingdome:</q>
               <p>Hee premises to his Exhortation (about the discharge of his Office) a grave obtestation, wherein hee sets before the eyes of <hi>Timothy,</hi> 1. The Majesty of God. 2. The Lord Jesus Christ. 3. The Judgement seat of Christ, before whom hee was to give an account of his Ministry, with others to bee judged in that last day. 4. That glory of Christ, which will shew forth it self at his illustrious appearance, and the full manifestation of his Kingdome.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 2.</hi> Preach the word, bee instant in season, out of season, reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long-suffering and doctrine.</q>
               <p>The Exhortation it self, in which hee requires <hi>five</hi> duties: (1) Diligence in preaching. (2) Striving a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all impediments. (3) That hee do not onely take all occasions to preach, which may consist not onely with his own convenience, and the leasure of the sloathful people, but that hee stir up himself, sparing no pains, and as it were with his hand, restrain the people busied about the vain imployments of the world, earnestly exhorting all to seek after that which is mainly necessary. (4) That hee leave no means unattempted, in exhorting the people that they make progress in the faith and obedience of Christ, not onely preaching true Doctrine, and reproving that which is false, but also reproving and correcting their evil conversations, and exhorting them to live ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily, justly, and soberly. (5) That hee mix his reproofs with zeal and fervency, and season them with gentleness, and that he back his confutations of errours with sound Doctrine, that his labour may not bee in vain.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 3.</hi> For the time will come when they will not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure sound Doctrine, but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears.</q>
               <p>Hee subjoyns <hi>nine</hi> Reasons to his Exhortation:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. Because the time was at hand, when many would depart from the sincerity of Doctrine, therefore it was necessary that <hi>Timothy</hi> should more diligently at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to his Office: And this defection he describes from its five degrees: (1) The Professours of Christ will not admit of sound Doctrine, they will not indure that their sins should bee reproved, or to bee stirred up to goodness, nor can any thing bee savoury or relished by them. (2) They will obstinately cleave to their own lusts, or carnal affections. (3) In their hearts, they will hate the true Pastors, as open enemies, and that they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain and suppress them, they will heap up to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves teachers, that will soothe up the people in their lusts. (4) The ancient truth of God conducing to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness and newness of life, will not relish with them, but
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:49391:95"/>
out of a curiosity alwaies to hear some new thing, they will seek for such as gently claw their itching ears, in the mean time making no small shew how much they are desirous to promote the Christian Doctrine and Religion.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 4.</hi> And they shall turn away their ears from the Truth, and shall bee turned unto Fables.</q>
               <p n="5">(5) The <hi>fift</hi> degree of their defection is this, They will openly profess their impatience of hearing those strict Teachers of the Truth, who produce nothing before them, but what they have learned from the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and shall turn themselves to hear those who urge in their preaching, the inventions of men, their own dreams, histories, humane fictions, fables and legends.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 5.</hi> But watch thou in all things, endure affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, do the work of an Evangelist, make full proof of thy Ministery.</q>
               <p>Hence hee infers and repeats his Exhortation, That <hi>Timothy</hi> bee so much the more vigilant, and execute all the parts of his office, inuring himself to labours and afflictions, not yeelding for any adversaries or dangers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of an Evangelist</hi>] To the repetition of his Exhortation hee adjoyns <hi>another Reason,</hi> Because it became him to act the part of an Evangelist, <hi>i. e.</hi> more than an ordinary Teacher, and to omit nothing of those things which may lawfully bee executed by a faithful Evangelist.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 6.</hi> For I am ready now to bee offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.</q>
               <p>The <hi>third Reason</hi> of his Exhortation is this, Because it is, as it were, a testamentary Exhortation of <hi>Paul,</hi> now old, whose fellowship <hi>Timothy</hi> was not long to enjoy, (for hee speaks this, as one that was to dye for the Gospel of Christ, and shortly to be loosed out of the prison of the world and his body, that hee might freely soar up to God) Therefore this Exhortation was to take the deeper im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression in the mind of <hi>Timothy.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 7.</hi> I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the Faith.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 4. From the experience of <hi>Paul</hi> that exhorted him, who had now almost finished the course of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery, and had found by experience in the running of it, not onely not a troublesome conflict<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but even full of consolation and good hope, and that part of it which yet remained of his race, hee was fully perswaded it would bee glorious. Hee explains this Argument with its <hi>five</hi> Branches.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Branch</hi> 1. The fight which hee had undertaken in his Apostleship, and now almost accomplished, hee calls a <hi>good fight,</hi> that <hi>Timothy</hi> might know that hee was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed of the labours, afflictions and persecutions which hee had under-went.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Branch</hi> 2. Hee pleases himself in the consummation of his race, as now having his desire, and almost obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the prize.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Branch</hi> 3. Hee rejoyces that hee had shewed himself a faithful souldier to his Captain Christ, through the Grace of God, both in Doctrine and life, observing his Military oath.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 8.</hi> Henceforth there is laid up for mee a Crown of Righteousness, which the Lord the righteous Iudge shall give mee at that day, and not to mee onely, but unto them also that love his appearing.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Branch</hi> 4. As for the future hee professes his confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of a free reward, which God hath graciously pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to all the faithful; and as a just Judge, justly and also of Grace will reward, not out of any merit of ours, but by accumulating his former gracious gifts freely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his latter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Branch</hi> 5. Wherein the Apostle presents his example for <hi>Timothy's</hi> use and all the faithful, that the Crown of Righteousness was not to bee set upon his head alone, but upon the heads of all, who endeavouring to do those things which are pleasing to the Lord, declare that they expect and love his appearance.</p>

                  <q>

                  <p>The <hi>second</hi> part of the Chapter follows, wherein hee treats of his private affairs, which concerned <hi>Timothy</hi> and himself, and which it appertained to <hi>Timothy</hi> to bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with: The Articles of this part are <hi>seven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Artic.</hi> 1. Of the comming of <hi>Timothy,</hi> whom (if hee was then at <hi>Ephesus</hi>) hee calls from thence, after hee seemed to have stayed there long enough.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vers. 10.</hi> For <hi>Demas</hi> hath forsaken mee, having lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved this present world, and is departed unto <hi>Thes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salonica, Cresens</hi> to <hi>Galatia, Titus</hi> unto <hi>Dalma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="11">
                        <hi>11.</hi> Onely <hi>Luke</hi> is with mee. Take <hi>Mark</hi> and bring him with thee: For hee is profitable to mee for the Ministery.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>Hee gives <hi>three</hi> Reasons why <hi>Timothy</hi> should hasten his comming.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. From the fewness of his companions, and helpers, whereof hee was now destitute: For <hi>Demas</hi> not liking the dangers and afflictions, which were incident to <hi>Pauls</hi> companions, and wherewith they were often exercised (being led by the love of ease, security, and the commodities of this life) undervalues the care of <hi>Paul,</hi> and the Gospel now openly defended by him, in comparison with his own private advantages, hee went to <hi>Thessalonica,</hi> where hee might live more securely. <hi>Crescens</hi> was sent into <hi>Galatia,</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> was gone to <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> to propagate the Gospel. So that hee onely had <hi>Luke</hi> the Physician to accompany him: Hee wills <hi>Timothy</hi> also when hee comes to bring with him <hi>Mark, Barnabas</hi> Sisters Son, who might bee useful to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 12.</hi> And <hi>Tychicus</hi> have I sent to <hi>Ephesus.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 2. Because hee had sent <hi>Tychicus</hi> to <hi>Ephesus,</hi> which is spoken without any reference to <hi>Timothy</hi>'s abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in that place, whereupon it may bee questioned, whether <hi>Timothy</hi> was at <hi>Ephesus</hi> at that time, when these were written.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 13.</hi> The Cloak that I left at <hi>Troas</hi> with <hi>Carpus,</hi> when thou commest, bring with thee, and the books, but especially the parchments.</q>
                  <p>Lastly giving the <hi>third</hi> Reason of his comming, hee wills <hi>Timothy</hi> when hee came, to bring with him the Cloak or the Chest wherein his books or parchments were kept, whereof hee had then need; It is not much ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial whether wee understand a Cloak, or a Chest, so long as wee know that God disdains not to regard the meanest matters of his servants, nor to refuse the place, wherein mention of them is made in his book.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vers. 14. Alexander</hi> the Copper-Smith did mee much evil, the Lord reward him according to his works.</p>
                     <p n="15">
                        <hi>15.</hi> Of whom bee thou ware also, for hee hath greatly withstood our words.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Artic.</hi> 2. It relates to <hi>Alexander</hi> the Copper-Smith, an enemy to the Gospel, who earnestly withstood the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle in his preaching, and was very troublesome to him, to whom (out of well-tempered zeal) in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, hee wishes divine revenge; as to a malicious and obstinate enemy, and hee warns <hi>Timothy</hi> to take heed of him, lest hee receive the like injuries from him.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 16.</hi> At my first answer no man stood with mee. But all men forsooke mee; I pray God that it may not bee laid to their charge.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Artic.</hi> 3. Hee mentions <hi>four</hi> remarkeable things, which befell him at his first defence, when hee first pleaded his cause before <hi>Neroes</hi> judgement seat; The <hi>first</hi> is, that none <hi>in</hi> the Church at <hi>Rome</hi> assisted him, or became any waies helpful to him (which is an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that hee did not succeed <hi>Peter</hi> there, nor that hee was Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi>) which desertion of him, hee imputes to the infirmity of the Saints at <hi>Rome</hi>: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:49391:96"/>
hee intercedes to God for them, and beseeches him to pardon them.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 17.</hi> Notwithstanding, the Lord stood with mee, and strengthened mee, that by mee the preaching might bee fully known, and that all the Gentiles might hear, and I was delivered out of the mouth of the Lion.</q>
                  <p>The <hi>second</hi> is, That the Lord was his help, in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of his cause, and supported him by his Grace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all accusations, whereof hee gives the Reason, That so the Lord did more illustriously confirm and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the preaching of the Gospel amongst the Gentiles.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Out of the mouth</hi>] The <hi>third</hi> is, That God delivered him from the present danger of death (or from the cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Nero,</hi> and his adversaries which accused him) as it were out of the mouth of the Lion.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 18.</hi> And the Lord shall deliver mee from every evil work, and will preserve mee unto his heavenly Kingdome; to whom bee glory for ever and ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>The <hi>fourth</hi> is, That by this experience God had confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Faith in him, that hee would preserve him, lest daunted with any danger, hee should defile himself in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny evil work, even until hee should translate him into his heavenly glory, upon which account hee gives thanks to God with confidence.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Trophimus] Artic.</hi> 5. Wherein to hasten the comming of <hi>Timothy,</hi> hee mentions the absence of <hi>Erastus</hi> and <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phimus,</hi> who might minister unto him, and supply the place of <hi>Timothy.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>Salutes] Artic.</hi> 6. It contains the salutations sent from some Saints at <hi>Rome,</hi> who were with the Apostle while hee writ these things.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 22.</hi> The Lord Iesus Christ bee with thy spirit; Grace bee with you. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Artic.</hi> 7. Hee concludes his Epistle, wishing the presence of Christ with the spirit and soul of <hi>Timothy,</hi> and praies for grace to the whole Church, whom it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to understand the Doctrine set down in this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle, that with the greater reverence they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Ministery, and acknowledge the authority of <hi>Timothy.</hi>

               <p>In the description of the Pen-man <hi>Paul,</hi> his authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is asserted from these <hi>eight</hi> heads.

(2) That hee is <hi>an Apostle of Iesus Christ,</hi> who by an immediate commission to all Nations, held the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme degree of Ministry in the Church. (3) That his Doctrine agrees with the <hi>Faith</hi> of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and all the Elect, which every one of them that are elected would receive, none but Reprobates would reject, because it contains nothing but the known and acknowledged Truth, instructing men to godliness and the pure worship of God.</p>

(6) That the original of this Truth is most <hi>Ancient,</hi> inasmuch as God hath promised eternal life, not onely in the beginning of the world, preaching it to our first Parents in paradise, but also covenanting with his Son (designed to bee our Mediatour) about it before the world was made, in the Covenant of Redemption. (7) That this Truth was most wisely revealed, <hi>i. e.</hi> by degrees, and in conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient seasons, as it seemed good to God, it was made known, and now is openly manifested by the preaching of the Gospel.</p>

               <p n="8">(8) That the charge of preaching this Gospel, by special Ordination and deputation of our Saviour Christ, <hi>was committed to him</hi>: And this is the description of <hi>Paul</hi> the Pen-man of this Epistle: The description of <hi>Titus</hi> to whom hee writes, follows; Hee is called <hi>Pauls</hi> own Son, not according to the flesh, but <hi>first,</hi> after the common faith, which hee received from the Doctrine of the Apostle, whose Disciple hee also was, and his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual auditor, being alwayes in his company: <hi>Again,</hi> because hee had fully received the impression of the faith preached by the Apostle, and expressed it to the life in his Doctrine. <hi>Lastly,</hi> because hee resembled <hi>Paul,</hi> as it were an image, in his manner of life and conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 4.</hi> To <hi>Titus</hi> mine own son after the common faith, Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father, and the Lord Iesus Christ our Saviour.</q>
               <p>In his salutation hee blesses <hi>Titus,</hi> from God through Christ, wishing and applying to him, First, <hi>Grace, i. e.</hi> That is the gifts of the Holy Ghost, both necessary to his own salvation, and his calling in the Ministry. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <hi>Mercy, i. e.</hi> Remission of sins, or infirmities, in the exercise of the gifts bestowed upon him. Thirdly, <hi>Peace, i. e.</hi> Happiness from the fountain of Grace, by degrees to bee accomplished.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 5.</hi> For this cause left I thee in <hi>Crete,</hi> that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain Elders in every City, as I had appointed thee.</q>
               <p>This Preface being premised, that hee might instruct <hi>Titus</hi> about the choosing of Ministers, in the first place, hee repeats <hi>three</hi> general Precepts which he gave to <hi>Titus,</hi> when hee went from <hi>Crete. First,</hi> That <hi>Titus</hi> finish, in the Constitution of the Churches, that which the Apostle had begun; <hi>Then</hi> that hee appoint Elders (<hi>i. e.</hi> all ordinary Governours of the Church) in every City, wherein the faithful, lately converted, dwelt. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That in this business hee carry not himself after his own will, but follow the rule set him by the Apostle, as hee had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 6.</hi> If any bee blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children, not accused of riot, or unruly.</q>
               <p>In the <hi>second</hi> place hee sets down <hi>three</hi> things requisite in Elders, or Governours onely, or of Teachers also: (1) That they bee not defamed, to the derogation of their Authority. Again that they bee not guilty of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lygamy, too frequent in those times: And lastly, That their whole family bee a mirrour of honest and chaste Discipline, <hi>i. e.</hi> That their children bee brought up in the faith, accustomed to temperance and frugality, free from profuseness and luxury, and patterns of obedience: For hee esteemed it very necessary that the family of an El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der should bee rightly ordered, if the wife and children understood, that upon conjecture of their evil manners and conversations, the Master of the Family might bee cast out of his Ecclesiastical Office.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 7.</hi> For a Bishop must bee blameless, as the steward of God: not self-willed, nor soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre.</q>
               <p>In the <hi>third</hi> place, because amongst the Elders, they that labour in the Word and Doctrine are the chief; the properties of this Elder, whom hee calls a Bishop, are <hi>twelve,</hi> whereof hee spake in the former Epistle to <hi>Timothy.</hi> (1) Hee ought to bee free from any <hi>just blame,</hi> lest his Authority be diminished, yea so far from blame, that nothing bee found in him unworthy the steward of God, who ought to bee so much the more blameless, by how much his office is more holy. (2) Hee ought not to bee <hi>self-willed,</hi> or such an one that obstinately pleases himself, for hee that is too self-willed, is ready to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please all others. (3) Not <hi>soon angry,</hi> for hee that is so, cannot bear with the infirmities of the people of God, or regard them. (4) Not given to <hi>wine</hi> and drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. (5) Not contentious; <hi>No striker.</hi> (6) Not given to <hi>filthy lucre,</hi> free from covetousness.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 8.</hi> But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate,</q>
               <p>This hee confirms, because it is requisite, that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his abilities hee bee ready to receive strangers, or the banished servants of God. (7) That hee esteem and love good men, such as excel others. For it is the sign of a man of little honesty, to hate those that are good, upon any pretence. (8) That in all things hee bee modest, sober, of a sound minde, or prudent. (9) That hee bee just, desirous to restore every man his own. (10) That hee bee pious and holy, who by his life and conversation may teach others.

                  <p>The <hi>second</hi> part of the Chapter follows, wherein hee gives an account of what diligence and care ought to bee used in the choosing of Pastors, <hi>viz.</hi> Because false Teachers did at that time abound: Hee also describes those whom hee would have rejected from this Office, whereof are, (1) <hi>unruly</hi> or refractory, who will not bee reduced into order, casting off the yoak of subjection, or of the Eldership, or of any other lawful jurisdiction, whether they bee such as withdraw themselves from obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Authority, either Natural or Civil, to whom they ought to submit in the Lord. (2) <hi>Vain talkers,</hi> who given to vain boasting, follow after vain subtilties, or frigid and trifling speculations, which conduce no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to holiness, and the fear of God.

                  <p>Hee advises him that these are not onely to bee refuted, but forbidden to preach either publickly or privately; whereof hee gives <hi>seven</hi> Reasons:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. Because they draw whole Families from sound Doctrine, and drive them to perdition, and that either by teaching errours, or by ill applying the general Doctrine, to foment the lusts of men, and that for filthy lucres sake.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 12.</hi> One of themselves, even a Prophet of their own said, The <hi>Cretians</hi> are always liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 2. Because they followed the disposition of their Nation, lyars, given to idleness, serving their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance, and bellies, like beasts, which hee proves by the testimony of the <hi>Cretian</hi> Poet, <hi>Calimachus</hi> or <hi>Epime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nides,</hi> to which Testimony <hi>Paul</hi> himself assents.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 13.</hi> This witness is true; wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may bee sound in the faith.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 3. Because a severe reproof of this kinde of Teachers, and the <hi>Cretian</hi> Disciples cleaving to them, was very conduceable to the procuring and maintaining of their soundness in the faith: Therefore they were se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely to bee reproved.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 4. Lest otherwise the <hi>Cretians</hi> should attend to fabulous traditions, and Jewish fictions, touching Legal Ceremonies, and the Precepts of these kind of men, who could not beat the pure Doctrine of Christ, but indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to corrupt it with their leaven.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 15.</hi> Unto the pure all things are pure, but unto them that are defiled, and unbeleeving, is nothing pure: but even their mind and conscience is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 5. Because the truth of Christianity hath deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined contrary to the Precepts of these Judaizing Teachers, asserting, That to the pure, all things are pure, <hi>i. e.</hi> to Christians, purged from their sins by Faith in Christ, all meats, and other creatures, which were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean by the Ceremonial Law, were now lawful after Christ was exhibited, that the faithful may use them with a good conscience.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Defiled] Reas.</hi> 6. Because the same <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that nothing can bee used purely by them, who are not justified by Faith in Christ, but that their minds and consciences which falsely acquit them, being not renewed, are polluted: and so hee convinces them of vanity, who from the observation of Ceremonies endeavour to attain to holiness.</p>

                     <hi>Vers. 16.</hi> They profess that they know God, but in works they deny him, being abominable and diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient, and to every good work reprobate.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 7. Because although those Teachers did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess themselves worshipers of God, yet in works they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied him, because they were enemies to the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness which is by Faith, and to the fruits of the Spirit, wherefore they were abominable hypocrites, rebells a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Truth of God, and unmeet for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of any good work: From which reasons it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, that those false Teachers are to bee restrained, that they teach neither in publick nor private.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>second</hi> part of the Chapter touching the Doctrine of Faith, follows, which hee subjoyns as the fountain, from whence virtue is fetched, for the performance of the foresaid duties: For they cannot bee Christian duties, except grace to perform them bee derived from Christ by Faith. For in this the works of regenerate and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate men materially good, do differ: That the works of these are done by the enemies of God, from the corrupt strength of free will, for carnal ends, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny respect to the glory of God: But the works of rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate men are done by the servants of God, reconciled

                  <p>
                     <hi>Hath appeared] Reas.</hi> 1. Because the Gospel of the Grace of God bringing salvation of all kinds to men, being published and manifested, hath appeared to all sorts of men: Therefore it is meet, that men of all sorts, shew their thankfulness to God in an holy conversation, prosecuting the foresaid virtues.</p>
                  <q>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 2. Because this Gospel of God doth not onely teach us what duties wee are bound to perform, but also instructs us how to draw strength from the fountain of the Grace of Christ, from his death and resurrection, to deny ungodliness, and worldly lusts, and to live so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly, as to our selves; justly, as to our neighbours; and holily, as to God: Therefore ought wee to bee ready for the performance of these duties.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Precept</hi> 2. Of the duties of Charity towards any our of the Church, or within it, these duties are <hi>four.</hi> (1) That they respect the credit and reputation of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, speaking evil of no man. (2) That they bee free from strifes and contentions. (3) That they follow after moderation and equity, being ready (when need requires) to part from their private right. (4) That they bee gentle towards all, even the worst of men.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 3.</hi> For wee our selves also were sometime foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts, and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.</q>
               <p>Hee gives <hi>two</hi> Reasons why gentleness should bee shewed towards some.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. Because wee before our conversion were such, as they now are; wee are all of us by nature, upon many considerations to bee blamed, yet wee desired to bee treated courteously and mildly by all: Therefore let us deal accordingly with those who are not yet converted: Hee sets down <hi>five</hi> diseases of our Natures. (1) Wee were <hi>foolish,</hi> because all the wisdome of men is meer va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, so long as wee know not God, for wee are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the right rule, and the true fountain, and the due end of our actions. (2) <hi>Disobedient,</hi> Because men by nature, do nothing of those things which either God or conscience command, but that which pleases themselves. (3) <hi>Straying, viz.</hi> from the true way which leads to eternal life, and being deceived with errours, they go further off from God daily. (4) <hi>Serving,</hi> with delight, divers lusts and pleasures, which reign together, and as it were, by turns challenge a dominion over all the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate. (5) Wee were destitute of the true love of God, living in <hi>malice</hi> and <hi>envy,</hi> rejoycing in the hurt, and sorry for the good that befalls our neighbour: ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting one another, when all of us were most worthy to bee hated of God.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 4.</hi> But after that the kindness, and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared,</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 2. Because wee, although perverse, yet at length were converted by the Grace of God: Therefore ought wee to use gentleness towards those that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted, and hope well of them, who may possibly bee converted by the same Divine Grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Kindness</hi>] Hee explains this reason, and commends the grace that was shewed to us in our conversion, and proves it by <hi>eleven</hi> Reasons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. From the more remote cause, <hi>viz.</hi> the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and kindness of God, which rejoyceth to put forth it self for our advantage, and to communicate good to us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 2. From the neerer cause, which is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the love of God, wherewith God is affected to man-kind above all other creatures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 3. From the instrumental cause, or the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of revealing the Gospel, which hath no less gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously shined forth upon us, and without our procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than the Sun (from whence the similitude of shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning forth or appearing is fetch't) rises upon us without our help.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 4. From the next cause of our conversion, which is the effectual manifestation of God, as a Saviour, made to us, who as soon as hee manifests himself to our hearts, not as our Judge to condemn us, but as our Saviour, to save us, by this manifestation of himself hee draws our hearts to him, and converts us.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 5.</hi> Not by works of Righteousness, which wee have done, but according to his mercy hee saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 5. By way of removing all our works, and all merit in us, which either went in time before our effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual calling, or which could bee fore-seen and conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as if wee had done them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 6. Expresly affirming that <hi>mercy</hi> is the cause of salvation,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 7. Making God the Author of the Sacraments, or the external means of salvation, and also the Author of our regeneration, and so of the internal means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by wee are led to salvation (conceive the same of other means) which are not from our selves, but the Holy
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:49391:98"/>
Ghost, or God the sole Author, who alone without us instituted the layer of Baptism for a Sacrament, and the grace signified by Baptism (<hi>viz.</hi> the washing of us from the filth of our sins, and the renewing of the Image of God in righteousness and holiness) hee alone works in us.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 6.</hi> Which hee shed on us abundantly, through Iesus Christ our Saviour.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 8. From the meritorious cause of the graces of the Spirit, plentifully shed upon us, which is Jesus Christ our Saviour, both the fountain from whom, and the chanel through whom, the grace of God is conveighed to us.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 7.</hi> That being justified by his grace, wee should bee made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 9. From the nature of free Justification, seeing wee are justified not by works, but by the grace of Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 10. From the manner of entring upon life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, to the possession whereof, wee are admitted, not as buyers or Merchants, but as heirs appointed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 11. From the instrumental cause, hope, or faith, which relye upon the free promises of God (not any of our merits) and altogether exclude our works, so that wee are made heirs of life, according to the hope, which the promises of God have given to us.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 8.</hi> This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, That they which have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved in God, might bee careful to maintain good works; these things are good and profitable unto men.</p>
                  <p n="9">
                     <hi>9.</hi> But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentious, and strivings about the Law, for they are unprofitable, and vain.</p>
               </q>
               <p>The <hi>third</hi> Precept is this, That hee conjoyn with the Doctrine of faith, the Doctrine of good works, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from faith, and urge it with Authority, and see that the faithful maintain, or bee Patrons of good works, seeing life is freely bestowed upon them: Hee gives <hi>two</hi> Reasons of the Precept. <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. Because this saying concerning this Precept is a faithfull saying, or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to bee beleeved, and most necessary and true, which cannot frustrate or deceive those that obey it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Good] Reas.</hi> 2. Because this kinde of Doctrine is good and profitable unto men, because it tends to the glory of God, the confirmation of our selves, touching the certainty of salvation, and to the edification of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in the faith, and the conversion of Infidels.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Foolish] Precept</hi> 4. That hee restrain foolish que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions, wherewith men use to intangle themselves, and to hinder themselves from holding any thing firmly in the known truth: Such are Genealogical questions, or Chronological, and contentious dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and strivings about Law-ceremonies, or the like.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For they are</hi>] Hee adds the Reason, Because though those questions make a shew of wisdome, yet they are foolish and vain, and unprofitable, nothing tending to edification in faith and holiness of life.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 10.</hi> A man that is an heretick, after the first and second admonition, reject:</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Precept</hi> 5. Wherein the Apostle enjoyns <hi>Titus</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject by Excommunication the man that is an Heretick, or that holds contrary to sound Doctrine, and makes a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision or sect in the Church, or breaks the unity of the Church by any errour of his (when hee is openly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed <hi>before the Presbytery,</hi> and admonished the first and second time) and neither trouble himself and the Church, more than needs, with the disputations of such kinde of men, or spend that time which is appointed for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing of the Chuch, in vain disputations with these perverse men.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 11.</hi> Knowing that hee that is such, is subverted and sinneth, being condemned of himself.</q>
               <p>Hee subjoyns a Reason, because it is in vain to dispute against one convinced of obstinacy already; for hee hath fallen from the truth, and is so overthrown, that hee will not indure to bee edified any longer, and rejecting the light offered in the admonishing of him, hee makes it plainly appear that hee doth violence to his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 12.</hi> When I shall send <hi>Artemas</hi> unto thee, or <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chicus,</hi> bee diligent to come unto mee to <hi>Nicopolis,</hi> for I have determined there to Winter.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Precept</hi> 6. Concerning private affairs, whereby hee recalls <hi>Titus</hi> from <hi>Crete,</hi> and wills him to come to <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis,</hi> where the Apostle seems not to have been when hee wrote these things (as the addition of some unskilful Scribe hath set it down in the end of the Epistle) but there hee intended to Winter.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 13.</hi> Bring <hi>Zenas</hi> the Lawyer, and <hi>Apollos</hi> on their journey diligently, that nothing bee wanting unto them.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Precept</hi> 7. Concerning private matters also, That hee would assist <hi>Zenas</hi> and <hi>Apollos</hi> in their journey, men very well skilled in the Scripture, but no wise weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 14.</hi> And let ours also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they bee not unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Precept</hi> 8. That hee instruct not onely the faithful a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the people, but also the Preachers of the Gospel, or those that are of the Pastoral order, that they go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore others in the communication of their goods, and distributing according to necessity. The reason whereof is given, lest whilst they exhort others to good works, they themselves should bee without fruit.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 15.</hi> All that are with mee salute thee. Greet them that love us in the faith. Grace bee with you all. <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </q>
               <p>Hee concludes the Epistle, (1) With commendations sent to <hi>Titus</hi> from the Brethren. (2) With salutations sent from himself to the faithful in <hi>Crete.</hi> (3) With an Apostolical benediction, where hee comprehends not <hi>Titus</hi> onely, but the Churches also, to whose use this Epistle was written, sealing up his wish, and the truth of the whole Doctrine, with his <hi>AMEN.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough <hi>Paul,</hi> (seeing hee knew himself hated by all the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> not yet converted, and suspected also by many of the weaker Beleevers, too much addicted to the observation of Legal Rites) chose to suppress his name in the beginning of this <hi>Epistle,</hi> that without prejudice they might the more easily entertain the Truth: yet without controversie, hee intimated his name by messengers, to some chief and eminent Brethren in the Church, to whose hands this Epistle was first to come, and that it was known, appears in the end of the <hi>Epistle.</hi> But after demonstration of the same Spirit in this as in the other of <hi>Paul's</hi> Epistles, the Authority of the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> may satisfie us, who by a singular providence of God, in the <hi>third Chapter</hi> of his <hi>second Epistle,</hi> to the same scattered <hi>Hebrews,</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth concerning the Epistle of <hi>Paul</hi> written to the same, which was in their hands, and openly acknowledged to bee <hi>Pauls,</hi> which Epistle <hi>Peter</hi> there commends, with the rest of <hi>Paul's</hi> Epistles, as divinely inspired by the same

Spirit of Wisdome, as now brought into the Canon of the Scripture, and unanimously with his other Epistles acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged and received by the Church; wee must of necessity own this for the very Epistle, unless wee will undervalue the faithfulness of the Church, and the Providence of God, in keeping the Canon of the Scripture, and the Oracles delivered to the Church.</p>
               <p>The scope of the Epistle is this, To strengthen the <hi>Hebrews</hi> that were weak in faith, and for the most part addicted to legal Rites, not sufficiently instructed about the Excellency of Christ, and further also troubled every where with perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions by Infidels; and to encourage them against all fear, to perseverance in the faith, and obedience of the Gospel.</p>
               <p>The parts of the Epistle (as of the other Epistles of <hi>Paul</hi>) are <hi>two;</hi> The <hi>one</hi> for the forming and confirming of their faith, <hi>to Chap. 12.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other tends to holiness, and bringing forth fruits of faith in their lives and conversations, <hi>Chap. 12, 13.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to what appertains to the Doctrine of faith, hee instructs the <hi>Hebrews</hi> how great the Excellency of Christ is, in his <hi>Prophetick</hi> and <hi>Priestly</hi> Office.</p>
               <p>As for the Excellency of Christs <hi>Prophetical</hi> Office, hee shews it to bee incomparable, and far to exceed all, both Men and Angels, <hi>Chap. 1.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the <hi>three</hi> next <hi>Chapters,</hi> hee makes a <hi>fourfold</hi> use of this Doctrine in a <hi>fourfold</hi> Exhortation.</p>
               <p>The <hi>first</hi> Exhortation is, Not to Apostalize from the Christian faith.</p>

                  <hi>4</hi> That they make haste by faith to enter into the rest which God hath promised, whilest they hear the voyce of Christ, <hi>Chap. 4.</hi>

               <p>As to the <hi>Priestly</hi> Office of Christ, That the Iews ascribe not too much to the Levitical Priesthood, and pertinaciously adhere to the Ceremonies thereof; Hee proves Christ to bee the chief Priest, more excellent than any typical high Priest, even that true <hi>Melchizedeck;</hi> In the mean time hee rebukes the ignorance of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> who could not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the things hee had to say touching the Excellency of Christ, <hi>Chap. 5.</hi> From whence hee draws an Exhortation to growth in the knowledge and faith of the Gospel, <hi>Chap. 6.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hee proceeds to demonstrate the eminency of Christ above the <hi>Levitical Priests,</hi> as well in respect to his Person, as also his Priestly Office, <hi>Chap. 7, 8, 9.</hi> And in the beginning of the <hi>tenth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Doctrine hee makes application of, exhorting them to go forward confidently and patiently in the profession of the true Religion, imitating the faithful Confessors and Martyrs, who departed in the faith, before the birth of Christ, in the latter end of <hi>Chap. 10, and Chap. 11.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the <hi>second</hi> part of the Epistle divers Exhortations to Christian duties are laid down, which also may bee reckoned amongst the Uses which hee makes of the former Doctrine, <hi>Chap. 12, 13.</hi>

                  <hi>Vers. 1.</hi> God who at sundry times, and in divers man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, spake in time past unto the Fathers by the Prophets,</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. Christ the Son of God is more excellent than all the Prophets, by whom God spake to the ancient Church, or the Fathers; hee hath made our condition under the Gospel, better than the condition of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers under the Law: For <hi>first</hi> they were Prophets by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration, not when they would, but as they were acted by the Spirit of Christ, and spake as the <hi>Ministers</hi> of God; but Christ is the <hi>Son of God,</hi> and chief of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, who spake by his own Authority no less than in his Fathers Name. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Those Prophets were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, by whom heretofore at sundry times, and in various wayes of Revelation, by parts and degrees, God mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested to the Church the Doctrine of salvation: But the <hi>Son</hi> is <hi>one,</hi> by whom the Father <hi>once fully, plainly,</hi> and <hi>finally,</hi> hath declared to us (who live under the Gospel) his <hi>whole</hi> Will in the last times of the world: Therefore the excellency of his Prophetical Office is incomparable.</p>

                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. Christ as hee is by nature born Heir, so also by the eternal appointment of God to his Mediatorship, and by special Covenant, hee is appointed Heir, or Lord Proprietor, of all the creatures in heaven and earth: Therefore his Excellency is incomparable.</p>

                  <hi>By whom] Arg.</hi> 3. By him having his being from Eternity, the Father made the world, and all things in it, not as by an instrument, but as by his <hi>word,</hi> and <hi>Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi>: Therefore his Excellency is incomparable.</p>

                  <hi>Vers. 3.</hi> Who being the brightness of his glory, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press image of his person, &amp; upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high,</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. Christ, so far as an imperfect similitude can manifest, is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the brightness of his Fathers glory, or the beaming forth of his glorious nature, shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in light inaccessible: In, and of the Father, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten of the substance of the Father, who, although the Father never was without him, nor can bee, yet hee is distinct from the Father, and eternally undivided, by whom the Father reveals and communicates his glory, as the Sun by its shining is made conspicuous to us: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Excellency is incomparable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Image] Arg.</hi> 5. Christ is the express Image or Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the Person of the Father, <hi>i. e.</hi> (as much as an imperfect similitude can instruct us) hee is a distinct per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son from the Father, resembling his Father in all things, of one and the same form or essence, who represents the Father to the life unto us, that we may acknowledge the Father to be such as the Son is: Therefore his Excellency is incomparable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Upholding] Arg.</hi> 6. Christ upholds, supports, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves all creatures in heaven and earth, by the Divine word of his power, or the vertue of his Deity: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Excellency is incomparable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Purged] Arg.</hi> 7. Hee hath obtained, purchased the purging of our sins fully, as hee is the High Priest, God and man (receiving no assistance from any one) not by any legal Sacrifice, but by himself once offered upon the Cross: Therefore his Excellency is incomparable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sitteth] Arg.</hi> 8. After the expiation of our sins, by himself alone once made, hee sate down God-man, as King of the Church, at the right hand of the Majesty on high, reigning in equal honour and power with God the Father, and governing all things: Therefore his Excellency is incomparable.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Ver. 4.</hi> Being made so much better than the Angels, as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 9. Christ is so much more excellent than the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, by how much the name of Son is more excellent than the name of an Angel or Messenger: But the name of the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God</hi> belongs to Christ, and according to his Divinity by eternal Generation, the whole Divine Essence being communicated to him: And further ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

to his Humanity, not by Adoption, but this Name is given him by union, so that the same person which was the Son of God to bee incarnate, is now the Son of God incarnate, his humane Nature being taken unto the unity of the second Person.</p>

               <p>This last Argument the Apostle confirms with <hi>eight</hi> Reasons, whereof the <hi>seven</hi> first are taken out of so many places of Scripture.</p>

And here also hee uses a word of the Preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tense, that although thou hearest of him as present, yet thou mayest understand his Generation perfectly past, or eternal, as the shining of the Sun is perfect, and yet it continually beams forth from the Sun: Therefore Christ is so much the more excellent above Angels, by how much a Son is more excellent than a Messenger.</p>

               <p>The Arguments for the proof of this Proposition are <hi>eight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>first</hi> Argument is contained in the word, <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi> Because already the excellency of Christs Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical Office was shewn in the former Chapter: Therefore ought we the more attentively to hearken to his Doctrine.</p>

                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 3. If the Law promulgated by the Ministry of Angels, or Messengers (whose service God made use of) was accounted firm, stable, authentick, divine and inviolable, much more the Gospel published by Christ the Son, ought to bee accounted such: Therefore ought yee to obey the Doctrine of Christ the Son of God.</p>

If every transgression against the Law (which is the Doctrine of deserved death) received a just reward, or the recompence of a capital punishment, wee cannot escape destruction, if wee neglect the Gospel of free salvation: Therefore ought wee to give the more attention to the Gospel of Christ.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 3.</hi> How shall wee escape if wee neglect so great salvation, which at the first began to bee spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him,</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Argum. 5.</hi> Confirming the former, The Gospel was immediately published by the Lord Jesus Christ himself, while hee was upon earth, and was preached to the Church with authority by the Apostles, who were eye and ear-witnesses of his Doctrine; And moreover it was confirmed, with all kinds of gifts of the Spirit, and seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral miracles accompanying the preaching of the Apostles, the testimony of the divine Seal being added, as it were, from Heaven: Therefore except wee attend the more carefully to his Doctrine, wee cannot escape un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punished for the neglect of so great salvation thus confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med unto us.</p>

               <p>The new condition of the world under <hi>Messias,</hi> or the restoring of the world into the Grace of the <hi>Messias,</hi> (whereof wee spake from the sixt <hi>verse</hi> of the former Chapter) is not put in subjection unto Angels, but to Christ the Son of God: Therefore if it was a wickedness not to hearken attentively to Angels (which are servants) how much more hainous will it bee to despise the most powerful King of the restored world? The Church (as it were a new world, to bee gathered by the Gospel) or the new condition of the Creature under <hi>Messias,</hi> is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>World,</hi> Because all the glory which now appears in the Ornament of the Universe, shines more gloriously, when it is converted into our use by Christ: It is called the <hi>World to come,</hi> for the perfection of its renovation, yet not to bee perfectly so, but in the world to come; Christ indeed hath now begun to make all things new in his own, and for their sake, but what hee hath begun, hee will not compleatly perfect till the last day, when the Creature shall bee delivered from the bondage of corruption, into the liberty of the Glory of the Sons of God.</p>

                  <p>Confirming this Argument hee passes to the <hi>second</hi> part of the Chapter, that hee may prove that the incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Christ, or his sufferings in the flesh (which was an offence to the <hi>Hebrews</hi>) derogate nothing from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of him: The Arguments produced to this end are <hi>fourteen,</hi> whence hee infers the conclusion to bee proved, in the first verse of the following Chapter, by an admonition to consider, what an one Christ is, <hi>i. e.</hi> how excellent hee is in the offices of his Apostleship, or of his Prophetical and Priestly office, wherein hee humbled himself and suffered.</p>

Although Christ in the time of his humiliation, was made lower than the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, in respect to his sufferings in the flesh, yet that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation was not perpetual, but for a short time, and onely in part, in respect to the humane nature that suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered: Because the price of Redemption being paid, hee was raised from the dead, exalted to the right hand of God, and crowned with glory and honour, declared Lord and King over all the works of God: Therefore wee ought not to detract from him because of his suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings in the flesh.</p>

Not unadvisedly, or compelled by necessity did Christ suffer, but freely, or out of the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious good will of God towards us, hee tasted death for a short time, not for himself, but for all us, <hi>his Sons,</hi> that hee might bring us to salvation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as it is expounded in the following verse: Therefore his estimation is not to bee lessened, because of his sufferings in his assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med flesh.</p>

of our salvation, the more conveniently by affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to bring many Sons, his Elect, to life and glory, not by his Doctrine onely, nor onely by the example of his life, but also by the merit of his death, undergone for the redeeming of them: Therefore his excellency ought not to bee abated because of his sufferings in the flesh.</p>
                  <q>

The Redeemer and the Redeemed, Hee that sanctifies, and they that are sanctified, not onely by the decree of God, and the predictions of Scripture, but also from Justice it self, are of one and the same Nature, of the same Natural lump, derived from the same <hi>Adam</hi>: For the Justice and Wisdome of God required, that in the humane Nature, which had sinned, sin should bee punished: And therefore required that the Redeemer of men, should bee truly man: Therefore the reputation of Christ the Son of God, because of his assuming the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of humane Nature, is not to bee diminished.</p>

Confirming the former, The <hi>Messias</hi> would bee incarnate, that wee might bee his Brethren, and that hee might shew forth himself a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unto us; And although hee is the Son of God, yet hee is not ashamed to call the Redeemed, or Elect, his Brethren: Therefore the reputation of Christ is not to bee lessened because of his sufferings in humane flesh, but rather ought wee to boast in his relation to us, and to glorifie him so much the more, because of his sufferings for us.</p>

Christ out of his love to the Elect, the Children of God, would partake of the same humane Nature with them, that hee might by his death satisfie for them, and so abolish the power of the Devil, which hee (as an exe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Vers. 17.</hi> Wherefore in all things it behoved him to bee made like unto his Brethren, that hee might bee a merciful High Priest, in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 13. Christ ought to bee made like his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren the Elect, in Nature, Properties, Affections, and all infirmities, except sin, that his Brethren might bee the more certain and assured of his faithfulness and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, in the exercise of his Priestly Office, and perpetual intercession with God for them: Therefore the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Christ ought not to bee diminished because of his sufferings in the flesh.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 18.</hi> For in that hee himself hath suffered, being tempted, hee is able to succour them that are temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</q>

Confirming the former, Christ by his suffering afflictions and temptations in the humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, was fitted by his experience of sufferings (in whom wee may trust) to bee able and willing to succour us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the like trials: Therefore his reputation is not to bee diminished because of his sufferings in the flesh. And thus, as in the former Chapter, it was demonstrated that Christ is the true Son of God, so in this Chapter hee hath demonstrated him to bee the son of man; The one, true God-man; and hath removed the scandal of infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities and sufferings of Christ in the flesh, which all the beleeving <hi>Hebrews</hi> did dash against.</p>

                  <p>THe excellency of the Prophetical Office and person of Christ being vindicated in the fore-going dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, even under all his sufferings in the flesh; Hee exhorts them now to a consideration of this excellency, that they may hold fast the profession of the Christian Faith, and not apostatize from it, to this end producing <hi>fifteen</hi> Arguments.</p>
               </argument>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 1.</hi> Wherefore holy Brethren, partakers of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly calling, consider the Apostle, and High Priest of our Profession Christ Iesus.</q>
               <p>The Proposition concerning the holding fast their Profession of the Faith is contained in an Exhortation to a serious consideration of Christ, the Apostle and High Priest of our Profession.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. Yee are sanctified, and by Faith made partakers of an effectual calling to heavenly things: Therefore you ought to hold fast the Profession of this Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Apostle] Argum.</hi> 2. Yee have Jesus Christ the Son of God, the Apostle, or Teacher of your Faith, sent from God, and our High Priest, who hath expiated our sins by his blood; You have him, I say, the Author of this Profession: Therefore it is to bee held fast.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 2.</hi> Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also <hi>Moses</hi> was faithful in all his house.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 3. Christ in the administration of his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postleship, and Priesthood committed to him, is not less faithful than <hi>Moses,</hi> who obtained testimony from God, that hee was faithful in all his house: Therefore ought yee to hold fast your Christian Profession, Because the <hi>Hebrews</hi> ascribed too much to <hi>Moses,</hi> and could hardly bee drawn away from <hi>Mosaical</hi> Ceremonies, that they
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:49391:101"/>
might bee brought to Christ: Therefore here on set purpose hee compares Christ with <hi>Moses.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 3.</hi> For this man was counted worthy of more glory than <hi>Moses,</hi> inasmuch as hee who hath build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the house, hath more honour than the house.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 4. Christ is so much more excellent than <hi>Moses,</hi> and the whole Church also, by how much the builder of the house is more excellent than the house it self, or any part of it: <hi>Moses</hi> also is but a member of that Church, and a part onely of that house: Therefore the Profession of your Faith is to bee held fast.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 4.</hi> For every house is builded by some man, but hee that built all things is God.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 5. Confirming the former under the same comparison, As no house, not part of an house is built by it self, but by another man, so neither the Church, nor <hi>Moses,</hi> who is a member of the Church, is built by himself, but owes his building to some higher Architect: But Christ who is proved God, is the builder of the Church, and of every member of it, and also of all things: Therefore hee is more excellent than <hi>Moses,</hi> and the Faith and Profession of his Doctrine is to bee held fast.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 5.</hi> And <hi>Moses</hi> verily was faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to bee spoken after.</p>
                  <p n="6">
                     <hi>6.</hi> But Christ as a Son over his own house, whose house are wee, if wee hold fast the confidence, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing of the hope firm unto the end.</p>

                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 6. <hi>Moses</hi> was faithful as a servant in anothers family, to testifie, and that indeed darkly, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards more fully and openly was to bee spoken of Christ, and his dominion: But Christ is faithful, as Son and Heir, who is over his house, and speaks from his own authority: Therefore Christ is more excellent than <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> and the Profession of his Doctrine is to bee held fast.</p>

If wee firmly hold fast the confidence and hope of eternal life, procured for us by Christ, and to bee communicated (in which hope wee now make our boast) wee shall declare our selves to bee his house, or his true Church, in which the Lord will dwell: Therefore the Profession of our Faith is to bee held fast.</p>

of conscience from peace towards God, and safely dwell under his shadow, the beginning whereof is in this life, and the perfection of it in the life to come: Wee enter into this rest more and more by faith, till at length wee obtain a full refreshment at the coming of our Lord. The Arguments of the Exhortation are <hi>Eleven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Being left] Arg.</hi> 1. In the midst of the threatning, <hi>Psal.</hi> 95. vers. <hi>ult.</hi> There is a promise left to us beleevers of entring into Gods rest: Therefore you ought to make haste, that by faith yee may enter into that Rest.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Let us fear] Arg.</hi> 2. Unless you make haste in the race of your faith, to enter into the promised rest, there is danger, lest by your delay, you bee shut out, or bee found excluded: For a sloathful and idle faith is justly suspected: Therefore with fear (which whets on di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence) you ought to hasten, that you may enter into Rest.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 2.</hi> For unto us was the Gospel preached, as well as unto them; but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 3. Confirming both the former, seeing the same Evangelical promise upon the same condition is preached as well to us as them, and the word heard did not profit them, who received it not mixed with faith, but onely those that imbraced it by faith: It will follow, that this promise of entring into rest; will neither profit us, unless by faith imbracing the promises, wee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to enter into rest, and on the other side, it will follow, that the promise will advantage us, if wee bee careful to enter in by faith: Therefore wee must endeavour to enter in.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 3.</hi> For wee which have beleeved do enter into rest, as hee said, as I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest; although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <hi>4.</hi> For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day, on this wife, and God did rest the seventh day from all his works.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <hi>5.</hi> And in this place again, if they shall enter into my rest.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. Wee that beleeve in Christ, have an entrance into rest, opened to us by faith: Therefore let us hasten to persevere by faith, till wee obtain a full rest.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I have sworn] Arg.</hi> 5. Confirming the former, The Lord swearing in his wrath that unbeleevers shall bee shut out of his rest, on the contrary swears that beleevers shall bee admitted into his rest: Therefore beleeving Gods Oath, let us hasten more and more to enter into his rest.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The works</hi>] Hee explains the force of this Argument, vers. 10. <hi>three</hi> wayes; <hi>First,</hi> by shewing that Gods rest ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in his Oath, <hi>Psal.</hi> 95.11. is not the rest of the <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day,</hi> wherin God rested from the works of Creation, because those works being finished from the beginning of the world, vers. 3. the rest of the seventh day was cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated, as it appears, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. and so that rest of God is past, vers. 4. But in <hi>Psal.</hi> 95.11. <hi>David</hi> makes mention of another rest; Therefore here is not meant that first rest of God, celebrated upon the Sabbatism of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day, vers. 5.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 6.</hi> Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and they to whom it was first preached, entred not in because of unbeleef.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Hee explains the Argument by declaring the consequence, which follows from this, that unbeleevers are excluded because of unbeleef, from entring into rest: It remains necessarily to bee gathered (saith hee) that some, <hi>i. e.</hi> the faithful, enter into it: For either belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers or unbeleevers shall enter into the Kingdome of God: But unbeleevers shall not enter, but are excluded by the Oath of God: It remains that some, <hi>i. e.</hi> the faithful enter in.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 7.</hi> Again, hee limiteth a certain day, saying in <hi>David,</hi> to day, after so long a time; as it is said, To day if yee will hear his voyce, harden not your hearts.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> By shewing that the rest of God expressed in his Oath, <hi>Psal.</hi> 95.11. is not that typical rest in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which hee proves, because <hi>David,</hi> Psal. 95.7, 8. defines a certain day, <hi>To day,</hi> so long a time after the rest of the seventh day, and after the peoples entrance into the Land of <hi>Canaan, viz.</hi> the day of <hi>Gods patience,</hi> so long, <hi>viz.</hi> as wee hear the voyce of God, so long as wee are admonished not to harden our hearts, so long as God offers to men that hear his voice, entrance into his rest, unless through unbeleef they harden their hearts: Therefore by Gods rest, the Prophet <hi>David</hi> doth not understand the typical rest of the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 8.</hi> For if Iesus had given them rest, then would hee not afterward have spoken of another day.</p>
                  <p n="9">
                     <hi>9.</hi> There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Whereof hee gives a reason, because if <hi>Ioshua,</hi> or ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical Jesus had settled the people in Gods rest, which <hi>David</hi> promises, then <hi>David</hi> in no wise would have spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the Psalm of another day afterwards, but vers. 8. hee speaks of it: Therefore some rest remains to the people of God, promised by <hi>David,</hi> besides that typical rest of the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 10.</hi> For hee that is entred into this rest, hee also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his.</p>
                  <p n="11">
                     <hi>11.</hi> Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leef.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 6. Gods rest is the ceasing from our labour, as God rested from his works, or it is a ceasing from sin, troubles, vexing cares, and all our miseries: Therefore let us make haste to enter by faith into that rest, lest any of us with the rebellious Israelites bee excluded from Gods rest.</p>

                  <hi>Vers. 12.</hi> For the Word of God is quick and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, peircing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joynts and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 7. Confirming the former, after this manner, The word of God which calls us to his rest, with threatning of wrath except wee obey, hath now no less efficacy to save beleevers, and to destroy the unbeleevers, than it had long ago; let us therefore make haste, by faith to enter into that rest, lest wee perish, as hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the unbeleever. There are three Epithites of the <hi>word</hi>: (1) It is <hi>quick,</hi> because it doth not lose its effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy with the Prophets that are mortal, who preach it, but retains its perpetual force and vertue to all ages, <hi>Zach.</hi> 1.5, 6. (2) It is <hi>powerful,</hi> because it is the Power and Arm of God to effect whatever it saith, whether for consolation, or terror. (3) More peircing than any two-edged sword, because as a two-edged sword peirceth into the most inward, hidden, and hardest parts of the body, so the word of God, by the perfect manifestation of light, pierceth into the most intimate secrets of the heart, which are meant by the marrow in the bones, and into all the most inward faculties of the soul, that it may discover the plottings of the sensitive soul, and of the intellective, what it intends, and what it pretends, what every one lusts after, and by what means it endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours the attainment of what it intends. The word of God (I say) passes through all the faculties of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane soul, that it may manifest to every one, if there bee any hypocrisie, or if there bee any root of bitterness or unbeleef lying hid, and that it may propose to every one according to the Rule, not only what is within in the thought of his heart, but also with what intention he thinks and wills; so that they who inwardly think of Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing,

The perfections which were required in the Levitical Priests, <hi>vers.</hi> 1, 2. were joyned with some notes of imperfection, and with the sins of the Priests, <hi>vers.</hi> 2, 3. Therefore Christ which was declared a Priest without sin, in the end of the former Chapter, is more excellent than the Levitical Priests.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Among men</hi>] The Perfections of the Levitical High Priest were <hi>four.</hi> (1) The Levitical Priest was taken <hi>from among men,</hi> and was chosen one of many. (2) Was ordained <hi>for men,</hi> in those things which appertained to God, <hi>i. e.</hi> That in the place and name of the people hee should administer about the worship of God, praying to him for the people, teaching the people in the name of God, and that hee should by all possible means promote the Glory of God, and the salvation of the people. (3) Hee offered <hi>gifts</hi> of inanimate things, and <hi>sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> of beasts, sometimes <hi>burnt-offerings,</hi> for the sins of the people, sometimes <hi>peace-offerings,</hi> for the obtaining of benefits, sometimes <hi>thank-offerings,</hi> for benefits re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, other whiles <hi>sacrifices for special</hi> sins, By all which the virtues of Jesus Christs Sacrifice was dimly shadowed out.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>For that</hi>] There are <hi>two</hi> notes of Imperfection in the Priest-hood. (1) That they themselves were obnoxious to the same infirmities, <hi>i. e.</hi> of ignorance, and errours, and the miseries consequent to sin.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. As the lawful Priests were called to the honour of this office, so Christ was not onely lawfully called by the Father, as <hi>Aaron,</hi> but also further was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged and declared the onely begotten Son of God, in this Priestly office: Therefore hee is much more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent than the Levitical Priests. The Antecedent is proved out of <hi>Psalm</hi> 2. where the Father speaking to his Son, <hi>vers.</hi> 7. calls him <hi>his Son whom hee begot,</hi> before hee command him, <hi>vers.</hi> 8. to ask of him the ends of the earth, or intercede for the salvation of men, which are parts of the Priests office: Therefore in this <hi>Psalm,</hi> hee is not onely called by the Father to his Priestly office, but also is acknowledged his Son, and so more excellent than the Levitical Priests.</p>

                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 4. This Argument consists of <hi>five</hi> Branches, which may bee so many Arguments. (1) Christ is so the Son of God, that hee is man also, the Son in our flesh, the infirmiti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

(2) Hee offered up prayers and supplications, and himself to death, for his people, and so offered a more excellent Sacrifice than the Levitical Priests. (3) Hee interceded with a greater sense of our misery and guilt, <hi>with strong
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:49391:103"/>
crying and tears,</hi> and so in his sympathy towards us excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Levitical Priests. (4) With greater confidence hee pleaded our cause than any of the typical Priests could, even then when in the pangs of death, and sense of the Divine wrath or curse, due to our sins, his sanctified hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature conflicted with the terrours of death. (5) Hee prayed with greater efficacy and fruit, than any typical Priest; For hee was freed according to his prayer, from fear, which the sight of an angry God put upon his sense, and holy reason, because having paid a sufficient price for us, all cause of anger and fear was taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: Therefore Christ is a far more excellent Priest than the Levitical Priests.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 8.</hi> Though hee were a Son, yet learned hee obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, by the things which hee suffered:</q>

                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 5. Drawn from the former, which with the removal of the scandal of the Cross, shews also the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Christs Priest-hood; Christ was not imployed in beholding of the Sacrifices slain, and himself free from all suffering, as the Levitical Priests in the slaying of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, but although hee was the Son of God, yet hee really felt by the sufferings in his body, and in his soul, how hard a matter it was to expiate our sins, taught by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, what a difficult thing it was to perform expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory obedience, even to the death of the Cross, for the appeasing of his Fathers wrath, and the satisfaction of Justice: Christ is therefore far more exellent than the Levitical Priests.</p>

Christ the Chief Priest was every way com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat and perfect, in whom there was not the least thing wanting, which is requisite in a Priest; For being now sanctified, or offered up for a Propitiatory Sacrifice to the Father, hee compleated the whole price of Redemption, or what remained, hee perfected in his last sufferings, of which price no part was paid by the Levitical Priests: Therefore hee is far more excellent than those Leviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Priests.</p>

Confirming the former, Christ is called of God (whose word is effectual) a Priest after the order of <hi>Melchisedec,</hi> which order is far more excellent than that of <hi>Levi:</hi> Therefore Christ is the Chief Priest, far more excellent than the Levitical Priests.</p>

               <p>Wee have spoken of the Excellency of Christ Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: The <hi>second</hi> part of the Chapter follows, wherein the excellency of Christs Priest-hood is proved to bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Levitical Priest-hood; and that by <hi>seventeen</hi> Arguments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. The perfection or effectual consumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the worshipers of God, as to the expiation of sin, Justification, Sanctification, and Eternal life, could not bee obtained by the Levitical Priest-hood: Therefore the Levitical Priest-hood is imperfect, nor so excellent as the Priest-hood of Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What further] Argum.</hi> 2. Confirming the former, If perfection could have been obtained by the Levitical Priest-hood, there was no need that another more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Priest should arise, <hi>viz.</hi> Christ, after the order of <hi>Melchisedec,</hi> not after the order of <hi>Aaron</hi>; Hee leaves the Assumption to us to gather, which is this, But there was a necessity that a more excellent Priest should arise, as it appears from <hi>Psalm</hi> 110. Therefore perfection by the Levitical Priest-hood cannot bee obtained but by the Priest-hood of Christ, and therefore it is more excellent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The people</hi>] A Reason confirming the <hi>Major</hi> Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Law was given under this Priest-hood, and the people were exercised in its Discipline, and whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver force the Law, or the Legal Covenant had, all this is ascribed by those that are zealous of the Law, that the worshipers by this Priesthood might bee perfected, but in vain: Therefore if by this Priest-hood, or the Law, or by the Legal Covenant joyned with it, the worshipers might obtain perfection, there had been no need of a more excellent Priest-hood, and another Law: But seeing that perfection by this Priest-hood could not be obtained, there was need of another more excellent.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 12.</hi> For the Priest-hood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the Law.</q>
               <p>

Proving withall that Christ should arise a Priest after the order of <hi>Melchisedéc,</hi> not denominated af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the order of <hi>Aaron,</hi> nor obnoxious to the Levitical Law: The changeableness and the changing of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitical Priest-hood, hath drawn along with it the muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and change of the Levitical Law, or Legal Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant joyned with it, that another Priesthood might suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,

Therefore Christs Priesthood being introduced, the Levitical is to bee done away, with the Levitical Ceremonial Law, and by consequence the Priesthood of Christ, which sprang of the Principal Tribe, is more excellent than the Levitical.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 15.</hi> And it is yet far more evident: For that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the similitude of <hi>Melchisedec</hi> there ariseth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Priest.</q>

From the words of <hi>Psalm</hi> 110. proving the same that before, Christ is another Priest from the Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, between whom and <hi>Melchisedec</hi> his type, there is a similitude. Therefore is follows that the Priesthood of Christ doth not hang upon the Levitical Law, and also because it is <hi>Melchisede<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Christ is made a Priest, not according to the Law, which gave weak and carnal commandements, concerning bodily Ceremonies, as the Levitical Priests, but after the power and virtue of an immortal or indisso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luble life, whereby Christ himself lives for ever, and can as the author of life effectually bestow eternal life: Therefore Christs Priesthood is more excellent than the Levitical.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 17.</hi> For hee testifieth, Thou art a Priest for ever after the order of <hi>Melchisedec.</hi>
               </q>
               <p>Hee confirms this Argument from <hi>Psalm</hi> 110. wherein the Father declares his Son a Priest for ever after the order of <hi>Melchisedec,</hi> and by consequence declares the virtue of Christs Priesthood, to bee sufficient unto eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life.</p>

                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 7. Taken from the foresaid <hi>Psalm,</hi> The Law or Legal Covenant (with the Ceremonial Precepts, and the whole Levitical Priesthood, joyned to that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant) by reason of the weakness and unprofitableness of it, in it self, for the expiation of sins, and the justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of men, and the bestowing of eternal life, is abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished by the introduction of an eternal Priesthood, <hi>viz.</hi> of Christ: Therefore the Priesthood of Christ is more excellent than the Levitical.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 19.</hi> For the Law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did: by the which wee draw nigh unto God.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 8. Confirming the former, The Law or Legal Covenant, under the Levitical Priesthood, although it was a School-master unto Christ, yet in it self, it made nothing perfect, it justified, sanctified, saved none; But the Priesthood of Christ, that better hope, or Gospel, that good prefigured and hoped for by the faithful under the Law, being now introduced in the room of the Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Priesthood, or Legal Covenant; This (I say) brings perfection to the people of God, and puts them into good hopes of life: Therefore the Priesthood of Christ, &amp;c.</p>

By the Priesthood of Christ (or by that hope, better than the Law or Levitical Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood) wee that are at a great distance from God by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, all of us come near unto God, to the Throne of his Grace, which was the priviledge of the Priests onely, or rather of the Chief Priest, under the Legal types: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Priesthood of Christ, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 10. The Levitical Priests, without an oath, by a Law changeable at the pleasure of God the Law-giver, were made Priests: But Christ, as appears from <hi>Psal.</hi> 110. is declared a <hi>Priest for ever,</hi> by the oath of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Therefore the Priesthood of Christ, &amp;c.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 22.</hi> By so much was Iesus made a surety of a better Testament.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 11. Christ in his Priesthood is the Surety of a Covenant so much the more excellent, by how much the Priesthood confirmed with an oath is more excellent, than that which is mutable and commanded for a time: Therefore his Priesthood is more excellent: For where there is a Priest, there is a Covenant, the Surety whereof is a Priest, the Covenant being legal and vanishing, had for its Surety a typical Priest, which prefigured the true Priest Christ that was to come: But the Covenant of Grace, hath Christ the true Priest for its Surety, who first of all bound himself to give satisfaction to Divine Justice for our debt; furthermore that as the friends of God in the Covenant of Grace wee should walk to life eternal. There are other offices of a Surety, but these suffice for the opening of the present Argument.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 23.</hi> And they truly were many Priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death.</p>

               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 12. The Levitical Priests were <hi>many</hi> at one time, and <hi>successively</hi> followed one another, for one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone could not undergo all things belonging to the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and death did hinder that any one should abide long in his office: But Christ alone executes his Priestly Office <hi>for ever,</hi> having no <hi>Partner,</hi> or <hi>Successor,</hi> nor wanting any to substitute in his stead: Therefore his Priesthood is more excellent than the Levitical.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 25.</hi> Wherefore hee is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing hee ever liveth to make intercession for them.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 13. Following upon the former, Christ our Priest living for ever, and in the perpetual odour of his Sacrifice interceding for his, is <hi>able to save and perfect to the utmost,</hi> or every way to accomplish the sanctification and salvation of all the faithful, or of all that come in to him; But the Levitical Priests could not do that: Therefore his Priesthood is more excellent than the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitical.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 14. Christ as a Priest, as it became our one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Redeemer, hath more excellent qualities of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and a more excellent condition than any of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitical Priests: Therefore his Priesthood is more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent than theirs: As for the qualities of his person, (1) Hee is <hi>holy,</hi> both in his nature, and in his desire, wholly devoted to the glory of God the Father. (2) Hee is <hi>harmless,</hi> who doth injury to no man nor creature. (3) Hee is <hi>undefiled</hi>; first hee is free from the pollution or blot of all sin, both of his own and others. (4) Hee

is <hi>separated from sinners,</hi> i. e. No waies obnoxious to sin, or so far from sin, that hee cannot bee a sinner.

Following upon the former; Christ is not necessitated to offer Sacrifice for his own sins, who had none, or to offer Sacrifice often for the sins of the people, it was sufficient to offer himself once: But it was neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for the Levitical Priests, daily to offer, both for their own and the peoples sins: Therefore his priesthood is more excellent than the Levitical.</p>

(1) The constitution of the Levitical Priesthood proceeds from the Law, which may bee changed; but the constitution of the Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Priesthood, or of Christ, flows from the word of the Oath, which cannot bee changed, because the Oath of God is unchangeable. (2) The Levitical Law admitteth many to the Priesthood, the Gospel only one, that is Christ. (3) The Law admitteth one man to succeed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; the Gospel admitteth one only without a Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor, <hi>viz.</hi> Christ, the Son of God. (4) The Levitical Law admits men to bee Priests, that labour with infirmities, <hi>i. e.</hi> obnoxious to sin, who cannot make their Sacrifice ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual to appease God, or the blessing which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce, they cannot really confer upon those whom they bless; but the Evangelical Word hath ordained Christ (the Omnipotent Son of God) who is able in all things to make his Priesthood effectual. (5) The Law appoints temporary Priests, who are consecrated only for the short time of their life; but the Gospel hath the only Son; who is consecrated for ever. (6) The Levitical Law went before, nor was the Law Gods ultimate determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion touching Priests; but the Gospel, or the word of the Oath, succeeded after the Law, as Gods ultimate deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination: Therefore the Priesthood of Christ is more excellent than the Levitical: All tends to this, that the believing Hebrews, seeing the weakness and abolition of the Levitical Priesthood, and the excellency of Christs, might renounce their Legal Rites, and more firmly cleave unto Christ.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. Christ our High-priest is such, and of so great dignity, that hee sits King at the right hand of the Throne of the Majesty of God the Father in the heavens, equal to the Father in power and glory; Hee leaves us the other part of the Comparison, as sufficiently clear, concerning the Levitical Priest, that hee is not such an one: Therefore the Priest-hood of Christ is more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent than the Levitical.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 2.</hi> A Minister of the Sanctuary, and of the true Tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. Christ is the Minister of that Sanctuary in the heavens, where hee sits King in his Throne, and all holy things which appertain to the worship of God, and the salvation of man, not faintly, but effectually acting the part of a Priest in Heaven, although hee is a Royal Priest as to the dignity of his Person, and the manner of his Administration, yet as a Minister as pertaining to his Mediatory Office: Such are not the Levitical Priests on earth, but onely Ministers: Therefore the Priest-hood of Christ is more excellent than the Levitical.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of the true Tabernacle] Arg.</hi> 3. Christ is in heaven the Minister of <hi>that true Tabernacle which the Lord hath pitched, and not man, viz.</hi> of his body (which Christ himself compared to a Tabernacle) and is figured by the typical Tabernacle: which true Tabernacle of his body, the Holy Ghost miraculously formed and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for him in the womb of the Virgin: And Christ now ministring in Heaven, represents that body to the Father; and his Humanity wherein hee suffered, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to him continually interceding for us in the same body. But the Levitical Priests are onely Ministers of the typical Tabernacle which man hath built: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, &amp;c.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 3.</hi> For every High-priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices; wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer.</q>
               <p>Hee proves that Christ doth constantly offer up the true Tabernacle of his body to God the Father, by <hi>three</hi> Reasons:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. Because seeing that every Priest is ordained to offer up gifts and sacrifices, it is necessary that Christ have somewhat to offer; But besides his intercession, and the presenting of his sacrificed body to the Father, Christ hath nothing in Heaven which may reconcile God: Therefore the true Tabernacle of his body is that onely which Christ offers to God in the Celestial San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 4.</hi> For if hee were on earth, hee should not bee a Priest, seeing that there are Priests that offer gifts according to the Law:</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 2. Because if hee was on earth, hee could not bee a Priest by the Law, to offer, to wit, those things which the Law prescribes to the Priests, <hi>viz.</hi> Gifts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and typical Sacrifices: Therefore that true Tabernacle of his body onely remains, which Christ offers in his heavenly San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 5.</hi> Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as <hi>Moses</hi> was admonished of God, when hee was about to make the Tabernacle. For see <hi>(saith hee)</hi> that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the Mount.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 3. Confirming the former, because Priests ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Law, serve on earth, onely unto the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample and shadow of heavenly things, for their Ministry was bound to the Tabernacle, or the Temple of <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi> and is imployed in the administration of figures and typical Ceremonies, as it appears by the Levitical Law: Therefore Christ, seeing hee cannot offer up any typical Sacrifices by the Law, and if hee was upon earth, neither could hee bee a Priest by the Law, and seeing now hee is in heaven, and therein exercises his Priest-hood,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:49391:107"/>
it is necessary that hee administer about those heavenly things, figured by those Legal shadows, <hi>to wit,</hi> the body and substance of all Ceremonies, which hee also doth, representing constantly the true Tabernacle of his body unto God, and dispensing unto us spiritual bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits procured for us, by the offering of his body. The testimony proving the former is <hi>Exod.</hi> 25.40. from whence under the name of a Tabernacle, God will not onely have the Tabernacle, but all things appertaining to the Levitical Priest-hood, to bee representations of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things, <hi>viz.</hi> Of Christs Priest-hood, and his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 6.</hi> But now hath hee obtained a more excellent Ministry, by how much also hee is the Mediator of a better Covenant, which was established upon better promises.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. To prove the excellency of Christs Priest-hood above the Levitical, from the excellency of the New Covenant above the Old: Because Christ hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained so much the more excellent Ministry above the Levitical, by how much the Covenant whereof Christ is Mediator is more excellent, and established upon better promises, than the Covenant was under the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitical Priest-hood, For the Covenant under the Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Priesthood, as to its external form, was a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works, established upon Conditional promises of external things; but the Covenant under Christs Priest-hood, is the Covenant of Grace, freely promising Christ, with all his benefits, to Believers, or the parties in Covenant: And it is the Office of the Priest to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede betwixt God and men, and to confirm the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants between them, by the offering of Sacrifice, as also to endeavour that men may enjoy the Divine Promises. Wherefore how much better the Covenants have been, by so much the Priest-hood it self is to be esteemed more excellent and worthy.</p>

                  <head>The Second Part.</head>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 7.</hi> For if that First Covenant had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the Second.</q>
                  <p>The <hi>second</hi> part of the Chapter follows; wherein hee confirms this Argument in the parts of it: <hi>First,</hi> hee proves that the New Covenant of the Gospel is more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent than the old legal Covenant which is abolished: by <hi>six</hi> Reasons.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For if] Reas.</hi> 1. Grounded upon the Proposition con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed; The former Covenant under the Levitical Priest-hood was imperfect, wherein something was want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and something might bee taxed, not indeed in respect to it self, but in respect to its efficacy and virtue, and that not from any fault in the Covenant, but because of the weakness of those that were under that Covenant: Therefore the former Covenant was less excellent than this that is New.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Then should no place] Reas.</hi> 2. Confirming the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, Because the former Covenant was to bee done away, and the New brought into its place, which had not been, had it not been imperfect: Therefore that former is more imperfect, and this New one more excellent.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 8.</hi> For finding fault with them, hee saith, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the daies come (saith the Lord) when I will make a new Covenant with the house of <hi>Israel,</hi> and the house of <hi>Judah.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 3. Confirming the former Reasons, Because the former Covenant by reason of the weakness of the parties in Covenant to perform the Law, which was the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Covenant, could not make the Covenanters faultless, or free them from the accusation of God: but a better Covenant and more efficacious was found out by God, for Justification, Sanctification, and Salvation: Therefore the former Covenant is less excellent than the New one.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 9.</hi> Not according to the Covenant that I made with their Fathers, in the day when I took them by the hand, to lead them out of the land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they continued not in my Covenant, and I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded them not, saith the Lord.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 4. Because the New Covenant bears no simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude with that Covenant which God made with the people in <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> when hee brought them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> whereof <hi>Ier.</hi> 31.31. For that, though it wanted not some obscurity in its signification of Grace which was to bee obtained in Christ, represented by the Sacrifices, yet it had the external form of a Legal Covenant, and an express condition of full Obedience, to bee performed to all Gods commandements, as appears by the form of it, <hi>Exodus Chap.</hi> 19. and 20. <hi>Ier.</hi> 17.23, 31, 32, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the New Covenant (as will by and by appear) is free from the condition of works, both in respect to him that is to enter into covenant, as also in respect to him who made the covenant.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Because they] Reas.</hi> 5. The Covenanters according to the Old Covenant, may fall away, and have done so, and may frustrate that covenant, and have done so: But the New Covenant, as shall appear, is of perpetual Grace, according to which the true covenanters, or beleevers, have never fallen away, nor can they fall away, because of Gods Grace, nor can they frustrate the New Covenant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because of the fear which God puts into their hearts, that they may not <hi>depart</hi> from him, <hi>Ier.</hi> 32.40. Therefore the New Covenant is more excellent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I regarded] Reas.</hi> 6. The Covenanters according to the Old Covenant, abusing the conjugal goodness of God, and committing adultery with other Gods in their Idolatry, according to the conjugal power and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion which God had over them, might justly bee despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, rejected and condemned by God: It is not thus with those that are under the New Covenant: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the New Covenant is more excellent, whereof Christ is the Mediatour and Surety.</p>

                  <p>Now hee proceeds to the proof of the other part of the Argument, <hi>viz.</hi> That the New Covenant is esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished upon better promises, and that by reciting <hi>four</hi> absolute Promises, made to the Elect, or Beleevers.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>And I will bee their God</hi>] The <hi>second</hi> promise is of perpetual communion with God, arising from the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of Marriage right, whereby the people in cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant become the possession of Gods peculiar love, and God becomes a blessed possession to his people, and both these God promiseth: I will bee their God (saith hee) and they shall bee my people, and I will account them for my people.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>third</hi> promise is of continual instruction and teaching by the holy Ghost, so that they shall not fetch the knowledge of God from the decrees and opinions of men, nor shall hang their Faith upon the authority of mens teachings, nor shall stick in the bare speculation of those things they shall hear preached (as it befalls the unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, who live not under the New Covenant) but by the means of teaching which are of divine institution, they shall bee all (as well the least as the greatest) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed in, and indued with a lively, effectual know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, love and observance of God; so that neither in it self, nor in the estimation of beleevers, hee that

               <argument>
                  <p>HEE prosecutes the Comparison of the Levitical Priest-hood with the Priesthood of Christ, and further shews the excellency of the Priesthood of Christ: There are <hi>two</hi> parts of the <hi>Chapter</hi>: In the <hi>first</hi> hee proves by <hi>fifteen</hi> Arguments, that the Priesthood of Christ is more excellent than the Levitical, <hi>to vers. 16.</hi> In the <hi>second</hi> part hee removes the scandal of the Cross, or of the death of Christ, by demonstrating the sufficiency and necessity of it, <hi>to the end.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 1.</hi> Then verily the first Covenant had also ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Divine service, and a worldly sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</q>
               <p>As to the first part, the seven first Arguments are so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny characters of the imperfection of the Levitical Priest-hood, from whence the excellency of Christs Priest-hood is commended.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. The first Covenant appertaining to the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitical Priesthood, had onely shadowed rites of Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and an earthly Sanctuary: Therefore it follows, that the Priesthood of Christ (which contains true Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification according to the New Covenant, and an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Sanctuary, as before was shewed) is much more excellent.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 2.</hi> For there was a Tabernacle made, the first, wherein was the Candlestick, and the Table, and the Shew-bread, which is called the Sanctuary.</q>
               <p>Hee explains this Argument, <hi>First,</hi> By describing the parts of the Sanctuary, and the sacred things in it, <hi>fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> hee describes the typical rites of Justification: The Tabernacle that <hi>Moses</hi> erected, had <hi>two</hi> parts: The <hi>fore-part</hi> was called the <hi>Holy,</hi> the <hi>inner</hi> part the <hi>Holy of Holies</hi>; in the fore-part, was the Candlestick, in the South part of the house set on the left hand: Against it in the North part of the house was the Table with the Shew-bread, so called, because they were set before God; by which was signified that light and life is vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed to them which come unto God; And in this part was the Altar of incense placed before the entrance to the inner part, whereby the offering of prayers was sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 3.</hi> And after the second veil, the Tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all.</q>
               <p>The veil that hung in the entrance of this part, is here understood to bee the first veil. The other veil which divided the fore-part from the Holy of Holies, here 'tis called the middle veil, and the inner house which was behind that, is called the Holy of Holies; the fore-part figured out the Church upon earth, the hinder part figured Heaven, or the place wherein God manifests himself to the Church Triumphant.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 4.</hi> Which had the golden Censer, and the Ark of the Covenant over-laid round about with Gold, wherin was the golden Pot that had Manna, and <hi>Aarons</hi> Rod that budded, and the Tables of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</q>
               <p>In the Holy of Holies was (1) The Golden Censer, which was used by the High Priest entring in once a year, fit to signifie the intercession of Christ, praying for us, and making our prayers acceptable unto God. (2) There was the Ark of the Covenant, covered over with Gold, whence God uttered his voice; a fitting type of Christ the word incarnate, and opening the Counsel of God to us. (3) There was the pot of <hi>Manna,</hi> conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently signifying that hidden <hi>Manna</hi> (which God truly was in Christ to the faithful, for their food unto eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life.) (4) There was the Rod of <hi>Aaron</hi> that budded, fitly signifying the effectual blessing, which Christ gives to the labours of his Ministers. (5) The Tables of the Covenant were put into the Ark, which taught us that the fulfilling of the Law is onely to bee sought in Christ.</p>

And because here is enough said of the glory of the outward Tabernacle, or of the earthly place, the Apostle breaks off his discourse concerning the terrene Tabernacle.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 6.</hi> Now when these things were thus ordained, the Priests went alwaies into the first Tabernacle, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishing the service of God.</q>
               <p>The place hath been spoken of, in the next place hee describes the shadowy rites of Justification, and first of all those which the Priests daily exercised in the fore-part of the Tabernacle, burning incense, taking care for bread for the furnishing of the Table, oyl for the Lamp, and the rest, according to the Law.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 7.</hi> But into the second went the High Priest alone once every year, not without blood, which hee offered for himself, and for the errours of the people.</q>
               <p>Hee proceeds in describing the anniversary rites, which were of this sort. (1) The High Priest alone, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny companion. (2) Once a year, not oftener. (3) Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver without the offering the blood of a Calf, and an Hee-Goat, in a basin. (4) This blood hee offered for his own sins, great and small, and for the sins of the people. All these outward, worldly and shadowy things, were in no wise efficacious in themselves: For they prefigured the entring of Christ into Heaven, by his own blood, the true Propitiatory: This is the first Argument of the earthly imperfection in the Levitical Priesthood.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 8.</hi> The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all, was not yet made manifest, while as the first Tabernacle was yet standing.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. Propounded by way of exposition of the next mystery. In the time of the Levitical Priesthood, while it obtained a standing Tabernacle, and that Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial worship about the Sanctuary, the way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, or the true Sanctuary, was not manifestly declared, as it is now under the Priesthood of Christ, That which the Holy Ghost taught by excluding the Priests from the inward Sanctuary: by admitting the High Priest once a year, the Sanctuary remaining shut, all the year after:
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:49391:108"/>
Therefore the Priesthood of Christ is more excellent than the Levitical.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 9.</hi> Which was a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and Sacrifices that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience,</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 3. The rites of the foresaid expiatory, and the other such exercises of the Levitical High Priest, were typical and parabolical, and a meer pattern of those things which were to bee performed by Christ: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the excellency of the Levitical Priesthood is no waies to bee equallized with the Priesthood of Christ.</p>
               <p>

                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. Confirming the former, unless Christ had died, the Covenant or Testament had not been firm, for even amongst men a Testament is not valid while the Testator is alive, but onely after his death: For while hee lives it may be changed, but not when hee is dead: Therefore it was necessary that Christ should dye.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 18.</hi> Whereupon, neither the first Testament was dedicated without blood.</q>

As the Old Testament was not dedicated unto God, without typical blood; so neither the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament can be dedicated or offered by way of satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for sinful men, without the true blood of Christ, the true Mediatour, the Antitype: Therefore it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Christ should dye.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Vers. 19.</hi> For when <hi>Moses</hi> had spoken every Precept to all the people, according to the Law, hee took the

                  <p>Hee explicates and proves this Argument out of the History, <hi>Exod.</hi> 24. concerning the dedication of the first Tabernacle by Blood, where <hi>Moses</hi> sprinkled the Book of the Covenant, and the people, with the blood of Calves and Goats, withall expounding the signification and use of the ceremony, that that Blood was the Blood of the Covenant, or a symbol of the Covenant typically made in those ceremonies, and truly to bee fulfilled in the Blood of Christ.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vers. 21.</hi> Moreover, hee sprinkled with blood both the Tabernacle, and all the Vessels of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery.</p>

                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 4. As under the Law all things were purged either with blood, or washings, drawing virtue to purge from the Sacrifices, so that without typical shedding of blood, there was no remission of sins: So in the New Covenant, there can bee no remission of sins, but by the shedding of the Blood of Christ: Therefore the Death of Christ was necessary. The Tabernacle, and the Holy Vessels, which were in themselves without pollution, are said to bee sprinkled with blood, because in respect to us, were wee not purified by the Blood of Christ, all things become polluted unto us: Therefore the use of the most holy things must bee sanctified to us by Christ, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to the impure all things are impure, in as much as in all things, unbeleevers pollute themselves.</p>

If the types ought to bee purged with ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical blood, heavenly things, signified by those types, ought to bee consecrated by better Sacrifices, <hi>i. e.</hi> with the Blood of the Mediator himself, who in his Virtue comprehends all Sacrifices; and by consequence the Death of Christ was necessary.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 24.</hi> For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true, but into heaven it self, now to appear in the presence of God for us.</q>

Confirming the former, Christ is not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the typical Holy place, made with hands, but into heaven, signified by the holy place, that constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appearing there, hee might intercede for us: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it behoved him to offer up a more excellent Sacrifice, <hi>viz.</hi> himself, as much as heaven exceeds the earthly Holy place; and by consequence his death was necessary.</p>

                  <p>Now hee proves the sufficiency of the one Oblation of Christ upon the Cross, by <hi>five</hi> Arguments.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. Christ entred not often into the Terrestrial Sanctuary, that hee might often offer up himself, as the Levitical High-Priest, (who offered not his own, but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther blood yearly) but is once entered into heaven: Therefore that one Oblation of himself upon the Cross, was sufficient, whereby hee was admitted into heaven.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 26.</hi> For then must hee often have suffered since the foundation of the world; but now once in the end of the world, hath hee appeared to put away sin by the Sacrifice of himself.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. Unless that one Oblation of Christ upon the Cross had been sufficient, hee must by often offering himself, die often from the beginning of the world; for if an Oblation of the Body of Chirst ought to have been often offered up for sin, it would have been necessary that the Oblation should have begun, at what time sin began to bee committed, <hi>i. e.</hi> from the beginning of the world, and from that time that Sacrifice ought to have been so often repeated, as new sins were committed after the Sacrifice, the courses of Sacrifice being acted over and over, without number. But this is absurd: Therefore his once offering up upon the Cross was sufficient.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But now once] Argum.</hi> 3. Christ in the fulness of time appeared, to that end, that by his one Oblation of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, he might abolish the sins of his people, present, past, and to come; For to the obtaining and application of remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of sins, to the mortification and abolishing of sins, of all the Redeemed or Elect, there is virtue enough in the Death of Christ: Therefore his one Oblation is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vers. 27.</hi> And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the Iudgement;</p>

                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 4. As it is appointed of God that all men shall once die, and after death come to Judgement, so it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of God, that Christ should onely once offer up himself to expiate the sins of many, <hi>i. e.</hi> of his Elect, and that hee should come the second time judge both of quick and dead: Therefore his one Oblation of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self upon the Cross is sufficient.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The second time] Argum.</hi> 5. Christ coming the second time at the Day of Judgement, shall make it manifest to all the world, that hee with one Oblation of himself hath most fully satisfied for sin, and that the imputation of sin, and the punishment or misery, and whatever foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps there are of sin, are removed from himself as the Surety, and from his, for whom hee stood engaged, and that Salvation is obtained for the faithful, who expect his coming: Therefore his once Oblation upon the Cross for our Redemption was compleat. It is said that Christ shall appear the second time, without sin, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to his first coming, wherein though hee was most free from the pollution of sin inherent, yet hee was not free from the sins of others, or ours, which were imputed to him: And thereupon hee became obnoxious to infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and misery, till hee satisfied for our sins; but at the Day of Judgement hee shall appear in glory, which will testifie the total abolition of sin, and by consequence will demonstrate that that one Oblation upon the Cross, was abundantly sufficient to take away sin.</p>

               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 1.</hi> For the Law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those Sacrifices which they offered year by year continually, make the comers thereunto per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect;</q>
               <p>The Arguments for proving the excellency of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Christ above the Levitical Sacrifices, are <hi>twelve:</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. The Levitical Sacrifices prescribed in the ceremonial Law, only contained the shadow of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Christ, and his benefits, not a lively representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the things themselves, as it appears in the Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of the Gospel from the things themselves, as now exhibited and considered in themselves: Therefore they
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:49391:109"/>
were far inferiour to the Sacrifice of Christ, represented by them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Never] Argum.</hi> 2. Even the most excellent Levitical Sacrifices, yearly performed by the High-priest, could not justifie or sanctifie those for whom, or by whom, they were offered: Therefore they are inferiour to the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Christ.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 2.</hi> For then would they not have ceased to bee of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered; because that the worshippers once purged, should have had no more conscience of sin.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 3. Confirming the former, the Levitical Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, by their often repetition, argued their imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and weakness to justifie the sinners for whom they were offered: Therefore they were inferiour to Christs Sacrifice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For then</hi>] A reason is given of the former; If those Sacrifices had justified the worshippers, the frequent of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering them had ceased, because the worshippers purged from the guilt of sin, and quieted in conscience, by one Oblation, had no need to repeat it often: But those Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitical Sacrifices ceased not to bee often offered, because the Law commanded that it should bee so: Therefore those Sacrifices did not justifie their worshippers.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 3.</hi> But in those Sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year.</q>

Confirming the same thing, even their most principal Sacrifices amongst them, carried along with them a repeated mention of all sins past, which had been in vain, if by the former Sacrifices they had been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolished: Therefore these Sacrifices were far inferiour to the Sacrifice of Christ.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 4.</hi> For it is not possible that the blood of Bulls and of Goats, should take away sins.</q>

               <p>Hee proves this Argument from <hi>Psal.</hi> 40. Wherein Christ is introduced by the Prophet, as to the time hee was made man, and appeared in the flesh, publishing the abolition of Legal Sacrifices by his Father, and that in their stead, his obedience in the body was appointed, even to the Death of the Cross, in that hee saith, <hi>His ears were opened</hi>; or, <hi>God had prepared him a Body</hi>; by both phrases is signified, that the Son of God Incarnate, was formed to obedience unto his Father. Forseeing the Legal Sacrifices not accepted, as not able to expiate sins, hee offers himself up to death, according to the Will of his Father, according to the Prophecies, which in the volume of the books are contained concerning him; and so hee takes away the Levitical Sacrifices, that hee may establish the Sacrifice of Christ.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 10.</hi> By the which will wee are sanctified, through the offering of the Body of Iesus Christ once for all.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 7. By the Oblation of the Body of Christ, according to the <hi>Will of God,</hi> wee are Justified and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, which could not bee justified nor sanctified by the Legal Sacrifices: Therefore the Sacrifice of Christ by Divine institution, is more excellent than the Leviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.</p>

                  <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 8. The Priests offering the daily Sacrifice, daily stood, as Ministers labouring, and offering the same Sacrifices, ineffectual to take away sin: But Christ by one Oblation once offered, as Lord of Heaven and Earth, sat down, and Reigns as Partner of Glory with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Therefore his Sacrifice is more excellent than the Levitical.</p>

After the Sacrifice of Christ, nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains to bee done for the expiation of the sins of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, or the Elect, only the subduing of the Devil, the World, sin dwelling in us, death, and a full subjection of the rest of ours and Christs enemies remains, that the Redeemed may enjoy a full happiness, being freed from all their enemies: Therefore his Sacrifice is more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent than the Levitical.</p>

                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 10. Confirming the former: The Oblation of Christ once made, hath an infinite virtue, not only to satisfie for the sins of the Elect, or Believers, who have devoted themselves in holiness unto God, but also effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually to bestow holiness and salvation, gradually to bee accomplished, and eternally to endure, upon all those which were, are, and shall bee hereafter: Therefore his Oblation is more excellent than the Levitical, and that being now offered up, nothing remains but the subduing of enemies, and the application of the benefits procured by that Oblation, for the good of the Elect.</p>

                     <hi>Vers. 15.</hi> Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that hee had said before,</p>

                  <p>Hee confirms this Argument with <hi>six</hi> Reasons. <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. Because the contemner of <hi>Moses</hi> Law, legally convicted, was adjudged to capital punishment, without mercy: Therefore much more is the Apostate to be destroyed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Trodden under foot] Reas.</hi> 2. Because the Apostate is no less injurious to Christ, as much as lyes in him, than if hee should draw him from his Throne, and trample him under his feet.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Blood] Reas.</hi> 3.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Spirit] Reas.</hi> 4. Because they offer despite to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, as if hee was a lyar, who convinceth them of the Deity and Divine power of Christ.</p>
                  <q>

                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 5. Because God professeth himself the reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of all sin, and of injuries done to his people, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.35, 36. and much more of so horrible a sin against his Son, and also against the whole Church.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>HEE proceeds to confirm his former exhortation to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance in the Faith, with divers Arguments drawn from the properties and effects of Faith, Illustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the manifold experience of the Saints: The Arguments of his Exhortation are twenty four, All which prove that Faith is to bee promoted, or that wee ought to persevere in the Faith, or live by it in the midst of afflictions.</p>
               </argument>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 1.</hi> Now Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. Faith embracing the promise concerning things hoped for, makes the things as it were present, and gives them a kind of subsistence, so far as it applies to us, the truth and power of God promising (in whose power the things promised are contained) and makes us as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the event, as if the things promised were actually performed: Therefore wee ought to live by Faith, and persevere in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the] Argum.</hi> 2. Faith laying hold upon the Word of God, is a convincing demonstration of the truth of things past, present<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to come, which are not seen, or appear, and are justly esteemed by us most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, because of the undoubted truth of the word of God: Therefore, &amp;c.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 2.</hi> For by it the Elders obtained a good report.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 3. By Faith Beleevers are commended, justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and proclaimed blessed by the Testimony of God, as it appears by ancient examples in the Scripture: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee ought to live by Faith, and persevere in it, in the midst of afflictions.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 3.</hi> Through Faith wee understand that the worlds were framed by the Word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 4. Faith satisfies it self in the word of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, concerning making the world out of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, or concerning the Creation of all things which wee see, out of no apparent or pre-existent matter: Therefore wee must live by Faith, and persevere in it, although wee see nothing of those things which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to us in the word of God: seeing God can effect our salvation promised to us out of things which appear not, no less by his word, than hee could create the world out of nothing.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 4.</hi> By Faith <hi>Abel</hi> offered unto God a more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent sacrifice than <hi>Kain,</hi> by which hee obtained wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, that hee was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it hee being dead, yet speaketh.</q>
               <p>The properties of Faith follow, which are illustrated by the special experience of the Saints, which hee dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses into <hi>four</hi> classes; as it were for orders sake: The <hi>first</hi> is of those which lived before the flood, <hi>to vers.</hi> 8. The <hi>second</hi> is of those which lived from the flood, till <hi>Israel</hi> went down into <hi>Egypt, to vers.</hi> 23. The <hi>third</hi> is of those that lived at their comming out of <hi>Egypt, to vers.</hi> 32. The <hi>fourth</hi> is of those that lived after, <hi>to the end.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The first in the <hi>first</hi> rank or classis is <hi>Abel,</hi> who is said by Faith to offer a more excellent Sacrifice than <hi>Cain,</hi> not onely <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hat Faith caused that hee should make choice of the best Sacrifice, which by the command of God, it was lawful for him to offer, but especially because by Faith in the thing signified, <hi>i. e.</hi> the <hi>MESSIAH,</hi> the immaculate Lamb of God promised, (who was to take away the sins of the world) hee fastened his eyes, and worshiped God in Spirit, whereas <hi>Cain</hi> stuck in the naked superficial Ceremony onely; And so <hi>Abel</hi> is declared ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified by Faith, God giving testimony of the excellency of his Sacrifice which hee offered: By which Faith, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though dead, yet hee speaks, teaching by his example all in the Church, to beleeve in Christ, and to seal their Faith with the Martyrdome of blood, if it be the will of God.</p>
               <p>Hence <hi>Argum.</hi> 5. The faithful are declared just by Faith, their offerings are accepted, their worship is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of God, and posterity is edified by the example of Beleevers, as is manifest by the example of <hi>Abel</hi>: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought wee to persevere in the Faith.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 5.</hi> By Faith <hi>Enoch</hi> was translated that hee
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:49391:110"/>
should not see death, and was not found, because God had translated him; for before his translation hee had this testimony, that hee pleased God.</p>
                  <p n="6">
                     <hi>6.</hi> But without Faith it is impossible to please him: for hee that cometh to God must believe that hee is, and that hee is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Enoch</hi> follows in the <hi>second</hi> place, who is said by Faith to bee translated into life immortal, death, or the separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Soul from his body, not intervening, only a change made from mortal to immortal qualifications. He proves that this Translation was a fruit of Faith, because <hi>Enoch</hi> pleased God, or was approved, before the transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him; and without faith it is impossible to please God, the reason whereof is given, because no man comes unto God, or is admitted into fellowship with him, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less hee subscribe to the All-sufficiency and goodness of God, by Faith, so as to apply that goodness of God to himself, which is offered him, and come unto God, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of communion with him; for it is Faith alone that divests a man of all his own worth, and joyns him to God that is merciful, and full of compassion. Hence <hi>Argum.</hi> 6. By Faith wee obtain Eternal Life, as God hath testified to us in the translation of <hi>Enoch,</hi> who had hee not been indued with faith, had not pleased God, nor come unto him, nor had been admitted into heaven: Therefore ought wee to persevere in the Faith.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 7.</hi> By Faith <hi>Noah</hi> being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an Ark to the saving of his house, by the which hee condemned the world, and became Heir of the Righteousness, which is by Faith.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Noah</hi> is the <hi>third,</hi> who warned of God concerning the coming of a Flood many years after, believed, and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and by the Command of God prepared an Ark, to the saving of his Family, whereby hee convinced the rest of the world then living with himself, of unbelief, and is declared the Heir of that Righteousness which is by Faith in Christ, who was represented by the Ark: Hence <hi>Argum.</hi> 7. By Faith wee are to take heed of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of God, and diligently use the appointed means to Salvation, by which diligence wee convince the world of unbelief, and slothfulness, and testifie the truth of our Faith, whereby wee believe in Christ, and obtain the inheritance of Righteousness in him, as is manifest in the experience of <hi>Noah:</hi> Therefore wee ought to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severe in the Faith.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 8.</hi> By Faith <hi>Abraham,</hi> when hee was called to go out into a place, which hee should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed, and hee went out, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whither hee went.</p>
                  <p n="9">
                     <hi>9.</hi> By Faieh hee sojourned in the Land of Promise, as in a strange Country, dwelling in Tabernacles with <hi>Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> the Heirs with him of the same Promise.</p>
                  <p n="10">
                     <hi>10.</hi> For hee looked for a City which hath foundations, whose Builder and Maker is God.</p>
               </q>
               <p>The second Rank or Classis of Believers, which li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to the time of <hi>Israels</hi> going down into <hi>Egypt,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the <hi>first</hi> in order is <hi>Abraham,</hi> who by Faith left his Country, and followed God into a strange Land, lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Promise of God for an inheritance to bee given him, uncertain in the mean time where hee should sojourn, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. By Faith also hee sojourned in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised Land, dwelling in Tabernacles, as some Pilgrim and Stranger, as <hi>Isaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> his Posterity did, to whom the same promise of an Inheritance was made, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. For hee did not so much look at that typical Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> as Heaven, represented by that Land of Promise, which is like a fenced and strongly founded City, whose Builder is God, and not man. Hence <hi>Argum.</hi> 8. By Faith wee being called of God, leave all earthly things, and content with our condition, (being according to the Will of God) whatever it is, wee so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journ in this world, under hope of a most abiding Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, to bee possessed by us in heaven, as appears in the example of <hi>Abraham:</hi> Therefore, &amp;c.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 11.</hi> Through Faith also <hi>Sarah</hi> her self received strength to conceive Seed, and was delivered of a Child, when shee was past age, because shee judged him faithful, who had promised.</p>
                  <p n="12">
                     <hi>12.</hi> Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, so many as the stars of the Sky in multitude, and as the Sand which is by the Sea shore, innumerable.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Before hee passes from what hee had to say of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> hee mentions the Faith of his Wife <hi>Sarah,</hi> whose Faith concurred with <hi>Abrahams,</hi> to apprehend the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of the numerous Off-spring which should issue from him: <hi>Sarah</hi> by Faith leaning upon the truth of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of God that is faithful and Almighty, though shee was barren and aged, and above the powers of nature, shee is made fit to conceive Seed, and to bring forth <hi>Isa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ac,</hi> from <hi>Abraham</hi> already, in respect to children, as it were dead; and so the Promise of God concerning his innumerable Off-spring took effect. Hence <hi>Argum.</hi> 9. By Faith wee are fitted for the performance of those things, which far exceed humane strength, and to receive the accomplishment of Promises, incredible to carnal reason; as is apparent by the experience of <hi>Sarah:</hi> Therefore, &amp;c.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 13.</hi> These all died in Faith, not having received the Promises, but having seen them afar off, and were perswaded of them, and imbraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 10. All these last recited, viz. <hi>Abraham</hi> with <hi>Sarah</hi> his Wife, and <hi>Isaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> persevered in the Faith, even till death, neither did they enjoy the good things in this life, which God promised, only by Faith they saw the certainty of the things promised, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded of them, saluted the good promises afar off, and stretching out, as it were, the Arms of Faith, imbraced them, thinking it enough that they should enjoy them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this life, professing themselves in the mean time, while they lived, that they were pilgrims and strangers in the earth: Therefore ought you to persevere in the Faith, and to live by Faith.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 14.</hi> For they that say such things, declare plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that they seek a Country.</p>
                  <p n="15">
                     <hi>15.</hi> And truly if they had been mindful of that Country, from whence they came out, they might have had op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to have returned:</p>
                  <p n="16">
                     <hi>16.</hi> But now they desire a better Country, that is an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to bee call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their God; for hee hath prepared for them a City.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Hee proves that while they lived upon earth, they did not obtain the promises, by <hi>two</hi> Reasons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reason</hi> 1. Because professing themselves strangers in the earth, they plainly shewed that they sought a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. but not an earthly country, because they had opportunity of returning to it, if they had sought it, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. Therefore they sought an heavenly Country promised of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wherefore] Reas.</hi> 2. God is not ashamed to bee called their God, whence hee gives us to understand, that hee had a City prepared for them, <hi>i. e.</hi> Heaven, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to raise them from the dead, that both in body and soul they might possess that desired Country, for as their God hee had prepared that City for them, so hee would bee called by them, <hi>Their God,</hi> that all may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, that these Saints were not to bee separated from the society of God, which they sought.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 17.</hi> By Faith <hi>Abraham</hi> when hee was tried, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered up <hi>Isaac;</hi> and hee that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ad received the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, offered up his only begotten Son,</p>
                  <p n="18">
                     <hi>18.</hi> Of whom it was said, that in <hi>Isaac</hi> shall thy seed bee called.</p>
                  <p n="19">
                     <pb n="206" facs="tcp:49391:111"/>
                     <hi>19.</hi> Accounting that God was able to raise him up, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from the dead: from whence also hee received him in a figure.</p>
               </q>
               <p>The Arguments have been handled which were drawn from the common effect of the Faith of the Patriarchs: The Arguments follow, which are drawn from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per effects of the Faith of each of them; First hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends the Faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that when God tryed him, whether hee would beleeve the Promises, and also whether hee would in all things obey, hee forthwith of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered up <hi>Isaac</hi> for a burnt-offering; though his onely Son, although <hi>Abraham</hi> had immediate promises of mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying his seed in this very <hi>Isaac, vers.</hi> 17. Although it was expresly said to him, of this very Son, that the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed seed, (in whom all Nations were to be blessed) should come of him, <hi>vers.</hi> 18. For by Faith <hi>Abraham</hi> reasoned, that God, who had brought forth <hi>Isaac</hi> from Parents past children, was able to raise him also out of the Ashes. And thus hee received <hi>Isaac</hi> snatched from the jaws of death, in a similitude, as it were raised from the dead, <hi>vers.</hi> 19.</p>
               <p>Hence <hi>Argum.</hi> 11. By Faith all impediments are conquered in temptations, which may any waies hinder the performance of our obedience unto God, and that with most happy success, as is manifest by the experience of <hi>Abraham</hi>: Therefore, &amp;c.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 20.</hi> By Faith <hi>Isaac</hi> blessed <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Esau</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning things to come.</p>
                  <p n="21">
                     <hi>21.</hi> By Faith <hi>Jacob</hi> when hee was a dying, blessed both the Sons of <hi>Joseph,</hi> and worshiped, leaning up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the top of his staff.</p>
               </q>
               <p>The example of <hi>Iacob</hi> follows, who when hee was a dying, by Faith comforted himself and his Sons, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the blessings, which, according to the Promise of God, should come upon his Nephews and their posterity, and that with so much perswasion, that for joy hee wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shiped God, leaning upon his staffe by reason of the weakness of his body.</p>
               <p>Hence <hi>Argum.</hi> 13. That by Faith they that are a dying may take comfort, and not onely comfort them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but also others concerning the blessings promised, as may be seen in the example of dying <hi>Iacob</hi>: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, &amp;c.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 22.</hi> By Faith <hi>Joseph</hi> when hee dyed, made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the departing of the children of <hi>Israel</hi>: and gave commandement concerning his bones.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ioseph</hi> is named the last of the Patriarchs, whom nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his power, nor the abundance of good things which hee enjoyed in <hi>Egypt,</hi> could make unmindful or negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent of the Promises of God, but being perswaded of the children of <hi>Israels</hi> going out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and of the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them into the Land promised to the Fathers (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though many years after) hee commanded that his bones should be carried out also, in testimony of his preferring the thing signified by the promised Land, before all earthly things: From whence,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 14. Faith overcomes length of time, before the accomplishment of the Promise, comming between, together with the commodities of this life, the corruption of death and the grave, and looks for a resurrection with the Saints, as wee see in the example of <hi>Ioseph</hi> dying: Therefore, &amp;c.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 23.</hi> By Faith <hi>Moses</hi> when hee was born, was hid three months of his Parents, because they saw hee was a proper child, and they not afraid of the Kings commandement.</q>
               <p>The <hi>third</hi> rank or classis of examples follows, from the times near the children of <hi>Israels</hi> departing out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> to the times of the <hi>Iudges</hi>; The <hi>first</hi> Example is of the <hi>Parents</hi> of <hi>Moses,</hi> who gathering from the beauty of the child <hi>Moses,</hi> that God had designed him for some emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent imployment, by Faith hid him three months, all that time, not fearing the Kings command, they preserved him alive, whom the King (hee being a male-child) commanded to be cast into the river.</p>
               <p>Whence <hi>Argum.</hi> 15. By Faith fear is overcome, which Tyrants by their unjust commands bring upon the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, as is manifest in the example of <hi>Moses</hi> Parents: Therefore, &amp;c.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 24.</hi> By Faith <hi>Moses</hi> when hee was come to years, refused to bee called the Son of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</p>
                  <p n="25">
                     <hi>25.</hi> Chusing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:</p>
                  <p n="26">
                     <hi>26.</hi> Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in <hi>Egypt</hi>: for hee had respect unto the recompence of reward.</p>
               </q>
               <p>The <hi>second</hi> Example is of <hi>Moses,</hi> the many acts of whose Faith are reckoned up, which carry the force of many Examples and Arguments. The <hi>first</hi> act of Faith in <hi>Moses</hi> is, that being come to years, and the use of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and discretion, by Faith hee refused the royal rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and had rather be called an <hi>Hebrew,</hi> than <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Nephew: which hee did not onely in word, but really, when leaving the Kings Palace, hee went forth to visit his <hi>Hebrew</hi> Brethren in affliction, nor returned hee again to the delights of the Court, <hi>vers.</hi> 24. The Apostle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends this act upon a <hi>threefold</hi> account.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That hee chose rather all afflictions in banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to endure hard bondage, that hee might by any means be assistant to the people of God, rather than be wanting to his duty, and enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season, with the neglect of his duty, <hi>vers.</hi> 25.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That hee accounted it greater riches to bee despised with the people of God, for their Faith in Christ that was to come, and so to bear his Cross, or the reproaches of Christ (upon whom those injuries which are done to his members fall as upon the head) than to be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> possessed of the treasures of <hi>Egypt</hi> in <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Court.</p>

                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That hee supported himself with the hope of delivering the people of God, and expectation of the free reward, which God hath promised to give unto his servants: whence it appears that what hee hath spoken of <hi>Moses,</hi> was the effect of his Faith, <hi>vers.</hi> 26.</p>
               <p>Hence <hi>Argum.</hi> 16. By Faith, Honour, and Riches, and other worldly allurements, wherewith unwary men are catched to their perdition, become vile, and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions borne for the name of Christ, and communion with the Saints, and Christ himself, and an expectation of the reward promised to the afflicted servants of God, is glorious, as it clearly appears in the example of <hi>Moses</hi>: Therefore, &amp;c.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 27.</hi> By Faith hee forsook <hi>Egypt,</hi> not fearing the wrath of the King, for hee endured, as seeing him who is invisible.</q>
               <p>The <hi>second</hi> act of <hi>Moses</hi> Faith is, that trusting in the Promise of God, hee fore-shewed to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his will, hee should bring the children of <hi>Israel</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and deliver them from that bondage, both himself and all the people, to whom in their departing hee was Leader and Captain: This act is commended upon a <hi>twofold</hi> account. <hi>First,</hi> That hee feared not the wrath of the King, who might (had not God with-held him) having gathered together, and armed his forces, either have slain, or reduced a fearful and unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like people (upon their departure) into more grievous bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That by Faith hee saw the power and faithfulness of the invisible God, and with this supported himself in all his straights, whence hee proves this act to be an effect of Faith.</p>
               <p>Hence <hi>Argum.</hi> 17. By Faith wee beleeve the promised liberty of the children of God from the Kingdome of darkness, and wee conquer all fear, which the wrath, and armed force of tyrants can bring upon those who press after the heavenly inheritance, having our eyes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies fastened upon the promised assistance of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible

               <p>The <hi>third</hi> act of <hi>Moses</hi> Faith is, that being certainly perswaded of the Promise of God, he celebrated the Passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over Feast in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and with the blood of the Paschal Lamb, took care that the doors of all the <hi>Israelites</hi> should be sprinkled: Promising in the name of God that they should be all delivered from the destroying Angel, (which was that night to slay all the first-born of the <hi>Egyptians</hi>) whose houses soever were marked with the blood of the Paschal Lamb.</p>
               <p>Hence <hi>Argum.</hi> 18.

destitute of humane help, reduced to divers straights, and evil entreated by the world, where ever they came: so that they chose to live in mountains and deserts, in caves and dens of the earth, among wild-beasts rather than men; who that they might not seem forsaken in these afflictions, the Apostle declares, that man-kind, (which dealt so cruelly with them) was not worthy of the company of such precious servants of God. From all these wee shall briefly draw but one Argument, which for memories sake wee set down thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 22. What is there which God requires of us, that wee are not able to effect by Faith? What are wee not able to suffer, that God laies upon us? as appears by the experience of the faithful Saints. Therefore Faith is to be cherished, we ought to live by it, and to persevere in it.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 39.</hi> And these all having obtained a good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port through Faith, received not the Promise:</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 23. All the Saints (whereof wee have spoken) by Faith were approved of God, justified, or God gave testimony to them, that they pleased him; although they had not that great Promise of Christs Incarnation, or of the seed of the woman compleated (wherein all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises are <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Amen</hi>) while they lived: Seeing therefore that they who lived in that obscurity, perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in all persecutions, constant in the Faith of Christ that was to come; how much more ought wee to perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, who see that Promise compleated in the Faith of Christ now exhibited?</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 40.</hi> God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.</q>
               <p>Hee answers a doubt; some may question why God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the comming of Christ, or why hee was not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested in the times of the Ancient Fathers: Hee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers, adding <hi>Argum.</hi> 24. It seemed good to God, to vouchsafe us this happiness, that wee should see with our eyes, the fulfilling of all the Oracles and Types; the honour of seeing Christs day, and hearing the Gospel, hee vouchsafed this not to the Fathers, but reserved it for us: Therefore so much the more are wee obliged to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severe in the Faith of Christ, and the constancy of our Profession, to the honour of Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Without us</hi>] Hee opens the Counsel of God, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the reservation of the honour of seeing Christ exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited, to our times, and addeth <hi>Argum.</hi> 25. God would not have the Infant condition of the Church perfect before the exhibition of Christ, without the more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat condition of the Church after Christ, manifested in the Flesh; that the whole Church, as well before as after Christ might be one perfect man in Christ; nor would God that the faithful living under Legal types, should be otherwaies perfected, than by looking together with us, to the thing signified, which is exhibited in our times: Seeing therefore that they in the Infant condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church, obtained perfect Righteousness and Salvation, by Faith, looking with us upon the thing signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Legal types, <hi>i. e.</hi> upon Christ that was to be manifested, as if he had been manifested already, and patiently persevered through all adversities; It will bee unworthy if wee persevere not constantly in the Faith of Christ, who is exhibited.</p>

               <p>This Proposition is inferred from the Precedent Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of the faithful, set forth under the similitude of contenders running in a race, wee ought, casting aside all hinderances, constantly to run the race that is set before us.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Lay aside</hi>] That the Apostle might make the Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation easier, and them more expedient for this race, hee admonishes them of shunning two impediments: the one outward, the other inward. The <hi>outward</hi> impediment is, that which is cast in their way from external things, riches, honours, and other earthly things, which ought not to be so much esteemed by us, but wee should be ready to renounce them, when and so far as they hinder our course in the obedience of Faith, for then they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come weights, which hee commands us to cast away. The <hi>internal</hi> impediment from inbred corruption or concupiscence dwelling in the flesh, which naturally cleaves to us, and may most easily ensnare us unawares unless wee take heed. And wee are said to cast away this sin, when wee take not care for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof, neither are wee so vehemently desirous of this mortal life, but when God calls us wee are prepared to lay down this life, for so is inbred corruption cast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, that it might not ensnare us in the tryals of Faith, for otherwise by no endeavours can it be altogether re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, so long as wee live in the flesh.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 2.</hi> Looking unto Iesus the Author and Finisher of our Faith, who for the joy that was set before him, endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the Throne of God.</q>

                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 2.

                  <hi>Vers. 5.</hi> And yee have forgotten the Exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children, My Son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him.</q>

Joyned with a reproof, The friendly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation of God in the Scripture, speaking to you as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to sons, requireth of you, that yee neither contemn the chastisement of God in the hardness of your hearts, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther faint being chastised, by reason of the tenderness of your hearts, (which now yee seem to do) having forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the divine Exhortation: Therefore yee are to bear afflictions patiently and constantly.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 5. Confirming the former; Chastisement is an effect of Divine love towards him whom God chastiseth: For chastening is for the amending of him that is chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: Therefore you ought to bear afflictions patiently.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Scourgeth] Argum.</hi> 6. To bear afflictions patiently, is a sign of Adoption; God acknowledgeth no man for his adopted Son, whom hee doth not exercise with sharp afflictions, nor is any man excepted: Therefore that yee may be found with the mark of adoption upon you, and that yee may prove your selves the Sons of God, yee ought patiently to bear afflictions.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 8.</hi> But if yee bee without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are yee Bastards, and not Sons.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 7. They that are free from chastening, or they which do not suffer fatherly chastisement, are not the Sons of God; they together with hypocrites may have the outward and visible Church for their Mother, but they cannot have God for their Father: Therefore if you would not be accounted hypocrites and bastards yee ought to bear afflictions patiently.</p>

                  <hi>Vers. 9.</hi> Furthermore, wee have had Fathers of our flesh, which corrected us, and wee gave them reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence: shall wee not much rather bee in subjection to the Father of Spirits, and live?</q>

The Fathers of our flesh had power to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stise us their Sons, and it was meet that wee should bear their chastisements, yea wee have born them with reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, how much more hath God the Father of our spirits power to chastise us, and wee are bound to bear his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stisements patiently?</p>
               <p>

               <p>

If wee have born the chastisements of our Parents, who for a short time in looking to our temporal good, oftentimes have for their own pleasure unjustly chastised us, wee ought much rather to suffer the chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, who for a short time most prudently and justly chastises us for our spiritual profit, that hee may make us partakers of his holiness, or may sanctifie us to life eternal.</p>

Answering an Objection; Although for the present, in the opinion of the flesh, no chastening may seem to be matter of joy, but onely sadness? yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it will be found by those that have been exercised, proved and subdued by it, that this Discipline did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit their composed and quiet minds, and it will appear that it hath promoted holiness or the fruit of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: Therefore yee ought to suffer afflictions, and moreover to take courage, and compose your selves to go on constantly in the waies of the Lord; which is signified by the <hi>lifting up of the hands, which hang down, and feeble knees.</hi>

Unless you patiently suffer afflictions which come upon you for the Gospels sake, and go on stoutly in the Profession of the Faith in the waies or streigth paths of the Lord, there is very great danger lest halting and inclining to fall away (by reason of the afflictions, which yee suffer for the Faith) yee imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately fall away indeed, and altogether turn a side out of the way, or renounce the Faith: Therefore admit yee of healing by the medicines of Faith and Christian Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation: suffer afflictions patiently, couragiously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm your feet in the waies of the Lord, and in his streight paths go forward.</p>

                  <hi>Without which</hi>] Hee gives the reason why hee joyns the study of holiness with peace: because without peace with men they may obtain eternal salvation, but they cannot be saved, or see the Lord without holiness, in whose sight, society, and fruition in Heaven, consists e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life.</p>

               <p>As to what concerns corruptions of manners (from which also the way is open to falling from the Faith) hee forbids, lest there be any fornicatour amongst them, that is, that they should not suffer him, but cast out of the Church fornicatours, and prophane persons, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning heavenly priviledges, and the good things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to the faithful and holy, do give up themselves to gluttony, to their bellies, and vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As for the Covenants of works, or the Law, hee sets down the terrible manner wherein the Law was delivered, of which description there are <hi>eight</hi> Branches.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) In the Covenant of works, or Legal Covenant there was a Mountain that might bee touched, or earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (whereto Heaven is opposed, or the heavenly Mount <hi>Zion,</hi> the Throne of Grace) as if hee had said, After yee beleeved in Christ, yee came not unto the Mount that might not be touched, and that which is earthly, the very sight whereof did affright, thereby the throne of Justice was represented, wherein God sitteth, when hee deals with the unregnerate man, that putteth confidence in his own strength, shining in the merit of his own works.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) In making that Covenant, the Mount <hi>burned with fire,</hi> whereby the anger of the Judge armed, and ready to consume sinners, trusting in their merits or works, or dealing with him from the Covenant of works.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) In making that Covenant, there was a whirle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind, <hi>darkness, and a tempest,</hi> whereby was represented the perplexed condition, amazement and horrour of the mind, whereby the soul of the sinner is repressed when the Judge shews to him out of the Law or Covenant of works, his justice and anger, according to the condition of the violated Covenant.</p>
               <p n="4">(4) In giving the Law there was <hi>the sound of a Trumpet,</hi> whereby was signified that all who are guilty of violating the Covenant of works, shall be cited, and of necessity appear before the Tribunal of God the supream Judge, and none escape.</p>
               <p n="5">(5) In making that Covenant there was <hi>a voice of words,</hi> by which was represented the Letter of the Law, reciting the duties wee were bound to, but not at all conferring strength for the performing of the things commanded.</p>
               <p n="6">(6) In making that Covenant, they who had heard <hi>the voice of words, intreated that the word should not bee spoken to them any more,</hi> whereby was signified the intolerable weight of multiplied guilt contracted by the violation of the Law, as also despair touching the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture performance of the Law incumbent upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, when God deals with the sinner out of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of works. That which the Apostle here inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, when hee saies, <hi>For they could not endure that which was commanded.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">(7) In making that Covenant, if <hi>so much as a beast had touched the Mountain, it was to bee stoned or thrust through with a dart,</hi> whereby was signified; <hi>First,</hi> That the sinner is excluded from all access to God, neither is it lawful that any sinner should approach to him, from the condition of this Covenant. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That both the sinner, and all things that belong unto him, his Oxen and Cattel are an abomination unto God. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That the sinner is to perish miserably by this Covenant, <hi>i. e.</hi> with contempt and ignominy, as with stones and darts shot at his cursed and abominable head.</p>
               <p n="8">(8) In making that Covenant, so terrible was the sight, that <hi>Moses</hi> said, <hi>I exceedingly fear and quake,</hi> and confessed his horrour; whereby was also signified that the most holy or just men could not bee able to stand before God, if they should be dealt with according to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of works, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 143. <hi>v.</hi> 2. It is said, <hi>In thy sight shall no flesh living bee justified</hi>: This is the former part of the Argument, the summe whereof is this.

               <p n="5">(5) Yee that in times past did live amongst world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men, whose portion is in this life, and whose names are written in the earth, now yee are found to be of the number of the Elect, and of those that were in times past written in Heaven, in the book of life a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Elect, and those that are predestinated to the obtaining of glory and grace.</p>
               <p n="6">(6) Yee that were without God in the world, ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to him (and in times past hee was your angry Judge) now being reconciled to him, hee is your mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful Judge, who absolves you, and powerfully destroies your enemies.</p>
               <p n="7">(7) Yee that were in times past numbered in the Catalogue of the damned, and of those that perished; companions with the spirits of the wicked, who are now in prison, are made by the Covenant of Grace through Christ, the Brethren of those, which now possess Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and have their spirits perfected in Heaven, <hi>i. e.</hi> they being free from sin and misery, are plenarily justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and sanctified in their spirits.</p>
               <p n="8">(8) Yee being delivered from the Covenant of works, which admitted not a Mediatour, and also from the yoak of Ceremonies, have access to Jesus the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, who is the Mediatour and Surety of the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, who hath undertaken that yee shall perform what the Covenant requires of you, and doubtless<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hee will make it good.</p>

                  <hi>Vers. 27.</hi> And this word, yet once more, signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of those things that are made, that those things which cannot bee shaken may remain.</q>
               <p>That wee may admit this sense, Hee expounds the words of the Prophet, which are so to be understood, because hee that is said once to shake the Heaven and the Earth, and not oftener, is said in that to remove those things that are unstable, and things that are made or created, as to their mutable condition, or mutable qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, that those things which cannot be shaken, and are immutable may succeed, such as all things will be in the glorious Kingdome of Christ.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 28.</hi> Wherefore wee receiving a Kingdome which cannot bee moved, let us have Grace, whereby wee may serve God acceptably with reverence, and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fear.</q>
               <p>Hee deduces from hence the <hi>fifth</hi> Reason of the Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, Wee have right to the glorious Kingdome, which cannot be shaken, and is already by Faith received by us: Therefore the Doctrine of Grace, and study of holiness is to be held fast, or that which is the same, let us have Grace whereby wee may serve God acceptably with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and godly fear.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 29.</hi> For our God is a consuming fire.</q>
               <p>The <hi>sixth</hi> Reason of the Exhortation, Against those which either do not hold fast the Grace of God, or abuse it to prophaneness. Our God is a consuming fire: Therefore let us hold fast Grace with endeavours after holiness. Who although hee profess himself the God of the faithful, yet hee will not suffer them to go unpunished<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who counterfeit the Faith which they have not, or they who with <hi>Esau</hi> abuse the Doctrine of Grace, even to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane licentiousness.</p>

               <p>The <hi>first</hi> Exhortation is to Constancy in Charity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Brethren<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wherein hee secretly commends them, because they indeed hitherto had imbraced and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coured for Christs sake the faithful, or brethren joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in Faith, and sincere Religion, and hee openly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats them that they would go forward constantly, and undefatigably in that same virtue, <hi>Let</hi> (saith hee) <hi>bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly love continue.</hi>

<pb n="212" facs="tcp:49391:114"/>
who want succour and consolation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thereby</hi>] The Argument to obedience of the Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is onely one. Because some using hospitality, have entertained Angels, when they thought they had received men, as <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lot, Gen.</hi> 18, <hi>&amp;</hi> 19. The force of the Argument is, Because more good is done in this kind than any one can easily imagine: For the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self entertaineth any thing that is done in his name to poor Beleevers, Prophets, or Disciples.</p>
               <q>

That they be moved in affection towards the Brethren, who are in bonds, especially for the sake of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and so succour them, as if they themselves in like manner were bound, and cast into the same prison, and lay in the same bonds with them. Not so onely, but hee also exhorts them, that as members of the same mystical body, they would in some measure be so affected with the evil of the afflicted Brethren, as they would have others af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected towards them if they were in the same condition, Because so long as they lived, they bare about with them a mortal body, obnoxious to the same evils: For that which happens to one, may happen to another, and common infirmity ought to move compassion.</p>

                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. To this sense, If any one hath not the gift of continency, God hath prepared a remedy and a safe refuge, <hi>viz.</hi> wedlock, and hath pronounced this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of life honourable amongst all sorts of men, and the conjugal bed (used according to the purpose of God) to be holy and undefiled: Therefore Chastity is to bee regarded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whoremongers] Argum.</hi> 2. If any one neglects wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock, which is the remedy of incontinency, and polluteth himself, either with fornication, being a single man, or with Adultery, being married, let him know (whosoever hee is) that Whoremongers and Adulterers God will judge: Therefore, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Exhort.</hi> 5. To avoid Covetousness, Lest this vice corrupt their manners. The Reasons of the Exhortation are <hi>three.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The first is propounded under the form of a Precept. Those things that you have, ought to suffice you, whether yee have them from any honest vocation, they come from the Divine blessing, and with those yee ought to bee contented, and not to be troubled with the desire of having more: Therefore take heed of Covetousness.</p>
               <p>

It is no less for any Beleever than for <hi>David,</hi> in <hi>Psal.</hi> 118. <hi>vers.</hi> 6. to promise to himself with confidence, not onely necessary succour as to this present life, but also Gods help ready against all the oppositions of wicked men, who endeavour to take away from Gods servants their very lives, together with all their substance: Therefore Covetousness is to bee avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 7.</hi> Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the word of God: whose Faith follow, considering the end of their conversation.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Exhort.</hi> 6. To the keeping the purity of the Gospel without the leaven of Jewish Doctrine; There are <hi>six</hi> Reasons of the Exhortation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Faith follow] Reas.</hi> 1. Your Teachers, the Apostles, and other faithful Ministers of Christ, have preached no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing unto you but the word of God, and have propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded no end to themselves in their conversation, besides that which ought to be propounded by faithful teachers, <hi>viz.</hi> the glory of God, and your salvation: Therefore imitating their Faith, and looking to the end of their conversation, keep yee the purity of the Gospel, or the Doctrine of Faith.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 8.</hi> Iesus Christ the same yesterday, and today, and for ever.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 2. Jesus Christ whose Doctrine is preached to you by his Ministers, is no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> divers, but one, remaining the same for ever and ever: Therefore keep the purity of his Doctrine, and the unity of Faith with those your Teachers, which have preached to you the Word of God.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 9.</hi> Bee not carried about with divers and strange Doctrines: for it is a good thing that the heart bee esta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lished with Grace, not with meats, which have not profited them, that have been occupied there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 3. Propounded under the form of a Precept: There are divers and strange Doctrines, unknown to the Apostles, which Christ is not the Author of; if yee have hearkened to them, as the wind driveth the chaffe up and down the earth, or ships floating in the Sea, so they shall carry you about hither and thither, that yee shall hold fast nothing: Therefore be established in preserving the purity of the Gospel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is a good thing] Reas.</hi> 4. It is better (yea it is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely good and saving) that yee seek the peace and establishment of your heart and conscience in the Grace of Christ, which onely his Gospel commends to you, and not in Legal Ceremonies, nor in observation of mean, daies, and the like: Wherein Righteousness least of all consists: Therefore keep the purity of Faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaven of the Jewish Teachers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Which have not profited] Reas.</hi> 5. Confirming the former, from the experience of them that Judaize; Those Legal observations have profited nothing as to Righteousness, or Salvation, them that are much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant, and have spent their time in them: Therefore keep the pure Faith of the Gospel from all leaven of this sort.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 10.</hi> Wee have an Altar, whereof they have no right to eat, which serve the Tabernacle.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 6. They that serve the Jewish Tabernacle after Christs comming, or they that pertinaciously cleave to Levitical Ceremonies, cannot bee partakers of Christ, which is the thing signified to us by the Altar, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, and other Levitical shadows, and is the true bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of them all: Therefore the Doctrine of Faith is to be preserved from the leaven of the Jewish Doctors, who thought that the observation of these Ceremonies was to be joyned with the Gospel. To which purpose the same Apostle saith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.2. <hi>If you bee circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing,</hi> The reason whereof is this, The observers of Legal Ceremonies, or they that receive shadows now abolished, do in the prescribed distinction of meats, observation of Altars, Feasts, Jubilies, Holy water, Priests garments, and the like Ceremonies, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally shew forth that the Sun of Righteousness is not yet risen, that Christ is nor yet come, that the Ceremonial Pedagogy is not yet abolished; but that still the time of shadows and signs, which were instituted onely to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figure Christ, until the time of Reformation.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 11.</hi> For the bodies of these beasts, whose blood is brought into the Sanctuary by the High Priest
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:49391:114"/>
for sin, are burnt without the Camp.</p>
                  <p n="12">
                     <hi>12.</hi> Wherefore Iesus also<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that hee might sanctifie the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Hee proves that they are to bee excluded from Christ, who seek righteousness, or part of righteousness, in the shadows or works of the Law; because God hath pre-fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured this in the type of the Expiatory Sacrifice; from <hi>Levit.</hi> 23.27. The blood of the Expiatory Sacrifice was brought by the High-Priest into the Sanctuary, but the flesh was wholly burnt with fire, neither did any thing thereof come to the Priests, as was given to them from the other Sacrifices. The Apostle affirms that this sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, that none of those who adhere to the Covenant of Works, could eat Christ, but were to bee excluded from communion with them, as many as do not firmly adhere to Christ, but seek even the least part of righteousness in the Levitical shadows, or works.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Without the Camp</hi>] God signified by this; <hi>First,</hi> That Christ was to suffer without the gates of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and that is plainly come to pass; for Christ was crucified without the gate. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That true expiation was to bee sought in the blood of the <hi>Messias,</hi> that suffered with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> (or the place consecrated for the Levitical worship) And the Apostle also doth teach, that Christ himself intended this, (having by his providence so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposed of every thing, that hee should suffer without the City) <hi>viz.</hi> that Christ going without the gates to offer up himself, would by that very thing signifie, that there was no virtue of Justification or Sanctification to bee sought in any legal Rites, but only in his own blood, all those legal Rites being excluded.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 13.</hi> Let us go forth therefore unto him without the Camp, bearing his reproach.</p>
                  <p n="14">
                     <hi>14.</hi> For here have w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="15">
                     <hi>15.</hi> By him therefore let us offer the Sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips, giving thanks to his Name.</p>
                  <p n="16">
                     <hi>16.</hi> But to do good, and to communicate, forget not, for with such Sacrifices God is well pleased.</p>
               </q>
               <p>From hence the <hi>sixth</hi> Exhortation is drawn to a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent imitation of Christ, going out of the City, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering up himself to his Father. This imitation consists in <hi>three</hi> things. (1) As Christ going without the City renounced the world, that hee might do his Fathers Will; so wee for his sake ought to renounce all worldly things, being ready to leave Father and Mother, family and goods, unless wee would bee accounted unworthy of his fellowship. (2) As Christ hath born his Cross, going out into an opprobrious place, <hi>Golgotha,</hi> so it behoveth us to bear Christs reproach, or our Cross, after him, that is, to prepare our selves to suffer banishments persecutions, reproaches, and miseries of that kind for his sake.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For not</hi>] He gives the reason of this branch, because we Believers know that those worldly things are momentary, and that there is not an abiding place for us on earth, but wee seek a City, that heavenly inheritance, to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of which, it becomes us to go out of the world with a ready mind, and to renounce worldly things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>By him</hi>] The <hi>third</hi> thing, in which wee ought to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate Christs suffering, is, that (resting in his intercessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, merit, and worthiness) wee offer to God spiritual sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, and acceptable, <hi>i. e.</hi> As Christ hath offered himself to God, that by his Passion hee might fulfill and abolish all Levitical types; so wee (whom hee hath made perfect by his alone Sacrifice, as to Justification, and hath sanctified us, as Priests consecrated to God, that legal sacrifices being abolished, wee might offer spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al sacrifices) ought to offer up our selves, as living Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices for the serving of God; and also Sacrifices of Praise, Prayer, and Thanksgiving, which are our first fruits, our <hi>calves,</hi> and those spiritual sacrifices, which wee ought continually to offer to God through Christ, by whose merit wee and our obedience is made acceptable unto God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To do good</hi>] Besides the calves of our lips, hee also commands us to do good, that is, to perform all duties of charity towards all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but most especially towards the houshold of Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>With such</hi>] Hee backs this part of the Exhortation with a strong reason, because these kind of sacrifices please God, or are acceptable to him, as the most sweet fruit of our Faith in Christ, and most evident testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our sincere love towards God, and our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 17.</hi> Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit your selves: For they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable for you.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Exhort.</hi> 7. That they perform diligently the duties which they owe to Pastours, and Governours, receiving them reverently as the Ministers of God, loving them for Gods works sake, which is in their hands, obeying them in all things, which they prescribe out of the Word of God, to bee believed or done in the Name of God, according to their office, endeavouring with as great thankfulness as may bee to recompence their labours and cares.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They watch</hi>] There are <hi>four</hi> arguments of the Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. The Ecclesiastical Ministers, your Lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, watch for you, praying, studying, disputing for you, preaching the Gospel, and exercising Ecclesiastical Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline amongst you for your good: Therefore obey them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Account] Argum.</hi> 2. God requires an account of your souls from them, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> but one perisheth by their fault: Therefore obey them, who undergo amongst you so dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and hard a task.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That with joy] Argum.</hi> 3. If you obey as it becomes you, you will rejoyce your Pastours, and they will more cheerfully follow their work, but otherwise they will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed do their duty, but heavily, and with sorrow; and so yee that ought to bee acceptable to them, will become the cruel tormentors of your Pastours: Therefore obey them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For that] Argum.</hi> 4. Preventing an Objection: (if perchance any amongst them might not care for the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, griefs and sorrows of their Pastours) it will turn to your hurt, if Gods Ministers are compelled to mourn through your fault, God will hear their groanings, and will severely vindicate the contempt of his Embassadors: Therefore obey them.</p>

The Apostle after his manner, about the end of the Epistle, commends himself to the prayers of the faithful Hebrews, whom hee desires to pray, that God would bless him in all things, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially that hee might freely and fruitfully preach the Gospel: But hee speaks of himself in the plural num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, as it appeareth out of the words that follow, which belong to his own person, from which it is manifest, that it was not unknown to the faithful Hebrews, that <hi>Paul</hi> was the Writer of the Epistle, which <hi>Peter</hi> also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth unto us, although for the unbelieving Hebrews sake, whom hee endeavoured to win, hee did not prefix his name, (which was hateful to them) before this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle: The reasons why <hi>Paul</hi> would have them prays from himself are <hi>two.</hi>

although my reputation is abused by calumniatours, who are enemies of the Gospel, and cannot bear my preaching concerning the Grace of Christ, and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from the Covenant of Works, and Levitical Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, yet I am conscious to my self that I have due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly discharged my office, and of my innocent conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that I deserve ill of none, But hee speaks here most modestly concerning himself, lest hee should give any occasion of cavilling.</p>

And hee adds <hi>through Iesus.</hi> (1) Because all those good works are purchased for us by the desert of Christs death. (2) They are derived to us through him as through a chanel. (3) Those good works are effected by him. (4) They are purged by him, and made acceptable: Therefore glory is attributed to God and Christ for ever, <hi>Amen.</hi> Hee useth <hi>four</hi> Arguments of his confidence in praying, <hi>vers.</hi> 20.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>For in few</hi>] The Reason of this Petition is, Because those things were more briefly written by the Apostle, without any allay, which might mollifie his reproofs, and they want explication, larger handling, a more ample and quick application from their ordinary Pastors.</p>
                  <q>

For the same end hee hopes that hee with <hi>Timothy</hi> shall come unto them.</p>

                  <p>As for the subscription, after the Epistle, there is no credit to be given to it: For it is manifest out of this Chapter, <hi>vers.</hi> 23. that <hi>Timothy</hi> was absent when this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle was writ: Therefore the subscription seems to be added from some unskilful Scribe.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Efore the time that something of mine did pass the <hi>Press,</hi> without my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or allowance, I did not minde to come abroad in this Learned Age, wherein many, more able Men than I am, do keep silence; my Furniture be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fitter for my present Charge, than for more publick Edification, in my judgement; and my Employments so frequent, as my spare time is little, for far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther extent of what the <hi>Lord</hi> hath bestowed upon mee. But, since that time, my just fears, from apparent grounds, that numbers of my <hi>Sermons,</hi> which were rudely, and popular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, delivered (as thrice, or four times preaching a week, might yeeld) and taken from my Mouth, as it was possible to overtake the current of running speech; the judicious Writer making what hee had overtaken, to cohere, the best hee could; and Copies going from him, to many, with num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of faults, and mistakings of the Transcribers; I being unable to revise (for straightness of time) any thing which was written by them, first, or last. My just Fears, I say, that these should Come to thy Hands, rude and faulty, as they are, made mee willing rather, when God should grant mee leasure hereafter, to draw up, in short, the points of Doctrine delivered by mee in these Sermons; that thou mightest have a twenty, or thirty of them, or m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e, possible, in the bounds and price of one at large.</p>
               <p>With this passage of Gods providence, another hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred, to draw forth this piece unto thy view in the mean time, which is this: When I considered, how largely God hath provided <hi>Helps,</hi> for understanding of holy <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> by large Commentaries, and sweet Sermons, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially from His Church in <hi>England;</hi> whereby encrease of Knowledge is given to the Learned, and such, whose means to buy, and leasure from their calling to read, and victory over their own lasiness, for taking pains, doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur with their capacity, for making use of this the <hi>Lords</hi> Liberality: I have often requested the Father of Lights, To help such as either could not, or else would not, profit themselves by that, which is already granted in his Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by some short, and plain manner of writing; whereby the weaker judgements might be supported, and all Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse taken away from the witty Sluggard, and such whose worldly Employments, and great Affairs, have seemed sufficient Reasons, to excuse their negligence, and the small and naughty matters of their own Salvation, and the Kingdome of <hi>Heaven,</hi> and Evidences thereof in <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And, to this purpose, I have been very instant, with the Godly-Learned of mine acquaintance, to take this matter in hand; and, to divide amongst them, the hard parts of <hi>Scripture,</hi> at least, that this work might be done by the hands of many, which could not be done by one. I found their approbation of my desire, and inclinable willingness, to put hand to work also. But, some of them, for the weight of their ordinary Charge, some of them for age, and infirmity of body, some of them for their hands full of the <hi>Lords</hi> work in another sort, could not adve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ture to be straightly ingaged in the work. Where-through I was forced either to forsake my Desires, which daily were kindl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> within mee more and more; or else, come forth with some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of this kind, as might be; and seek amongst my Readers, some to take this Matter to heart; and, to do therein, as the <hi>Lord</hi> should enable them, by themselves, or by others.</p>
               <p>I have made choice of this <hi>Epistle,</hi> which is a piece of hard Meat, in the estimation both of the <hi>Apostle,</hi> the Writer thereof, (<hi>Chap. 5,</hi> and <hi>6.</hi>) and of <hi>Peter,</hi> giving his judgement of it, (<hi>2</hi> Pet. <hi>1.15, 16.</hi>) That if I should attain any part of mine intent in any measure, in so hard a place, I might encourage others, to take in hand a more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie part of Scripture, with more hope of success.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Summe</hi> of each <hi>Chapter,</hi> or the <hi>Contents,</hi> do stand instead of <hi>Analysis;</hi> and, in some places, of a <hi>Paraphrase.</hi> The <hi>Text</hi> doth follow, <hi>Verse</hi> by <hi>Verse.</hi> The Exposition of the <hi>Verse,</hi> serveth for grounds of Doctrines, which Doctrines, following upon the grounds, are joyned, most part, with the Note of Collection [THEN] Plurality of Doctrines from the ground, or from the <hi>Text</hi> where the consequence is easie to be perceived, is distinguished by figures, according to their numbers. Terms of Art I have eschewed, Because I would be plain to all. I have spared all enlargement of the Doctrines, which I could spare; leaving them as grains of Seed, to get their growth in thy mind, by Meditation, which is necessary for such as love to make use of this sort of writing, because I would be short. The special handling of such Passages, as the Apostle citeth out of the Old Testament, I have left to their own proper place. Quotations, for confirmation of my Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, drawn from the ground, I have spared also: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, I judged, If the Doctrine was pertinently collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the ground, the <hi>Text</hi> in hand was sufficient con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation. And if it be not pertinently collected, I am content that thou pass by it, and take onely what is perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent. A Quotation could prove the Doctrine true; but not prove it pertinent; and so not serve my purpose. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more, and more petinent Consequences, the Learned will finde, which I have not observed: but not for the Learned, or such as are able, and willing, to make use of larger Writings, do I intend this present.</p>
               <p>Therefore, do not look how much thou doest miss, which might have been said; but what in the first frame of this mould could be done, in such brevity. Which mould, I trust, the Learned shall help, if it please the <hi>Lord</hi> to stir them up, to take this matter in hand. I have pressed, singly to point out Truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> without <hi>Partiality;</hi> not wresting the Text, to reach a Blow to any man. And what thou shalt make of this present Piece<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I am not careful, if I can ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain thereby, that more able Men may be set on work, to do what I intend, but cannot do.</p>
               <p>If the precious Iewel of the <hi>Scripture</hi> may be more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed of, and made use of, which is more necessary for our Souls, than the Sun in the Firmament is for our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; and, the greatest gift, next after our <hi>Lord Jesus</hi> down-sending amongst us, that ever the world saw. If I may by this piece, I say, be an Instrument, to stir up any to the love of searching the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> I have not lost my pains, whatsoever shall become of this Book: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto I have solicited for no Patronage under Heaven, but thy Christian Good-will to my Aim; to have our <hi>Lord</hi> the more honoured, in the sound Knowledge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and right use of His <hi>Scripture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:49391:117"/>I am confident, that thou wilt easily judge with mee, That the proud, and prophane Despisers of <hi>God</hi> are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to perish, amongst his Enemies: but consider, and judge again; If prophane Despisers of holy <hi>Scripture,</hi> who dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain to read, or obey, what <hi>God</hi> commandeth therein, be not to be ranked in the same Roll. For <hi>God</hi> draweth so nigh unto us in his Word, speaking unto us, as a King unto his Subjects, or a Master unto his Servants, that the obedience, or disobedience which wee give to His Speeches, resolveth directly, and immediately, upon <hi>God himself.</hi> For what is it else to hear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and beleeve, and obey <hi>God;</hi> but, to hear, and beleeve, and obey His speeches? And, what is it, not to take notice of <hi>God,</hi> to despise, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey <hi>God,</hi> but not to take notice of his Speeches, not to read his Writings, and not to care for any thing that Hee commandeth, promiseth, or threatneth? Therefore hath the <hi>Lord</hi> written the great things of his Law unto us, even to be a Touch-stone, not onely to try all mens Doctrine there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, but also to try all mens disposition towards Himself; and how they stand affected to His Honour, whether as Foes, or as Friends. For, What readier way is there, to get evidence of a man destitute of the Knowledge, Faith, Love, Fear, and the rest of the parts of the Image of <hi>God,</hi> than to finde him destitute of the Knowledge and Love of the <hi>Scripture</hi>? What surer sign of a man, who for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent is enemy to <hi>God,</hi> and to the enlargement of His Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Kingdome, than to finde him traducing the perfect Law of the <hi>Lord,</hi> and marring, to his power, the free course of the Scriptures light, which is the Stepter of <hi>Christs</hi> Kingdome? Again, What surer sign of a Child of Promise, begotten of <hi>God,</hi> than to see him, with <hi>David, Psal. 119.</hi> making more of the Scriptures, than of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; and pouring out all his Affections upon it, as upon the nearest Mean whereby <hi>Gods</hi> Spirit may be conveyed into his soul, for perfecting of Holiness; and the readiest Chariot, to carry up his Spirit, to dwell in <hi>God,</hi> for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of his happiness.</p>
               <p>Wee shall finde also, answerable to <hi>Gods</hi> purpose of trying men by His Scripture, His Wisdome, giving a due meeting unto men, as they do make use of His Scripture. Do they not read it? or do they read, and not consider it? Do they not weigh, what is imported by it, in sense and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? It fareth with them, as with those to whom <hi>Christ</hi> said, <hi>Mat. 22.29. You erre, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God.</hi> Do they not love it? Behold their Plague, <hi>2</hi> Thes. <hi>2.10, 11, 12. Because they received not the love of the Truth, that they might be saved; for this</hi> very <hi>cause,</hi> saith the Text, <hi>God shall send them strong delusion, that they should beleeve a Lie, that they might be damned.</hi> Do they not stedfastly beleeve, what they learn in Scripture? In Gods judgement, with the fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish, and unstable, they are suffered to wrest the Scriptures, to their own destructio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were they never so great wits, <hi>2 Pet. 3.16.</hi> Do they not study, to give obedience unto the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>own Truth of it? Hee dealeth with them, as with <hi>Israel, Psal. 81.11. My people would not hearken unto my voice, and</hi> Israel <hi>would none of mee.</hi> (Hee counteth himself rejected, because his Word was rejected) But what followeth, <hi>vers. 12? So I gave them up, unto their own hearts lust: and they walked in their own counsels.</hi> But to such as will be Christs Disciples indeed, Students, seeking to grow in knowledge, beleef, and obedience of his Word? seeking to love him, and keep his sayings, hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth <hi>(Joh. 14.26.)</hi> to send unto them. <hi>The Spirit, of Truth, the Comforter, the Holy Ghost, to teach them all things</hi>: That is, to perfect their knowledge, more and more, by his Spirit, to fill their hearts with joy and comfort, according to his Truth, and to make them holy, more and more.</p>
               <p>And why are all these stiles given? Even to shew, that such as will have Christs Spirit to work any of these, must seek him to work all of these joyntly, or not to have him for working any of them at all. Neither comfort without truth, nor comfort without Holiness. The same is it which Wisdome cryeth, <hi>Prov. 8.34, 35, 36. Blessed is the man that heareth mee, watching daily at my Gates; waiting at the Posts of my Doors: For who so findeth mee, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth life; and shall obtain favour of the Lord. But hee that sinneth against mee, wrongeth his own Soul, all that hate mee, love death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore how thou doest hate Death, and love thine own Soul, how thou standest affected towards <hi>Gods,</hi> and the fellowship of the Comforter, the holy Spirit, the Spirit of Truth, and towards the enlargement of the Kingdome of Christ; let thy affection towards the Scriptures, more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant dwelling in thy self, and for the Scriptures more free course amongst others, bear witness.</p>

                  <p>BEcause the <hi>Hebrews</hi> were hardly drawn from the observation of Levitical Ordinances, unto the simplicity of the Gospel, and in danger of making Apostacy from the Christian Faith, by persecution, the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> setteth before their eyes the glory of Jesus Christ, in his person, far above men and Angels; by whose Ministery the Law was given, not only as God, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. but also as man, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. and in his Office above <hi>Moses, Chap.</hi> 3.

                  <p n="2">2. <hi>These are called the last dayes.</hi>] Then, The fulness of time is now come: The Law-giver of the Church hath spoken his last Will: His mind is fully revealed; setled course for the Faith, and service of his Church, is taken; after which no new alteration of his constitutions is to bee expected.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Hee saith, God spake to them by the Prophets, but hath spoken to us by</hi> his Son.] Then, 1. As the Son is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the servants, so is Christ above the Prophets. And no reason, that the Jews should think so much of <hi>Moses,</hi> and the Prophets, as for them, to mis-regard Christs Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and stick to the Levitical Service, under pretence of estimation of the Prophets. 2. The glory of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel is greater than the glory of the Law. 3. The glory of the ministerial calling of Preachers of the Gospel, is by so much the greater, as it hath the Son of God first-man in the Roll thereof; as first Preacher, and Prince of Preachers. 4. Christs Sermons are all of them direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto us: and so much more highly should the Doctrine of the Gospel bee esteemed of, by us.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>In describing Christ, hee saith, the Son is Heir of all things: that is, hee hath received a domination over all creatures, from the Father; that as Hee is Lord over all, so is Christ.</hi>] Then, 1. Christ is Heir of all things in the Church also, Lord of the Sabbath, and of all the service annexed to it, to whom it is lawful to chop and change the Levitical Ordinances, at his pleasure. 2. And Heir of all the Prerogatives and Promises, made to the Jews, or others; through whom only, as the righteous owner of all things, both Jew and Gentile must seek and keep right to what they have, or can claim: And therefore it behoved the <hi>Hebrews</hi> to enter themselves Heirs to their priviledges by Christ, or else to bee dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inherited.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Hee saith,</hi> God by his Son, made the worlds.] <hi>So hee calleth the world, for the variety of times, and ages, and fleeces of the creatures, one succeeding another.</hi> Then, 1. Christ is God, Creator of all things. 2. Hee is a distinct person from the Father; by whom the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther made all. 3. That which the Father doth, the Son doth the same; yet so, as in order of working, the Father is first, and the Son is next; working with, and from the Father.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>In describing Christ, hee useth borrowed similitudes: for what proper word can bee found, to express so great a mystery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And what can wee conceive of his Godhead, but by resemblance? Yea, hee useth more similitudes than one; for it is but little wee can conceive of him by one: and what wee might misconceive by too hard pressing of one similitude, by another is corrected; and so our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception helped.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Christ the Son, is called the</hi> brightness <hi>of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Glory.] The similitude is borrowed from the Sun beams.</hi> Then, 1. As the Father is glorious, so is Christ his Son glorious, with the same glory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Therefore 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.8. Hee is called the Lord of Glory. 2. As the beams of light have their original from the Sun, so hath Christ his original of the Father, and is unseparable from him: for as the Sun was never without its light, so nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was the Father ever without the Son, but co-eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with him. 3. As the Sun is not manifested, but by its own brightness; so the inaccessible light of the Fathers Glory, is not revealed to the creature, but by the Son.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Christ is called the</hi> express Image <hi>of the Fathers Person.] The similitude is borrowed from a Signets im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, which representeth all the lineaments of the Seal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. The Father is one person, and the Son is one other person of the Godhead, having his own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per subsistence distinct from the Father. 2. The Son re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembleth the Father, fully, and perfectly; so that there is no perfection in the Father, but the same is substantially in the Son: As the Father is Eternal, Omnipotent, Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipresent, infinite in Wisdome, Goodness, Mercy, Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and all other Perfections; so is the Son Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, Eternal, and all that the Father is. 3. Whatsoever perfection wee can perceive in Christ, shining in his Manhead, or Word, or Works; the same wee may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude to bee in the Father also, whose resemblance, and express Image hee is. Find wee Christ good and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, loving and pittiful, meek and lowly, not abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the most vile and miserable, whether in soul or bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, that cometh unto him for relief<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wee may bee assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that such a one is the Father; and no otherwayes minded to such as seek unto him through Christ.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Christ <hi>upholdeth all things,</hi> by the word of his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.] Then, 1. The preservation of the Creatures, as well as their Creation, is from Christ. The Father upholdeth all, so doth the Son. 2. What hee doth, hee doth as Omnipotent God, by his Word, without trouble or bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then. As hee spake, and all was done; So hee but by his Word commandeth, and all standeth fast. And this his Word is nothing else, but his powerful Will, ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things to bee, and continue; and powerfully making them so to bee, and continue, so long as hee will.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Christ by himself <hi>purged our sins. To wit, by bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our sins upon his body on the Tree,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.4.] Then, 1. Our sins are filthiness that must bee purged. 2. The satisfactory cleansing of our sins, is not a thing to bee done by mens meritorious doings, or sufferings, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready done, and ended, by Christ, before hee ascended; and that by himself alone, all creatures being secluded. 3. Hee that upholdeth all things, by the Word of his own Power; and hee that purged our sins, by his own Blood, is but one self-same Person; God and Man is He in one Person.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Christ <hi>sate down on the</hi> right hand <hi>of the</hi> Majesty <hi>on high.] That is, when</hi> Christ <hi>had cleansed our sins by his death, hee ascended to Heaven, and possessed himself as Man, in the fellowship of the same Glory, which as</hi> God <hi>hee had before the World was,</hi> Joh. 17.4, 5.</p>
                  <p>Then, 1. The Son is joyned in the fellowship of the same Glory with the Father, as well in his Manhead af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Resurrection, as in his Godhead before his Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. For, though the glory of Christs Godhead was hid, for a while, by the sufferings of his Manhead, yet was it not abolished, nor in it self abated thereby: but the Manhead first assumed unto the unity of Person with the Godhead, that our Ransome might bee rich; and then, to the union of the same Glory, that the Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, after the Ransomes paying, might bee altogether glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Seeing hee that hath cleansed our sins, is so glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a Person, all the means of his cleansing us, how base soever, such as were his Hunger and Thirst, his Poverty and Weakness, his shameful and painful Death, should bee glorious in our eyes also.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Hee proveth Christ to bee greater than the Angels, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his</hi> Name <hi>is more excellent than theirs.] For they are called Angels, and hee</hi> Gods <hi>Son: which hee is said to have by inheritance as due to him; both as God by eternal Generation, and as Man by assumption of our Nature in unity of one person; according to which hee is not the adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but natural Son of</hi> God: <hi>Filius natus, non filius factus.</hi> Then God giveth not idle titles: as God calleth things, so they are, or are made to be. Christ, as God, is called Gods Son, because by eternal Generation hee is so: as Man hee is called Gods Son, because by assumption of the humane nature unto the personal union of his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, hee is made so to be.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As far as Sonship is above servile imployment, so far is Christ more excellent than the Angels.</p>

                     <hi>Vers. 5.</hi> For, unto which of the Angels said hee at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a Father, and hee shall be to mee a Son.</q>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Hee proveth this point by Scripture,</hi> Psal. 2.7. 2 Sam. 7.19. <hi>and putteth them to improbation of his Doctrine by Scripture, if they could.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. In the Primitive Church, in matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, all Authority was silent, and Divine Scripture spake, and determined questioned points of Truth. 2. The Apostle counted it sufficient, to bring Scripture for his Doctrine; and permitteth no impugning of it, but by Scripture.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Onely of</hi> Christ, <hi>saith God,</hi> I have begotten thee.]</p>
                  <p>Then, 1. Howsoever God hath many Sons by Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by Office, by Grace, and Adoption; yet, a Son by Generation, a native Son, hath hee none, but Christ. 2. Christ is of the same Nature and Essence, with the Father, consubstantial with him; because begotten of him, in himself, without beginning; the Son being eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally in the Father, and the Father eternally in the Son, of the self-same Nature, and God-head.</p>

His Scepter, is a Scepter of Righteousness; because hee cannot abuse his power, to do wrong to any, but will do right to all; yea, and lead on his Subjects to Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Faith, to justifie them before God, and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of Conversation, to adorn them before Men.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Hee</hi> loveth <hi>Righteousness, and</hi> hateth <hi>Iniquity.</hi>] And therefore, 1. His Scepter cannot be swayed but righteously. 2. And so must his Subjects set themselves to do, if they will please him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Therefore, Christs God hath anointed him, with the Oyl of Gladness, above his Fellows.</hi> Then, 1. As Christ is God himself, so also is hee Man under God, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his Man-head, and Office therein. 2. And God is his God by Covenant: Christ as man, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate with God. 3. And hee hath Fellows in the Covenant: that is, others of man-kind, with whom hee is partaker of flesh and blood, Fellow-brethren, and Co-heirs, Shares-men in all the Fathers Goods with him. 4. Hee is anointed with the Oyl of Gladness; furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Spirit that bringeth joy unto him, and all his Subjects, who get conveyed unto them by Christ, Righteousness, and Peace, and Joy in the Holy Ghost. 5. Hee is anointed above his Fellows. The rest of the confederate Saints are anointed also; yet by measure, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive they the Spirit. But Christ is anointed above them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Spirit is not given to him by measure; but to dwell bodily, or substantially, that wee of his fulness may all receive, Grace for Grace.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Because hee loveth Righteousness, &amp;c. Therefore hee is anointed.</hi> Then, The Righteousness of Christ, is the procuring, and meritorious cause of this joy to him, and his Subjects, Fellows in the Covenant.</p>

                     <hi>Vers. 1.</hi> Therefore, wee ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which wee have heard<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> lest at any time wee should let them slip.</q>
                  <p n="1">1. THerefore, <hi>Wee ought to give heed, &amp;c.] From the Excellency of Christs Person, bee urgeth the Belief of his Doctrine.</hi> Then, 1. CHRIST must be esteemed of, as becommeth the Excellency of his Person. 2. The way how CHRIST will be respected of us, is by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting his Doctrine. And the Excellency of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, should procure our reverend receiving of his Word, and stedfast holding of it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Hee will have us to take heed, lest wee should let it</hi> slip. <hi>The word is borrowed from rent and leaking Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, or sandy ground.</hi> Then, 1. The Gospel is a precious liquor, worthy to be well kept. And wee, of our selves, are as rent Vessels, ready to let it slip, when wee have heard it; or like sandy ground, which keepeth not the rain.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>For this wee ought to give the more earnest heed.</hi>] Then, The Conscience of the worth of CHRIST, and his Gospel, and of our own unfitness to retain it, should sharpen our vigilancy, and attendance, to keep it: else wee will doubtless let it slip.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Hee saith not, lest shortly; but, lest at any time.</hi>] Then, It is not sufficient to beleeve the Word for a while, and for a while to remember it: but wee must gripe it so, as never to quit it by mis-regard, or mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleef. <hi>For, Faith, and love of the Truth, is the good me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory that specially hee requireth here.</hi>

                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 2.</hi> For, if the word spoken by Angels, was sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast, and every transgression, and disobedience re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a just recompence of reward.</q>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Hee reasoneth from the Law spoken by Angels.</hi>] Then, The Angels were employed in giving of the Law, they did blow the Trumpet; they, from GOD, utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the word to <hi>Moses.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The word spoken by them, was stedfast.</hi>] Then, What God delivereth by the Ministery of Messengers, is authorized, and ratified by GOD.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Every transgression was punished.</hi>] Then, The pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of transgressors or his Law, is a proof of GODS authorizing the Doctrine.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Hee calleth the punishment a just Recompence.</hi>] Then, There is no evil befalleth sinners, more than they do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve: None hath cause to complain of injustice.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 3.</hi> How shall wee escape, if wee neglect so great salvation, which, at the first, began to bee spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him.</q>

                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Hee reasoneth for the punishment of the Law-break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to prove the punishment of misbelieving the Gospel.</hi>] Then, 1. The not-embracing of the Gospel, is a greater sin, than the breach of the Law. The despising of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness, is much worse than the making of the fault. 2. Examples of Judgement upon Transgressors of the Law, are evidences of greater Judgements to come on the misregarders of the Gospel.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Hee calleth the Gospel,</hi> so great a Salvation; <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the free Offer of Remission of sins, and eternal Life, in it.</hi> Then, The greatness of the benefit to bee gotten by the Gospel, aggravateth the sin of the misregarders of it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Hee sayeth not, If wee reject, deny, or persecute the Gospel; but, if wee</hi> neglect.] Then, The neglect of the Doctrine of the Gospel, the careless receiving of it, the not studying to know it, is sufficient to draw down hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier judgements, than ever fell on the breakers of the Law; albeit a man bee not an Under-miner, or open Enemy to the Gospel.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Hee describeth the Gospel, to bee that Doctrine which Christ himself preached, and his Apostles from him.</hi> Then, wee are not bound to believe any more for Gospel, than that which is made clear unto us by his Apostles word. And the misregarding of other Doctrine, which is not conveyed so from him, falleth under the threatning.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>Hee marketh the Apostles certainty, of what they have delivered unto us, in that they were ear-witnesses of his Doctrine.</hi> Then, The more certainty the Apostles had from Christ of their Doctrine, the surer is the ground-work of our belief, and the greater is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt done to Christ in their Message, by unbelief.</p>
                  <q>

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Hee saith, God bare witness to the Apostles Doctrine, by signs and wonders.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. What the Apostles have spoken from Christ, they spake not alone, but God with them, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessed with them. 2. The proper use of Miracles, and extraordinary Gifts powred out in the Apostolick times, was to testifie, that the Apostles Doctrine was Divine Truth. Those, then, must bee lying wonders, which are alledged for confirming any Doctrine beside theirs.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The distribution of the gifts of the Holy Ghost, was according to his own will; not as possibly the Apostles would have carved, either to themselves, or others, in the nature of the gift, or measure of it.</hi> Then, The Apostles were so employed in the working of Miracles, as it was evident, even then, that not they, but God was the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of them, while hee was seen to follow his own will therein, and not mans carving, in distributing his gifts. And the more Gods over-ruling Will was seen in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles then, the more confirmation have wee of that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine now.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 5.</hi> For, unto the Angels hath hee not put in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection the World to come, whereof wee speak.</q>

                  <p n="2">2. <hi>It is called</hi> the World to come; <hi>because, albeit this change began with the work of Grace, before Christ came, yet it was nothing in comparison of the World i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="3">3. <hi>The World is put in subjection to Christ, that hee may dispose of it at his pleasure.</hi> Then, Christ is twice So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Lord of the World: once, as Creator; again, as Mediator, in his Manhead, to make all the creatures in heaven and earth serve, nill they, will they, to far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the work of full Redemption, which hee hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken.</p>

That which may bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up of Christ, partly by his word and doctrine, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by his miraculous works, and extraordinary gifts of the Spirit, powred out upon the Primitive Church, partly by his ordinary and powerful working upon the souls of his own, since that time, unto this day, humbling and comforting, changing and reforming, mens hearts and lives: I say, these evidences of his Power, do make a spiritual eye, in a manner, to see Jesus, the worker of these works, crowned with glory and honour.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Hee meeteth another doubt, arising from the abase<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Christ in his sufferings and death, to which hee answereth in the words of the Psalm: first, that it was fore-told in that same Psalm, that hee was to bee made, for a little, lower than the Angels; to wit, by suffering of death.</hi> Then, 1. The Cross of Christ is a ready stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling block for a carnal mind: else, what needed the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving of the scandal? 2. It is true indeed, Christ in his humiliation, was abased under the Angels, and emptied. 3. This abasement was but a little, and for a short time. 4. It was fore-told in the Psalm that speaketh of his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation. 5. If wee look to the Scripture fore-telling, wee shall not stumble at Christs Humiliation.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Hee giveth a farther answer, by shewing the end of Christs Suffering, to bee for our cause, in the favour of God to us, That hee should, by the Grace of God, taste Death, for every one of us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. Christs suffering was not for his own deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, but for ours; and therefore, should bee glorious in our eyes. 2. Every Believer, and Elect Soul, hath inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest in that death of his: and so every man bound to love him, and magnifie him for it, and to apply the fruit of it to himself. 3. This death was but a tasting of death, because hee continued but a short time under it: for, his short suffering was so precious, that hee could not bee holden by the Sorrows of Death, but Death, for a little, was sufficient; and therefore, should diminish no mans estimation of him. 4. It was by the Grace of God that his Death, for a short, should stand for our Eternal: and therefore, gracious and glorious should these his suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings bee esteemed by us.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 10.</hi> For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many Sons unto glory, to make the Captain of their Salvation perfect through sufferings.</q>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Another reason of Christs Suffering. This way of our saving by Christs Sufferings, made for the Glory of God, and our good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, When the reasons of Christs Death are seen, the scandal of his Cross ceaseth.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>There is a work to do here, a great many of</hi> Sons <hi>to bee brought to glory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. All the Elect, and saved Souls, are in the rank of Children. 2. Albeit they bee few in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the world, yet are they, many of them, all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. 3. There is not one of them all, who can go to Heaven, or Salvation, but by Christs leading and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>The Captain of their Salvation must bee made</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, <hi>through suffering.</hi> Then, 1. How perfect soever Christ be in himself, yet before his suffering hee lacked one thing, which his Office towards us, required; to wit, experimental suffering of such sorrows as his souldiers and followers are subject unto. 2. When his sufferings were ended, hee was perfectly fitted to comfort us, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hee found our sorrows in himself sometime.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Hee saith, It became God, for whom, and by whom, are all things, that the matter should bee so brought about.</hi> Then, 1. All things are for Gods Glory at the end: and so should the manner of our salvation bee also. 2. All things are by Gods Hand and Power brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout: and reason too, that hee dispose of the means of our salvation, as hee pleaseth. 3. This way became God most of any: It brought him greatest Glory, by the Shame, Sorrow, and Death, of one, to bring Glory, and Joy, and Life, to many.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 11.</hi> For both Hee that sanctifieth, and they who are sanctified, are all of one: For which cause hee is not ashamed to call them Brethren.</q>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>If any should further ask, how could hee die? or, how could Iustice accept him in our stead? Hee answereth, Because hee is one of our kind, and nature.</hi> Then, 1. There is a natural Band betwixt Christ and his Followers. They are of the same stock, of the same natural substance. 2. Christs natural Band with us, maketh him a direct entress to redeem us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Hee calleth Christ,</hi> him that sanctifieth; <hi>and the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers,</hi> they who are sanctified.]</p>
                  <p>Then, 1. The Band of Nature betwixt Christ and Men, is reckoned unto those onely who are sanctified; with none other will Christ reckon Kindred. 2. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they must study to Holiness, that would claim Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to Christ. 3. The sanctification which it behoveth us to have, must proceed from Christ: no holiness, until a man bee in him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Hee saith, Christ is not ashamed to call the Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> Brethren.] Then, 1. As Christ hath dimitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to our Nature, so also to the stiles of consanguinity with us. 2. Christ is as kindly affectioned to his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, as ever Brother was to another: hee will not misken his own, albeit unworthy. 3. That which may serve to our glory and comfort, Christ will think it no disgrace to himself.</p>

                     <hi>Vers. 12.</hi> Saying, I will declare Thy Name unto my Brethren: In the midst of the Church will I sing praise unto Thee.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hee proveth that hee calleth us Brethren, from</hi> Psal. 20. <hi>vers.</hi> 22. <hi>The Messias there, taketh upon him, to preach to men, and to praise the Father.</hi> Then, 1. With our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Christ took on also the Yoke of the Exercises of Religion. 2. Hee joyneth with us, in the Discharge of them. 3. Hee is first in the Exercise: not onely because hee discharged them in his own proper person; but also because still by his Spirit, where two, or three are gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together in his Name, hee is in the midst of them; moving, and moderating, the Spirits of his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectable Organs.</p>

                     <hi>Vers. 13.</hi> And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold, I, and the children which God hath given mee.</q>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The next proof is from</hi> Psal. 18. Vers. 2. <hi>Where Christ under the type of</hi> David, <hi>promiseth to beleeve in the Father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. Christ is one of the number of Beleevers, one of the Covenant of Grace, confederate by Faith: and therefore, hee behoved to be a man to this end. 2. Then have wee, in the sense of our unbeleef, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the soundness and strength of Christs beleeving, as well as of his other Perfections.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The third proof is from</hi> Isa. 8.18. <hi>Wherein Christ, under the type of the Prophet</hi> Isaiah, <hi>presenteth himself with his chosen Children, before the Father.</hi> Then, 1. Christ is our Father also, and wee his Children. 2. Wee are given to him of the Father. 3. Wee are
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:49391:120"/>
not presented before the Father, without our Mediatour Christ. 4. Christ, and wee his little ones, joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and separated from the world, are a pleasant sight, for the Father to behold.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 14.</hi> Forasmuch, then as the Children are parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of flesh and blood; Hee also Himself likewise took part of the same; that through death, Hee might destroy him that had the power of death; that is, the Devil.</q>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Hee giveth further reasons of his Incarnation. And first, hee behoved by death to destroy the Devil, that had the power of death: and so behoved to bee a Man, that hee might dye.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. Sinners without Christ, are under the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death, temporal and eternal. 2. Satan hath power of Death, as the Burrio hath power over the Pit and Gallows, at death to take them away to torment, who are not delivered from his power. 3. Christ hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed Satans power, and tyranny, in this point, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of all his Elect, and true Beleevers. 4. The way how Christ hath overcome Satan, is by his own death, ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soming his own. 5. For as death behoved to bee the way, it behoved also Christ to bee a mortal man, as well as God, that hee might dye.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Again hee saith, Christ took part of flesh and blood with the Children: that is, with the Elect given to him.</hi>] Then, 1. Love to the Elect, made the Son of God come down, and make himself a Man also. 2. Christ in his humane Nature, is as kindly a Man, as any of the Elect; having flesh, and blood, and bones as well as wee. His flesh and blood is not onely like to ours; but is a part of our substance; who is come of the same stock of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> as surely as ours: and not made either by Creation of nothing, or by trans-substantiation of some other things than our substance.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 15.</hi> And deliver them, who through fear of death, were all their life time subject to bondage.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Another fruit of Christs death, is the delivery of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, from the bondage of the fear of death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wherein they do lye before Beleef.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. There is a natural fear of Death, and the Devil, and Hell, rooted in all men, alwaies: albeit not as yet felt, yet easily wakened. 2. This fear putteth men in bondage, that they dare not meditate on Death, or Gods Judgement, or Hell, as deserved by themselves. 3. Christs death delivereth his Subjects from the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of this evil, and from the bondage of this fear also. 4. None but a Childe of Christ, can have solid and true courage against death: neither is there a free man in the world, except true Christians.</p>

                     <hi>Vers. 16.</hi> For verily, Hee took not on Him the nature of Angels, But Hee took on him the seed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Hee insisteth in the Doctrine of Christs Incarnation, because it is the ground of all our comfort; and secludeth the Angels from such an honour, as wee have thereby. The Son of God took on him the seed of</hi> Abraham, <hi>and not the nature of Angels, saith the Apostle.</hi> Then, 1. Christ hath his proper subsistance, and being in himself<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> before the Incarnation, even his own Divine Nature, with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal properties existing: For hee is the Son of God, the second person of the God-head, before hee took on our nature. 2. Hee chose to assume our nature, for our delivery, and not the Angels nature, for delivery of such as were fallen of their kind. 3. The nature that hee taketh on, is mans very nature; the seed of <hi>Abraham.</hi> 4. Hee preventeth the personal subsistance of our nature; hee assumeth the seed of <hi>Abraham.</hi> 5. Hee maketh an Union of our nature, with his Divine Nature. 6. The way of making the Union, is Assumption, or Taking of our nature unto his own, whereby remaining the same which hee was before; to wit, The Son of God, hee joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth our nature to himself; and becometh what hee was not before; to wit, The Son of Man. 7. Hee assumeth the seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that hee may be known to be no other, but the same Messias, which was promised by the Prophets, to the Fathers. 8. When hee hath assumed Mans Nature, to His own Divine Nature, Hee remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the same Hee that Hee was before, still one person. So Christ Jesus is the promised Messias; the second per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the God-head; very God from everlasting, and very Man since the conception of the Virgin <hi>Mary:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Incarnation, having onely his own Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in his person; but now since that time, having our Nature also, personally united with his Divine Nature, so to remain, both God and Man in one person, for our good, for ever.</p>

                        <hi>Vers. 17.</hi> Wherefore, in all things, it behoved Him to be made like unto His Brethren; that Hee might be a merciful and faithful High Priest, in things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to God; to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.</p>
                     <p>Hee concludeth, That Christ behoved to partake both of our nature and punishment, or misery, that wee might receive the more good of Him.</p>

They who imagine, and worship a Christ, not like to us in all these things, wherein the Scripture pronounceth him like unto us, do mistake the true Christ, and worship a false. 2. It is very necessary that wee conceive rightly of Christs person, seeing the Scripture doth press the knowledge thereof upon us, so particularly.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Hee sheweth the end of his conforming himself unto us, to be, That hee might be a faithful and merciful High Priest.</hi> Then, 1.

In this his Office, hee is faithful, and will neglect nothing, night nor day, that may help us. 3. In our slips, and over-sights, hee will bee merciful un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us. 4.

If hee command us in any thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or be to make covenant with us, or have controversie to debate with us, our High-Priest will answer for us. 3. If wee have any thing to do with God, to seek any good thing of him, or deprecate any evil, or to offer any Offering, of Praise, or Service, Christs Office stretcheth it self to all this, to do for us. 4. In special<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as our sins daily deserve, and provoke Gods anger<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so doth Christs Priest-hood pacifie Gods wrath, and work Reconciliation to us.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. There are two Evils, which attend the Children of God, to annoy them; to wit, Troubles, and Sin; or, Sin, and Misery. 2. Christ hath experience, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit not of Sin, in his own person; yet of temptation to sin, and of suffering of trouble.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Hee applieth the Comfort, expresly to the tempted.</hi> Then, 1. Men in trouble have need of comfort, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief; but men under temptation to sin, much more. 2.

                  <p>Then, like as if any man should have added or pared, chopped or changed, the Ordinances of Gods House, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, it had been an imputation, either unto God, of not sufficient directing his Church, or unto <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> and the Prophets, of unfaithful discharge of their duty in the Church of the Old Testament.

                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Hee preferreth Christ above</hi> Moses, <hi>as the Builder is above the House.</hi> Then, as no stone in the house, nor all the house together, is comparable in honour with the Builder of the house: So the honour and authority of no particular member of the Church, not of the whole Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church together, is comparable to the honour and authority of Christ.

                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. Whatsoever imployment a man get of God, in edifying of the Church, yet, in proper speech, hee is a part of the building, builded by another. 2. The ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of building the Church, belongeth to God alone properly. 3. The building of the Church, is a work re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring omnipotency in the builder: For, to make a Saint of a sinner, is as hard, as to make a man of the dust of the earth, or of nothing.</p>

                  <p>Then, as much difference betwixt Christs authority in the Church, and mens, how excellent soever; as betwixt the authority of the Master and the Servants. 2.

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>In the words of the</hi> Psalm 95. <hi>vers.</hi> 9. <hi>hee exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them, to beware of hardening their hearts in unbelief. The words of the Psalm are called here,</hi> The saying of the holy Ghost; <hi>and,</hi> of the God of <hi>Israel,</hi> 2 Sam. 23. 2, 3.</p>
                  <p>Then, 1. The authority of the Scripture is not of man, but of the Holy Ghost. 2. The Scriptures are no dumb letter, but the voice of the holy Ghost, who by them speaketh. 3. The Holy Ghost is God, the inspirer of the Prophets, that wrote the Scripture. 4. The Holy Ghost is a distinct person of the God-head, from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Son; exercising the proper actions of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; inspiring the Prophets, inditing the Scriptures, and speaking to the Church.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. That the evil of sin is not seen, till the consequences thereof be seen, what provocation it giveth to God, and what wrath it draweth down on the sinner. 2. It is safest, to take a view of our danger, by any sin, in the person of others, who have fallen in the like, and have been pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished. 3. The sins that our Predecessors have been given unto, wee should, most carefully, watch against. 4. That Gods Bounty, Patience, and Means of Grace, the longer they be abused, aggravateth sin the more.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 10.</hi> Wherefore, I was grieved with that Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and said, They do alway erre in their hearts; and they have not known My Waies.</q>

                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. Mis-beleeving and disobeying of the Word preached, is not reckoned with God, for simple ignorance of the mind; but for a wilful ignorance, and erring of the heart, which is worse. For, the ignorance of the mind simply, is, <hi>I know not,</hi> but the errour of the heart, is, <hi>I will not know, I care not, I desire not, I love not to know, nor obey.</hi> And such is the ignorance of those who have the Means of Knowledge, and Reformation, and yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in their sins. 2. Such obstinate ignorance, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful disobedience provoketh God to cast away the Sinner, and not to deal any more with him.</p>

                     <hi>For their Doom, God debarreth them from His Rest: That is, from all the Comforts of His Fellowship, and giveth them Torment, in stead of Rest.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. Obstinate Disobedients of the Voice of the Gospel, lye near hand final off-cutting. 2. If God give over a man, to such hardness of heart, as still to work contrary to the light of Gods Word, Hee hath, apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly denounced, and sworn, to condemn and seclude from Heaven, such a Soul. 3. It is onely such obstinate ones, as go on, hardening their heart against Admonitions of the Word, that God hath sworn to debar.

                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. Mis-beleef is the main Root of Apostacy.
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:49391:122"/>
As Beleef draweth us to an Union with God, so mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleef maketh a Separation. 2. Mis-beleef is a special part of the hearts wickedness, bewraying the enmity which naturally wee have against God, as much as any ill: For, Mis-beleef denyeth to God the Honour of Truth, Mercy, and Goodness, and importeth Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in the contrary. 3. Mis-beleef is an ill in the heart, making the heart yet worse and worse, where it is, and barring forth all the Remedies which might come by Faith to cure the heart.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Hee warneth to take heed, lest there be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> such an heart in any of them, at any time.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. Mis-beleef is a subtil and deceitful sin, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving colours, and pretences, a number, to hide it; and must bee watched over, lest it deceive, and getting strength, overcome. 2. The Watch must bee constant, at all occasions, lest this ill get advantage, when wee are careless, and unattentive, at any time. 3. Watch must bee kept, as over our selves, so also over others: lest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others mis-beleef not being marked, draw us in the same snare with them.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. Beleeving is a drawing near to the Living God, and staying with him. 2. The loss that Mis-beleef bringeth, should scare us from so fearful a sin. 3. Depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the true Christian Religion, is a departing from the Living God, whatsoever the Apostate, or his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers do conceive: for God is not, where Truth is not.</p>

                     <hi>Vers. 13.</hi> But exhort one another, daily, while it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, To day; lest any of you bee hardened, through the deceitfulness of sin.</q>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Hee prescribeth a Remedy, to prevent this ill: to wit, That</hi> they exhort one another, daily, while it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, To day. <hi>That is, Beside the publick Exhortation from their Preachers, that every one of them, mutually, confer, and stir up one another by speeches that make for decy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phring the deceitfulness of Sin, or preventing hardness of heart, or confirming one another in the Truth of Religion, and constant profession thereof.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. Private Christians not onely may, but should keep Christian communion amongst themselves, and mutually exhort and stir up one another. 2. This is a necessary mean of preserving people from Defection. 3. And a duty daily to bee discharged, while it is to day: that is, as oft, and as long as God giveth present occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and opportunity for it; lest a scattering come.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The inconvenience that may follow, if this be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, is,</hi> Lest any of you be hardened, through the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulness of sin.</p>
                  <p>Then, 1. There is none, even the strongest of the Flock, but they have need of this mutual help of other private Christians. 2. Neither is there any so base, or contemptible, but the care of their standing in the Faith, and of their safety, belongeth to all. 3. Sin hath many waies, and colours, whereby it may beguile a man: and therefore, wee have need of more Eyes than our own, and more Observers. 4. If it be not timeously discovered, it will draw on hardness of heart, so as a man will grow senseless of it, confirmed in the habit of it, and loath to quit it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>In the former verse, hee warneth them, to beware of Apostasie in Religion: and, in this verse, That they take course, that they be not hardened in any sin in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, The ready way to draw on Defection in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, is Defection from a godly Conversation. And the way to prevent Defection in Religion, is to study to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness of Conversation.</p>

                     <p>To stir them up to Perseverance, hee layeth a necessity of holding fast gripe of the Principles of Christian Religion, whereby they were perswaded to become Christians: because onely so, fellowship with Christ is gotten.

The Man that renounceth the Grounds of the Gospel, and persevereth not, was never partaker of Christ. 3.

                     <p>HEE presseth the use of the former Doctrine, saying in substance, Therefore, be feared, to be debarred from Gods Rest, <hi>Vers.</hi> 1. For wee have the offer of it, as well as they; only here are the odds, They beleeved not, <hi>Vers.</hi> 2. But wee who do beleeve, enter into a Rest, as <hi>Davids</hi> words import. For there are three Rests in the Scripture, which may be called Gods Rest. 1. Gods Rest upon the first Sabbath. 2. The Rest of <hi>Canaan,</hi> ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical. 3. The Spiritual and true Rest of Gods People,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:49391:122"/>
in Christs Kingdome, which is a deliverance, and ceasing from Sin, and Misery. <hi>David</hi> doth not mean of the Rest of the Sabbath, in his threatning; because, albeit the Work of Creation was finished in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the World, and that Rest come and gone; yet <hi>David</hi> speaketh of another Rest after that, in the word of Threatning, Vers. 3. That Gods Rest was past at the founding of the World, is plain from <hi>Moses</hi> words, Vers. 4. After which Rest, <hi>David</hi> speaketh here of another Rest, Vers. 5 Wherein seeing Unbeleevers entred not, Beleevers must enter, Vers. 6. Again, <hi>David</hi> meaneth not of the Rest of <hi>Canaan:</hi> For, after they had a long time dwelt in <hi>Canaan, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> yet setteth them a Day, during which they might enter into Gods Rest, Vers. 7. For, if the Rest of <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> which <hi>Iesus,</hi> or <hi>Ioshuah,</hi> gave unto them, had been this true Rest, then <hi>David</hi> would not have spoken of another Rest after that, Vers. 8. But speak he doth. Therefore, there is a Rest besides these, even that Spiritual Rest, proper to Gods people, Vers. 9. I call this a Rest; because, when Gods People cease to do ther own works, and will, it is like Gods Rest, Vers. 10. Therefore, let us beware to bee debarred from this Rest, by Unbeleef, as they were, Vers. 11. For Gods Word is as effectual now, as ever it was, to discover the lurking Sins of the heart, howsoever men would cloak them, Vers. 12. And God, with whom wee have to do, seeth us throughly, Vers. 13. But, rather, seeing wee have so great encouragement, to get entry through Jesus Christ, so merciful and pittiful an High-Priest, Vers. 14, 15. Let us bee stedfast in our faith, and come, confidently, to get Gods Grace, to help us through all Difficulties in the way to that full Rest, Vers. 16.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Therefore let us fear lest any of you seem to come</hi> short <hi>of it. The similitude is borrowed from the prize of a Race.</hi> Then, 1 A Race must bee run, erre wee come to our full rest. 2 The constant Runner to the end, getteth rest from sin and misery, and a quiet possession of Happiness at the Races end. 3 The Apostate, and hee who by misbeleef breaketh off his Course, and runneth not on, as may bee, commeth short, and attaineth not unto it. 4 The Apostasy of some, and possibility of Apostasy of more Professors, should not weaken any mans Faith; but rather terrify him from misbeleef. 5 There is a right kinde of fear of perishing, to wit, such as hindereth not as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance of faith; but rather serveth to guard it, and spur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth on a man to perseverance. 6 Wee must not only fear, by misbeleeing to come short; but to seem, or give a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny appearance of comming short.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 2.</hi> For unto us was the Gospel Preached, as well as unto them; but, the Word preached, did not profit them, nor being mixed with Faith in them that heard it:</q>
                  <p n="1">1 <hi>To make the example the more to urge them, hee saith, The Gospel was Preached to them whom God debarred, for misbeleef from his Rest.</hi> Then, 1 The Gospel was Preached in the Wilderness for substance of Truth, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit not in such fulnesse of Doctrine, and clearnesse of Truth, as now.

                  <p n="2">2 <hi>The cause of their debarring, is,</hi> The Word was not mixed with Faith in them; <hi>and so profited them not.</hi>] Then, 1 As a Medicinal Drink must have the true In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients mixed with it; so must the Word have Faith mixed with it; joyning it self with all the parts of the Truth, closely. 2 Faith can wall with nothing, nor bee mixed with any Truth, but the Word: and the word will not joyn, nor wall, nor mix, with Conceits, Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Presumption, but with Faith: that is, it will bee received, not as a Conjecture, or possible Truth; but for Divine, and infallible Truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> else it profiteth not. 3 Hearers of the Word may blame their mis-beleef, if they get not profit. 4 Albeit a man get light by the Word, and some tasting of temporary Joy, and Honour, and Riches also, by professing or preaching of it, yet hee receiveth not profit, except hee get entry into Gods Rest thereby: for all these turn to Conviction.</p>

                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Another property of the Word: It is</hi> sharper than any two-edged sword, <hi>because it peirceth speedily through a brazen Brow, and dissembling countenance, and a lying mouth, and thrusteth it self without suffering resistance, into the conscience of the most obstinate, with a secret blow, and maketh him guilty within his own breast.</hi>

                  <p n="5">5. Peircing even to the dividing asunder of the Soul and the Spirit: <hi>That is, those most secret devices and plots of the Mind, or Spirit, and those closest affections of the Heart or Soul towards any forbidden evil, this word will finde out: yea, it can divide asunder the Soul and the Spirit, the Heart and the Mind, and tell the man how his Soul or Heart cleaveth to the sin, and how his Mind plotteth pretences to hide the evil of it from himself and others, even in those sins which have not broken forth, but lye as deep in the mind as the marrow in the bones. And it can put difference betwixt the purposes of the heart and the thoughts, how to compass the design, and how to hide the convoy.

                     <hi>To clear the power of the Word, hee bringeth in the property of God, whose word it is, and setteth up the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners secret thought, in the sight of the All-seeing God, with whom hee hath to do.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. God is the Party with whom the hearer of the Word hath to do, and hath his reckoning to make, and not the Preacher. 2. God joyneth with his Word, and giveth it that searching and discovering, and peircing virtue. 3. Gods omniscience, and all-seeing sight, should make us look to our inward disposition; so shall this, and

other like Exhortations, and Threatnings, have better effect and fruit in us.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 14.</hi> Seeing, then, that wee have a great High Priest, that is passed into the Heavens, Iesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast our Profession.</q>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Hee giveth them a direction for entring into their rest</hi>; To hold fast their Profession: <hi>that is, in faith and love to avow the Doctrine of Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, Hee that would enter into rest, must bee sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast, in maintaining, and avowing the true Religion of Christ. 2. Hee who quitteth the profession of the Truth of Christ, taketh courses to cut off himself from Gods rest. For, if wee deny Christ, hee will deny us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Hee commandeth,</hi> To hold fast our Profession. Then, 1. God will not be pleased with backsliding, or coldness, or indifferency in matters of Religion, because this is not, <hi>to hold it fast</hi>; but to take a loose hold, which is the ready way to defection. 2. There is danger, lest our adversaries pull the Truth from us. 3. The more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger wee fore-see, the more strongly must wee hold the Truth.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>The encouragement which hee giveth to hold fast, is,</hi> Wee have Christ, a great High Priest, &amp;c. Then, 1. As wee have need of threatning, to drive us to enter into Gods Rest; So have wee need of incouragements to draw us thereunto. 2. All our encouragement, is from the help which wee shall have in Christ, and that is sufficient. 3. Christ is alwaies for us in his Office, albeit wee do not alwaies feel him sensibly in us.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Hee calleth Christ,</hi> A great High Priest; <hi>to put dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt the typical High Priest, and him in whom the Truth of the Priesthood is found.</hi> Then, What the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical High Priest did in shew for the people, that the great High Priest doth in substance for us: That is, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileth us to God perfectly, blesseth us with all bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings solidly, and intercedeth for us perpetually.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Hee affirmeth of Christ, that hee is passed into the Heavens; to wit, in regard of his Manhe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. Christs corporal presence is in Heaven onely, and not on Earth, from whence hee is passed. 2. Christs corporal presence in Heaven, and absence from us in that respect, hindereth not our right unto him, and spiritual having, or possessing of him, 3. Yea, it is our encouragement, to seek entry into Heaven, that hee is there before us.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>Hee calleth him Iesus, the Son of God, to lead us through his humanity unto his Godhead.</hi> Then, no rest on the Mediator, till wee go to the rock of his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, where is strength, and satisfaction to faith.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 15.</hi> For wee have not an High Priest which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be touched with the feeling of our infirmities: But was, in all points, tempted like as wee are; yet without sin.</q>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Another encouragement is from the merciful and compassionate disposition of our High Priest, whose na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and office, and experience, maketh him, that hee cannot be but touched with our infirmities, both sinful, and sinless infirmities, of body, estate, or mind.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. Hee presupposeth, that the faithful are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to infirmities, both of sin, and misery; and by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son thereof, to discouragements, and dashing of their spirit. 2. Christ doth pitty the infirmities of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, their poverty, banishment, sickness, grief<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea, their sinful passions, and perturbations, and short comming in holy duties; hee is compassionate in all these. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may our Faith gather strength from his pitty, to bear these the better; and strive against our sinfulness with the greater courage. And, in the sense of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, wee should not stand back from Christ; but go to him the rather, as to a compassionate physician, who can, and will help us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>To give us assurance of his compassion, hee sheweth us, that hee was, in all points tempted like as wee are; yet without sin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. Christ hath experience of all tryals where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in any of his servants can fall; of poverty, contempt of the world, of being forsaken by friends, of exile, impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment, hunger, nakedness, watching, weariness, pain of body, dashing of mind, heaviness of hearts, dolour, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish, and perplexity of Spirit; yea, of desertion to sense; yea, of the wrath and curse of God; the feeling whereof may justly bee called <hi>A descending to Hell</hi>; Christ in his own experience knoweth what all such exercises are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. These his experiences, and sufferings, are pawns to us of his compassion on us in such cases; so that wee may as certainly beleeve the compassion, as the passion.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Hee maketh exception of sin, whereof hee was free; but not of his being tempted to sin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. Albeit our Lord was free from committing sin, yet hee was not free from being tempted to sin: and so can pitty our weakness, when wee are overcome of it. 2. His being free of sin, is our comfort against sin; For, if our Mediatour had been defiled with sin, hee could not have washed us: But now hee is able to justifie us, and set us free of sin also.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 16.</hi> Let us, therefore, come boldly unto the Throne of Grace, that wee may obtain Mercy, and finde Grace, to help in time of need.</q>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>From these encouragements, hee draweth another di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, To come boldly to God in prayer, for every thing whereof wee stand in need.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, the Apostle alloweth unto the beleever, 1. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain perswasion of the acceptation of his person: hee bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth him <hi>Come boldly.</hi> 2. Hee alloweth certain perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of the granting of his prayers, in the matter, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, of Grace and Mercy, which includeth the remission of sins.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 <hi>The Throne of Grace, or the Mercy-Seat, was above the Ark, within the Sanctuary, and represented God in Christ reconciled to his people, gracious and merciful un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. To this hee alludeth, and by this means teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the substance of that typical Mercy Seat, is to bee found in Christ under the Gospel. In him God is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to bee found on his Throne of Grace. 2. That the Veil of the Ceremonial Sanctuary, is rent in Christs suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, and an open door made unto the holiest, unto e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Beleever, and not for the Highest alone, to enter in. 3. That God layeth aside his terrour and rigour of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, when his own come to him in Christ, and offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth access unto the Throne of Grace, unto them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Hee will have us comming</hi> with boldness, <hi>to obtain mercy; including himself with the faithful, and joyning the meanest of the faithful, to whom hee writeth, in the same priviledge with himself.</hi> Then, 1. Free liberty to expound all our mind to God, as the word importeth, without employing the mediation of Saint or Angel, or any beside Christ, is one of the priviledges of Christian Religion. 2. This priviledge is common to the meanest of the faithful, with the chiefest Apostles. 3. There is mercy to bee had for such as come for removing of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry sin, and remedy of every misery.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Hee setteth before them the hope of Grace to help in time of need.</hi> Importing hereby, 1. That albeit for the present, possibly wee bee not touched with the sense of wants, straights, and difficulties; yet wee are to expect, that time of need will come. 2. That it is good to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see this, and make provision in the time of grace, in this acceptable day, while God is on his Throne of Grace. 3. That our prayers, if they get not an answer presently, yet shall they get an answer in the time of need. When our need commeth, then shall our help come also.</p>

                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 1.</hi> For, every High-Priest taken from amongst men, is ordained for men in things pertaining to God; that hee may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins.</q>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>HEE setteth down the properties of the High-Priest, that hee might shew the truth of them in Christ. First, the peoples comfort did require, that the High-Priest should bee a man.</hi> So is Christ a Man, cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen out from amongst men. The Flower of all the Flock. Therefore wee may come the more homely to Him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The High-Priest was ordained for men; that is, was appointed to imploy all his Office for mens good.</hi> So doth Christ: therefore may wee expect that hee will do for us, as Mediatour, what hee can: and that is all that wee need.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>The High-Priests Office reached to all things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to God; to communicate Gods will unto the people, and to lay before God the peoples Necessities.</hi> So doth Christs Office to all the business betwixt God and us, for working in us Repentance, and Amendment; and making our persons, and service, acceptable to God; and therefore, in nothing may wee pass by Him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>In special, the Priest behoved to offer Gifts and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices for sin, for removing of wrath, and obtaining of Favour</hi>: So hath Christ done, and fulfilled the type in this point also: therefore by Him must wee obtain the good which wee crave, and have the evil removed which wee fear.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 2.</hi> Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way, for that Hee Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self also is compassed with infirmity.</q>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Hee goeth on in the Comparison: The typical High-Priest behoved to be compassionate on the Sinner</hi>: So in truth is Christ, even as the misery requireth, proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, as the word importeth.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Hee maketh two sorts of Sinners, Ignorants, and Transgressours.</hi> Then, Though there bee difference of sinners, yet no sinner, that seeketh to Christ, is secluded from His Compassion.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Followeth a difference, serving to advance Christ, above the typical Priest. The High-Priest typical, was compassed with infirmities, not onely sinless infirmities, but sinful also; and so behoved to pitty others. Christ, though not compassed with sinful infirmities, but sinless one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet doth pitty Sinners of all sorts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, Look what compassion one sinner might expect of another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as much may wee expect of our sinless Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 3.</hi> And by reason hereof, hee ought as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Another difference. The typical Priest had need of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of his own sins, and the benefit of the true Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice: But Christ, because without sin, offered Sacrifice onely for our sins, and not for His own.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, All the Benefit of Christs Sacrifice, commeth unto us.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 4.</hi> And no man taketh this honour unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, but hee that is called of God, as was <hi>Aaron.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hee proceedeth in the Comparison. The typical Priest entred by authority to his Calling, and was honoured by his Calling: So entred Christ.</hi> No man, <hi>saith hee,</hi> taketh this honour unto himself, but Hee that is called as was <hi>Aaron.</hi> Then, 1. It is an honour to bee called to an Office in the House of God. 2. The Calling is <hi>null,</hi> if it have not God for the Author, and Caller. 3. If a man take an office, not appointed of God, or intrude him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self into an Office, without a lawful Calling, it is no kind of honour unto him.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 5.</hi> So also, Christ glorified not Himself, to bee made an High-Priest: But hee that said unto Him, Thou art My Son, to day have I begotten Thee.</q>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Our Lord is commended, for not glorifying himself, by intrusion in his Office.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. Such as pretend to bee Christs Servants, must beware to intrude themselves into any Office, and must attend, as Christ did, Gods Calling, to Gods Employment. 2. Hee that usurpeth a Calling, doth glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie himself, and taketh the honour that is not given him: for which hee must give a Reckoning.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Thou art My Son, this day have I begotten Thee, <hi>doth import, by the Apostles alledging, not onely Christs God-head, and Declaration to be Gods Son; but also the Declaration of him, To be High-Priest in his Man-head; taken out from amongst men.</hi> So deep are the Consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Scripture, when the Spirit bringeth forth his own Mind from it.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 6.</hi> As hee saith also in another place, Thou art a Priest for ever, after the Order of <hi>Melchisedec.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Hee alledgeth another place, more clear.</hi>

                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 7.</hi> Who in the daies of his flesh, when hee had offered up Prayers, and Supplications, with strong Crying, and Tears, unto him that was able to save him from Death; and was heard, in that hee feared.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Having proved Christs Office, hee sheweth his Exercise of it, in offering for our sins a more precious Oblation than the typical: Even himself, with Tears, to Death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In these words, Then, Christ is pointed out unto us.</hi> 1. An High-Priest, taken from amongst men: a very true Man of our substance; Flesh, of our flesh. 2. A Man subject to the sinless infirmities of our nature, as Grief, Fear, Mourning, Death. 3. Having a set-time, during which hee was to bear these our infirmities, in the daies of his flesh. 4. Exercising his Priestly Office in these his daies, and offering his precious Tears, and Cryes, yea, his life, for us. 5. One, who howsoever Fear was upon his holy Nature, yet knew hee should bee delivered from death. 6. Who, as a man, in confidence of delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, made prayers to the Father. 7. Whose prayers are not refused, but accepted, and heard on our behalf. 8. And, that these his sufferings were ended with the daies of his humiliation.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>These Acts of Fear, and Tears, &amp;c. are the proper Acts of his humane nature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. As the Divine Nature had its own Acts pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to it self, so had the humane Nature acts proper to it self also; and some acts were common to both the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: So of Christs acts, some are Divine, some Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane; some are both Divine and Humane. 2. As Man, hee was unable to bear our burthen, or to help himself, and therefore behoved to have the help of the God-head. 3. Albeit hee was God in his own person, yet as Man, hee behoved to take our room and place,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:49391:124"/>
and pray for assistance, both as surety for us, and teacher of us: To give us example how to behave our selves in straights.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Hee feared death, and offered Prayers and Tears, and strong cries: Because not onely death temporal presented it self before him; but, which was much more, the curse of the Law, the Fathers wrath for sin duly deserved by us, was set in a Cup to his head, which should have swallowed him up for ever, if hee had not, by the worthiness of his person overcome it, and turned the eternal wrath and curse due unto us, into a temporal equivalent to himself.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. The sense of Gods wrath, whom will it not terrifie since it wrought so on Christ? And Nature can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not chuse but fear, when sense feeleth wrath. 2. Felt wrath seemeth to threaten yet more, and worse: and therefore, beside feeling, doth breed yet further fear. 3. The curse of God due to our sins, virtually implying the deserved pains of Hell, is more terrible than can bee told, and such as the Creature cannot chuse but fear and abhor. 4. Christs sufferings were no phantasie, but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry earnest, vehement, and terrible. 5. No weapon, nor Buckler against wrath, but flying to God by supplication, and crying, and tears.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Hee prayed to him that was able to save him, and was heard.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. Albeit sense of wrath seeth no out-gate; but black fears are alwaies before it; yet Faith looking to Gods omnipotency, seeth an out-gate. 2. Christs prayers in our behalf, receive no repulse, but are heard. 3. Christ both died, and was saved from death also, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it could not keep Dominion over him. So shall wee bee saved from death though wee die.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 8.</hi> Though hee were a Son, yet learned hee obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience by the things which hee suffered.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hee removeth the scandal of his Cross, by shewing the necessity and use thereof.</hi> Albeit hee was the Son, yet hee learned obedience by those things which hee suffered.</p>
                  <p>Then, 1. In the time of Christs deepest humiliation, the union betwixt his God-head and Man-head was not loosed, hee remained the Son of God still. 2. The excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of his person exempted him not from suffering, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving once taken on our debt. 3. Christ knew what suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering was, before hee suffered: but hee knew not by experience till hee actually suffered. 4. Christs holy life was a part of his obedience to the Father: but his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in suffering for our sins, was obedience in an high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er degree. 5. To obey God by way of action, is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon lesson to every holy creature: but, that a sinless and holy person, should suffer for sin, was a new lesson pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to Christ, a practick which never passed but in Christs person onely.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 9.</hi> And being made perfect, hee became the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him.</q>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The suffering of Christ is called his Perfection.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. Christ though perfect in his person, yet hee wanted something to make him perfect in his Office till hee suffered: for hee could not satisfie the Fathers justice till hee suffered; nor yet could hee have fellow-feeling from experience, of the miseries of his members. 2. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter suffering, Christ lacketh nothing that may pacifie God, or comfort and save sinners.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The fruit followeth, Being perfected, hee is become the Author of salvation to all that obey him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. The proper cause of our salvation is to bee sought in Christ, perfected by suffering: not in any one part of his holiness, or obedience in doing, or any part of his suffering; but in him perfected by his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, even to the death of the Cross. Wee may take comfort from, and make use of his holy conception, life, and several virtues: but wee must remember that his accomplished obedience, in doing, and suffering, is our ransome, joyntly considered: and not any particular act looked on alone. 2. None should stumble at Christs sufferings, which perfected him in his Office, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise perfected our ransome to the Father. 3. Christ felt the bitterness of his own sufferings himself: but wee got the sweet fruit thereof; even eternal life. 4. Onely they who obey Christ, can claim Title to the purchase of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life by him. Now these are they who obey him, who in uprightness of heart beleeve in his promises, and aim to draw strength out of him for new obedience.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 10.</hi> Called of God an High-Priest, after the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>Melchisedec.</hi>

                     <hi>Hee proveth that Christ is Author of eternal salvation to his Followers, from the nature of his Priesthood, which is eternal; not after</hi> Aarons <hi>Order, but</hi> Melchisedec's.</p>
                  <p>Then the nature of Christs Priesthood after <hi>Melchise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dec's</hi> order, and the Fathers authorizing him in the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, is the evidence of our eternal salvation to bee had by him with the Fathers approbation.</p>

                     <hi>Vers. 11.</hi> Of whom wee have many things to say, and hard to bee uttered, seeing yee are dull of hearing.</q>
                  <p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. Even the Children of God are not free of this disease, of slowness to conceive spiritual things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right. 2. The incapacity of Auditors will breed even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the best Preachers, difficulty of expressing their mind. 3. Preachers should rebuke the dulness of people, to stir them up the more.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 12.</hi> For when for the time yee ought to bee Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, yee have need that one teach you again which bee the first Principles of the Oracles of God; and are become such as have need of Milk, and not of strong meat.</q>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Hee maketh their fault the more, because by reason of time, they ought to have been Teachers: that is, both well grounded themselves, and labouring to inform others.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. As wee have longer time to learn, so should wee make more progress in knowledge. 2. As wee are rooted in knowledge our selves, so ought wee to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate our knowledge, and inform others.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Hee calleth the Catechizing of the Ignorant, the</hi> Teaching the first Principles of the Oracles of God; <hi>and compareth it to the giving of Milk.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. Catechizing of the rude and ignorant, is the first thing must bee done, for making sound Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians. 2. There is an order to be kept in bringing men unto knowledge: The first principles, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nd fundamental Doctrines must first be taught. 3. Nothing is to bee taught for grounding men in Religion, but Gods Oracles; that which is in Gods word onely. 4. The manner of teaching the Principles of Religion, should bee easie and plain, as Milk for Children.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 13.</hi> For every one that useth Milk, is unskilful in the Word of Righteousness. For hee is a Babe.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hee proveth them to bee rude in knowledge, by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of one weak in knowledge, whom hee calleth a Babe, using Milk, and unskilful in the</hi> Word of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness: <hi>so called, because how to be righteous is the sum of the Doctrine of it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. There are degrees of knowledge in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity: Some are weak, like Babes; some more instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and of full age. 2. All knowledge in Christianity, is to bee reckoned by acquaintance with the Scripture, and skill therein: Not by humane learning.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 14.</hi> But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age; even those who by reason of use, have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.</q>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Hee describeth the well-instructed Christian, by his meat, and exercised senses. The meat that hee is fit for, is strong meat: that is, more profound Doctrine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. All the Scripture, and Doctrine from it, is either Milk, or stronger meat; but whether this, or that, yet alwaies it is food, fit for nourishment of mens souls. 2. Discretion must bee used by Teachers, to fit their

                  <p n="2">2. <hi>For the exercise of his senses, or wits, to discern good or evil, hee hath it by use, habit, and frequent acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself with Scripture.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. The use of the Scripture, and knowledge gotten thereby, is to discern by it, what is good, what is evil; what is truth, what is errour; what is right, what is wrong. 2. Though Scripture bee the Rule, yet not every one can take it up, or make right application of the Rule, to the point in hand. 3. To get a mans wits exercised, requireth frequent use of, and acquaintance with the Scripture. And without this haunting our mind in the Scriptures, and observing the Lords counsel there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, a man cannot bee able, albeit hee were versed in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane writs, to discern false Doctrine from true.</p>

                  <head>The Doctrine of Chap. VI.</head>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 1.</hi> Therefore, leaving the Principles of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Christ, let us go on, unto Perfection; not lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing again the foundation of Repentance from dead works, and of Faith towards God.</q>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>FRom the reproof of their dulness, hee draweth an Exhortation, to amend their pace, and go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</hi> Which teacheth us, that the conscience of our by-gone slips, and sloathfulness, should bee a sharp spur, to drive us to a swifter pace; for overtaking of our Task.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Hee calleth</hi> the Principles of Religion, the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the Doctrine of Christ.</p>
                  <p>Then, 1. The Doctrine of Christ is the summe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Hee that hath learned Christ well, hath learned all. 2. Nothing to be taught in Christs house, but his doctrine, which commeth from him, and tendeth to him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Hee leaveth the Principles, and goeth on to perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi> Then, 1. There are two parts of Christian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine: one, of the Principles of Religion, another, of the perfection thereof. 2. The Principles must first bee learned, and the foundation laid. 3. When people have learned the Principles, their Teachers must advance them further, towards perfection.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Hee saith, hee will not lay again the foundation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> presupposing it is so laid, as it needeth not to be laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. Or, if they make Apostacy after once laying, cannot be laid the second time.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, The grounds of Religion must be so solidly learned, as they may well be bettered afterwards, by addition of further knowledge, but never raised again: and must be so soundly beleeved, as they never be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced again.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Hee reckoneth a number of fundamental points of Doctrine: and, first,</hi> of repentance from dead works: <hi>so hee calleth our works before conversion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. It is a main point of the Catechism, to beleeve that all our works before repentance, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, are but dead works: that is, sins making us li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to death. 2. If repentance bee not learned from these works, the rest of the building wanteth so much of the foundation.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>In joyning the Doctrine of Faith, as the next point, hee giveth us to understand,</hi> That it is as necessary a ground of Religion, to teach a penitent to beleeve in God, as to teach the beleever to repent.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 2.</hi> Of the Doctrine of Baptisms, and, of laying on of hands, and, of resurrection of the dead, and, of eternal judgement.</q>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The Doctrine of Baptisms, in the plural number, hee maketh a third fundamental Doctrine: and so maketh it necessary,</hi> That the significations of Baptisme be taught, that the people may learn to put difference betwixt out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Baptism by the Minister, which an hypocrite may have, and the inward Baptism by the Spirit, which Christ bestoweth upon his own Elect: and, that they be instructed in the nature of this Sacrament, and the signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication thereof: yea, and of the Baptism of suffering af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction for the Gospel, whereunto the outward Sacrament of Baptism obligeth.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The fourth fundamental point of the Doctrine of the Catechism, hee maketh the Doctrine of the laying on of hands. Now, hands were in a special manner imposed: First, in the bestowing of spiritual and miraculous gifts, for the confirmation of new converts in the primitive Church,</hi> Act. 8.7.18. <hi>Which endured until the Christian Religion was sufficiently confirmed unto the world to bee divine. Next, imposition of hands was used in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Office-bearers in the Church, both extraordinary, and ordinary,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.14 <hi>and</hi> Chap. 5.22. Acts 6.6.</p>
                  <p>Then, in the Apostles estimation, it is necessary for grounding of people in Religion, that they be instructed, not onely how the Lord founded the Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and confirmed it by extraordinary gifts of the holy Spirit, in the Primitive Church: But also what Offices, and Office-bearers hee hath ordained for ordinary edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and ruling, and maintaining of his Church, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the end of the world, that they may acknowledge such as are sent of God, and submit themselves unto them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>The Doctrine of Resurrection of the dead, hee maketh the fift point of the Catechism: and of the last judgement, the sixt. Under which sixt, the summe of Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion may be comprized, and in this order wherein they are set down, may be best learned, beleeved, and made use of.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>By this manner of speech,</hi> if God permit, <hi>hee teacheth us,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. That a Preachers indeavour to instruct a people, can have no success, except God make way unto him, and concur with him. 2. That hee who is busied in the most necessary part of Gods service, suppose it were in writing Scripture, or in ordinary preaching, and writing; must do it with submission to God, to be stopped in the midst
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:49391:125"/>
of his work, and cut short; yea, and that in the midst of a meditated speech, if it so please God.</p>

                        <hi>Vers. 4.</hi> For, it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost,</p>

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Minding to stir them up to make progress in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, hee setteth before them the danger of Apostasie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. Hee presupposeth, except they study to make progress, they shall go backwards: and that going back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, tendeth to Apostacy: and that voluntary, and compleat Apostacy from known Truth, doth harden the heart from repentance, and cutteth off a man from mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. 2. Hee accounteth our natural security so great, that there is need of most fearful threatnings, to awake us out of it. 3. That the onely way to be freed from Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, is to be aiming at a progress.</p>
                  <p>Next observe, 1. <hi>That hee doth not speak here of every sin against knowledge, albeit indeed those be fearful and dangerous; but of Apostacy from Religion, and the Doctrine of Christ.</hi> 2. <hi>Not of the Apostacy of Ignorants, who never were informed in the matter of Religion, but lightly came, and lightly went away; (albeit the shame done to Christ by them, is great and grievous:) but, of such who after illumination, and feeling somewhat of the power of the truth, doe revolt.</hi> 3 <hi>He speaketh not here of Apostacy of infirmity, for fear, in fit of a passion, or hasty passage of ones life: But, of a voluntary, and deliberate falling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way after clear conviction of the truth, This is that sin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Holy Ghost which here hee speaketh of.</hi> 4 <hi>Hee doth not presuppose here, that an elect childe of God, and renewed, may fall into this sin: But, that a Professor, and some in the visible Church, may fall away and dye in this sin. (Now, a Professor may bee endued with many gifts, and yet be a temporizer, and remain unrenewed inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and so may possibly fall into this ill) And therefore eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Professor should be the more circumspect, because of the possibility of some mens Apostasie, and the more diligent to attain to that faith which purifieth the heart, and worketh by love, which faileth not.</hi> 5 <hi>In telling what is the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of a Professors Apostasie, the Apostle mindeth not to weaken any mans faith, or discourage him from progresse making: But, by the contrary, his intention is, that men strengthen themselves so much the more in the Faith. And therefore such as have felt no more in their own estimation, but these tastings, should be so far from discouragement, and fainting, that rather they must look to a necessity laid upon them, to make progress in Faith, and the fruits there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and to draw near to God, who can preserve them from falling away.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But because some do trouble themselves, and other some do harden themselves in errour, by this place (as our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended brevity will suffer) let us study to give some light to both. Compare this place with</hi> vers. 9, 10, <hi>&amp;c. Of this Chapter, to the end. First, in these</hi> verses, <hi>the</hi> 4, 5. <hi>and</hi> 6. <hi>hee is speaking of Professors in general, conditionally. But</hi> vers. 9, 10, <hi>&amp;c. hee is speaking to the true Beleevers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst these</hi> Hebrews, <hi>particularly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Here in these verses are glorious gifts, Illumination, and tasting of spiritual things: There in those verses, is Faith, working by love, to the glory of Iesus, and Weal of his Saints.</hi> 3. <hi>Here are men enrolled amongst Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, so holden, and esteemed, both of themselves, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: There are sensible souls, in the feeling of sin, and fear of wrath, and hope of mercy, flying to Iesus as to a Refuge, and casting the Anchor of their tossed souls with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the veil, where Iesus is in Heaven.</hi> 4. <hi>Here men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving from the holy Ghost good things: there men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving from him, beside these good things, better things also.</hi> 5. <hi>Here things glorious indeed, yet not alwaies accompanying salvation, but in some going before saving Grace; in others, possibly alone, without saving Grace: But there are saving Graces alwaies joyned with Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> 6. <hi>Here in these verses the Apostle is not confident, but such as have received these things here mentioned, may fall away, except they go forward, and study to make progress. But there, in those verses, the Apostle is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded, that they shall not fall away, but be saved; and thereupon encourageth them to go forwards.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>From this Comparison it is clear then,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. That there is a possibility of the Apostasie of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors, and titular Saints, but not of the Apostasie of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed souls, and true Christians, true Saints. 2. There is a ground of fear from these words, to such as are secure, and puffed up with the conceit of their spiritual gifts, but not of those who in fear are fled to Christ. 3. That in this place carnal confidence onely is shaken in such, who as if they had done well enough, study not to make progress: But Faith no waies weakened in such, who still study to advance, and make more and more progress. 4. That here fruitless light, and fruitless feeling, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in question; but not Faith, and laborious love, bringing out fruits to Christs glory, and good of his Saints.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Again, from this comparison it is evident,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That the holy Ghost is Author, both of these com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon spiritual gifts, and of these special saving graces al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so. Of these common gifts hee is Author, as dwelling amongst Professors, and distributing good things unto all Professors that are in the visible house of his Church. But hee is Author of those saving Graces, as dwelling in true Professors, who are his own house: bringing with himself better things than these gifts, and salvation also unto them infallibly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly, From this Comparison it is clear.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. That there are some Converts, external from the world, to the Church, who yet stick in their naturals, and are not in the sense of sin, fled unto Christ for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, nor converted from Nature to saving Grace; to whom the Apostle will not deny room in the Church, if they will study to make progress. And, 2. That illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and tasting of Spiritual things, may bee given as well to such, who are not renewed in their heart, as unto sound Converts.</p>
                  <p>For, 1. <hi>The natural man may be convinced, that the Church is a blessed Society, and joyn himself unto it.</hi> 2. <hi>Yea, change his outward conversation, and cast off his pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions which are in the world through lust, and take him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be ruled outwardly by Christs Discipline, and call him, LORD, LORD.</hi> 3. <hi>And be so blameless before men, that hee may look with his Lamp like a wise Virgin, waiting for the Wedding, and yet be a graceless fool in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly.</hi> 4. <hi>Yea, hee may be illuminated, not onely by learning the literal knowledge of the Gospel, as men do their Philosophy, but also may be illuminated supernatural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with in-sight in many profound things in the Scripture. For supernatural gifts may be in a Natural and unrenewed Man, so as hee may say to CHRIST,</hi> I have prophesied in thy Name, <hi>and yet be unrenewed in Christs estimation.</hi> 5. <hi>Hee may taste of the heavenly Gift, partly by historical beleeving the Truth of the Gospel, partly by contemplation of the Truth credited. Now, historical Faith, is a taste of that heavenly gift of Iustifying, Faith; because it is a good degree towards it? and contemplation of this Truth, bringeth a taste of the thing credited; and so of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Gift revealed in the Gospel. For, the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of every Truth, bringeth with it; naturally, a dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation, such as Philosophers do finde in their studies. And the more eminent the Truth be, no wonder the delecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be the greater. For, many heard Christs gracious Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and wondered, and beleeved his words to be true: but Christ did not commit himself unto them; for hee knew what was in them.</hi> 6. <hi>Hee may be made partaker of the Holy Ghost, and have his share of Church gifts, distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:49391:126"/>
by the Holy Ghost; so as hee can from the light which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>he Holy Ghost giveth him, answer other mens doubts, comfort the feeble minded, and edifie others in their Faith, by his speeches; yea, have the gift of expressing his brain-light, both in conference to men, and in formal prayer to God, if hee be a private man onely: and if hee be in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick office, may have the gift of formal preaching, and praying in publick: yea, in those daies of the Apostle, might have had the extraordinary gifts of Tongues, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesying, and Miracles-working. Therefore, saith Christ,</hi> Many will say to mee in that day, Lord, Lord, have wee not prophesied in thy Name? and in thy Name have cast out Devils? and in thy Name done many wonderful works? <hi>To whom Christ will answer,</hi> I never knew you; Depart from mee, yee that work iniquity, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.22, 23. <hi>Now, this knowledge, convincing light, and gifts of utterance, &amp;c. are from the Holy Ghost; or else, how could such Apostates, as are here described, sin against the Holy Ghost?</hi> 7. <hi>Hee may taste of the good Word of God: that is, finde sweetness in the Doctrine of the Gospel, and bee convinced of the Goodness and Mercy of God towards sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, shining therein: yea, and by beholding the possibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his own salvation, upon this condition. If hee will sell all, and buy the Pearl, hee may taste of Gods Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandise, in the blocking for them; beside all the false joyes, and delusions, which hee may get by presuming of the certainty of his own salvation, and yet, in the mean time, as a fool, will not lay down the price; will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce his earthly, and beastly affections; will not deny himself, and his own corruptions: The care of this world, and the deceitfulness of Riches, choaking the fruits of the Word heard, as they who receive the seed amongst thorns. Wherefore in time of persecution for the Word, hee may by and by be offended, and quit the Truth, albeit with the stony hearted hearers, in time of prosperity, hee heard the Word, and anon, with joy, received it,</hi> Mat. 13.20, 21, 22. 8. <hi>Lastly, hee may taste of the power of the World to come: that is, in contemplation of the Blessedness promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to the Saints in Heaven, be taken with admiration of it, yea, and have a natural desire of it, as</hi> Baalam <hi>did, when upon such a speculation, hee did wish to dye the death of the Righteous, and to have his last end as his: and yet love the wages of Iniquity so well, as hee forsook not his covetousness, for all his wish of Heaven. In a word, It is possible, that a man impenitent, and unrenewed in his heart, may be a glorious Professor, for his outward be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, and have fair gifts, and yet make Apostasie from the Truth, when hee getteth a fit Temptation: or else, how should it be possible, that the Devil should make glorious Professors, and Church-men in all Ages, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states, Persecuters, Betrayers of the Truth to the Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Underminers of the Church of Christ; Except they, under all their show, did lodge in their heart, the love of Mony, and worldly Riches, more than the love of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? the love of the praise of men, rather than Gods Approbation? the lust of their fleshly ease, and pleasure, more than the pleasure of God? the fleshly fear of those that can kill the Body, more than of God, Who can cast both Soul and Body into Hell? And, therefore, no wonder, if for satisfaction of their Ambition, Avarice, Lusts, and earthly Affections, they become ready to sell</hi> Christ <hi>and</hi> His <hi>Truth, and</hi> His <hi>Church, and their Country, and All, when they finde their Merchant, and the beloved Price offered unto them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4 Observe here; How glorious soever these Illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Gifts, and Tastings seem, yet there is no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther here granted, but Tastings, to such rotten Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors. That which they get, is either onely in the Brain, by Knowledge; or, if there bee any Feelings, they are but fleeting motions, flowing from temporary grounds, which proceed not from any Spiritual life in the man, nor from a root in himself: that is, not from the Spirit dwelling in him. Such feelings do neither foster, nor strenghthen him, for any Spiritual Obedience; but vanish, without changing the heart. It is true, all that the godly get, in comparison of what hee shall get, is but Tastings: Yet in comparison of these fruitless tastings of the unsound Professors, that which hee getteth, is true Eating, and Drinking, a real Feeding; holding his soul in life; and enabling him to work the works of God; to mortifie his lusts, and serve God in his Spirit.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Observe, <hi>That here hee doth not challenge those who have felt these tastings, for unsound, nor threaten them, if they hold on, and make progress.</hi> Then, 1. The having of illumination, and spiritual gifts, and tastings of heavenly things, is not to be lightly esteemed of, but accounted as steps and degrees unto a further progress: wherefore, as it is possible for some to fall away, so is it a peece of advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to encourage men to go on, that they fall not away. 2. There is no danger in having this Illumination, or these light tastings: But all the hazard is, to rest upon them, and not to tend towards perfection, or, to fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way after receiving so much encouragement. 3. And therefore, wee must not rest on Illumination, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon gifts, how glorious soever; nor tastings, and feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, how sweet soever: but seek still into a more near communion with Christ, and still more to mortifie our lusts, and still to abound in the fruits of love to Christ, and his Church.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 6.</hi> If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto Repentance; seeing they crucifie to themselves, the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame.</q>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Hee saith not.</hi> It is impossible they should bee sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, <hi>but,</hi> that they shall bee renewed by Repentance.</p>
                  <p>Then, Apostates salvation is not impossible, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause their repentance is impossible: and where repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is, there is no impossibility of salvation, but a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of salvation rather. For, hee that giveth the repentance, hee declareth his purpose, to give remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion also.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Hee giveth a Reason why they cannot get repentance, because they maliciously renounce Christ, and crucifie him afresh unto themselves. That is, draw on the guiltiness of his enemies who crucified him, did lye under, by Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy, allowing their crucifying of him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1 An Apostate from Christs doctrin, doth Christ as open shame as he can; and saith in effect of Christ, that his doctrin is false, and not to be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. 2 An Apostate alloweth <hi>Iudas,</hi> and the <hi>Iews</hi> for crucifying of Christ; and accounteth Christ no more worthy, than so to bee dealt withall. 3. Renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of Christ, maketh repentance impossible: For, hee is a Prince, to give repentance unto <hi>Israel.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, hee who will not quit Christ, nor his true Doctrine, is not debarred from having Repentance, nor from Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Hee giveth a reason of the punishment of Apostates, from the less, to the more, under a similitude from land-labouring, thus: As God blesseth such men, who, after pains taken on them, bring forth the fruits of good works; So doth hee curse those, who after pains taken on them, do bring forth but evil works. And if it be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>The Similitude sheweth,</hi> 1. That men are like unma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nured Land, before they bee brought within the Church: but after they are made partakers of the Gospel, then are they like manured Land within hedges, Gods Husbandry. 2. That such as begin to bring forth
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:49391:126"/>
fruits worthy of repentance, God blesseth, and maketh more fruitful. 3. That the means of Grace under the Gospel, are to our souls as Rain, and labouring, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Husbandry is to the ground.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 8.</hi> But that which beareth Thorns and Bryers, is rejected, and is nigh unto cursing; whose end is to be burned.</q>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The Similitude sheweth,</hi> 1. That a man may pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, for not bringing forth the fruits of the Gospel, albeit hee fall not into the sin against the Holy Ghost. 2. That there is a great reason why God should cast away a man, who amendeth not his life by the Gospel, as that an Husbandman should give over labouring of a peece of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil ground. 3. And by this means also sheweth, that Gods most severe judgements, have all of them most e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitable reasons. 4. That there is a necessity of bringing forth the fruits of well-doing, if a man would bee free of the curse, either of Apostates, or of the barren land.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 9.</hi> But beloved, wee are perswaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though wee thus speak.</q>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Hee mitigateth his threatning of them, for fear of hurting their Faith</hi>: Beloved, <hi>saith hee,</hi> wee are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded better things of you, though wee thus speak. Then, 1. A Preacher may threaten fearfully those of whom hee hath good hopes; yet with prudency, lest hee harm them. 2. And people threatned, must beware of weakning their own Faith, knowing, that threatnings are not used to weaken their Faith, but to put away se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, and sloathfulness.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Hee taketh his assurance of them, from such things as accompany salvation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, In the fruits of Faith, there are marks and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences of a mans salvation to bee found, which may give a charitable perswasion of their blessed estate, to such as know them,</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 10.</hi> For, God is not unrighteous, to forget your work and labour of love which you have shewed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Name, in that yee have ministred to the Saints, and do minister.</q>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The reason of his good hopes of them, is their by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone, and present fruits of love towards Christs name, and his Saints.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. The works of love, done for the glory of Christ, or to his Saints for Christs sake, from time to time, as God giveth occasion, are evident marks of a mans salvation; and more sure tokens of saving Grace given, than illumination and tastings, spoken of before. 2. No love is to be reckoned for love, but working love. 3. No works are right works, which flow not from love to Christ.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Of such works hee saith, that God is not unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to forget them: and so proveth their salvation, because such fruits accompany salvation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. With the grace of laborious love towards Christs Name, the grace of salvation doth go in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. 2. Justice doth agree with grace in the reward of well-doing, because the reward is graciously promised, and righteousness maketh promises to be performed. 3. The man that loveth Christ in deed, and in truth, hath that which is most terrible in God, for the pawn of his salvation, even his Justice.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>These are they whom hee reproved for weakness of knowledge,</hi> Chap. 5. vers. 12. <hi>whom now hee commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, for their good affection, and fruits.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. Mean knowledge, if it be sanctified, and sound, will be fruitful in the works of love. 2. This vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of love is no excuse for sloathful following of the means of knowledge: wee must grow in love, and grow in knowledge also.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 11.</hi> And wee desire, that every one of you do shew the same diligence, to the full assurance of hope, unto the end.</q>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Hee exhorteth to continue diligent unto the end.</hi> Then, 1. The diligent have need of Exhortation to go on. 2. Exhortation to perseverance, importeth not su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spition of falling away, but serveth to further perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance rather. 3. No other Tearm-day is set to our dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, but the end. No licence to slack, or give over.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The end of their going on in diligence, is their full assurance of hope.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. Whatsoever measure of assurance men have, they may yet obtain a fuller measure of it. Still wee must study to grow. 2. Constant diligence in the works of love, is the ready mean to foster and augment our assurance. 3. Christian hope is not a conjecture, or probability, but an assurance.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 12.</hi> That yee be not sloathful; but followers of them, who through Faith and Patience inherit the Promises.</q>

                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. So many examples as wee have in Scripture, of the godly gone before, so many leaders and encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers must wee reckon our selves to have. 2. The painful, and not the sloathful, are the true imitators of allowed examples. 3. In the way to Heaven, there are many things befalling us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which make it unlikely wee shall come there: for which cause, there is need of Faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4. A time must intervene, and troubles also, ere Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven be possessed: There is, therefore, need of Patience also.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>They inherit the Promise, saith hee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. The most patient and painful servants of God, get not Heaven by merit, but by inheritance. 2. They get not Heaven by merit, but by promise. Now, the promise is of Grace.</p>

                        <hi>15.</hi> And so after hee had patiently endured, hee obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Promise.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>For many examples, hee bringeth one of Father</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, <hi>from</hi> Gen. 22. vers. 16.17. <hi>and maketh use of it by application.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, because we cannot have all examples at once before our eyes, we shall doe well, for several duties, to have some select examples singled out, for our own more ready use.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Hee marketh, first, the Promise made: next, the confirmation of it by an oath: then, the fast and constant hold laid on it by</hi> Abraham: <hi>last, the fruit of the holding fast</hi>; Hee obtained the promise.

                  <p>Then, In making use of examples, it must be held for a ground, that the honest and up<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The end of an oath is to end controversie.</hi> Then, This similitude importeth, that as long as wee are in mis-beleef, there is a controversie betwixt God and us: wee testifying that wee are in suspition of his good affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction towards us, and of his promise keeping unto us: and God is offended with us, for our wicked thoughts enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of him.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Hee calleth Beleevers by</hi> Isaaks <hi>stile,</hi> Heirs of the Promise.</p>
                  <p>Then, Beleevers are all reckoned by God, as so many <hi>Isaaks,</hi> and intituled with <hi>Isaak,</hi> to be Heirs of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> with him, and Heirs of the Good promised to him, and Heirs begotten by the force of Gods Promise, and Word, and not by the force of nature.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And certainly, albeit the Law serve for a Preparation, yet it is the Gospel, and the Word of Promise, which pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in the heart of a man to God, in love, as a reconciled Father, and converteth him. Wherefore, even because of the Beleevers begetting to God, by the immortal seed of the Word of Promise, hee may be called the Heir of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise also.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>By the Oath God declareth himself willing to shew the immutability of his Counsel, concerning the Salvation of Beleevers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. As many as beleeve in Jesus, and are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten by the Promise, are fore-ordained, in Gods Counsel, for Salvation. 2. The Purpose and Counsel of God, concerning such mens Salvation, is immutable. 3. God will have Beleevers knowing this His Counsel, concerning themselves, and their Salvation, and assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the immutability thereof. 4. Hee will have the sworn Promise made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his Seed, serving in particular, to the Heirs of Promise, or Beleevers, to make evident this His Counsel to them in particular, as well as to <hi>Abraham,</hi> because Hee sware to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to shew them this His Purpose.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>By the Oath hee saith,</hi> God is willing more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly to shew the immutability of his Counsel.</p>
                  <p>Then, 1. Till the immutability of the Lords Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, concerning our salvation, be laid hold upon, Faith cannot be stedfast, as the Lord would have it. 2. God is willing, that wee should look in upon his Counsel, by the eye of Faith, and read our Names written in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, in His Decree: and so be made sure. 3. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of Salvation, or of the Blessing to Beleevers, is of it self sufficient enough for Assurance, albeit it were not sworn: and the Oath is added, not of necessity; for any weakness of the truth of the Promise, but out of super-abundant good will, to have us made sure. 4. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoveth to be most pleasant to God, that Beleevers have full assurance of Faith, and over-come all doubting, seeing hee sweareth the Promise, onely for this end.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 18.</hi> That by two immutable things, in the which it was impossible for God to lye, wee might have a strong Consolation, who have fled for refuge, to lay hold upon the Hope set before us.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Another end of the Oath, is, That with assurance the Beleever may have strong Consolation, upon solid grounds.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>But how describeth hee the Beleevers, to whom this Comfort is allowed?</hi> Wee, <hi>saith hee,</hi> who have fled for refuge, to lay hold upon the Hope set before us. <hi>That is, Wee, who to flee from deserved wrath, have taken our course towards</hi> Jesus, <hi>in hope to get the Salvation offered unto us in</hi> Him. <hi>Fleeing for refuge, a similitude, whether from nature, or from the Ordinance of</hi> Moses <hi>Law,</hi> Numb. 35.6. Giveth us to understand, 1. That every true Beleever, of necessity, must be sensible of his own sins, and the deserved wrath of God pursuing him for sin. 2. Must have this estimation of Jesus, That Hee is both a ready, and sufficiently strong Refuge, to save a man from sin and wrath, when hee runneth towards Him. 3. That in this sense of sin, and wrath, and good esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Christ, hee set his Face towards Him onely: avoiding all by-waies, leading elsewhere, than to this Refuge; and running for death and life to be found in Him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Again while hee saith,</hi> To lay hold upon the Hope set before us, <hi>hee giveth us to understand,</hi> 1. That in Christ, our Refuge: not onely is there deliverance from pursuing Wrath, but also eternal life to be found, as it is set before us in the Gospel. 2. That the Beleever must have Hope, to obtain this Offer. 3. And, as hee is driven, by fear of the Law, unto Christ, so must hee also be drawn, and allured, by this Salvation set before him, griping undeserved Grace, as well as fleeing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served Wrath.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>While hee describeth the Beleever, after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as the man to whom all these things appertain, hee teacheth us,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That, Whosoever findeth himself in any truth, to be such a one as here is described, so driven, and so drawn to Christ, fleeing from Sin and Wrath, and running on to Christ, in Him alone to be saved; may be well assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, hee is a man endued with saving Faith, One of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> Children, An Heir of Promise, One of the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of the Saints, and fellowship of the Apostles, whom the Apostle here taketh in with himself, in this Text; A Man in Gods Counsel, Fore-known, Elected, Predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated: A Man to whom God intended both to speak and swear, in <hi>Abrahams</hi> person, to whom God alloweth both strong Consolation here, and the Possession hereafter of whatsoever is set before him, in the offer of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>The end of the Oath</hi>; That wee might have strong Consolation, by two immutable things (<hi>that is Gods Promise, and Gods Oath</hi>) in which it is impossible that God should lie.</p>
                  <p>Then, 1. The Consolation which God alloweth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Faithful, is strong, able to overcome the Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge of Sin, fear of Judgement, Death, and Hell, and feeling or fearing of any misery whatsoever. Other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solations are but weak, in comparison hereof, and can overcome none of these. 2. God hath laid immutable Grounds for this Consolation; His unchangeable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, and His unchangeable Oath. 3. God cannot lye, nor deceive, whether Hee say, or swear. 4. His nature maketh this impossibility of lying, and immutability in promising, and swearing. 5. God alloweth this strong Consolation, to come by Faiths resting on these two immutable things, His Promise, and Oath. So that the less a man apprehend the grounds of his Faith to be solid, the less hee shall be comforted: and the more hee apply
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:49391:127"/>
the Promise to himself, and apprehend the unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness of the Promise and Oath of God, the more strong shall his Consolation be.</p>

Therefore hee did not account this any typical action, having any resemblance of that which was to be done of Christ his Anti-type: for then should hee not have failed to mark it, seeing hee observeth the mystery of his Name, and place of dwelling, which is less.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.

                  <p n="3">3. <hi>As</hi> Melchisedec <hi>the Type, is by interpretation, King of Righteousness</hi>: So is Christ in truth, King of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness. 1.

The reason, in force, goeth thus.</hi> 1. <hi>If</hi> Melchisedec, <hi>the Type, be more excellent than</hi> Abraham; <hi>much more must</hi> Christ, <hi>of whom hee is a Type.</hi> 2. <hi>And if</hi> Melchisedec's <hi>greatness be not easily perceived, except there be a due con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of it; much more</hi> Christs <hi>greatness requireth consideration, and is worthy of contemplation.</hi> 3. <hi>If</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, <hi>by paying of Tythes, acknowledge</hi> Melchisedec's <hi>superiority; Much more should all</hi> Abrahams <hi>Off-spring acknowledge</hi> Christs <hi>Superiority whom</hi> Melchisedec, <hi>ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pically represented: by paying of what is due, for the maintenance of his Service, and bestowing on his Ministers, who are appointed to bless in his Name (whether it bee less, or more, which they bestow) in such a manner, as it vilifie not, nor disgrace their high Employment, which</hi> Christ <hi>hath put upon them, and so dishonour him, whose Servants they are.</hi>

                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 5.</hi> And verily, they that are of the Sons of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi,</hi> who receive the Office of the Priesthood, have a Commandement to take Tythes of the people, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Law, that is, of their Brethren, though they come out of the loyns of <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hee proveth, that in Tythes taking,</hi> Melchisedec <hi>was greater than</hi> Abraham, <hi>who did pay Tythes; Because, for the same respect, the Levites, by taking Tythes of their Brethren, as Priests, had a Superiority over them, for their office sake, who otherwise were their equals.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then. 1. The Priestly office lifted up the Levites a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove their Brethren, who were sprung of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as well as they. 2. The command of taking Tithes, was annexed to the office of the Priesthood, in token of their superiority by office over them, who by nature were at least their equals.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vers. 6.</hi> But hee whose descent is not from them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Tythes of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and blessed him that had the promises.</p>
                     <p n="7">
                        <hi>7.</hi> And without all contradiction, the less is blessed of the greater.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hee proveth again,</hi> Melchisedec <hi>to be greater than</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham; <hi>and so, greater than</hi> Levi; <hi>because hee blessed him: and therefore, behoved to be greater.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. <hi>Abraham,</hi> notwithstanding hee had the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, yet got hee the blessing by <hi>Melchisedec,</hi> in type; and, from Christ, represented by him, in truth. 2. If <hi>Melchisedec</hi> was greater, because hee blessed him, as type: Then Christ far more, who blesseth in effect.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Now, there are sundry sorts of blessings.</hi> 1. <hi>There is a blessing of reverence, and worship: So men bless God. This sort importeth no greatness in the blesser, but subjection.</hi> 2. <hi>There is a blessing of Charity: So men bless one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by mutual prayer. This sort importeth no Superiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty neither.</hi> 3. <hi>There is a blessing of authority ordinary: So do Gods Ministers bless the people, in the Lords name.</hi> 4. <hi>A blessing of authority extraordinary: So</hi> Melchise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dec <hi>blessed</hi> Abraham, <hi>and the Prophets, and Patriarchs, such as by inspiration they were directed to bless. And this official blessing, with authority, proveth Superiority, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be ordinary, or extraordinary.</hi> 5. <hi>There is a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of power, of it self, effectual: So blesseth Christ; and so God blesseth men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From this, 1. The Excellency of the office of Gods Ministers is evident, who are appointed to bless the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in Gods Name. 2. And how they should bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected, in love, for their work sake. 3. And how they

                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 8.</hi> And, here men that dye, receive Tythes: but there hee receiveth them, of whom it is witnessed, that hee liveth.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Another point of Comparison, tending to this end: The Levites, in their tything, were mortal men, one succeeding another. But</hi> Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisedec, <hi>in type of his Priesthood, and Scriptural being, and Christ, in the truth of his Priesthood, are immortal: And therefore,</hi> Melchisedec, <hi>as the typical Priest, and Christ, as the true Priest, are greater than Levitical Priests, by as much as immortality is above mortality.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, Every Age hath Christ for a Priest, living in their own time, to deal for them, with God: And what benefit they get by him, in their own time, hee can make forth-comming unto them, even for ever.</p>

                     <p n="10">
                        <hi>10.</hi> For hee was yet in the loyns of his Father, when <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisedec</hi> met him.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Another reason to this same purpose</hi>: Levi <hi>paid Tythes to</hi> Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisedec <hi>in</hi> Abrahams <hi>loyns: Therefore,</hi> Melchisedec <hi>is greater in his Priesthood, than the Levitical Priests. So was Christ in</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams <hi>loyns, will you say. I answer, Christ was the true represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Priest, even when</hi> Melchisedec <hi>met</hi> Abraham: <hi>and in</hi> Melchise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dec's <hi>person, as type, the honour was done to Christ, in truth, and, to his Priesthood, by</hi> Abraham. <hi>And again, Christ was in</hi> Abrahams <hi>loyns, onely in regard of the matter of humane nature, not for the manner of propagation: and, so, is exempted from the Law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural posterity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Alwaies from this reasoning, wee learn, That, as receiving Tythes, proveth superiority in office: So paying of Tythes, or maintenance in room of Tythes, proveth subjection to that office, and office-bearers, which receive the same. And, so, mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Ministers should be a matter of honouring of them; or rather, of him that sent them, of its own proper institution; though men turn it into a beggarly stipend, and count the more basely of the office, because of the manner of maintenance.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>From the reason of</hi> Levies <hi>paying of Tythes in</hi> Abrahams <hi>loyns, wee learn,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That there is ground in nature, for imputation of the Fathers deed, unto the children descended of him by natural propagation: so that as justly may God impute unto us <hi>Adams</hi> sins, as to <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi, Abrahams</hi> Tythes paying.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 11.</hi> If, therefore, perfection were by the Levitical Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood (for under it the people received the Law) what further need was there, that another Priest should rise, after the order of <hi>Melchisedec,</hi> and not be called after the order of <hi>Aaron?</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To the end of the Chapter, he sheweth a necessity of the abolishing of the Levitical Priesthood, and establishing of Christs. One reason is in this verse; because perfection was not to be had by the Leviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Priesthood. By Perfection, is understood a perfect satisfaction for our sins, and a perfect purchase of all that wee have need of unto eternal life. He proveth, that such perfection could not be had by</hi> Aarons <hi>Priesthood; because, then, there had been no need of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Priesthood after</hi> Aarons, <hi>if perfection could have been by his Priesthood. But the Scripture sheweth, that there behoved to arise a Priest after</hi> Melchisedec's <hi>order; by whom perfection was to be gotten,</hi> Psalm 110.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Therefore, perfection could not be by</hi> Aarons <hi>Priesthood. From this wee learn,</hi> That under the Law, remission of sins, and eternal life, was not obtained by virtue of any sacrifice then offered: but by the virtue of Christs Sacrifice, and Christs Priesthood, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented thereby.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>But why could not perfection be by that Priesthood? He giveth a reason, saying,</hi> For under it the people received the Law. <hi>The word importeth as much, as the people were then legalized, discipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, after a Legal manner: that is, the Law was still urged upon them; still they were pressed to give perfect obedience, under pain of the curse; still God dealt in the external form of handing them, as one not satisfied for any thing that was offered, as yet, in their name. Therefore, perfection could not be had by that service: For it was evident, that neither God was pacified, nor their consciences quie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, by any thing in that Priesthood: but all were sent to the thing signified, and to the time which was to come, in the Messia's mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation.</hi> Then, Comparing their time, and ours, for outward man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of handling, as they were legalized; that is, straightly urged<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the yoak of the Law: wee were evangelized; that is, smoothly entreated, under the Gospel, God laying aside terrour, entreating us to bee reconciled, and to come, and receive Grace for Grace.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 12.</hi> For, the Priesthood being changed, there is made, of necessity, a change also of the Law.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>From the change of the Levitical Priesthood, he inferreth, of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, the abolishing of the Levitical Law, and of our obligation thereunto.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. The Levitical Priesthood, and the Levitical Law, do stand and fall together. 2. The Levitical Law cannot stand with any other Priesthood than <hi>Aarons</hi>: it cannot stand with Christs under the Gospel. 3. Christs Priesthood, seeing it is another than <hi>Aarons</hi>: must have another Law, other Ordinances, and Statutes, than <hi>Aarons:</hi> a Law and Ordinances suitable unto it self. 4. To use Levitical Ceremonies under the Gospel, is to confound the Priesthood of <hi>Aaron</hi> and Christ.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vers. 13.</hi> For, hee of whom these things are spoken, pertaineth to another tribe; of which no man gave attendance at the Altar.</p>
                     <p n="14">
                        <hi>14.</hi> For, it is evident, that our Lord sprang out of <hi>Judah,</hi> of which Tribe <hi>Moses</hi> spake nothing concerning Priesthood.</p>
                     <p n="15">
                        <hi>15.</hi> And, it is yet far more evident: For, that after the simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of <hi>Melchisedec</hi> there ariseth another Priest.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Hee proveth, that</hi> Aarons <hi>Priesthood is changed, and the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance thereof; because</hi> Psal. 110. <hi>speaketh of Christs Priesthood, that is, f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>eed from the service of the Altar. By the Altar, hee meaneth the material Altar, commanded in the Law: Another Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar hee knoweth not. And Christs Priesthood hee declareth to be freed from the service of this Altar; beside which, no Law could tye it to any other Altar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, Christs Priesthood is freed from the Altar which God commandeth, and all the service thereof. And whosoever will erect another material Altar in Christs Priesthood, and tye his Church unto it, must look by what Law they do it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. From <hi>Vers.</hi> 14. wee learn, That Christs Genealogy was well known in the Apostles times, and no controversie about it. And, it sufficeth us, that wee know this by the Apostles Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; albeit wee could not lineally deduce the same.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Observe how hee reasoneth; That none of the Tribe of</hi> Juda <hi>attended the Altar, because</hi> Moses <hi>spake nothing of that Tribe, concerning the Priesthood.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, Negative Conclusions, in Matters of Faith, and duties, follow well from the Scriptures silence. It is not warranted from Scripture; therefore I am not bound to beleeve it. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth not require any such thing of mee; therefore God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counteth it not service to Him to do it, is good reasoning.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>From</hi> Vers. 15. <hi>The Apostle comparing the Proofs of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, calleth this last in plain tearms,</hi> Far more evident.</p>
                  <p>Then, Of Reasons drawn from Scripture, by Consequence, some will be less evident, some more evident, and yet all be good Reasons, and prove the purpose strongly.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 16.</hi> Who is made, not after the Law of a carnal Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, but after the power of an endless life.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hee entreth into a more particular comparison of the Levitical Priesthood, and Christs, to shew the weakness of the one, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison of the other. The Levitical Priests in their Consecration, got a commandment, for the exercise of bodily and carnal Rites, some few years of their mortal life, without power to convey the Grace sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by those bodily Rites. But Christ, in his Consecration, is endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with power to confer grace, and life eternal, from Generation, to Generation, to all that seek the Benefit of his Priesthood.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, wee may be assured of Christs power, to make the means which hee useth for our salvation effectual, as wee may be assured of his endless life.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 17.</hi> For, Hee testifieth, Thou art a Priest for ever, after the Order of <hi>Melchisedec.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He proveth this by Scripture, because God calleth him a Priest for ever: Therefore, Hee hath power for ever, as living for ever, to make his own Priesthood effectual.</hi> So, <hi>The eternity of Christs Priesthood, proveth it to be forcible, to give eternal life. For, if it did not endure in his person, it could not give eternal life, and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples hearts would not rest upon it, with any ground: And so it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved to be renounced, and another Priesthood sought. But seeing it is not to be changed, but shall endure; Then, of necessity, it hath the thing to give us, which wee are seeking: that is, eternal life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, As long as Christ endureth, we want not a Priest, to hear
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:49391:129"/>
confession of sin, to give absolution, to bless us, &amp; give us eternal life.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 18.</hi> For, there is, verily, a disannulling of the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment going before, for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.</q>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>By the same words of establishing Christs Priesthood,</hi> Psal. 110. <hi>hee proveth, that the Levitical Law was to be abolished, when Christ came: Because the establishing of Christs Priesthood, and bringing it to light, is the disanulling of the Levitical.</hi> Then, There needeth no more to declare, That the Levitical Priesthood, and Law, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolished, and wee freed from the Ceremonies thereof, but the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Christ, and His entring to his Office of Priesthood.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Hee giveth a reason, of the abolishing of this Priesthood; Because it was weak and unprofitable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Quest. <hi>How can that be, seeing it was ordained, to strengthen the Beleevers, then, and was profitable for that end?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I answer, <hi>It is called weak, and unprofitable, in regard of any power, to make satisfaction to Gods justice for our sins, or to purchase any salvation unto us: For, other waies, as a mean, to lead men, for that time, unto the</hi> Messias, <hi>who should satisfie for us, it was not weak, nor unprofitable: But, to pacifie God, and purchase salvation, as the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeving Iews did use it, it was weak, and unprofitable altogether. Again, being considered as a mean, to prefigure Christ, it was profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble still, till Christ came; namely, for that end and use. But when<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He is come, no end, nor use, more for it, but that it should be abolished, having served the turn whereunto it was ordained.</hi> Then, 1. Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Ceremonies, whatsoever use they might have had before Christ, are weak, and unprofitable, after His comming. 2. It is evil reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to say, such Rites and Ceremonies were used before Christ came; therefore they may be used now also.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 19.</hi> For, the Law made nothing perfect; but the bringing in of a better hope did: by the which we draw nigh unto God.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He proveth, That those Rites were weak: Because the Law, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Moral, or Ceremonial, could not perfect any thing: that is, justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, sanctifie, and save any man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>They served as a Pedagogue, to lead a man to</hi> Christ, <hi>for expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of sin, and purchase of salvation, but could not effectuate this, by themselves. And this maketh good the</hi> Answer, <hi>to the</hi> Question <hi>in the former</hi> Ver. Then, To seek to bee perfected, justified, and saved, by works, is to seek that by the Law, which could never bee brought to pass by it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. What, then, doth perfect all? <hi>Hee answereth</hi>: The bringing in of a better Hope, <hi>perfecteth all. That is,</hi> Christ <hi>then hoped for, and looked unto, who is that</hi> Better Thing, <hi>even the</hi> End, <hi>and the</hi> Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, <hi>of those Legal Ordinances, being brought in unto Beleevers,</hi> Hee <hi>doth perfect all.</hi> Then, 1. What the Beleevers could not get un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, by their outward service, they got it by Christ, hoped for and beleeved into. 2.

                        <hi>22.</hi> By so much was Iesus made a Surety of a better Testament.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Hee goeth on, to compare the Levitical Priesthood with Christs· Two Comparisons are here conjoyned: First, Levitical Priests were made without an Oath, only by way of simple Ordinance, and Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; God leaving, room to himself, how long hee pleased to hold on the Direction; and when hee pleased, to change it. But</hi> Christ <hi>was made Priest with an Oath, that hee should never be changed.</hi> Then, 1. When God gave forth the Ceremonial Law, hee reserved room to himself, to change it: yea, gave evidence, that hee was to change it: for, hee obliged the people, during his will, but not himself. 2. But, for Christs Priesthood, God is bound with an Oath, Never to change it: and, it leaneth on his nature which cannot altar, nor repent, and upon his Oath, which cannot be violated.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Another comparison, betwixt the Levitical Covenant, and the Evangelical Covenant. As far as the Oath is above the changeable commandement, by so much is the new Covenant better than the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant under the Law.</hi> Then, 1. There was a Covenant, or Testament, whereby Beleevers were saved, as well under the Law, as under the Gospel. 2. The Covenant now, though in substance of salvation, one with the former; yet, in the manner of down-setting the Articles, and the form of it, is better than the Covenant then, more clear, more free, more full, more largely extended, and more firm.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Christ is here called Surety of this Covenant.</hi> Then, 1. Christ must see the Covenant kept, and be good for it. 2. God hath Christ to crave for our performance of the Covenant: and we have Christ, to crave for Gods part of the Covenant: Yea, and Christ to crave, to give us Grace, to perform that which God requireth of us in his Covenant. 3. Jesus is content to be Surety: and the Father hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented, and ordained, and made him Surety. So, it resteth only, that wee bee content also, and make much of Christ, that hee may do all our work for us, and all Gods work in us.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Vers. 23.</hi> And they, truly, were many Priests; because they were not suffered to continue, by reason of death.</p>
                     <p n="24">
                        <hi>24.</hi> But, this man, because hee continueth ever, hath an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable Priesthood.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Another Excellency of Christs Priesthood, above the Levitical, which may be branched out in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>se particulars following.</hi> 1. The Levitical Priests were many, both at one time, and one after another: by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son whereof, that Priesthood was weakened, while one part of the Office, for such a time, was in the hands of this man; and another part, for another time, was in the hands of that man. And, because one man could not be ready to take the Sacrifices from all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; therefore, several men behoved to take several parts of the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. But, in Christs Priesthood, there is but one man, even himself; His Priesthood is undivided: no man beareth a part of the burden with him: Hee, alone, attendeth all mens Sacrifices, by himself: Hee is at leisure, for every mans employment, at all times, in the greatest throng of Sacrifices. Then, as long as Christ is at leisure, no reason to employ another to carry our prayers.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The Levitical Priesthood, did pass from one person to another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Death made interruption. But Christs Priesthood cannot pass from his own person, to any other: neither death, nor any other infirmity, can interrupt his Office.</hi> Then, 1. To make any Priest, by special Office, in the New Testament, beside Christ, is to rent the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of Christ, and make it imperfect, like <hi>Aarons</hi>; which, for the same reason, that it had many Priests, was weak, and imperfect, and inferiour to Christs. 2. To make Priests, by office, in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, to offer up any corporal Sacrifice, is to make Christs Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood separable from his own person: which is against the nature of Christs Priesthood, which cannot pass from one, to another: for so importeth the word. 3. To make plurality of Priests in Christs Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, Vicars, or Substitutes, or, in any respect, partaker of the office with him, is to presuppose, that Christ is not able to do that office alone; but is either dead, or weak, that hee cannot fulfil that office: contrary to the Text here, which saith, <hi>Because hee continueth ever, he hath an unchangeable Priesthood</hi>: or, a Priesthood which cannot pass from one, to another.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 25.</hi> Wherefore, hee is able also to save them to the uttermost, which come unto God by him; seeing hee ever liveth to make intercession for them.</q>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Hee sheweth the fruit of Christs keeping still the Priesthood, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together in his own person, to be, the perfect Salvation of all beleevers for ever</hi>: Hee is able to save, to the uttermost, them that come unto God through him. Then, 1. Whosoever communicateth Christs Priesthood, with any other beside his own person, maketh Christ not able, alone, to save to the utmost, those that come unto God, through him. 2. From this ground also, it doth follow, that Christ not only beginneth the beleevers salvation, but perfecteth it also. Hee doth not work a part of a mans salvation, and leave the rest to his own merits (or the merits of others) but perfecteth it himself, even to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most. 3. And if a man joyn any thing meritorious unto Christs Priesthood, or any Mediatour, for intercession, beside him, or seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, by his own works, to purchase salvation, hee denieth Christ to be able to save him to the uttermost.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Hee describeth Beleevers, to be those that come to God, through Christ.</hi> Then, 1. Christ is the door, and the way, through which onely access is gotten to God. By Saints, or Angels, there is not a way to come to God, but by Christ onely.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They that come not through him alone to God, seclude them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from the sufficiency of salvation to be had in him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The nature of beleeving, is to make a man come towards God, to get communion with him, through Christ. 4. And none but
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:49391:129"/>
such as come in Faith to God, through Christ, can take comfort from his Priesthood, or look for salvation.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Hee giveth a reason, why perfect salvation is to be had for such as come to God, through Christ: Because</hi> Hee liveth for ever, to make intercession for them. <hi>Hee saith not, to offer, or cause to offer up, the sacrifice of his body for them, But,</hi> Hee liveth, <hi>and is not to be offered any more, and,</hi> liveth, to make intercession.</p>
                  <p>Then, 1. The sacrificing part is done, and ended: His intercession hath now the place: and, by his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession, wee get the merit of his death and passion, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied unto us: and not by any new oblation. 2. If hee brook his life, hee will not fail to intercede for us, who come unto God through him, and not through Saint, or Angel, or any person beside: For, hee liveth for ever, to make intercession for us.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 26.</hi> For, such an High-Priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the Heavens.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To the end hee may force the Hebrews, to forsake the Priesthood of</hi> Levi, <hi>hee draweth a strong reason, from the nature of our estate under the Gospel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whereby hee proveth, not onely, that the Priests of <hi>Aarons</hi> Order are abolished, but also, every Son of <hi>Adam</hi> is excluded from the office of the Priesthood, except Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ in his own person onely. Because every Priest that wanteth the properties of Jesus Christ, is unbeseem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for us under the Gospel. A sinful man might have been a Priest under the Law, to prefigure Christ, before hee came: But, now, no sinful man may be a Priest by office, but Christ onely, in whom there is no sin. When the Sacrifice was a beast, then a sinful man might be a Priest: But, now, when the Son of God is the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and hath offered up himself already, and is gone in, into the Sanctuary, with his own blood, to make inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession; there must be no more any sacrificing till hee come out of the Sanctuary again, at the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: nor any Priest, but hee, till hee have ended his intercession. For, such an High-Priest became us, who is holy, harmless, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Question. <hi>But why is it unbeseeming us, under the Gospel, to have a Priest without these properties?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I answer.</hi> The Sacrifice of the New Testament, is the unspotted Lamb of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Jesus Christ, holy, harmless, &amp;c. Therefore it becommeth us to have such a Priest, who is holy, harmless, and undefiled. For, it were unseemly, that the Priest should be worse than the Sacrifice. Next, our Priest hath our sins, original, and actual, to remove, and Heaven to open unto us: And, therefore, it were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beseeming, that any should be our Priest, who hath not his own sins altogether removed, nor yet hath gotten en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, as yet, into Heaven himself.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>In that hee draweth them, of necessity, to quit all mens Priesthood, and betake them unto Christ, as Priest onely, wee learn,</hi> That our necessities being well weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with the insufficiency of any beside Christ, to do our turn, wee shall be forced to quit all Priests, but Christ onely: For, what Priest can know all our needs, all our sins, all our thoughts, all our desires, all our prayers, all our purposes, and wait on upon our business, with God, night and day, to see that no wrath break out upon us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Who can do this; but Christ onely? What Man? What Saint? What Angel?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>In that hee reckoneth a number of perfections, neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to be in a Priest, in the time of the Gospel, all of them in Christ, and all such as wee stand in need of, wee learn,</hi> That all the perfections whereof wee have need in a Priest, are all in Christ: And, the perfections which are in Christ, we have need of them all, and should make use of them all.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>The first property of a Priest under the Gospel, is this,</hi> Hee must be holy: <hi>that is, of his own nature, holy, in his original holy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, no sinful man can be a sufficient Priest in the New Testament, to do for us, who wants holiness by Nature.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>The next property: Our Priest must be harmless, ill-less, free from any original guiltiness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, No man, come of <hi>Adam,</hi> by natural propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, can be a Priest for us now, to satisfie our necessities, who have sin original in us.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>The third property: Wee have need of a Priest un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled, that is, free from actual sin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, No Priest can suffice us, who are defiled with actual sin, but Christ, who never sinned.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>The fourth property: A Priest meet for us, must be free from the pollution of those amongst whom hee converseth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, Wee who are of polluted lips, and lives, and dwell among such a people, communicating, many waies, of their guiltiness, cannot have sufficient com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, through any Priest, who can be infected with sin. And, hee who is a man of polluted lips, is not meet to be a Priest for us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The fift property: A Priest meet for us, behoved to have his residence in Heaven, and have commandment over Heaven, to open it unto us, and give us entry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, None other, but Christ, could suffice us, on whom, by nature, the doors of Heaven are closed. No Priest, out of Heaven, is meet for us.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 27.</hi> Who needeth not daily, as those High-Priests, to offer up Sacrifice; first, for his own sins, and then, for the peoples: For this hee did once, when hee offered up himself.</q>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The sixt property of a fit Priest for us: Hee must have no need to offer Sacrifice for his own sins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, neither <hi>Levi,</hi> nor any sinful man after him, can be a Priest ander the New Testament, but Christ onely, who never sinned, and so had never need to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for himself.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The seventh property: Hee must not have need to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer daily for the peoples sins, who must be our Priest: For, if he should offer the second day, then the first daies Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice should be declared unsufficient: Or, else, why offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth hee again, after that which is sufficient?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. The Priest of the New Testament, need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not to offer oftner than once. 2. And if Christs Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice were offered oftner than once, or daily, hee could not be a fit Priest for us, nor offer a perfect Sacrifice for us; for, the oft offering, should declare the former offerings, unsufficient, and imperfect.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Hee giveth a reason, why Christ needed not to offer up oftner; Because hee hath offered up himself, once, for the sins of the people.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. Christ was both the Priest, and the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, in his own offering. 2. Christs Sacrifice cannot be offered up by any, but himself: another than Christs self, cannot offer up Christ. 3. Betwixt the comming of Christ, and the writing of this Epistle, which was sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry years after Christs Ascention, the Apostle knew no offering of Christ, but that onely once, upon the Cross and yet, times out of number, was the Sacrament of the Lords Supper celebrated before this time.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>In that hee maketh that</hi> once offering, <hi>the reason of his not offering daily, it teacheth us,</hi> That the perfection of that once offered Sacrifice, maketh the repetition need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less: And, whosoever maketh it needful, that Christ be offered daily, maketh both Christ an imperfect Priest, and his Sacrifice imperfect also.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 28.</hi> For, the Law maketh men High Priest, which have infirmity; but, the word of the oath, which was since the Law, maketh the Son, who is consecrated for evermore.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hee giveth a special reason, why it beseemeth not us under the Gospel, to have a sinful man for our Priest; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this is the very difference betwixt the Law, and the Gospel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The Law maketh men, which have infirmities, High Priests: But, the word of the oath, which was since the
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:49391:130"/>
Law, maketh the Son, and, none but the Son, who is consecrated for evermore.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, The Scripture knoweth no Priest, but the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitical Priests, of <hi>Aarons</hi> posterity, for the time of the Law: or, else, that one Priest which was made by an oath, for the time of the Gospel. Beside these, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle acknowledgeth none, nor were there any other, in his time, in the Church.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Hee maketh the difference of the Law, and the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, to stand amongst other things, in the difference of Priests: so as the Gospel cannot admit such Priests, as the Law admitted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, To have Priests now, after the similitude of the Priests under the Law, were to remove the difference which God hath made betwixt the Law, and the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>The differences, as the Apostle setteth them down here, are,</hi> 1. <hi>The course taken about Priests under the Law, was alterable: they were made without an oath, the Law-giver declaring it to be his will, to change that course, when hee saw it fit. But the course taken about the Priests of the New Testament, is with an oath: and, so, cannot be changed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, To make a Priest in the Gospel, who is not consecrated by an oath, to abide for evermore in the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, but may be changed, and another come in, in his place, is contrary to the institution of the Evangelical Priesthood.</p>
                  <p>The next difference, hee maketh this: <hi>The Law ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth men, in the plural number, a plurality of Priests: but the Gospel admitteth no plurality of Priests, but the Son, onely, to be Priest.</hi> Melchisedec's <hi>order in the type, hath no Priest but one in it, without a Suffragane, or sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted Priest. Therefore, Christ, the true</hi> Melchisedec, <hi>is alone in his Priesthood, without partner, or Deputy, or Suffragane.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, To make plurality of Priests in the Gospel, is to alter the order of <hi>Melchesedes,</hi> sworn with an oath; and, to renounce the March set betwixt the Law and the Gospel.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The third Difference: <hi>The Law maketh men Priests, but the Evangelical Oath maketh the Son of God Priest for the Gospel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, To make a man Priest now, is to mar the Son of Gods priviledge, to whom the priviledge onely belongeth.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The fourth Difference: <hi>The Law maketh such Priests, as have infirmity: that is, sinful men, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make the Sacrifice which they offer, effectual, to paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, nor the blessing which they pronounce, to come; nor the instruction which they give, forcible to open the eyes. But the Evangelical Oath, maketh the Son, who is able to save to the uttermost, all that come to God, through him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, To make a sinful and weak man, a Priest now, is to weaken the Priesthood of the Gospel, and make it like the Law.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The fift Difference: <hi>The Law maketh men Priests, which have infirmities, over whom death had power, that they could not be consecrated, but for their short life time. But the Evangelical Oath, maketh the Son, whom the sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows of death could not hold, and hath consecrated him for evermore.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, As long as Christs Consecration lasteth, none must meddle with his office.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The last Difference: <hi>The Law instituting Priests, was not Gods last will, but might suffer addition: But, the Evangelical Oath, is since the Law, and Gods last and unchangeable Will.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore, To adde unto it, and bring in as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Priests now, as did serve in the Temple of old, is to provoke God to adde as many plagues as are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in Gods Book, upon themselves, and their Priests also.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>In saying,</hi> Wee have such an High Priest, who is set down on the right hand, &amp;c. <hi>Hee setteth forth the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Christs person, that hee may commend his Priesthood.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. The glory of Christs office is not seen, till the glory of his person be seen. 2. The glory of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is not seen, till his glorious Soveraignty, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the world be seen. 3. Yea, the glory of Christ is not rightly seen, till his equality with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in glory, be seen and acknowledged.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>In saying, that Christ, as High-Priest is set down on the right hand of the Throne, hee giveth us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,</hi> That Christ, as in his Divine Nature, hee is undivided from the Father, in Glory, and Dominion; So, in his humane Nature, hee is exalted to the fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of Divine Glory, with the Father: Because of the union of the humane Nature, with the Divine, in one person of the Mediatour: The two natures still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining distinguished, but not divided, nor separated, the one from the other.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Hee noteth the place of this Glory, to be in the</hi> Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, <hi>wherein hee preferreth Christ, above the Levitical Priests: for, their Priesthood is onely exercised on Earth, But Christs, in Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore when wee will employ our High-Priest, wee have no earthly City to seek him in, but in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the onely place and palace of his residence.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 2.</hi> A Minister of the Sanctuary, and of the true Tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.</q>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>For all this glory, yet Christ is still called here a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister, to shew us,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That his high honour, hindreth him not to do his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for our good.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Hee is called</hi> A Minister of the Sanctuary, <hi>or,</hi> of the holy things: <hi>for the word will agree with both, and both tend to one purpose: for, the holy things were all tyed to the Sanctuary: and, hee that was Minister of the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, was Minister of the holy things also, and that, in
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:49391:130"/>
name of the Saints. Now the Sanctuary, or the holy things which here is spoken of, is the thing signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Sanctuary, and by the holy things. And so taking all the significations of the word together, we are taught,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That Christ in his glory, is not idle, but as a faithful Agent in the heavenly Sanctuary, taking the care of all the holy things, which his Saints and people are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to present, procuring and giving forth all holy and spiritual things from Heaven to his Saints, which their estate requireth.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>He is called,</hi> a Minister of the true Tabernacle, which God pitched, and not man: <hi>That is, the Ministers of his own Body, miraculously formed by God; not after the ordinary manner of other men, signified and represented by the Typical Tabernacle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, the Tabernacle and Temple under the Law, was but the shadow; and Christs Body was the true Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle. For, 1. As the Symboles of Gods presence, was in the typical Tabernacle; so the fulness of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head dwelleth bodily in Christ. 2. As the typical Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle had inclosed in it all the holy things, the Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick, Table of Shew-bread, Laver, Altar, &amp;c. So hath the humanity of Christ, or Christ the Man, all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness and perfection; the fulness of all good, and all holy things in him, Light, Food, Washing, and Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, and all in himself; that out of his fulness we may all receive Grace for Grace. 3. As the Tabernacle, in the outmost Coverings, seemed but base, yet had bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter stuff within; so, our Lord, when he dwelt in the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle of his flesh amongst us, was found in form as a man, and in the shape of a servant; but inwardly, was full of Grace and Truth.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>In calling Christs Body,</hi> The true Tabernacle, which God builded, and not man, <hi>he teacheth us,</hi> To make use of Christ in truth, as the Church of old made use of the Tabernacle in the Type, that is, in him seek God. Towards him turn the eye of our soul, when we seem, to our selves, to be far removed to the end of the earth; in him offer all our spiritual sacrifices; in him seek our Washing, our Food, our Light, our Comfort; in him, as his Priests, make our Abode, and daily Dwelling. In him let us live and breathe.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>In so calling Christ, hee appropriateth the sacrificing of his Body to himself, in his own person, as the personal and proper act of his Priesthood: for the offering of the which Sacrifice, once, and never after (as</hi> Heb. 7.27. <hi>sheweth) he keepeth still the stile of the onely Minister of the true Tabernacle, as his own incommunicable Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore, whosoever presumeth to offer his Body, presumeth also to take his place.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 3.</hi> For, every High-Priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He proveth, That Christ is the Minister of the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of his own Body, by offering it up; because it behoved him, seeing he is a Priest, to offer up something, either the typical Oblations, or else his own Body represented by them. But the typical Oblations he could not offer, according to the Law, not being a Levite: Therefore he behooved to offer up himself, represented by the typical Oblations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, the Apostle acknowledgeth no Priest, but either the Levitical Priest, or the Priest that offereth up his own Body. And, whosoever pretendeth to have the Office of a Priest now, usurpeth either the office of the Levite, or Christs Office.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 4.</hi> For, if he were on earth, he should not be a Priest; seeing that there are Priests, which offer gifts accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Law.</q>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>He proveth, That Christ cannot offer up the typical Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations; because he cannot be a Priest on earth, albeit he were on earth; because Priesthood on earth, is proper to the Levites onely: For, they are the onely Priests, by Law, on earth, and have prescribed to them, by Law, what they should offer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Quest. <hi>You will ask me here, Was not Chriest a Priest when he was on earth?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I answer,</hi> Yes.</p>
                  <p>Quest. <hi>How then, saith the Apostle here, If he were on earth, he should not be a Priest?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I answer,</hi> Because, albeit he began his Priesthood up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth, yet he could not brook his Office of Priesthood upon earth. For, as the High-Priest, who was the Type, carried the Sacrifice, once a year, through the Court, and before the Sanctuary killed the sacrifice, and then took the blood thereof in unto the Holiest of all, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented himself there before the Lord, with the blood, to intercede for the people, and there remained, during the time of Intercession appointed to him: So Christ, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying his sacrifice out of the City, offered up his Body on the Altar of his Godhead, to his Father; and by his own blood, entred into the heavenly Sanctuary, and sate down on the right hand of the Majestie on high, and there he liveth for ever to intercede for us; having then ended his sacrifice, as this Apostle proveth, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.27. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 9.25, 26. And having no sacrifice now to offer on earth, it is with reason that the Apostle saith, <hi>If he were on earth, he should not be a Priest.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whence we learn: 1. That Christ is not now on the earth, not in any place thereof; and therefore if any man say to us; <hi>Lo here he is; Lo there he is,</hi> we must not beleeve him: it is a false Christ he sheweth us, and not the true, as Christ himself forewarneth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.23. 2. That it is impossible that Christ should now be on the earth; for then should he lose his Priesthood, which is impossible: For, if he were on earth, he should not be a Priest, saith the Apostle here. 3. That Christs Priesthood is onely discharged now in heaven, seeing he cannot be a Priest on earth.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. His <hi>Reason is,</hi> They are Priests which offer Gifts, according to the Law. Then, <hi>Every Priest, who brooketh his Priesthood on earth, must offer Gifts accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Law, as the Apostle here reasoneth: And such Priests as those Christ hath abolished, having changed the Priesthood, and the Law also.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore, there can be no Priest by Office on earth at all, with Gods allowance.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 5.</hi> Who serve unto the Example and Shadow of Heavenly things: as Moses was admonished of God, when he was about to make the Tabernacle: For see (saith He) that thou make all things according to the Pattern shewed unto thee in the Mount. He describeth the proper use of the Levitical Priests, to serve unto the Example of heavenly Things.</q>
                  <p>Then, 1. The Incarnation of Christ, his Death, and the Benefits thereof, signified by Levitical Shadows, are heavenly things, in regard of their heavenly Fruits, and Effects, and other heavenly respects, and are with an heavenly minde to be looked upon. 2. The Ceremonies of the Law, were not idle Rites; but, Examples and Figures of Christ and his Graces; by the which men were led, then, as by the hand to Christ, who was to come.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>From</hi> Exod. 25.40. <hi>he proveth, they were Shadows of heavenly things; because the Pattern in the Mount re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented the heavenly things: and</hi> Moses <hi>Tabernacle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented the Pattern in the Mount: Therefore it repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented heavenly things. And unto this Pattern was</hi> Moses <hi>tyed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. God would not, no, not in the time of Types, suffer any device of man to come in, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting any thing heavenly: Much less will he now. 2. Those which himself ordaineth he will have observed, and none omitted.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 6.</hi> But now hath Hee obtained a more excellent Ministery; by how much also Hee is the Mediatour of a better Covenant, which was established upon better Promises.</q>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="246" facs="tcp:49391:131"/>1. <hi>The offering of the Typical Oblations, hee hath made proper to the Levites. Now, the offering of the true Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, and service belonging thereunto, hee appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to Christ, and calleth it,</hi> A more excellent Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery.</p>
                  <p>Then, 1. The offering of the thing signified by the Levitical Types, is more excellent than all their offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. 2. This Ministery is proper unto Christ onely, in his own person.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>From this hee preferreth the Mediatorship of Christ, to the typical: The Promises, and the Covenant now, to the Covenant then. His reasoning, is:</hi> As the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery is, so is the Mediatour. The Ministery is more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, in offering up himself, than the shadows. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the Mediatour is more excellent now, than the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical of old.</p>
                  <p>Then, The offering of Christs Body, which is the more excellent Ministery, is still annexed to the Person of the Mediatour onely. And, whosoever intrudeth himself in that excellent Ministery, of offering up Christs Body, intrudeth himself also into the Office of the Mediatour.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>In comparing the Covenant then, and now, hee maketh this the better, Because the Promises are better.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whence wee learn, 1. That there was a Covenant betwixt God, and his Church, of old, under the Law: And, so Reconciliation to be had with God then. 2. That howsoever in substance of Grace, both the Covenants a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, yet the form of this Covenant under the Gospel, is better: Because the express conditions are better, the Promises are more spiritual, and more free of straight conditions.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 7.</hi> For, if that first Covenant had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To clear the abolishing of the Old Covenant, hee proveth it, not to be faultless, Because a New Covenant was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised in place thereof. Not that any thing was wrong in that Covenant, but because it was imperfect, and all things needful not expressed in it clearly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whence wee learn, 1. That the Lords proceeding with his Church hath ever been from the less perfect, to the more perfect, till Christ came. 2. That where-ever God addeth, or altereth, what hee once did institute, by so doing, hee sheweth, that before his Addition, hee had not expressed all his Mind, as in the time of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, 3. When once hee hath perfected his course taken with his Church, as now hee hath done under the New Testament, hee altereth the matter no more.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 8.</hi> For, finding fault with them, hee saith, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the daies come (saith the Lord) when I will make a New Covenant with the House of <hi>Israel,</hi> and the House of <hi>Judah.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Hee proveth, That there was an imperfection in the Old Covenant, Because God found fault with the people under it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, The imperfection of the Covenant of Old, was especially in default of the parties with whom it was made; who, by their inability to fulfil it, or behold the drift of it, made it unable to save themselves.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>In the words of</hi> Jeremiah 31.31. <hi>the Lord promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, to make a Covenant, afterwards, with the House of</hi> Israel, <hi>and</hi> Judah.</p>
                  <p>Then, 1. The party in the New Covenant, is not all Mankind, but the Church of the New Testament; the spiritual <hi>Israel,</hi> and <hi>Iudah.</hi> 2. This Covenant was not brought to light of old, but had its own time of manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station. 3. Even then, the Church was made wise of the imperfection of the Old Covenant, that they might learn to look through the outward form of it, to a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. 4. The Hope, and Too-look, which they had to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the New Covenant, held up their heart, that they, without us, and our Priviledges, should not be perfected.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 9.</hi> Not according to the Covenant that I made with their Fathers, in the day when I took them by the hand, to lead them out of the Land of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> because they continued not in my Covenant, and I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded them not, saith the Lord.</q>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The Prophet distinguisheth the Old Covenant, from the New, by describing the Old, what it was, how broken and how punished. For the first, the ten Commandements, and the rest of the Law delivered unto them, when they came out of</hi> Aegypt, <hi>was the Covenant of Old, wherein God promised, To be their God, upon condition, That they did all that hee commanded them, and, they accepted the condition.</hi> So, albeit there was Grace here, in sundry Articles, covenanted, yet the form of the Covenant, was like the Covenant of Works. Compare <hi>Ier.</hi> 17.23. with <hi>Ier.</hi> 31.31, 32, 33, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>For the next: They continued not in it, through leaning to their own strength, and seeking to establish their own Righteousness, being ignorant of the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God. They dealt deceitfully in the Covenant, and fell to open Idolatry, from time, to time.</hi> So, By the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works, no man will be found stedfast.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>For the punishment of it</hi>: I regarded them not. <hi>In the</hi> Hebrew, <hi>it is as much, as,</hi> I Lorded it over them. <hi>That is, used My Husbandly and Lordly Authority over them, and so mis-regarded them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whereof wee have to learn, 1. That as Gods Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and Husbandship, is an Obligation of doing well to the Covenant-keeper: So is it a Declaration of his just Freedome, and Authority, to punish the Covenant-breaker. 2. That when God is pleased to exercise his Dominion and Authority over Covenant-breakers, the transgressour falleth in mis-regard with God: that is, As little account is made of his life, as of one without the Covenant. 3. That to be mis-regarded of God, is the sum of all judgement. 4. That the impotency of the people, to keep the Old Covenant, did not exempt them from the punishment due to the breaking of it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>The Lord maketh their instability in the Old Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, the Reason of his making of a New one.</hi> Wherein the Lords bounty is very remarkable; Who, out of our evil, taketh occasion, to do us so much more good: And, because of mens instability in the Old Covenant, maketh another Covenant, whereby hee maketh us to persevere in obedience.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 10.</hi> For, this is the Covenant that I will make with the House of <hi>Israel,</hi> after those daies, saith the Lord: I will put My Laws into their mind, and write Them in their hearts; and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to Mee a People.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This is the better Cevenant, containing better Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, whereof Christ is Mediatour, and Surety, unto all them that beleeve in Him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wherein consider, 1. That all the Articles are Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises; and, so, do require in the party that will joyn in the Covenant, Faith, to embrace the Promises; that the Covenant may be agreed unto on both sides: God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising, and the needy Sinner heartily accepting. 2. That what is required in the Old Covenant, as a Condition, is here turned into a Promise, by God, in the New. In the Old Covenant, hee required obedience to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements: and here hee promiseth, to write his Laws in our hearts. God undertaketh to do our part in us, if wee will beleeve in Him. 3. That the sense of Wants, and the feeling of our Imperfections, yea, of our hearts wickedness, and carefulness, both of heart and mind; yea, the feeling of the inlacks, or defects of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and Faith, are not just hinderances to make a soul that gladly would be reconciled with God, in Christ, stand back, from embracing this Covenant: But, by the contrary, the feeling of sinfulness, in mind, and heart, are Preparations, to fit us, and set us on, to joyn in this Covenant, wherein God undertaketh to help, and reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, all these felt evils, through His Christ, by putting His Laws in our Mind, and writing them in our Hearts. For, what is this else, but t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="247" facs="tcp:49391:131"/>
and more with the understanding of his will, and to frame our hearts and affections to the obedience of the same? 4. That by the Covenant, comfort is provided for sinners, who are humbled in the sense of their sins: and no door opened for presumption, nor room given to prophane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to go on their ways, blessing themselves. For, the maker of the New Covenant presupposeth two things: First, that his party renounce his own righteousness, which he might seem able to have by the Old Covenant. Next, that he flee for relief to God in Christ, to have the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits promised in this New Covenant. Which if he do, it is impossible that he can either lean to his own merits, or live in the love of his sinful lusts. 5. That by this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant such an union is made betwixt God and the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, that the Believer is the Lords adopted childe, and the Lord is the Believers God, all-sufficient for ever, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising to be all to the Believer, which, to be our God, may import, and to make the Believer all that one of his people should be.</p>

                     <hi>Verse 11.</hi> And they shall not teach every man his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: For, all shall know me, from the least to the greatest.</q>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>While he saith,</hi> They shall not teach every man his neighbour, <hi>he doth not mean, that his Word, and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and Ministry appointed by him, or brotherly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, for mutual edification, shall be mis-regarded, or not made use of: But by the contrary, That he will himself be their Teacher in these his own means: First, giving his children a greater measure of the Spirit, and a more neer communion with himself than of old.</hi> 2. <hi>Making his children so wise unto salvation, as they shall not hang their Faith upon mans authority: but search by all means, till they understand the minde of God, the infallible Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as he hath revealed himself in his Word,</hi> 3. <hi>So clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Truth which is outwardly taught unto them, by his own Instruments, after so sure and perswasive a manner, by his Spirit inwardly, that the outward Teaching, shall be no Teaching, in comparison of the inward concurrence; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as we hear those</hi> Samaritans <hi>were taught, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved indeed the womans report, that they might go to Christ: But when they were come to him, got so great sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction from himself, that they said unto her,</hi> Now we believe, not because of thy saying, for we have heard him our selves, and know, that this is indeed that Christ, John 4.42. <hi>So will the Lord inwardly make his Truth powerful unto Salvation to his own, that they may say to those that are his Instruments,</hi> Now we believe, not because of your saying, but because we have heard him our selves.</p>
                  <p>Then, 1. It is not Gods will, that other mens belief should be the Rule of our belief: but that we all search to understand the Scriptures, and Gods will revealed therein. 2. It is easie from this ground, to answer that famous question, <hi>How know you such and such grounds of Salvation?</hi> We answer, <hi>It is an Article of the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> They shall be all taught of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>He saith,</hi> They shall all know me, from the least to the greatest.</p>
                  <p>Then 1. The New Covenant admitteth all Ranks and Degrees of persons, and excludeth none, high nor low, that love to embrace it. 2. It may be, in sundry points of truth, some of them be ignorant and mistaken, more than other some: But of the saving knowledge of God in Christ, they shall all have light, in a saving measure. 3. The greatest, as well as the meanest, in whatsoever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of Place or Gifts, must be Gods Disciples in the study of saving Knowledge, and hearty obedience.</p>

                     <hi>Vers. 12.</hi> For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins, and their iniquities will I remember no more.</q>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>To make us believe the former Promises, he addeth to a New Article, of the Remission of sins: because from the Conscience of those, ordinarily do arise our doubts and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of drawing near to God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. The conscience of sin, must not drive us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from God: but rather force us to run unto God more humbly: because, onely to such as come unto him, in his Christ, is remission of sin promised. 2. Whatsoever sort of sins they be, unrighteousness, or sin, or inquity, they shall not hinder God to be gracious to the penitent, fleeing to this Covenant for refuge.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>In saying,</hi> For I will be merciful, 1. He maketh his mercy, pardoning sin, the reason of his bestowing the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer good things: His giving of one grace, the reason of giving another, even grace for grace. 2. He maketh his mercy the ground of all this favour, and nothing in the mans person, or works, or worthiness of his faith. 3. The word <hi>Merciful,</hi> is in the Original, <hi>Pacified</hi>; and doth import both Gods respect to the propitiatory sacrifice of Christ, which pacifieth him towards us; and also our duty in looking towards it, as the price of our reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>In that the Lord joyneth the promise, of putting his Law in the minde, and writing it in our heart, with the promise of remission of sins, he teacheth us,</hi> That he will have every confederate soul, that seeketh the benefit of this Covenant, to joyn all these benefits together, in their claim, with remission of sin, seeking to joyn the illumination of their minde, renovation of their heart, and life, at least in their desires and endeavours: and not to sever one of them from another, but study in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightness to have them all.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>While he saith, He will remember their sins no more, he teacheth,</hi> 1. That he will never forgive sin, nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get it, but set it ever in his sight, till a man enter into this Covenant with him, through Christ. 2. That when he hath forgiven sin, he forgeteth sin also: whatsoever he remitteth, he removeth from his remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 13.</hi> In that he saith, A New Covenant, he hath made the first Old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old, is ready to vanish away.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>From the name that the Lord giveth this Covenant, in calling it New, he draweth two consequences: The first, that the former Covenant by this word was declared old. Next, that as it was declared old, it was so declared shortly after to be abolished.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then 1. The least word that proceedeth out of Gods mouth, is weighty, and worthy of consideration. 2. Whatsoever Gods word doth import, by due conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence must be taken for Gods truth, and Gods minde, as if it were expressed. 3. Seeing Christ is come, and the time is now of this New Covenant, we know, that by Gods authority, the Levitical, ordinances, and whole form of the Legal Covenant, and ceremonial forms of worship are abrogated.</p>

                     <p>THen, That you may see this more clearly, let us take view of the typical Ordinances, in the Old Covenant, and of their accomplishment in Christ, under the Old Covenant, and typical Tabernacle, there were sundry shadows, <hi>vers.</hi> 1, 2. The Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle divided in two rooms, and their furniture with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in them both, <hi>vers,</hi> 3, 4, 5. In the outer room the Priests resorted daily, <hi>vers.</hi> 6. In the inner room, onely the High Priest, once a year, <hi>vers.</hi> 7. The close-keeping of which room, signified, that the way to Heaven, was not to be fully clear, during the time of those shadows, <hi>vers.</hi> 8.

All being but temporary shadows, imposed till Christ came, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form all, <hi>vers.</hi> 10. But when Christ came, hee gave to those shadows, accomplishment. For, hee was Priest of the true Tabernacle of his own Body, signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the typical Tabernacle, <hi>vers.</hi> 11. And, by his own blood, entred into Heaven, for our Eternal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, <hi>vers.</hi> 12. For, if the types procured a Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial

And, therefore, that Remission of sins, and Eternal Life, might be given to the faithful, both then of old, and now, hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved, by his office, to make his Testament, and die, <hi>vers.</hi> 15.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Whereof wee learn,</hi> 1. That as other things were typed under the Law, so also was our Justification, and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of obtaining the same, shadowed forth. 2. That those things which then were called Justifications, were so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led onely because they were the representations of the way of obtaining Justification: for they did not justifie. 3. That albeit Justification be onely one, yet the types therefore were many: no one of them being able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press the truth, but in part.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>By calling them</hi> Ordinances of Divine Service, <hi>hee teacheth us,</hi> That sometime, those Ceremonies which are now abolished, were, during their own time, parts of Gods external worship, in regard of the Commandement of God injoyning them.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Hee setteth before our eyes, the pleasant face of Gods outward worship; that, in the wise appointing of every thing, for place, for division of rooms, for furniture, for ornaments, for materials, for persons, for actions, for or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of doing, wee may behold the Glory, not onely of the appointer of them, but also, the glory of the Church, and of Heaven, and of Christ, and of his Saints, represented thereby, as far above the glory of those outward things, as heavenly, and spiritual things, are above earthly; as the particular Exposition of the meaning of the Types, in their own proper place, will make plain, which wee cannot meddle with here, seeing the Apostle judgeth it, not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent.</hi>

                     <hi>Hee expoundeth what the High Priests going through the Veil but once a year, did mean, saying, the Holy Ghost signified something thereby.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. The Holy Ghost is the Author of these Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of <hi>Levi,</hi> and of matters appointed about that Old Tabernacle, as of the expressions of his own mind to the Church: and, so, hee is very God. 2. The Holy Ghost, is a distinct person of the God-head, exercising the proper actions of a person, subsisting by himself, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting the Ordinances of the Church, teaching the Church, and interpreting the meaning of the Types unto the Church. 3. The Church under the Law was not altogether ignorant of the spiritual signification of the Levitical Ordinances, because the Holy Ghost was then teaching them the meaning. 4. Those Rites and Ceremonies were not so dark in themselves, as they could not be in any sort understood: but were expressions of the mind of God, to the Church of that time.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>That which the Holy Ghost did signifie was this,</hi> That the way unto the holiest of all, was not yet made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, while as the first Tabernacle was yet standing.</p>
                  <p>Then, That the holiest of all represented Heaven, the Old Church did know.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Hee saith not that the way to Heaven was closed, but not clearly manifested.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, They knew the way to Heaven, darkly, through the Veil of Types. 2. They knew there was a time of clearer light comming.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>The time of the endurance of this not clear manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the way to Heaven, is set down to be,</hi> Whilst the first Tabernacle was standing.</p>
                  <p>Then the Old Church was taught, 1. That the clear light of the way to Heaven, was not to be revealed while those shadows, and that Tabernacle endured. 2. That when the clear manifestation of that way should come by the Messias; that Tabernacle was not to stand. 3. That when God should cause that first Tabernacle to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, the true light was at hand. 4. That none should receive the clear light of the way to Heaven, but such as should renounce the Ordinances of the first Tabernacle.</p>
                  <p>And so the Apostle, by the authority of the Holy Ghost, enforceth these Hebrews either to renounce the Levitical Ordinances, or to be deprived of the true light of the way to Heaven now revealed.</p>

                     <hi>He sheweth the use of the Tabernacle and the imperfection of the service thereof, saying,</hi> The Tabernacle was a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure for the time then present, <hi>Whereby he giveth us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,</hi> 1. That the Tabernacle was a type and figure of Christ. 2. That it was not appointed for all time to come, but for that present time of the Churches Non-age. 3.

For, otherwise, the Apostle testifieth here, the outward offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings could not perfect them in the conscience. 3. That when Remission of sin, and Attonement, is promised in the Law, upon the offering of these gifts, as <hi>Levit.</hi> 14.9. and 17.11. the form of speech is Sacramental, joyning the virtue of the Sacrifice of Christ, signified by the offering of the figurative Sacrifices unto the Beleever. 4.

                  <p>Then, There is a two-fold consideration to be had, of the Levitical Ceremonies: One, as they are joyned with the significations; and, so, promises were made of Attonement, by them in the Law. Another, as they were looked upon, by themselves, separate from their signification, as the carnal Jews took them, and rested on them; and, so, they could not perfect the conscience.</p>

For, our Tabernacles are builded by natural generation, of man and woman, with propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of original sin: But, Christs Body, in a singular man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, even by the special operation of the Holy Ghost, in the womb of the Virgin: And, so, without original sin.</hi>

                     <hi>Vers. 12.</hi> Neither by the Blood of Goats and Calves: but by his own Blood hee entred in, once, into the holy place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> having obtained eternal Redemption for us.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The opposition goeth on</hi>: 1. The Levitical High Priest entred into the typical holy place: But Christ entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the holy place properly so called: that is, into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Levitical Priest entred often into the holy place: Christ entred but once into Heaven. Hereby the Levitical Priests entry was declared to be imperfect, because it behoved to be repeated: But Christs entry into Heaven, to be perfect, because but once, not to be repeated.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Levitical Priests entred by the blood of Goats and Calves: But Christ entred by his own blood.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>And if Christ entred but once into Heaven, after his Suffering</hi>; Then, Wee must not think, that his Body is any where else, but in Heaven onely, wherein it is once onely entred.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>If the blood whereby Christ entred into Heaven, was his own blood,</hi> Then, 1. Verily, Christs Body was like ours, in substance, having blood in it, as ours: and, wee must not conceive otherwise of his body, than to be of the same substance, and substantial properties with ours. 2. The blood belonged to the same person, to whom the properties of God belongeth, so often in this Epistle at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed unto Christ. His Blood, was the blood of God, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28. That is, the same Jesus, was God and man, with flesh and blood, in one person.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>The Fruit of Christs bloody Sacrifice, hee maketh,</hi> The Eternal Redemption of those for whom hee offered it: <hi>And, to the typical Sacrifice, hee ascribeth no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption at all, in the comparison. Thereby giving us to understand,</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. That from the worlds beginning, to the end there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, salvation of sinners is by way of Christs Redemption: That is, by his loosing them, through payment of a price. 2. That the Redemption was manifested to have force, when after his bloody Sacrifice hee entred into Heaven. 3. That such as are once redeemed by Christ, are Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally Redeemed: not for a time, to fall away again: but eternally to be saved, most certainly.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Vers. 13.</hi> For, if the blood of Bulls, and of Goats, and the Ashes of an Heifer, sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh.</p>

                        <hi>Vers. 14.</hi> How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the Eternal Spirit, offered himself, without spot, to God, purge your consciences from dead works, to serve the living God?</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To prove, that eternal Redemption is the fruit of Christs Sacrifice, he reasoneth thus, If the Typical Sacrifices and Rites of old were able to work that for which they were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained; that is, external Sanctification: Much more shall Christs true Sacrifice be able to work that for which it was appointed; that is, Eternal Remission of sins, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Sanctification, unto eternal life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then there are two sorts of Sanctification: One, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, of the flesh, which maketh a man holy to the Church, whatsoever he be within. Another, internal, of the conscience and inner man, which maketh a man holy before God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The purifying of the flesh, <hi>he maketh to be by the exercise of such and such Ordinances of Divine Service for the time.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then External, or Church-holiness of the outward man, is procured by such and such exercises of Divine Ordinances in the Church, as serve to make a man to be reputed and holden for clean before men, and so to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived for a member of the Church: as is to be seen, <hi>Numb.</hi> 19.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>From his form of reasoning, we learn,</hi> That whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver liberty, and access of coming to the Church, was made to the Jew of old, by these ceremonies of the Law, as much and more liberty is made to the Christian, to come in to God, by the blood of Christ.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>In describing Christs Sacrifice, he saith,</hi> Christ, through the Eternal Spirit offered himself, without spot to God.</p>
                  <p>Then 1. Christ is both the Sacrifice and the Priest, in one person. He offered himself as man, through the Eternal Spirit, that is, by the vertue and power of his own Godhead, by which he preached, before his Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to sinners, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.19. 2. His sacrifice was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out spot. He was that spotless Lamb, in whom was no sin, nor imperfection, nor defect of any thing that the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice required. 3. The vertue of the sacrifice, which made it to purchase Eternal Redemption unto us, floweth from the infinite worth of his Eternal Godhead. 4. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit Christs two natures, have their distinct respects in the actions of his Office, yet Christ is one, and undivided in the execution of his Office.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>The fruit and force of the sacrifice, is set down in this, that this</hi> Blood shall purge our conscience from dead works, to serve the living God: <hi>That is, shall both ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve a man from his foregon sin, and also enable him to serve God for time to come.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. Sins are but dead works, flowing from na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture dead in sin; and not onely deserving, but also draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on death upon the sinner. 2. The conscience lieth polluted with the filthiness of dead works, till the vertue of the blood of Jesus applied, bring intimation of abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution. 3. Christs blood doth not purge the Conscience from dead works, that a man should go wallow in them again; but that he may serve the living God more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptably. 4. The purging vertue of Christs blood, is joyned with the sanctifying, and renewing of the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved sinner: and what God hath conjoyned, let no man put asunder.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 15.</hi> And for this cause, he is the Mediator of the New Testament; that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions which were under the first Testament, they which are called, might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the promise of eternal inheritance.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Now, lest any man should stumble at Christs death, he sheweth a necessity thereof, in respect of his office of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation, and the purchase to be made by his Redemption. The force of the reason is this, Remission of sins could not have been given under the Law, except the Mediator had been to pay the price of the same under the Gospel: Nor could the faithful and called ones, either then or now, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain eternal life for an inheritance, otherwise than by the Mediators death: Therefore it behoved the true Mediator<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by means of death, to pay the promised price of the purchase of remission of sins and eternal life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. The remission of transgressions, and the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of eternal life, are both fruits of Christs Passion, 2. The fruits of his Passion extended themselves unto them who were under the Old Testament, as well as unto us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the New. 3. The way of purchase of these benefits, was by Redemption; that is to say, by lawful purchase, such as might satisfie justice. 4. The way in special, was by means of the Mediators death: His life was laid down, to redeem ours: His one life, as good as all ours. 5. For this cause Christ took the office of a Mediator unto himself, that he might have right and interest by death, to make this purchase. 6. And therefore except he had really died, the purchase could not have been lawfully made.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 16.</hi> For where a Testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the Testator.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Another reason to prove the necessity of Christs death, from the force of the word</hi> Covenant, <hi>which signifieth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so a</hi> Testament. <hi>The force of the reason is this, Christ</hi> (Jer. 31.31.) <hi>promised to make a</hi> New Covenant; <hi>and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore also a</hi> New Testament: <hi>&amp; i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> to make a</hi> New Testament, <hi>then also he promised to dye. The Articles of the</hi> Covenant <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so evinceth it to be a</hi> Testament; <hi>and the promiser bound to make his word good, and so to dye: For</hi> Jer. 31. <hi>the Lord Christ promiseth to reconcile his people to God, to take away their sins, and to be their God. Iustice required satisfaction of them, before they could be reconciled: Satisfaction they could not make themselves, therefore he who promised to make the Reconciliation with God, was bound to make the satisfaction for them to God: and if satisfaction for them, then to undergo the curse of the Law for them, and so to dye.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. The New Covenant is of the nature of a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, and the benefits promised therein; to wit, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sins, Reconciliation, Sanctification, and Life Eternal, are Legacies freely left unto us, by our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>funct Lord, who was dead, and is alive to execute his own will for evermore. The Scripture is the instrument and evidence; the Apostles, Notaries; the Sacraments, are seals; witnesses from Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Spirit; witnesses on earth, the Water, the Blood, and the Spirit. 2. Christ Jesus is both the maker of the Covenant which is in <hi>Ier.</hi> 31. and the Mediator thereof also: the Testator and Executor of that blessed Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 3. Christs death was concluded, and resolved up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and intimated, before he came into the world.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 17.</hi> For a Testament is of force after men are dead, otherwise it is of no strength at all whilest the Testator liveth.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He cleareth his reasoning, from the nature of Testaments amongst men; which, not before, but after a mans death, have force. But here it may be objected,</hi> How can this be, seeing by vertue of the testament of Christ, benefits not a few, were bestowed upon the Church, before his death, from the beginning of the world; not onely Remission of sins and Eternal Life, but also many graces and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings in this life, both bodily and spiritual? <hi>I answer, Albeit Christs death was not accomplished in act till of late, yet for the certainty of his death to follow, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeableness of his minde towards his Church, before his death, he was reckoned both with God, and the Church, for dead; and the promise of laying down his life for his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, accepted for the time, as if it had been performed. For which cause he is called (Rev.</hi> 13.8.) The Lamb slain from the beginning of the world. <hi>And Christ was still represented as a slain man in all these Sacrifices, which the Apostle pointeth at, as meeting this doubt in the next words which follow hereafter,</hi> Vers. 18.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 18.</hi> Whereupon neither the first Testament was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated without blood.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He proveth the necessity of Christs death yet farther. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:49391:133"/>
the Law his bloodshed was represented by types of bloody Sacrifices; therefore it behoved those types to be answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his real bloodshed and death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. What the types of the Law did signifie, Christ behoved to accomplish in verity. 2. The Old Church was taught, that by vertue of the blood signified by these types, the Covenant stood betwixt God and them.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vers. 19.</hi> For when Moses had spoken every Precept, to all the people, according to the Law, he took the blood of Calves, and of Goats, with Water and Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let Wooll, and Hyssope, and sprinkled both the book and all the people;</p>
                     <p n="20">
                        <hi>20.</hi> Saying, This is the blood of the Testament, which God hath enjoyned unto you.</p>
                     <p n="21">
                        <hi>21.</hi> Moreover, he sprinkled with blood, both the Tabernacle, and all the Vessels of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>From Moses example, we learn,</hi> 1. That the Lords Word should be manifested to all the people; and none of them debarred from taking knowledge thereof. 2. That the Word must be spoken plainly, with a distinct voyce, in the common Language, and not muttered in an unknown Tongue. 3. That with the use of holy Rites appointed of God, the Preaching of Gods Word should be joyned, to shew the Institution and force of Gods Ordinances to his people.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>In that the Book, and the People, and Instruments of Service, were all to be sprinkled, we learn,</hi> That every thing which we touch, or meddle with, or make use of, is unclean unto us, were it never so holy in it self, except the Blood of Jesus make it clean unto us, and cleanse us in the using of it.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 22.</hi> And almost all things are by the Law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He saith,</hi> Almost, <hi>because of some purging which was done by washing; and yet even that washing also, drew the Vertue of Ceremonial purging from the Sacrifice where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the washing was annexed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>In saying,</hi> Without shedding of blood, there is no remission of sins, <hi>he teacheth us,</hi> That wheresoever a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice is offered, for obtaining remission of sin, there shedding of blood must really be: and, where an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bloody sacrifice is pretended to be offered, for obtaining remission, it serveth not the purpose; because, <hi>Without shedding of blood there is no remission</hi>: Either therefore, must such as pretend to offer Christ for obtaining the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sin, grant that Christ is daily murthered by them, and his blood shed anew, in their pretended Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, or else, that by their Offering, no new Remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is purchased. But, the truth is, Christs Blood is once shed, and never to be shed again: and, that once Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Blood shedding is sufficient for everlasting remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, without any new Offering of him again.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 23.</hi> It was therefore necessary, that the Patterns of things in the Heavens, should be purified with these: but the Heavenly things themselves, with bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Sacrifices than these.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Another reason of the necessity of Christs death, in force thus much: If things figuratively holy, behoved to be cleansed with the Typical Blood of Beasts: Then things truly holy, behoved to be cleansed with better blood, even the blood of the Messias.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hence we learn,</hi> 1. That for the significations cause, God would not have the Tabernacle, nor any Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Service about it, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e esteemed holy, till blood was shed to sprinkle it: That it might be known thereby, that without the shedding of Christs blood, he would not accept of any thing from us as holy. 2. That the blood of Beasts was sufficient to make representation; but bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter blood, even the Blood of the Messiah, behoved to be shed, to give the truth of the signification. For as far as Heaven is above the earthly sanctuary, and mens souls above the vessels thereof; so far better behoved to be that blood which made souls acceptable to God, and to get entrance into heaven, than the blood of Levitical sacrifices was.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 24.</hi> For Christ is not entred into the Holy Places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into Heaven it self, now to appear in the presence of God for us.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He cleareth the matter, how Christ hath offered a better Sacrifice than the Levitical, yea, and behoved to offer a better, because he is entered into a better Sanctuary; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man, in another manner, and to another end than the High Priest under the Law entred: The comparison goeth thus:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The Levitical High Priest entred into the material and artificial Sanctuary, and a Typical sacrifice became him: But Christ entred not into that Typical Sanctuary: Therefore a Typical Sacrifice became not him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The Levitical High Priest entered bodily into the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurative Sanctuary: But Christ did enter bodily into the true Sanctuary in Heaven it self.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>The High Priest entered in behalf of the people, with the names of the twelve Tribes upon his breast and shoulders: But Christ is entered in, in behalf of us all his People, to appear for us: bearing the particular memory of every Saint in his Memory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The High Priest entered in to appear for a short time; and stayed not within the Sanctuary: But Christ is entred in, to appear now all the time from his Ascension, unto this day, and constantly still, while it is called</hi> Now.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 25.</hi> Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the High Priest entereth into the Holy Place every year, with blood of others.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He proveth, that he had offered a better Sacrifice than the Levitical, because he behoved to offer an Offering not to be repeated, as the Levitical: and so a more perfect Offering. The comparison goeth in dissimilitudes</hi>:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The High Priest entered in with the blood of others, But Christ entered in with his own blood.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The High Priest made an Offering of other things than himself: But Christ did offer himself.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then the Offering of Christ, is the personal action of Christ himself. None can, nor may offer him, but himself: <hi>For the Priest must be either better than the Sacrifice, or as good, at least, as the Sacrifice: But none can be so good as Christ, nor be more excellent, or better; therefore, none can offer Christ but himself.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>The High Priest offered his Sacrifice oftner: But Christ offered not himself oftner than once.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, to imagine an Offering of Christ often, is both to give the lye to this Text, and to make Christs Offering by repeating of it imperfect, and like to the Levitical, <hi>For if once offering of Christ be sufficient, often offering is su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous. And if often offering be needful, then that once offering was not sufficient, and so was not perfect, which were blasphemy to say.</hi> 2. If any man pretend to offer Christ often, it is not Christ that giveth him warrant so to do: For here it is declared, That he hath no hand in offering himself often.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 26.</hi> For, then must be often have suffered since the foundation of the world: But now once in the end of the world, hath he appeared, to put away sin, by the sacrifice of himself.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He proveth, That Christ cannot be often offered</hi>; Because then (<hi>saith he</hi>) must he often have suffered. Then,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. No Offering of Christ, without the suffering of Christ: His Passion and Death is inseparable from his Sacrifice. If Christ were often offered, he behoved to be often slain and put to death: But that cannot be, that he should suffer and be slain oftner: therefore, he cannot be offered up in a sacrifice oftener. And they who will take upon them to offer Christ again and again, take upon them to slay him, and put him to new suffering again &amp; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. 2. The offering of Christ in an unbloody sacrifice, is a

a vain imagination, which the Apostle acknowledgeth not: For, if that were possible, then were the Apostles words here false, and his reasoning ridiculous; which were blasphemy to say.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Hee saith,</hi> He behoved to have suffered often, since the beginning of the World; <hi>Because as often as new sins were committed, and new Remission was to be bestowed, as often behoved hee to have suffered, to expiate these sins, and to purchase the new Remission, since the beginning of the World: But this is impossible; Therefore his Offering often, is impossible.</hi> Then,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They who make it needful, to offer Christ often, make it needful, also, that Hee should have taken on flesh sooner than Hee did, and been slain sooner than Hee was, and slain as often as new sins were to be expiated, and forgiven, from the beginning of the world. And, so, by this vain conceit they do ranverse all the wisdome of God about Christ, and set to Him an Order, and Course of their own, making themselves wiser than God. 2. It is by the Apostles estimation, as vain a conceit, and as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to offer Christ oftner than once, now, in the end of the world, as to have offered Him before Hee came in the flesh, since the beginning of the world.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But, now, <hi>(saith hee)</hi> once in the end of the world, hee hath appeared, to put away sin, by the Sacrifice of himself. Then,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. No Sacrifice of Christ, doth the Apostle acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but such as is joyned with His bodily appearance in the world for that end. Once hath Hee appeared, and once onely hath Hee sacrificed Himself, saith the Apostle. 2. The Apostle understood no Offering of Christ, but onely one, and once to be offered, for time fore-gone, or time to come, from the beginning of the world, unto the end thereof. 3. This one Offering once offered, was sufficient to expiate the sins of the saved, before it was offered: and therefore, must have force also, to expiate the sins of the saved without repetition now, after it is once offered. 4. Whose sins Christ doth take away, for those Hee appeared, for those Hee made a Sacrifice of Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self: And, whose sins Hee doth not put away, for those Hee appeared not, Hee sacrificed not.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>In calling the time of Christs Suffering,</hi> The end of the world, <hi>hee giveth us to understand,</hi> That there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be so much time betwixt Christs First and Second Comming, as was betwixt the worlds beginning, and his First Comming: But a great deal of less time, need force: else, were not that time the end of the world.</p>

                     <hi>Hee applyeth the Common Law, of</hi> dying once, <hi>to Christ, saying,</hi> Christ was once offered, to bear the sins of many.</p>
                  <p>Then, 1. It is as unreasonable, that Christ should offer Himself oftner than once, as it is to exact of Him, the laying down of His life oftner than once: for, that is to exact more than the severity of Gods Justice requireth of Him. 2. Christs Death was not for any sin in Him, but for our sins. 3. Hee took not away the sins of every man in particular (for, many dye in their sins, and bear their own judgement) but the sins of many: the sins of his own Elect People, <hi>Mat.</hi> 1.21. <hi>Hee shall save his people from their sins.</hi>

That the defraying the Debt of the sins of such, for whom Christ hath undertaken, lyeth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Christ, and not upon the Beleevers, for whom hee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook. 2. And, that if his once sacrificing himself for them, did not expiate their sins sufficiently, then Sin should cleave unto Christ, until His second comming. 3.

                  <p>THat hee may yet further show the impossibility of offering Christ oftner, hee giveth the often repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of Levitical Sacrifices, year by year, for a reason of their imperfection and inability to perfect the worshiper: and therefore, of necessity Christs Sacrifice could not be repeated, except wee should make it imperfect, like the Levitical, and unable to perfect the worshiper, as the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Sacrifice was.</p>
                  <p>The force of his reasoning is this: The most solemn Sacrifice offered by the High-Priest himself, <hi>Levit.</hi> 16. and lest subject to repetition of all the Sacrifices, being offered not so often as each month, or each week, or each day, as some Sacrifices were, but once a year onely; yet, because they were repeated, year by year, they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, by this means, unable ever to make the commers thereunto perfect. Therefore, Christs Sacrifice could not be often offered; lest, for that same reason, it should be found imperfect also. And, this is his drift in <hi>vers.</hi> 1.</p>
                  <p>Hee proveth his reason to be good, thus: If they could have perfected the commer, then they should not have been repeated, but ceased from being offered, because they should have delivered the worshiper, perfectly, from sin: and, having done that, the repetition was to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, <hi>vers.</hi> 2. But they did not free the worshiper from sin; for, still after offering hee professed himself guilty (for any thing these Sacrifices could do) by offering of a new offering, <hi>vers.</hi> 3. And no wonder, because such Sacrifices were not worthy to expiate sin; and, so, unable to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way sin: and, so also, unable to quiet the conscience.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 1.</hi> For, the Law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very Image of the things, can never, with those Sacrifices which they offered year by year continually, make the commers thereunto, perfect.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>THE Old Covenant is called the</hi> Law, <hi>because it was drawn up in a Legal form, upon conditions of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the Law: and Grace and Life in Iesus Christ to come, were set before them in shadows, not in a clear manner, as in the Gospel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. In the Old Covenant, the Law was expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly urged, and Grace in the <hi>Messias</hi> covered, and hid, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Veils. 2. Christ, and his Grace, and the good things which come by him, were not so hid, but they might have been seen, albeit but darkly, being as by their sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, represented. 3. The revealing of Christ, and his benefits, under the Gospel, and under the Law, differ as far in measure of light, as the shadow of a thing, and the lively image thereof, drawn with all the lineaments. For, they saw Christ, and Righteousness, and Eternal Life through him, as those which are in the house see the shadow of a man comming, before hee enter within the doors: but, wee, with open face, behold in the Gospel, as in a Mirrour, Christs Glory shining; Christ, in the preaching of his word, crucified before our Eyes, as it were, and bringing with him life, and immortality, to light.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Hee maketh the repeating of the Sacrifices, a reason of their inability to perfect the commers thereunto: That is, perfectly to satisfie for those, who came to the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and to sanctifie, and save them, in whose name it was offered.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. A Sacrifice that perfectly satisfieth Gods Justice for sin, cannot be repeated: and, a Sacrifice which hath need to be repeated, hath not perfectly satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Gods Justice for the sinner, nor perfected the sinner, for whom it is offered, by doing all that Justice required, to purchase Justification, Sanctification, and Salvation, to him. 2. Whosoever will have Christ offered up in a Sacrifice oftner than once, whether by himself, or by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, denieth the perfection of that Sacrifice on the Cross; denieth, that by that one Sacrifice purchase is made of all that, is required to perfect sinners, which is fearful blasphemy.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 2.</hi> For then would they not have ceased to be offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, because that the worshipers once purged, should have had no more conscience of sin.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>By way of question, hee asketh,</hi> Would not those Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices have ceased to be offered, if they could have made the commers thereunto perfect?</p>
                  <p>Then, The Apostle esteemeth this Reason so clear, that any man, of sound judgement, being asked the question, must, of necessity, grant it. For, Natures light doth teach thus much, That if a Sacrifice do all that is to be done for the sinner, it standeth there, because there is no more to do. If it pay the full price of the sinners expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, at once offering, what need can there be to offer it over again? And therefore, if Christs one Sacrifice, once offered, perfect the commers thereunto, must it not cease to be offered any more, by this reasoning of the Apostle? For, if he have made a perfect purchase of whatsoever is required to perfect us, by once offering, Wisdome, and Justice will not suffer the price of the purchase to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered again. And if hee must be offered again, hee hath not perfected the purchase for us, by any Offering going before.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The Apostle his Reason, why a Sacrifice which perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the worshiper, must cease to be offered, is; Because, that the worshiper once purged, should have no more conscience of sins. By which hee meaneth not, that the purged wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shiper may do, hereafter, what hee listeth, and make no conscience. to sin: nor yet, that after hee is purged, and falleth into a new sin, hee should not take with his guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and repent, and run again to the benefit of that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice: But this hee meaneth, That the purging of his conscience, by virtue of a perfect Sacrifice, is such, that hee is freed from the just challenge, and condemnatory Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the conscience, for that sin wherefrom hee is purged.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="254" facs="tcp:49391:135"/>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> How is it then, <hi>will you say,</hi> that many of Gods Children are often times troubled with the guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their Conscience, for those same sins which they have repented and sought pardon for through Christs sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, and found remission intimated, and peace granted?</p>
                  <p>I answer, <hi>Not for any imperfection of the sacrifice, or of their remission; but for the weakness of their holding of the ever-flowing Vertue of that once offered sacrifice, and the remission granted there-through.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. He that is purged by vertue of the sacrifice of Christ, hath Gods Warrant to have a quiet and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able conscience. 2. And if he have a challenge, after he is fled to this sacrifice, he may, by Gods approbation, stop the same, by opposing the vertue of that perfect sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to the challenge.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>The comers unto the sacrifice, to have benefit thereby,</hi> vers. 1. <hi>are here called</hi> Worshippers, <hi>vers.</hi> 2.</p>
                  <p>Then, the Lord reckoneth it a part of Divine service and worship done unto him, to come and seek the benefit of that sacrifice, whereby he is pacified, and we ransomed.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>To make the worshipper perfect,</hi> v. 1. <hi>is expounded, by pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging them, &amp; delivering them from the conscience of sin,</hi> v. 2.</p>
                  <p>Then, that sacrifice which purgeth the conscience from sin, doth also perfect the man: Neither needeth he any thing unto salvation, which such a sacrifice doth not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase. And such is that once offered sacrifice of Christ.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>He proveth, That the Levitical sacrifices took not away the conscience of sin, because there was a yearly comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration made of the same sins; not onely of that year, but also of former: yea, beside the commemoration expresly done by the Priest, even in these repeated sacrifices, saith he, there was in effect, a real taking up again of those sins for which sacrifice had been offered before: because the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of sacrifice a new, did plainly import, That by no preceding sacrifice was the ransome of the sinner payed. And so in effect, the Sacrificers did profess, That for any thing which the former sacrifice could merit, their sins re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained unexpiated.</hi>

                  <p>Quest. <hi>But you will ask,</hi> Were not Believers under the Law, purged from their sins, and made clean, and white as snow? Psal. 51.7.</p>
                  <p>I answer, <hi>Yes, indeed; but not by vertue of those Typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal sacrifices, but by vertue of the sacrifice signified by them; to wit, the sacrifice of the true Lamb of God, which ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth away the sins of the World. And therefore, when At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement and expiation of sin is attributed to the Levitical sacrifices, as</hi> Lev. 17.11. <hi>the form of speech is Sacrament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, the property of the thing signified being ascribed to the sign, as was marked before.</hi>

                     <hi>Quest.</hi> But do not we Christians make a commemoration of our sins year by year? yea daily remembring even the sins of our youth, &amp; deprecating the wrath which they deserve?</p>
                  <p>I answer, <hi>It is true, we do; but not by way of offering a sacrifice, as they: for of them it is said here,</hi> In those sacrifices there is a remembrance of sin.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> What is the difference betwixt commemoration of sin, without renewd sacrifice, and commemoration of sin, with renewed sacrifices? betwixt the Jews comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration of sins year by year, spoken of in this place, and the commemoration which true Christians do make?</p>
                  <p>I answer, <hi>The Iew in his solemn Commemoration of sin, by renewed sacrifice, did really profess two things: One, That no sacrifice formerly offered, was sufficient to expiate his sin, or cleanse his conscience. Another, That he had not sufficiently holden by Faith, that signified sacrifice which was to come; but had need, through the Spectacles and Transparent of these typical sacrifices enjoyned for his help, to take a new view of that true sacrifice which was to come; of both which, the repeated sacrifice did bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.

                     <hi>Quest.</hi> But, what if with the commemoration of sins, year by year, and day by day, we should pretend to joyn a Sacrifice, that new expiation might be made, by offering of Christ over again, as is pretended to be done now adays?</p>
                  <p>I answer, <hi>By so doing, we should take away the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, which the Apostle here putteth betwixt the Levitical sacrifices and Christ, and make Christs no better than theirs: We should avow, That Christs sacrifice on the Cross, done by himself, was not a full ransome for our sins; but, that a mans offering were able to do that which Christs sacrifice on the Cross had not done. Finally, with the Iew we should avow, that the true and satisfactory sacrifice, were not as yet come; nothing heretofore being done, which were able to pacifie God, or purge the Worshippers from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of sin: For if a man think, that the price of expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of sin be already payed, he doth but mock Gods justice, and disgrace the Price payed, if he presume to pay the Price over again.</hi>

                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 4.</hi> For it is not possible, that the blood of Bulls and of Goats should take away sins.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He giveth a Reason, why these Sacrifices could not pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie the conscience, even because it is not possible, that they should take away sin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. The conscience can never be purged, except it see sin taken away by a perfect sacrifice, and a ransome so worthy, as justice may be satisfied. 2. It is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible that Attonement was properly made by the Levitical sacrifice, but onely figuratively; because here it is said, <hi>It was impossible they could take away sins.</hi> 3. Sin is not wiped away by any unworthy mean: for, sin being the breach of the Law of nature, and of the written Law, Gods Majestie so glorious, his Justice so exact, his Truth in threatning death to the offender, so constant, no less worthy sacrifice can expiate sin, than that which is of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue to answer all these.</p>

                        <hi>Vers. 5.</hi> Wherefore, when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not; but a body hast thou prepared me.</p>
                     <p n="6">
                        <hi>6.</hi> In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin, thou hast had no pleasure.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>He proveth, by testimony of the</hi> 40 Psalm, <hi>vers.</hi> 6, 7, <hi>&amp;c. That these sacrifices did never, by themselves, pacifie God: and therefore, were not to endure longer than Christ should come, to fulfil what they did signifie; and so abolish them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then of necessity, the Old Church was not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ignorant of the imperfection of their Legal service, for removing of their sins; and that the true expiation of their sins signified by these sacrifices, was to be sought in the Messias.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Christ <hi>is brought in by the Prophet,</hi> coming into the world: <hi>that is, taking on our nature, and manifesting himself in the flesh: because, by the Word, he is set before the Church of that time as incarnate, removing the Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Sacrifices, and offering himself in their place.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, the Word of God bringeth all Divine Truth to a present being unto Faith: and so, by prophecie, made Christ incarnate, present unto the Faith of the Fathers under the Law.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Christs <hi>words unto the Father, are,</hi> Sacrifice and oblation thou wouldest not; but a body hast thou pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared me: <hi>Which is in substance the same with,</hi> Mine ear hast thou opened, <hi>or,</hi> bored unto me, <hi>in the</hi> Hebrew, Psal. 40.6. <hi>For, if the Father open the ear of his son, by making him a wise servant for the work of Redemption: If he bore his ear, by making him a willing and obedient Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, then must he also prepare a Body unto him, and bring him into the world, by incarnation, that he may accomplish that service as became.</hi>

                     <pb n="255" facs="tcp:49391:135"/>Then, 1. Christs Body is of Gods preparation, and fitting made of God, so holy, and harmless, so free of sin, as it should be fit to be joyned with the God-head of the Son, and fit to be an expiatory Sacrifice for sin. 2. The Sacrifice of Christs Body, and the obedience done to God in it by him, is the Accomplishment and Substance of these Sacrifices. 3. God was never pleased, nor pacified by these Sacrifices, in themselves; but by Christs Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, signified by them. 4. God prepared a Satisfaction to himself, for us, when wee could not.</p>

                     <hi>Vers. 7.</hi> Then said I, Loe, I come (in the Volume of Thy Book it is written of Mee) to do Thy Will, O God.</q>
                  <p>Then <hi>said Christ,</hi> Lo, I come, to do Thy Will, O God; <hi>That is, When the Legal Sacrifices are found and declared unable to pacifie God, Christ</hi> Then <hi>findeth it the fit time to come into the world; and, to do that which the Sacrifices did fore-signifie, but could not effectuate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. Christ did not think it the due time for himself to come into the world, till it should be found, that without him, neither God could be satisfied, nor man saved, by any other mean, but by his obedience. 2. Christ assumed our nature, and offered himself in our room, to the Father, willingly: ready to perform what the Fathers Will could exact of us: yea, earnestly desired he to discharge that service for us, <hi>Blessed be His Name,</hi> for that willingness, even for evermore. 3. Speaking as in our nature, now incarnate, hee calleth the Father, his God. So Christ, as Man, hath our God, for his God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>One of the Reasons of his Offer-making, is,</hi> In the Volume of Thy Book it is written of Mee: <hi>That is, So is it decreed, and fore-prophesied, in the Scripture of Mee, That I should satisfie Thee, O Father, and do Thy Will, for Man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. Christ hath a great respect to the Scripture, to have all things fulfilled which are there spoken: though it should cost him his life, hee will have it done. 2. Hee desireth, that before wee look upon his manner of redeeming us, wee should look to the prophecies which went before of him in the Scripture. 3. The sum of Gods Decree, and of his Scripture, which revealeth his Decree, is, That God will save Man, by Christ: or, That the Son shall be incarnate, and do the Fathers will, for redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Man: that the Seed of the Woman, shall tread down the head of the Serpent, is amongst the first Oracles of Gods Good-Will to Man,</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Now, the Apostle gathereth from the words of the</hi> Psalm <hi>set down,</hi> vers. 5, 6. <hi>that the Levitical Sacrifices are abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, and taken away, because they could not please God; and, from the words of the</hi> Psalm <hi>set down,</hi> vers. 7. <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth, That Christs Sacrifice is that onely which pleaseth God, now come in the room of the Levitical.</hi>

                  <p>Then, 1. Clear Consequences drawn from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, are sound Doctrine. 2. Collation of places doth yeeld both ground of good consequences, and ground of clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. 3. The abolishing of Levitical Sacrifices is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that Christs Sacrifice may have the full place, and room, for pleasing of God, and saving of us.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>The Apostle sheweth what this Will was, and how it is accepted by the Father. The Will is, That Christ should offer up his own Body, in a Sacrifice,</hi> once for all. <hi>If but</hi> once, Then, 1. It is not the Fathers Will that Christs Body should be offered oftner than once. 2. If but once for <hi>All</hi>; Then, These <hi>All,</hi> for whom hee offered, were condescended upon, betwixt the Father, and the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour. God knew those whom hee gave to the Son, to be ransomed: and Christ knew those whom hee bought. 3. If but <hi>once</hi> for those <hi>All</hi>; Then, That <hi>once</hi> made a perfect Purchase for all those: The Father craved no more for their Ransome. Another offering for them, is needless; For, if it had been needful to offer again, once offering had not satisfied Gods Will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for their Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>For the Fathers Acceptation, and Fruit of it, he saith,</hi> By this Will; <hi>to wit, being obeyed,</hi> wee are sanctified; <hi>that is, I and you, and the rest of our society, Elect, are separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the perishing world, and consecrated, as devoted souls, unto Gods use, as holy Vessels of Honour, reconciled in due time, regenerate, and by degrees, at length, throughly made free of sin, and endued with Gods Image, in holiness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. Those onely who are of the Apostles socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, set apart for Gods use, by Election, before time, and Regeneration in time, those sanctified Ones, are those <hi>All,</hi> for whom Christ offered himself. 2.

                  <p>Then, Christs Sacrifice never was offered, nor shall be for ever offered, but once, say the contrary who will.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>In the Levitical Priesthood, they offered the</hi> same Sacrifice oftentimes, <hi>That is, Multitudes of Sacrifices, of the same kind.

                  </p>
                  <p>Then, no sort of plurality doth Christs Sacrifice admit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> seeing it is one onely, and onely once offered.

                  <p n="5">5. <hi>In the Levitical Priesthood,</hi> many Priests, many Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, oftentimes offered, <hi>could</hi> never <hi>take away sin: But Christ, our Priest offered</hi> one offering, <hi>to wit, his own Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi>; once, <hi>and not oftener: and this sufficeth for sin,</hi> for ever, <hi>vers.</hi> 12, 14.</p>
                  <p>Then, that Sacrifice which taketh away sins, must do it at once, and for ever: and that Sacrifice which doth not take away sins at once, and at one offering, shall never be able to take away sins by repetition, how often soever it be offered.</p>

                  <p>Then, 1. Whosoever will have any more offering up of Christ than that one, once offered before his Ascension; denieth that Christ by once offering, hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified 2. Howsoever you take the word <hi>Sanctified,</hi> whether for those that are separated from the world, and dedicated unto God in Christ, in Gods purpose and decree, comprehending all those whom the Father hath given unto Christ out of the world; that is, the elect: or whether you take it for the renewed and san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified in time; the offering of Christ is not but for the sanctified; that is, for such as are consecrated and separated out of the world, and dedicated to be vessels of honor unto God.</p>

The remission that the Fathers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law had, was of the first sort, upon promise of the Mediator to come, and to satisfie. And with remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this sort, a typical sacrifice might stand, for signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying that the true expiatory Sacrifice was not yet paid, but was coming to be paid. But the remission that we get un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Gospel, is upon Satisfaction already made by the true Expiatory and Satisfactory Sacrifice of</hi> Jesus Christ, <hi>done and ended with the personal suffering. And this sort of remission is it, whereof the Apostle here speaketh, and it admitteth no manner of offering for sin; neither typical offering, because Christ is come, and hath fulfilled what the typical sacrifice did signifie: neither the repeating of true Expiatory Sacrifice of Christs Body, because then Christ behoved to suffer daily, and dye daily, after that he hath made satisfaction. And besides these two sorts of offering, the Iewish bloody sacrifices typical, and the true Expiatory bloody Sacrifice of Christs Body on the Cross, the Scripture acknowledgeth none. So the meaning of the Apostle in these words must be this, Where remission of sins is already purchased, by offering of the true Expiatory Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, as now it is, under the New Covenant, there no more offering can be for sin any more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. The Apostle acknowledgeth no use for any sacrifice under the New Testament, after Christs Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, else his reason should not hold. 2. The sacrifice
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:49391:136"/>
which is offered, to wit, the body of JESUS, hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready suffered for sin, so that now the remission of those, that is, of sin and iniquity, all sorts of the Elects sinnes, is obtained thereby already. 3. Not onely <hi>No Sacrifice</hi> is any more to be offered for sin under the New Covenant, but also, <hi>No Offering,</hi> saith hee, bloody or unbloody, is to be offered. 4. That Church which pretendeth to offer any Offering for sins of quick or dead, now under the Gospel, professeth, That no remission of sin is to be had in such a Church, Because where there is remission of sin, there is no more offering for sin, saith the Apostle expresly.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>From the by-past Doctrine of Christs Excellency, and Riches of Grace, which commeth unto us through him, hee draweth Exhortations, for use-making of this Doctrine, in soundness of Faith, and the fruits thereof, unto the end of the Epistle. And first, hee exhorteth to seek unto commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God in Heaven, through Christ, using the terms of the Ceremonial Law, but mixed with words touching the excellency of the thing signified above those Ceremonies: to shew the</hi> Hebrews, <hi>that those Ceremonies had nothing in themselves, but did serve to represent Christ, and his Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits: And so to draw them from those shadows, unto the truth of that, which once being signified by them, is now manifested in Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To make the Exhortation to be the better received, hee setteth down sundry Priviledges of the Faithful,</hi> vers. 19, 20, 21. <hi>From which hee inferreth his Exhortation,</hi> vers. 22. <hi>For the first Priviledge, hee saith,</hi> Wee have liberty to enter into the Holiest: <hi>That is, into Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>In that hee maketh this Priviledge proper to the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of Christians, himself and others; hee teacheth us,</hi> 1. That so long as men are without Christ, they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred out of Heaven; no Door nor Way open, but the flaming sword of Gods justice, to keep out every one that shall press to enter before Christ bring them. But such, as come to Christ by Faith, Heaven is opened unto them, and the Door cast up for them to enter in who were exiled before.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Next, Hee commendeth this Priviledge, by calling the place,</hi> The Holiest, <hi>the place where Gods</hi> Holiness <hi>dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, represented by the Sanctuary, where nothing can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but that which is holy.

That in our prayers to God, wee may use free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of speech, telling him all our mind, all our griefs, all our fears, all our desires, and even poure out our hearts before him, at all times.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Hee commendeth this Priviledge, by the Price of the Purchase thereof, even the blood of Iesus. Whereby he teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us,</hi> 1. To have this Priviledge in high estimation. 2. To make good use of it. 3. To be confident of the standing of it: and all, because it is so dearly bought.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Lastly, Hee commendeth this Priviledge by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Right which all Beleevers have unto it, the Apostle, and these</hi> Hebrews, <hi>as his Brethren, and all other of that Society.

                     <hi>Vers. 20.</hi> By a new and living way, which hee hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated for us, though the Veil, that is to say, his flesh.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This is one Priviledge, That wee have liberty to enter into Heaven, followeth another. There is a way made to lead us on thereunto, which is Christs flesh, compared to the veil of the Sanctuary, which hid those things which were within the Sanctuary, and yet yeelded an entry through it self unto the Sanctuary. So is Christs Flesh the Veil of his God-head, which did hide the glory of his</hi> Deity <hi>from the carnal beholders, who stumbled at his baseness: and yet opened a door for the spiritual man to look in, upon him that was invisible, while as hee observed the brightness of the glory of God, breaking through the Doctrine and works of the man Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Hee maketh the way to be Christs Flesh, or Christ as incarnate, or Christ considered according to his humanity: Because Christs taking on our nature, is the onely mean of reconciling us unto God. No man ever came to the Father but by him. No other Name whereby men are saved, but the Name of</hi> Jesus Christ. <hi>And therefore as in the way a man must enter, and hold on still till hee come to the end, to the place where hee would be: Even so must every man who would be at Heaven, begin at</hi> Christ, <hi>and hold on, making progress in him still, from Faith to Faith, from Grace to Grace, till hee come to his rest.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>This way of</hi> Christs <hi>own making, hee hath devised it, and consecrated it. Hee who is the Fathers wisdome, hath thought it the best way to bring man to GOD, that GOD should become Man, that the Word should be made flesh. The best way to bring men to Heaven, that God should come down to the earth, to take on mans nature up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, that hee might make man partaker of the Divine Nature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Hee hath consecrated and dedicated his flesh, his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, set apart and sanctified himself to this same end, that men might make their means with God, by him, as Man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and by the Bands of Nature with him, be helped up to the Bands of Grace, with GOD, by comming to the man</hi> Christ, <hi>might finde</hi> God <hi>in</hi> Christ.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Hee calleth it a</hi> New Way, 1. <hi>Because of the clear manifesting of the way to Heaven under the Gospel, in comparison of the time of the Law.</hi> 2. <hi>Because a ready, plain, and safe way, without stumbling blocks, pits or snares, dangers or inconveniences, to such as keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves therein, such as new-made waies use to be.</hi> 3. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it waxeth never old, is now established, and never to be altered or abolished.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>It is a</hi> Living Way, 1. <hi>Because</hi> Christ <hi>liveth for ever to help them all to Heaven who seek unto God through him onely.</hi> 2. <hi>Because life is here in Christ, as in the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that hee may give life to whomsoever hee will; that is; unto all that come unto him.</hi> 3. <hi>Because it giveth life and refreshment to the weary passenger, and quickneth his dead and dumpish heart, when hee considereth that his Saviour is a man indeed so earnest to have us saved, that hee hath yoaked himself in communion of nature with us, thereby to save us. It is meat indeed to his soul, that the Word is made flesh: It is drink indeed to consider, that hee hath suffered for our sins. As</hi> Elias <hi>Chariot, so is</hi> Christs <hi>Man-head and sufferings. Get up here by Faith in him, and thou shalt go up to God. This way is that of Eagles wings. Lay first hold upon</hi> Jesus Christ, <hi>God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested in the flesh, and hee will mount up with thee, and carry thee through the wilderness to</hi> Canaan, <hi>from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural misery and sins which thou lyest in, unto Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>This</hi> Way <hi>leadeth through the Veil, to teach us,</hi> That wee comming to Christs Man-head, must not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist there: but by this mean seeking to God, who dwelleth in him, that our Faith and Hope may be in God. Wee enter by the Man Christ, and do rest on God in Christ, on the fulness of the God-head, which dwelleth bodily in Christ. This is to distinguish the Natures of Christ, and to keep the unity of his Person rightly.</p>

                     <hi>For our further satisfaction, he giveth us Christ over again, to make yet more use of him, to direct, guide, and convoy us in the way, to lead us to the Father in Heaven, through the Courts of his Dwelling, and to bring us in to him, and make us welcome there.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. We have Christ for a Priest to us, whose lips do always preserve knowledge, in whom are hid all the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of wisdom and knowledge, who will inform our mindes, and perswade our hearts to believe and obey: who will reconcile by his once offered sacrifice, the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever; will intercede for the reconciled, to keep him still in grace: will bless us, with all spiritual blessings: will take our prayers, thanksgiving, and the spiritual sacrifice of all the good works of our hands, and wash the pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from them: will offer them in our name, with the incense and perfume of his own merits; and lead our selves in, where our Lamps shall be furnished, and our Table filled, till we go into Heaven, and there he will welcome us in a Mansion prepared for us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.

                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 22.</hi> Let us draw near with a true heart, in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>From these Priviledges he presseth an exhortation,</hi> To draw near to God, <hi>and prescribeth the disposition required of us in our drawing near.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>This exhortation sheweth,</hi> 1. That true Christians are oftentimes so sensible of their own unworthiness, that under that sense, they are inclined of themselves to stand afar off; and have need of encouragement and invitation to draw near. 2. That such as are most sensible of their own unworthiness, are most called to come forwards unto GOD: for he giveth grace to the humble.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>He layeth down the Priviledges in the former verses, and in this draweth on the Exhortation: To teach us,</hi> 1. That such priviledges as are granted unto us in Christ, must be received and believed as truth. 2. That we must study to make use of our priviledges, and challenge them for our own. 3. That the weakest of true believers in Christ, may thrust in themselves at the doors of grace, amongst the holy Apostles: For the Apostle put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the Hebrews with himself in the exhortation, for this end.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>For our disposition, and sitting to draw near, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth, first,</hi> That we have a true heart. <hi>He saith not,</hi> a sensless heart, <hi>but,</hi> a true heart, <hi>that is, such a heart, as in the matter of believing, mindeth no confidence but in Gods grace, through Christ onely: And in the matter of Gods service mindeth onely his will in its aim, and alloweth one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that which is his will in its c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nsure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then an honest heart, which honestly acknowledgeth its own sins, and flyeth to Christs blood for sprinkling, whose aim is upright, endeavours upright, and censure of it self upright, allowing in itself nothing but what God alloweth, and displeased with that which displeaseth God, albeit many ways weak and imperfect, yet hath liberty to draw near unto God.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>The next thing he requireth, is</hi> full assurance of faith: <hi>That is, a settled and full perswasion to be accepted, even through</hi> Jesus Christ.</p>
                  <p>Then albeit, the Lord will not despise the weakest measure of faith, and will not quench the smoaking flax; yet it pleaseth him better, yea, it is his commandment, that men study unto the full assurance of faith: for, the more thou restest on Gods Covenant with thee in Jesus Christ, the more thou sealest his truth, glorifiest him, becomest the more like unto faithful <hi>Abraham,</hi> and gettest the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er rooting in Christ.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>The third is,</hi> That the heart be sprinkled from an evil conscience. <hi>The heart is sprinkled, when a sinner, sensible of sin, maketh hearty application to himself of the blood of Iesus for remission of sins: after this, hearty application of</hi> Christs blood, <hi>the conscience is furnished with a good answer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all challenges, and so is made good, a comfortable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, absolving the man through faith in</hi> Jesus, <hi>whom it tormented with challenges, before it ran to the blood of</hi> Jesus <hi>for sprinkling.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, whensoever the conscience is evil, accuseth and vexeth, let the vexed heart run to Christs blood; and then shall it be free from an evil conscience: for the blood of Jesus cleanseth us from all sin. Let the heart be sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and the conscience will be good.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>The fourth thing required in him that draweth near as he should, is,</hi> That his body be washed with pure wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: <hi>That is, That according to the signification of that Legal Rite, their outward conversation be blameless and holy; sin being so curbed within, that it reign not in their mortal body: so foughten against within, as it break not forth in scandalous works of Darkness in the actions of the body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. With a sprinkled conscience within, men must joyn an holy and blameless conversation without. 2. The washing of the conversation without, must pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from an heart sensibly acquainted with the power of the blood of Jesus. 3. And this outward holiness of the body must be wrought with pure water, that is, by the Spirit of Sanctification; to distinguish the reformation of a believer from a counterfeit, who without may look like a righteous man, but within be as a whited Tomb full of rottenness.</p>

                     <hi>Verse 23.</hi> Let us hold fast the Profession of our Faith, without wavering: (for he is faithful that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised.)</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Another Exhortation, to avow the faith of Christ; that is, the doctrine of Christ, the truth received from Christ, and believed, and not to quit it in the time of tryal, upon any condition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The requiring to hold fast the confession of our Faith, or Hope, as the word importeth, teacheth,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. That a true Christian must not onely hold the truth of Christ secretly; but must confess it, profess and avow it openly, where Gods glory, and others good requireth the same. 2. That he must look for adversary powers and temptations, to take that truth, or at least the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of it, from him. 3. That in these tryals and essays, he must hold the faster gripe, and avow it so much the more stedfastly, as he is tempted to quit it. 4. That when he is put to the tryal of this Confession of any
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:49391:137"/>
point of his Faith, hee is also put to the tryal of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of his hope, whether his hopes of the promised salvation in Jesus, be stronger to keep him stedfast, or the terror and allurement from men, stronger to make him quit the point of truth converted. 5. That nothing but this hope, is able to make a man stand out in tryal, if hee be hardly urged.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Hee will have the avowing of the truth of</hi> Christ, <hi>to be without wavering.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. Men must so learn the Truth, that they need not to change again: that is, must study to know the Truth soundly, and solidly. 2. And having learned it, must not say and unsay; one day avow it, and another day quit it: For so God getteth not his due glory: Beholders are not edified, the mans testimony wanteth weight with the adversary. But hee must be invincible in the truth, who will neither alter nor change, or diminish any thing of it, for fear or favour.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Hee giveth this for a ground of constancy</hi>; For hee is faithful who hath promised: <hi>That is, the promises which Iesus hath made to such as constantly beleeve in him, shall be surely performed, that no constant professor of his Truth shall be ashamed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. Where wee have a promise of any thing made unto us in Scripture, wee may be confident to obtain it, and bold to avow our hope thereof, against such as would teach us the Doctrine of Doubting, whereunto wee are, of our selves, prone and inclined; and against such as shake the assurance of the Saints perseverance. 2. The ground of our confidence is not in our selves, but in the faithfulness of Jesus Christ, who hath promised such gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to his children. 3. Our bold avowing of our hope, is not a bragging of our own strength, but a magnifying of Christs faithfulness.</p>

                     <hi>Hee strengtheneth his former Exhortation, by giving of directions, to further their obedience thereunto. And, first, for mutual up-stirring one of another.</hi> Whereof wee learn,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That mutual edification of Christians amongst themselves, and sharpening one of another, is a special help to constancy in true Religion, and a preservative a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Apostacy. 2. Prudence is required hereunto, that mutually wee observe one anothers disposition, Gifts, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, Virtues, and Faults; that wee may the better fit our selves to do good each one of us unto another, and to receive good each one of another, in our Christian con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versing together. 3. A godly striving one with another, who shall be first in love, and well-doing, is better than the ordinary strife, who shall exceed others in vanity, and superfluity of apparel and fare.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Another mean to this same end, is the frequenting of Christian Assemblies and Meetings, which may further this purpose of mutual edification. And therefore,</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. Church-Assemblies must be well kept, by such as do minde to prove constant in the true Religion. 2. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Meetings also of private Christians, for mutual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, and exhorting one of another, is not to be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, nor forsaken, but to be used, for keeping unity in the Church: and not to foster Schism, or hinder the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Assemblies.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Hee taxeth the fault of some amongst them, who in Schism, or purpose of Apostasie, withdrew themselves from all Church-Assemblies, and Christian-Meetings, and fell back again, or were in the way of falling back to the denial of</hi> Christ <hi>openly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. Separation from the true Church, and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian society of the faithful, is a remarkable evil. 2. The Schism or Apostasie of others, should not weaken us in following any good mean of edification, but rather stir us up unto more diligence, lest by negligence wee fall peece and peece back after their example.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Hee maketh the approaching of the day, to wit, of Gods Iudgement, a special motive to use the means dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, and make us constant in the Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. The day of Gods Judgement should still be looked unto, as a thing near hand, even at the doors, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is but a very little, and our day shall come, yea, and but a little time, till our Lord shall come to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 2. The consideration of the day of judgement, is a fit mean to sharpen us unto all good Duties, which may make our reckoning to be furthered at that day, and to make us boldly maintain the Truth against all fear of men.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 26.</hi> For, if wee sin, wilfully, after that wee have received the knowledge of the Truth, there remaineth no more Sacrifice for sins.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Another Motive to constancy in the Truth of Religion, taken from the fearful case of wilful Apostates, who sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the sin against the Holy Ghost, are secluded, for ever, from Mercy. I say, the sin against the Holy Ghost, because wee shall finde the sin here described, not to be any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular sin against the Law, but against the</hi> Gospel: <hi>Not a sin against some point of Truth, but against</hi> Christs <hi>whole Doctrine: Not of infirmity, but wilfulness: Not of rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, but of deliberation, wittingly, and willingly: Not of ignorance, but after Illumination, and Profession: Such as Iews turned Christians, revolting from Christianity, back again, to their former hostility against Christ, did commit. It is true, many who commit lesser sins, get never grace to repent: and many who make defection, in some point of their profession, may be secluded from mercy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after: but this sin here described, is a wilful rejecting of</hi> Christ, <hi>and the Benefit of his Sacrifice, after Illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Profession of the Faith of</hi> Christ.</p>
                  <p>Then, 1. As Apostacy from the true Religion lyeth nearest unto this sin; so they who desire to be freed of this sin, must be the more careful to be constant in the profession of every point of the Truth of the Gospel. 2. If a man reject the Benefit of that <hi>once offered Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice</hi> of Christ, there is no other Sacrifice for sin after that, nor any other mean to help him. But, if a man seek unto Jesus Christ, and will not quit Him, whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever hee may think of the hainousness of his own sins, the Sacrifice which Jesus offered for sins, remaineth, whereby hee may be saved.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 27.</hi> But a certain fearful looking for of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and fiery Indignation, which shall devour the Adversaries.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Having secluded the Apostate from Mercy, hee goeth on in these words, to shew his miserable estate.</hi> Whereof wee gather,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the wilful Apostate from the Faith of Christ, is also a wilful Adversary to Christ, of the highest sort: Partaker of Satans sin, and Satans Profession. 2. That every Apostate of this sort, is destitute of Gods Peace, self-condemned, desperate of salvation, hopeless of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, without all purpose of Repentance, or using means of help, stricken with the fore-sight of the Wrath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon him, and made to expect it, although hee should dissemble it never so much. 3. The Apostates fear shall come upon him, judgement answerable to his sin, the indignation and wrath of God, yea, fiery indignation, the most terrible that can be thought upon, which hee shall not escape, but it shall devoute him, swallow him up, and feed upon his body and soul, even for ever.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>In that hee maketh this the judgement of</hi> Christs <hi>Adversaries,</hi> Wee learn,</p>

                  <p n="3">3. <hi>In that by setting before them the fearful estate of Apostates from the known Truth of the true Religion, hee Laboureth to strengthen them against the fear of persecution.</hi> Whence wee learn,</p>
                  <p>That if Apostates, before they make Apostasie from the true Religion, did fore-see their own danger, as after Apostasie they are made to fore-see their own condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, all the terrour of all the torment which man could put them unto, and all the allurements which this world could give them, would not move them to quit the least point of the Truth of true Religion.</p>

                     <hi>I answer:</hi> They cannot, indeed, by physical action: but by doing the equivalent sin, they are accounted of God to do it, by judicial interpretation. Their Apostasie importeth, their agreeing to do Christ as much indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as if they did offer Him this personal violence. Their deeds shew, that they have this base estimation of Christ, and His Blood: and no better. For, what saith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postate of Christ, by his deed, but, That Hee is not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be professed, or avowed, or followed?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And what is this in effect, but to tread Him under all these base things, which the Apostate preferreth before Him? And so is to be understood of the Blood of Christ, and His Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Quest. <hi>But how can the Reprobate be said to be sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, by the Blood of the Covenant?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I answer.</hi> There is a sanctification to the purifying of the flesh, and a sanctification to the purifying of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, from dead works, to serve the living God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.13, 14.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The sanctification external to the purifying of the flesh, consisteth in the mans separation from the world, and dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation unto Gods service, by Calling and Covenant, common to all the members of the visible Church: and it is forcible thus far, as to bring a man into credit &amp; estimation, as a Saint, before men, and unto the common Priviledges of the Church; whereupon, as Men, so God also, speaketh unto him, and of him, as one of His People, and dealeth with him, in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal dispensation, as with one of His own People. In this sense all the Congregation of</hi> Israel, <hi>and every one of them, is called</hi> holy, <hi>yea,</hi> Core <hi>also, and his followers,</hi> Num. 16.3. <hi>The Sanctification internal, by renovation, consisteth in a mans separation from the state of Nature, to the state of grace; from his old conditions to be a new creature indeed. By this latter sort, a Reprobate cannot be called</hi> Sanctified, <hi>but by the former hee may be called</hi> Sanctified, <hi>and that by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the</hi> Blood of the Covenant, <hi>albeit hee should not get any further good thereby: For as the</hi> Blood of <hi>CHRIST hath virtue to cleanse the conscience, and renew the soul which commeth unto it truly and spiritually: so it must have force to do that which is less; that is, purifie the flesh, and external condition of the man who cometh unto it outwardly onely, as the Types did under the Law; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon an Hypocrite in the Christian Church, must be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted one of the Congregation of the Saints, as well as an Hypocrite under the Law was so called; because CHRISTS Blood cannot be inferiour to the Types, which were of this force, to sanctifie men to the purifying of the flesh. Or wee may say more shortly: There is a sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by consecration, when any thing is devoted, or dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated unto God, and a sanctification by inhabitation of the holy Spirit,</hi> 2 Cor. 6.16, 17, 18. <hi>Of the former sort, the Censers of</hi> Core, Dathan, <hi>and</hi> Abiram, <hi>are called</hi> Holy. <hi>And the reason is given, Because they offered them before the LORD, therefore they are hallowed,</hi> Numb. 16.38. <hi>And in this sense, all the members of the visible Church, even such as afterwards do prove Apostates, are sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, because they are offered, and offer themselves unto the Lord. But the inhabitation of the holy Spirit, is proper one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Elect, and Gods Children.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hence learn,</hi> 1. That all the members of the visible Church, are so confederate unto God, that it is sacriledge for them not to seek Gods honour in all things, or to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow themselves any other way, than for God. 2. Men are reckoned by God, so to deal with Christ and his Blood, and Covenant, and Spirit, as they make account thereof, as they have estimation of Christ, and his Blood, and Spirit. 3. And their estimation is not reckoned by their words, or pretences, but by their deeds, as these do import, so are they judged to esteem. 4. Because Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie from Christ importeth as much, as Hee and his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine are unworthy to be avowed, or maintained; by consequence it importeth also, that Christ was not the Man hee called himself: and, that all his Spirit had taught them, was untruth: and therefore justly here doth the Scripture challenge the Apostate, of counting Christs blood no better than the blood of a common Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor, and of giving of the Lie to the holy Spirit. So fearful a thing is it, to make defection from any known part of true Religion.</p>

                     <hi>Vers. 30.</hi> For wee know him that hath said, Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance belongeth unto mee; I will recompence, saith the Lord. And again, The LORD shall judge his People.</q>

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the justice and constancy of Gods Truth in general threatnings, is sufficient to prove the certain pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of particular sins. 2. The punishment of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states of one kind, may evidence the punishment of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postates of another kind. For it is the Jews Apostasie to Idolatry and worshiping of Images, which in that place the Lord doth threaten.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Hee maketh the knowing of God who speaketh, a proof sufficient for the certain performance of his Word.</hi>
                  </p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. It is presupposed, that such as reject the Mercy of Christ, shall not be able to reject justice, but must fall into his Hand. 2. The eternity of God maketh his wrath terrible: For hee liveth for ever to avenge himself on his foes. 3. The terror of the Lord, what tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hee is able to inflict, and that for ever, is a fit mean to make men beware to make Apostasie from Christ.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 32.</hi> But call to remembrance the former daies, in which after yee were illuminated, yee endured a great fight of afflictions.</q>

                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. Even they who have suffered for Christ,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:49391:138"/>
have need to be stirred up to constancy, and to be terrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Apostasie. 2. The more men have suffered for Christ, they ought to be the bolder in the profession of his Truth, and the more ready for new sufferings.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>He maketh the time of their first troubles to be after illumination.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then some do enter into troubles for Religion, at their very first conversion, and are yoked in battel against per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors, beside other on-sets of Satan, and their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 33.</hi> Partly whilest ye were made a gazing-stock, both by reproaches and afflictions: and partly whilest ye became companions of them which were so used.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He maketh their troubles in their own persons, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches and afflictions, the first part of their fight, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they were a gazing-stock to the world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then 1. Such as are called to suffer for Christ, are set upon a Theater, to give proof of their faith and love to Christ before the world. 2. The blinde world wondreth at such as adventure to suffer any thing for the truth of Christ, and think but ignominiously of Christ and his cause, and of those that maintain the same. 3. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches and taunts of the godly by the world, are recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned up to them for parts of their Christian cross, and their glory before God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The next part of their fight, was their partaking with such as did suffer the like.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then 1. It is the part of true Christians, to countenance them that confesse Christ, yea, and to joyn with them that suffer for him. 2. Communion with the sufferings of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, is reckoned up for a part of our own sufferings. 3.

                  <p>Then 1. When trial cometh of mens faith in Christ, such as minde to be constant, must prepare themselves to quit their goods, if GOD please so to honour them with employment. 2. When we see we must lose our goods for Christs sake, or suffer any other inconveniency, we ought to do it chearfully, and count our gain in Christ more than our loss in the world: And if we finde trouble, to let our adversaries know as little of it as we can: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, seeing there is no cause of grief, if our eyes were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, and our earthly affections mortified.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Their encouragement and cause of joy, was the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible feeling within themselves, of the comfort of eternal Riches in Heaven, keeping for them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then 1. It is the assurance of our heavenly inheritance which must make us ready to quit our earthly moveables. 2. Who so getteth a heart to quit any thing on earth for Christ, shall have better in heaven than he can lose here. 3. GOD useth to give earnest of what he is to give, in sensible feeling of spiritual Riches, to such as believe in him. 4. When men can esteem of things heavenly, as they are; that is, enduring goods: and of things earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as they are; that is, perishing moveables: then shall they readily quit the earthly in hope of the heavenly.</p>

                  <p>Then 1. The time of patience is as long as God hath any thing to do with us in this world. 2. Patience must not be joyned with idleness, but with active obedience of Gods will, as he requireth it. 3. After that employment is ended, the promised reward is given.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 37.</hi> For yet a little while, and he that shall come, will come, and will not tarry.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He encourageth them to</hi> Patience, <hi>by promise of the Lords coming to relieve them shortly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then 1. The tearm of patience is until the Lord come to deliver. 2. The patient attender on his coming, shall not be disappointed: For he will come, and will not tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry beyond the due time of our necessity. 3. It should strengthen us unto Patience, that the time is short, and the delivery certain.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 8.</hi> Now the just shall live by Faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.</q>
                  <p>How shall they send in the mean time? <hi>He answereth from</hi> Habak. 2.4. The just shall live by Faith: That is, <hi>The man who will be found righteous, must not look to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent sense; but sustain his soul with the word of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. In the midst of troubles, and Gods felt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, Faith will content it self with the onely promises of GOD. 2. Looking to Gods word by faith, is able to keep a soul in life and patience.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>He threatneth the misbelieving Apostate, that chuseth to draw back, and not live by faith. The words of the Prophet are,</hi> He whose soul is lifted up in him, is not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right. <hi>The Apostle betaketh him to the meaning; which being compared with the Prophets words, doth teach us,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. That he who refuseth to live by faith, is lifted up with the false confidence of some other thing than God: He hath some strong hold within himself, wherein he doth trust. 2. He that lifteth up himself in his vain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:49391:139"/>
will draw back from beleeving in Gods word in the time of tryal. 3. Hee that draweth back in the time of tryal, bewrayeth the want of this sincerity. 4. A back-slider from the profession of the Truth, is loathsome both to God, and to his Saints.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 39.</hi> But wee are not of them who draw back un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to perdition, but of them that beleeve, to the saving of the soul.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hee mitigateth the threatning, lest hee should seem to suspect them of inconstancy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. Such Threatnings and Exhortations as have been given here, do not import the uncertainty of their perseverance who are threatned, but standeth with the assurance of the contrary. 2. Hee who threatneth, should be as wary to weaken his hearers Faith, as his own. 3. Hearers must understand, that the right use of threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, is, to rowse men out of security, and not to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Wee are not of them (<hi>saith hee</hi>) who draw back un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to perdition.</p>

The Elect are not of that kind, or sort of men, who fall into Apostasie, unto per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. They may fall for a time, but are not of them that draw back, unto perdition.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Wee are of them (<hi>saith hee</hi>) who beleeve to the salvation of the soul.</p>

                     <p>NOw, that you may know the better how to live by Faith, consider, that Faith apprehendeth things to come, as present, and subsisting, by holding them, in their original Fountain, which is the word of Promise, and beholding in the Mirrour of the Word, the clear certainty of things, as yet not seen to sense, <hi>vers.</hi> 1.

                  </argument>
                  <head>The Doctrine of Chap. XI.</head>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 1.</hi> Now, Faith is the substance of things hoped for; the evidence of things not seen.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>HEE pointeth out the Nature of Faith, to help them to live by it.</hi> Then, Hee that would live by Faith, had need skilfully to search out the nature thereof.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>In describing Faith, hee ascribeth unto it the property of the Word which Faith layeth hold upon: For, it is the Word properly, which is the substance of things not seen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, There is such an union betwixt. Faith and the Word, that what the Word is in force and effect, that Faith is said to be in force and effect also. As Faith ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noureth the Word, so God honoureth Faith, in giving it the like commendation, for force, with the Word. What is the original of the being, and existence of any thing, but this? God willeth it to be, or promiseth it shall come to pass, or commandeth that it may be. Therefore, let Faith get a hold of the Promise, or Word, and it taketh hold of the thing promised by the root thereof. And in the hand of Faith doth Truth bud out, and flourish unto the ripe fruit of full satisfaction in performance.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>The word</hi> Evidence, <hi>in the Original, is a tearm of Logick, importing, that it is the nature of Faith, by dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, to convince.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, It were wisdome, for helping of our weak Faith, to make Syllogisms from the Word, and to reason so convincingly against all opposition of incredulity in us, as there might be a consent, and yeelding to the Truth, extorted from us.</p>
                  <p>As for example: When wee cannot take to heart the danger wee are in, by entertaining any known sin, from <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13. wee may reason thus; The Scripture saith, <hi>If yee live after the flesh, yee shall dye.</hi> But, if I forsake not, and mortifie not this known sin in mee, I live after the flesh. Therefore, if I forsake not, and mortifie not this known sin, I shall die. Again, the Scripture saith, <hi>If yee, through the Spirit, do mortifie the deeds of the body, yee shall live.</hi> Therefore, if I, by the Spirit, mortifie such and such lusts, I have Gods promise, that I shall live. And so in other particulars.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 2.</hi> For, by it the Elders obtained a good report.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hee proveth the nature of Faith, to be as hee hath said, because the Elders were approved of God, as blessed, in their beleeving, who could not otherwise be partakers of the promised blessing in the</hi> Messiah <hi>to come, except Faith had furnished unto them the substance and evidence of that hoped-for blessing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. The Fathers under the Law, were endued with justifying Faith, and accepted of God, even as wee. 2. Men, how base soever, are brought into credit with God, and into good estimation with his Church, by Faith.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 3.</hi> Through Faith wee understand that the Worlds were framed by the Word of God: So that things which are seen, were not made of things which do appear.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Another proof, to shew, that Faith is the evidence of things not seen; Because wee can have no other evidence of the Worlds Creation, but by looking thereupon in the Word, as it were in doing before our eyes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. Faith must not stand whether there be Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances, or Probabilities, or not, of such things as are promised in the Word: or else it could not beleeve the Creation, which is the making of all things of nothing. 2. The whole works of Creation are Pawns and Evidences of the possibility, yea, certainty of every thing promised: For, the works of Creation, stand upon no better ground,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:49391:139"/>
than Gods Word. This sentence, <hi>God shall make our vile bodies, like unto the glorious body of Christ Iesus,</hi> is as powerful to make us so, as this sentence, <hi>Let there be Light,</hi> was powerful to create Light, when there was none before.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 4.</hi> By Faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain; by which he obtained witness, that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and, by it, he being dead, yet speaketh.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In the Catalogue of Believers, he beginneth at</hi> Abel, <hi>the first persecuted man for Righteousness, and that by</hi> Cain, <hi>professing the same worship with him. Wherein we learn,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the wicked may joyn in the outward worship, and pure forms of Religion, with the godly, as <hi>Cain</hi> did with <hi>Abel.</hi> 2. That Faith putteth the difference betwixt their persons and service. 3. That a mans person must first please God, before his actions can please him: For therefore was <hi>Abels</hi> Sacrifice accepted, because by faith his person was justified. 4. Faith maketh <hi>Abel</hi> still a speaking Doctor to the Church, directing all who love to have such a reward, to cleave unto God, as he did: and, albeit they should dye for it, by the hand of their perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting and bloody Brethren, not to wonder at it.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 5.</hi> By Faith Enoch was translated, that he should not see death, and was not found, because God had translated him. For, before his translation, he had<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this Testimony, that he pleased God.</q>
                  <p>Enochs <hi>full felicity, is expressed by Gods translating of him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, if we ask where <hi>Enoch</hi> went to, we must search for him by Scriptures warrant, onely in the company of God, the Translator of him. For before he was tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated, he lived a blessed man in fellowship with God: And it is injurious to God and <hi>Enoch</hi> both, to put him out of Gods fellowship, as not blessed, when he is tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Enochs <hi>Translation beareth witness,</hi> 1. That the blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of everlasting life, with God, after death, was known in the Old Testament. 2. That the Fathers got possession of it. 3. That this felicity could not be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained unto, but by flitting, and removing out of this life. 4. That the body is a partner with the Soul, of Life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. 5. That howsoever it be appointed, for all men once to dye, yet God can make, when he pleaseth, Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation, or a Change, to stand in room of death.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Before</hi> Enoch <hi>was translated, he had this testimony,</hi> That he pleased God. Then, whosoever desireth to be blessed with God, after they are removed from this life, must first learn to please God before they depart hence.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 6.</hi> But, without Faith, it is impossible to please him. For, he that cometh to God, must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly seek him.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He proveth, that</hi> Enochs <hi>Translation, and pleasing of God, was by Faith; because pleasing of God cannot be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Faith. He nameth no other of Gods graces in him, but Faith onely; because it onely, of all other graces, strippeth a man naked of the worth of any thing in him, and sendeth him to Gods mercy in the Mediator.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. Whatsoever glorious Vertues he found in Gods children; yet it is not by any of these that they are justified or acceptable to God, but onely by their Faith: For, it is by Faith, that it may be by Grace: And if it be by Grace, it is not by worthiness of works. 2. In the matter of Justification, and acceptation with God, to be justified by Faith, or accepted not without Faith, is all one to be justified, and accepted, by vertue of nothing in a man beside Faith: else, the Apostles reasoning were not strong. 3. Except a man have this commended Faith in Gods Mercy, he cannot please God: Let him do else what you can name, without this faith, it is impossible to please God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>He expoundeth, what the Faith is, of which he meaneth: To wit, A coming to God, All-sufficient and merciful.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. God is Self-sufficient, and All-sufficient. 2. God is so gracious, as none can seek unto him, by that way which he hath revealed, but he will give them that which they seek. 3. Except a man believe Gods All-sufficiency, and merciful Bountifulness, he cannot come unto him, to seek supply of wants, or relief from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>From these words also we may observe the nature of Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. It maketh a man sensible of his indigence, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery: else, it could not send him a begging. 2. It maketh him to acknowledge his natural alienation, and farness from God: else, it could not set him on work, to seek God, and to come unto him. 3. It emptieth him of the confidence in his own, and all the creatures help: else, it could not send the man away, from all these, to God. 4. It pointeth out God, both able and willing, to help: else, it could not encourage, to take course for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief in him. 5. It setteth a man on work to use the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed means to finde God. 6. It certifieth a man, of Gods impartiality towards every one that seeketh to him; and maketh him to hold on the way, seeking diligently, and never to give over: And, so it bringeth a man to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny himself, and to have communion with God.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 7.</hi> By Faith, Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an Ark, to the saving of his house: by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the Righteousness which is by Faith.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In</hi> Noahs <hi>example, observe</hi> 1. <hi>He believeth the Deluge is coming, and feareth, and prepareth the Ark.</hi> Then,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Faith apprehendeth Judgements threatned in the Word, as well as Mercies in the Promises. 2. Faith ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending the Threatning, moveth to fear. 3. That is right Fear, which setteth a man on work to prevent the danger.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>By his diligence he condemned the world.</hi> Then,</p>
                  <p>The pains which the Godly take to eschew wrath, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth careless beholders of their diligence.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>By this he became heir of the Righteousness which is by Faith, that is, came evidently to be such.</hi> Then,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There is a Righteousness, which is onely by Faith. 2. That Righteousness, is Heirship to all true Believers. 3. Some special point of Faith, may bring this heirship un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to light, and give evidence of a mans Right thereunto.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 8.</hi> By Faith, Abraham, when he was called, to go out, into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed: and he went out, not knowing whither he went.</q>
                  <p>Abrahams <hi>following of Gods calling, and leaving of his Countrey, is counted a work of Faith. From</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams <hi>example, then let us learn,</hi> 1. That Faith in God, will cause a man quit his Countrey and Parents, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dearest thing, at Gods calling. 2. Faith counteth Gods Promises better than present possessions; and is content to quit the one for the other. 3. Yea, it is content with a Promise, of better in general; and for the special man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of performance, standeth not to be blinde. 4. Faith is willing to obey, as soon as it seeth a Warrant.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 9.</hi> By Faith, he sojourned in the land of Promise, as in a strange Countrey; dwelling in Tabernacles, with Isaac and Iacob, the heirs with him of the same pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise.</q>
                  <p>Abrahams <hi>sojourning in</hi> Canaan, <hi>is counted another work of his Faith. Wherein we learn:</hi> 1. That Faith can for a while suffer to be a stranger, even from that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto it hath best Right. 2. When Faith hath certainty of an heavenly inheritance, it can be content with a small portion of things earthly. 3. A man who sojourneth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst Idolaters, should be sure of a calling thereunto: and being amongst them, ought to behave himself as a Stranger, and Sojourner. 4. Yes, where he
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:49391:140"/>
hath best Right on earth, hee ought to have a Pilgrims mind.</p>
                  <q>

                  <p>
                     <hi>That which moved</hi> Abraham <hi>to behave himself as a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journey on earth, was the hope of a setled during place with God, in the society of the Saints in Heaven.</hi> Then.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Heaven is a setled, commodious, and safe-dwelling Place: All places here, are but moveable Tabernacles. 2. The Fathers under the Law, looked for entry into their eternal rest, in the Kingdome of Heaven, after the ending of their Pilgrimage here. 3. The hope of Heaven, is able to make a man content with Pilgrims Fare, and Lodging, here-away.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>This deducing of Consequences, from the Profession of the</hi> Patriarches, <hi>That they were Strangers. Teacheth us,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. So to read the Scriptures, as wee may mark, not onely what is spoken; but, also, what is thereby imported, by consequence. 2. That, what is imported by a speech, is a plain Declaration of the mind of the speaker; and not an obscure Deduction, as Mockers call it. They who say they are Strangers, declare plainly, that they seek a Country: saith the Apostle. 3. Yea, that it is lawfull to proceed, drawing one Consequence after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, till we find out the full mind: providing the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection be evident, in the course of sound Reason, as here it is.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The Apostle hath proved here, that the</hi> Patriarchs <hi>sought Heaven for their Country, because they sought a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than any on earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. The Apostle knew no place for residence of departed souls, better than the Earth, except Heaven one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. If there had been any other place, such as is feigned to be, his reasoning had not been solid. 2. The Patriarchs, after the ending of their Pilgrimage here on earth, went home to Heaven.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Because they counted themselves strangers, till they came home to Heaven, God is not ashamed to be called their God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. God will honour them that honour him. 2. God will avow himself to be their portion, who for his cause do renounce the world. 3. Yea, that the Lord may honour such as honour him, hee will even abase himself to exalt them. 4. When the Lord hath so done, hee thinketh it no dishonour to Himself, to do any thing that may honour his servants.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>God did prepare them a City, which the Apostle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath called</hi> Heaven, <hi>or the heavenly Country.</hi>

                  <q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vers. 17.</hi> By Faith, Abraham when he was tried, offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up Isaac: And he that had received the promises, offered up his onely begotten Son:</p>
                     <p n="18">
                        <hi>18.</hi> Of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Another commendation of</hi> Abrahams <hi>Faith from the proof given thereof in his tryal about</hi> Isaac. <hi>Whence we learn,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. That where the Lord giveth faith, there tryal must be expected: And, the greater faith, the greater trial. 2. That faith is most commendable when it standeth strong in tryal.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>He is said to have offered up</hi> Isaac <hi>by faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. There is nothing so dear, but faith in God will make a man quit it at Gods command. 2. The Lord counteth that to be done, wich a man is about to do. <hi>Isaac</hi> is counted offered, because so was he in <hi>Abrahams</hi> purpose.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>His receiving of the promises is here in another sense than</hi> ver. 13. <hi>For there to receive the Promises, is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the thing promised, or the Promises in performance. But here it is to have the Promises first and immediately made unto him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, the meaning of forms of speech in Scripture, is to be found by consideration of all circumstances of the place where they are spoken, and not of some circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances onely.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>It serveth to the commendation of his faith, that he obeyed Gods command, when it seemed to make the promise</hi> null.</p>
                  <p>Then, 1. To adhere to the promise, when by appearance of reason it is likely not to be performed, is tried faith indeed. 2. When Reason sighteth against Faith, it is wisdom to quit that Reason which would make us quit the Promises. 3. When Gods commandments and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises unto us, seem to cross one another, it is wisdom for us to justifie them both. All his words are truth.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 19.</hi> Accounting that God was able to raise him up even from the dead: from whence also he received him in a figure.</q>
                  <p>Abrahams <hi>looking to Gods Fidelity and Omnipotency, made him victorious over every difficulty, and so to give obedience to this hard commandment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. When we get hard commandments, we must lay our reckoning how we may obey them, and not how we may shift them. 2. Difficulties and impossibilities, as would appear, must be rolled over upon God. 3. Gods Omnipotency maketh that his promise cannot miss, but take effect.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Abraham <hi>as he expected, so he found: He expected</hi> Isaac'<hi>s resurrection from the dead; and, in a figure, or similitude, be received</hi> Isaac <hi>back from the dead: that is, from the jaws of death, no less unexpectedly, than from the dead.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. The Believer shall finde as much as he can expect from Gods word. 2. If the performance be not as he doth forecast, yet it shall be by a way as comfortable and p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Then, Patriarchal benedictions were given by ordinary Faith, albeit from the ground of extraordinary revealed truth. For faith ordinary, believeth Gods truth reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, howsoever ordinarily or extraordinarily.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>In that this example is propounded for ordinary imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, in believing of Gods ordinary revealed word, it teacheth us,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That he who hath the ordinary word of God, hath as sure a ground to rest upon, as if he had a particular and extraordinary revelation.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 21.</hi> By Faith, Iacob when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of Ioseph, and worshipped, leaning up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the top of his staff.</q>
                  <p>Jacob <hi>a dying, blesseth his off-spring, and worshippeth God in bodily weakness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. Faith can look through the cloud of Death, and behold both its own and others felicity. 2. In the solid assurance which it hath, it can worship or glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God for things to come, as if they were already past.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>It is not said,</hi> that he worshipped the top of his Staff, <hi>but</hi> upon the top of his Staff, leaning, <hi>for his weakness cause, by approaching</hi> Death: <hi>because he would, for this fore-seen blessing of God upon his posterity, testifie by signs of worship in his weak body, how he esteemed of that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. Faith will make the body, albeit it be weak, concur with the Spirit in the Lords worship. 2. When the infirmity of the body maketh it unable to concur with the Spirit, it must be helped with a stone, as <hi>Moses</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed against <hi>Amalek</hi>: or staff, as <hi>Iacob</hi> here; or any thing else, which may enable it to perform the worship the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; being put under breast, or arms, or knees. 3. <hi>Iacobs</hi> bending of his body, in so great weakness thereof, must bear witness against the prophane ease which many men now-a-days take unto themselves, both in private and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like worship.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 22.</hi> By Faith, Ioseph when he dyed, made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the departing of the children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones.</q>
                  <p>Joseph <hi>also testified his Faith in his death, concerning the delivery of Israel out of</hi> Egypt, <hi>by direction giving for transporting his Bones, in sign of his assurance of their going to Canaan, because God had promised so.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then the Lords promises are sure comforts in death, whereby Faith both sustaineth it self, and is able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage and strengthen others: And Faith maketh a man to keep them in memory, and to make use of them in due time.</p>

                     <hi>How great weakness</hi> Moses <hi>parents did bewray, the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story maketh evident: yet is their faith commended as vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious over the fear, wherein their weakness did most ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Whence we learn,</hi> 1. That nothing is commendable, but because done in faith. Their natural love is not menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, but their Faith. 2. That God so loveth faith in his children, that he commendeth it in the measure it hath, albeit it go not so far as it ought, and marketh what faith hath, and not what it wanteth of the perfection.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The Evidence of their Faith he maketh this</hi>; That they were not afraid of the Kings Commandment.</p>
                  <p>Then, 1, GOD alloweth not, that Kings command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments should be regarded when they command impiety, and wickedness: for then should they be honoured above God, if for their commandment we should do that which he forbiddeth. 2. Nothing but faith in God is able to make a man overcome the fear of that, which Potentares may do unto him: And, it is a commendable work of faith to get this victory.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>The beauty of the childe stirred up his Parents to this work of Faith, thinking with themselves, that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved to be for some special end, that God had so fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned the childe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. The Lord hath ways enough to excitate the faith of his own, and bring it forth to act. 2. Where special endowments are given, there is good evidence of special employment to follow.</p>

                  <p>Then, 1.

                  <p>Then, 1. <hi>Moses</hi> and GODS People in his time, did know CHRIST, or else they could not have born his Cross, and suffered for him. 2. Christianity is as old as true Religion. 3. The Cross and Reproach hath atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on true Religion in all Ages. 4. What reproach men suffer for true Religion, is reckoned to be Christs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, and not theirs. 5. Reproach and Shame is the heaviest part of the Cross; for, under it is all comprized here.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The next Motive was, His respect unto the Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the Reward, which also made him to esteem the Reproach his Riches.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. There is a reward for such as suffer reproach for Christ. 2. It is lawful, yea, needful for men to have respect unto this reward, and to draw encouragement from it, even for their own strengthening. 3. Though the Cross seem terrible, yet Faith can peirce through it, and behold the reward following it. 4. When sufferings for Christ are rightly seen, they are the richest and most glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious passage in all our life.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 27.</hi> By Faith hee forsook <hi>Aegypt,</hi> not feating the wrath of the King: for hee endured, as seeing him who is invisible.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Another work of Faith is, his leading of the people from their dwelling places in</hi> Aegypt, <hi>to the Wilderness, with the hazard of the wrath of</hi> Pharaoh, <hi>if hee should overtake them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, whatever it seem unto us now, after it is done, it was no small Faith at that time, to undertake such a bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, to turn his back upon a fertile land, and go with such a company, without provision, to the wilderness.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>His Faith is commended, for not fearing the wrath of the King,</hi> Exod. 2.14. Moses <hi>feared the wrath of</hi> Pharaoh <hi>and fled. After that,</hi> Exod. 10.29. <hi>Hee feared not another</hi> Pharaoh, <hi>as terrible as the former.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, Where natural courage would succumb, Faith will sustain; yea, and make a man endure (as it is spoken in the next words) where natural courage having led him on a little, would forsake him at length.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>The encouragement unto this work was,</hi> Hee saw him that is Invisible: <hi>That is, hee apprehended by Faith God more powerful than</hi> Pharaoh, <hi>and more terrible.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. Faith openeth the eyes, to see God in a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual manner, who by sense or imagination carnal, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be conceived. 2. The beholding of the invisible God is able to support a mans courage, against the terrour of men, and all things visible: and nothing else can do it.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 28.</hi> Through Faith hee kept the Passeover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest hee that destroyed the first-born should touch them.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Another work of his Faith is, His keeping of the Pass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over: That is, the Sacrament of the Angels passing over, and not destroying the people.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1. It is usual for Scripture, speaking of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to give the name of the thing signified, to the sign, because the sign is the memorial of the thing signified. Circumcision is called the Covenant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.13. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is the memorial thereof. The Paschal Supper for the like cause, is here called the Passeover, which was the work of the Angel, because it was by appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the memorial of it. So the Cup in the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per is called, <hi>The New Testament in Christs Blood:</hi> and the Bread in the same Supper is called, <hi>The broken Body of Christ</hi>; because it is the memorial thereof. 2. It is the work of Faith to celebrate a Sacrament rightly. 3. As <hi>Moses</hi> celebrated the Passeover in assurance that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying Angel should not touch the people of <hi>Israel</hi>: So may every Beleever be certified, by using the Sacrament, that the grace promised and sealed in the Sacrament shall be bestowed.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 29.</hi> By Faith they passed thorow the Red Sea, as by dry Land: which the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> essaying to do, were drowned.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hee joyneth the Faith of the true</hi> Israelites <hi>with the Faith of</hi> Moses, <hi>for whose sakes the rest of the incredulous multitude got the benefit of Delivery also through the Red Sea, which was the fruit of the Beleevers Faith. Whence wee learn,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. That Faith will finde unexpected deliveries, and out-gates, where it might seem altogether impossible. 2. Yea, means of destruction, by Faith may be turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to means of preservation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The fruit of Faith is evidenced by the drowning of the</hi> Aegyptians, <hi>essaying themselves to follow that way, which Faith had opened to</hi> Israel.</p>
                  <p>Then, 1. Presumption in unbeleevers, will set them on work, to go thorow the same dangers which beleevers pass thorow, but without all success: For Beleevers shall escape where unbeleevers shall down. 2. The bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of Faith is best seen, when the evil of unbeleef is seen.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 30.</hi> By Faith the walls of <hi>Jericho</hi> fell down, after they were compassed about seven daies.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hee ascribeth the down-throwing of the walls of</hi> Jeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho <hi>to Faith, making the Beleevers onely to compass them seven daies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. What God doth for beleevers, is reckoned the work of Faith, because Faith setteth God on work so
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:49391:141"/>
to say, and his power imployed by faith, worketh the work. 2. Faith will throw down strong Holds, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come seeming impossibilities. 3. Faith must use such means as God appointeth, albeit they seem but weak. 4. It matters not how weak the means be, if faith have a promise to prevail thereby. 5. The means must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly used during the time that God appointeth them to be followed.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 31.</hi> By Faith, the Harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not, when she had received the Spies with peace.</q>
                  <p>Rahab <hi>the Harlots faith is commended by the fruit of her safety, when misbelievers perished.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> How heard she Gods Word to beget Faith? Or how heard they of <hi>Iericho,</hi> Gods Word, that they should be called unbelievers?</p>
                  <p>I answer, <hi>The common report of God, and his works, joyned with Gods blessing, was sufficient to beget faith in her: And the same report, albeit carried, as other news, by common messengers, being despised, and counted unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be further enquired for, and sought after, was suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to make them guilty of misbelief.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. In this example it is evident, that faith is as acceptable in an Heathen, and an Harlot, as in a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor, and person of better condition. 2. That faith can change an Heathen, or vile person, into a Saint. 3. That the faith of women is to be observed and imitated, even as well as mens faith. 4. That the unworthiness of the party believing, giveth commendation so much the more unto the excellency of faith.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>No word here of her Lye, in receiving the Spies; but onely of her faith and peaceable behaviour towards them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. Where God seeth Faith, he hideth his eyes, as it were, from any thing that might deface the glory thereof. 2. He gathereth up the smallest good fruits which faith bringeth forth, and maketh not small reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning thereof, how small soever they be.</p>

                     <hi>Vers. 32.</hi> And, what shall I more say? For the time would fail me, to tell of Gideon, and of Barak, and of Sampson, and of Iephthah; of David also, and Samuel, and of the Prophets.</q>

                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The diversity of those that are here recorded, teacheth us,</hi> That albeit there be difference: of Believers; some stronger, as <hi>David</hi>: some weaker, as the rest; some base Bastards, as <hi>Iephthah</hi>: some of better sort, some of them notable in holiness, and conversation; some of them taint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with notorious falls in their lives: Yet are they all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolled by God, in a Catalogue of Honour, amongst his Saints.</p>

                     <hi>Whence we learn,</hi> 1. That in the old Church, under the Law, when the grounds of believing were not so clear as now they are, excellent things are recorded to be done by Faith, for up-stirring such as are under the light of the Gospel, to make use of faith. 2. That neither fire, nor water, nor man, nor beast, is so strong, but faith may make a weak man victorious over them all. 3.

                  <p>

To lay aside the sin which so easily doth beset us; that is, by studying to mortifie the body of our corrupt inclination, to cut off the wood-bind growth of violent predominant and wily sins, which most frequently get advantage of us. 3.

                  <p>The Christian Race-runner hath Jesus before him, in the way to help him in every thing that may befal him in his course. 2. Christ, must be looked upon, by him who would be helped in his Race: the Eye of the Soul being drawn off of every thing which might divert the Man, or discourage him (such as are the multitude of Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sliders, the multitude of Mockers, the multitude of by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:49391:142"/>
and runners therein, the multitude of fears, from our own unworthiness, and sinfulness, and temptations on all sides) and our mindes fixed on Christ, with loving and longing looks, which may draw life and strength from him. 3. We must look on him, as JESUS, the Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er from sins, and giver of Salvation; even him who saveth his people from their sins. 4. We must look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, as the author and finisher of our faith; that is, as our God, who hath begun his good work in us, and will also perfect it: Who hath given us grace to believe, and will surely continue this grace with us, even to the end: lest the fears of our Faith failing, make us to faint. 5. We must look upon him, as our pattern, and example, who having run the race before us, hath set forth himself for our imitation; that in him we might finde all whereof we stand in need.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>How Iesus ran this race, he sheweth, for our example,</hi> 1. He had Joy set before him, which he was to receive by our Salvation wrought. So have we joy set before us also. 2. For the hope of that joy, he ran with courage: So must we. 3. He ran with the Cross upon his back all the way, being a man acquainted with sorrows: So must we resolve also. 4. In his griefs and sorrows, shame set upon him from the world, and poured out contempt upon him: So must we resolve to finde it. 5. For the hope of the joy, he endured patiently, and went on, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Cross, and wearied not: So must we. 6. Albeit shame was the sharpest of his griefs from the world, yet he regarded it not, but despised all despising, and shamed shame, as unworthy to be taken notice of, in comparison of his Design: So must we. 7. He overcame all at length: So shall we through him also. 8. He hath gotten the Joy, and the Glory, for which he ran: So shall we with him. If we suffer with him, we shall also reign with him. 9. He is set down on the Right Hand of the throne of God, that is, is joyned with the Father, in the Glorious Government of Heaven and Earth, and all things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, for the good of all his followers: So that we need to fear nothing in our way, seeing he hath the Government of all.</p>

                  <p>Then, 1. Nothing more forcible to discourage a perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted Christian, than Contradiction. A man will suffer much, if he know it be for truth: but if the truth for which he suffereth, be called in question, and Scribes, and Pharisees, and chief Church-men, shall contradict him, and brangle his Faith, in the Truth, it is more pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful than a Rack-stock unto him. 2. The consideration of our Lord Jesus, his being exercised this way, is a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial mean to guard us in such a Temptation. 3. If we be not armed against contradiction, by certain knowledge of the Truth, and Faith in Jesus, we cannot hold out; but upon force, weary under the Cross; and be lost, or dissolved, like water, and fall by, as the word importeth.</p>

                     <hi>These Hebrews were somewhat dashed, and discoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, by the persecution which they had already born, and were like to faint. Therefore, he setteth them on, to prepare for suffering to the blood, that every suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering lesse than that, might be the more tolerable in their eyes.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>He maketh their Party,</hi> Sin. Then, 1. Christians must remember in their troubles, that they are tryed, whether they will choose to sin, or to suffer. 2. When they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey their persecutors, they must not be interpreted, to be strivers against them, so much as against sin. 3. With what colour, or pretence soever, sin be urged upon Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, they must not yield, but resist, in a Christian manner, and fight Christianly, against that sin whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to they are tempted. The more stedfastly they resist, they must prepare themselves for the more suffering, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve, at length, to lay down their blood in suffering.

                  <p>Then, 1. Whosoever be the Pen-men of the Scripture, it is God who speaketh in it. 2. The Scriptures do di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect their speech to every Age, and Church, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, no less than to those who lived in the Church of old, when it was first written.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>He chargeth them, for their forgetting of such a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly speech, as is the stiling of the afflicted by the names of</hi> Sons.</p>
                  <p>Then, 1. The special point of faith, which the Lord will have fostered under the Cross, is the faith of our Adoption; that we never mistake our Fathers affection, nor our gracious estate by calling, for any hard dealing wherewith possibly we may be exercised. 2. He will have us assured of our Adoption, by Gods manner of speaking unto us, as a Father to his Children. 3. He sheweth us, that the not remembring of the Word of God speaking unto us, according to our estate, is the cause of fainting, and of mistaking.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. That neither Chastisement, yea, nor Scourging, which is the sharpest measure of correction, is a sign of Gods hatred, but of his love rather. 2.

That receiving correction, is counted subjection to God; and, refusing correction, is refusing of subjection. 4. That submission to chastisement, is the way to life.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. Fornication and prophanity, are the bitter roots of other evils, and able to defile a Congregation. 2.

                     <hi>Vers. 17.</hi> For ye know, how that afterwards when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He sheweth Gods judgement on</hi> Esau, <hi>to terrifie all men, to hazard upon the sinful satisfaction of their own lusts, at any time.</hi> Then,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Esaus</hi> judgement should be a terrour to all men, to keep them from presuming deliberately to commit that sin, which they know may cut them off from the Blessing: because sundry times (albeit not always) God doth punish presumptuous sinners, with giving over the man to his own ways, and final impenitency. 2. <hi>Esaus</hi> example sheweth, how justly they may be deprived of the Blessing annexed to any Sacred Symbole, or gracious Mean, who do despise the mean whereby the Blessing is conveyed. For the Birth-right amongst the Patriarchs, was a pawn of the Blessing of being an Heir of Promise: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was <hi>Esau</hi> counted to reject the Blessing, when he counted light of the Birth-right. 3. His example shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, how little sinners consider for the present, what Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize they are making with Satan, when they meddle with known sins, and how they will be made to know it afterwards.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>He saith, that afterwards he would have inherited the Blessing; but was rejected.</hi> Then,</p>
                  <p>It agreeth with the prophane mans disposition, to desire the Blessing, and yet despise the means whereby the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing is gotten: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>o satisfie his fleshly lusts for the present, and to desire the Blessing withall afterwards. But God will neither sever the means from the Blessing, nor joyn the Blessing with the satisfaction of mens lusts. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he who will have the Blessing, must use the means to obtain the same, and renounce the satisfaction of his sinful lusts, or else be rejected, when he thinketh to get the Blessing.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>He saith,</hi> He found no place of repentance, albeit he sought the blessing with tears: <hi>That is, he could not obtain, that his father should repent the bestowing of the blessing beside him; nor, that God should repent his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous judgement on him. For, repentance here, is recalling the sentence given out. And why? Because he, for all his tears, and untimeous seeking of his sold blessing, repented not himself of his sin: for he continued as prophane as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and resolved to murther his brother, as soon as he found opportunity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. <hi>Esau</hi> did rue his deed, but repented not his sin. It is one thing to rue a deed done, and another thing to repent the sin in doing of the deed, and every known sin for that sins cause. 2. Tears may follow upon ruing, as well as on repenting: and it is possible, that the loss or harm procured by sin, may draw forth the tear, and not the sorrow for the offending of GOD by the sin. 3. <hi>Esau</hi> here is not brought in dealing with God for pardon of sin, and the heavenly inheritance; but with the man who had the ministry of dispensing the earthly blessing one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
                  <p>We read then that a blessing was sought carefully from a man, with tears, and not obtained: but we read not, that Gods Mercy and Blessing was ever sought from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self carefully, and not obtained.</p>

By this Charge, and new exaction of the Law, an unsupportable weight lieth upon the Conscience, pressing it down to Desperation and Death; that we would give all the world, if we had it, to be free of the terror of the Lord, and challenge of the Conscience, upon so fearful a ditty: represented by the peoples entreating, <hi>That the word should not be spoken to them any more,</hi> 7.

When we come to Christ, we are under the Covenant of Grace, which proclaimeth remission of sins unto all who are in him. 15. Yea, now under the Gospel, coming unto Christ, we are in better case than they who lived before Christ, because they were bound to all the Ceremonial and Typical Ordinances of the Law under the Old Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant: But we are exempted from that Old Covenant, and are entred into the New, which freeth us from that yoke which the Israelites could never bear. 16.

                  <p>
                     <hi>From the nature of this Kingdome, granted unto us in Christ, and from his terribleness, he exhorteth us to sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastness of Faith, and humble obedience.

                  </p>
                  <p>Then, As we receive Christ in the Gospel, wee receive the Kingdome of Heaven with him, in Right and Title: yea, in begun possession, which groweth by degrees.</p>

                  <p>Then, right is given to this Kingdome, before our ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice be done: Not because we have se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. It is not enough, that wee do such works which belong to Gods Service: but wee must take heed to the manner of doing of them; that they may be done with a ready affection, and good wil. 2. Next, that they be done in the sense of our own weakness, vileness, and unworthiness. 3. And thirdly, that they be done with reverend regard to God, in such a godly fear, as may make us circumspectly handle, and meddle with his Service, as the word importeth.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>That this may be the better done,</hi> let us have grace, <hi>or</hi> hold fast <hi>the grip of Grace, whereby wee may serve God, saith he.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, he that would have strength to serve God, must study by faith, to lay hold on Gods grace in the Gospel: and having laid hold thereon, to hold it fast: for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise wee can neither have heart nor hand to serve GOD. But he that is fastned on the grace and good will of God towards him, will draw courage and strength from this believed grace, to serve God cheerfully and reverent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Because the holiest men, have need of the Spurs of GODS Terrour, to stir up their lazy flesh, he closeth with a Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>word of</hi> Moses, Deuter. 4.24. <hi>terrifying the people from Idolatry, or Imagery; which he applyeth for making men circumspect in their manner of worship.</hi>

That to serve Idols, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a false Religion; and not to serve GOD, in reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and godly fear, in the true Religion, will be both alike plagued. 2. <hi>The words do teach us,</hi> That GODS entring into Covenant, and laying down of the feud and enmity against us, maketh Him not to lay down his awfull Majesty over us. 3.

                  <p>
                     <hi>FRom this first Precept, Learn,</hi> 1. That the first Fruit of Faith which God requireth, is Love, and constant love, amongst his children. 2. That our mutual love must be sincere and kindely, as if it were grounded on Bands of Nature.</p>
                  <q>

                  <p>
                     <hi>From this Precept, Learn,</hi> 1. That we are ready to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get charity to strangers, especially to be hospital unto them. 2. That the possibility of finding strangers bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter men than we take them to be, should over-ballance the suspition of their slightness, and should set us on to do the duty. 3. That if a man, intending to do good, do more than he intended to do, it shall be imputed unto him, no less, than if he had intended the same.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>From this, Learn,</hi> 1. That it is no new thing for the world, to put bonds on them who seek to bring them out of Bondage. 2. That Prisoners for Christ, are readily forgotten of such as are at freedom. 3. Such mens bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage should be esteemed as our own, even until God set them free. 4. That other distressed people also shall be helped by us, if we consider what may befal our selves, before we dye.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>From this we learn,</hi> 1. That breakers of Wedlock, and unclean persons in a single life, are both reserved unto GODS judgement, how lightly soever men let them pass. 2. That marriage being provided of God, for a remedy of incontinency, maketh Uncleanness the heavier sin. 3. That seeing it is GODS Doctrine, to commend Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage for honourable, and hath pronounced it not onely Lawful, but commendable in all persons, of whatsoever Place, or Calling, and hath justified it for undefiled; to traduce this estate of life, as not holy, or not beseeming an holy man, or an holy calling, and to forbid marriage, to persons of any calling, must be, as it is called, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1, 2. <hi>The Doctrine of the Devil.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Here we are taught,</hi> 1. That the enlargement of our desires, to have more and more worldly goods, whether we be rich or poor, is disallowed of GOD. 2. That GOD requireth Contentation with our present estate, how mean soever it be; and counteth it Covetousness, not to be contented.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>To make us contented, he giveth us Gods Promise made to</hi> Joshua, Chap. 1.5. <hi>for our provision in necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</hi> Then,</p>

The Promises made to <hi>Ioshua,</hi> or any other holy Man in Scripture, for Furniture in his Calling, may be very well applied unto us, for Help and Furniture in our Calling. 2. Faith in Gods Promise, for our Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, must both stay our fear of want in time to come, and give us contentment with that which we have for the present. 3. A general Promise of Gods being with us, and assisting of us, is as sufficient for all particulars whereof we stand in need, as if they were expressed.</p>

The weakest true Believer, hath as good ground of confidence in God, for every good, needful for soul, or body, as the Lords chief Prophets, and as good Warrant to apply the Scriptures to their own use, which speak of them. 3. He who believeth in God, needeth not to fear what flesh can do unto him. 4. Faith then, doth its part duly, when i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Who is worthy to be a Guide to a People, to wit, the man who speaketh the Word of God, and not his own Dreams; believeth the Truth which he teacheth, and hath his conversation answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. 2. The best respect that a Preacher can crave, or that a People can give to a Preacher, either in his life time, or after, is to remember the Truth of God taught by him, and to make use thereof. 3. In as far as Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers have spoken the Word of God, and made it the end of their conversation, People are commanded here, to remember them, and imitate their Faith; but no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>This Sentence serveth,</hi> First, To shew the eternity and immurability of Jesus Christ, in himself, and all his Properties, of Truth, and Love, and Pitty, &amp;c. Again, It serveth for a reason, of keeping fast the Doctrine taught from him by our faithful Leaders; because JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS CHRIST will still allow and maintain that Truth once given out by himself, and cannot chuse to change his Truth, being <hi>First</hi> and <hi>Last</hi> like himself. <hi>And thirdly,</hi> It serveth to encourage us to be constant in the Faith; because JESUS CHRIST is unchangeably the same, in love and care towards those who believe in him, in all ages, for their preservation and deliverance, in all cases wherein they can fall, for his Truth: as he hath given proof in former times towards others.</p>

                     </gap> with the Word of God, uncouth and strange Doctrine which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles did not acknowledge and recommend unto us, must be rejected. 2. There was such uncouth Doctrine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to creep into the Church, even in the Apostles time. 3. Apostolick Doctrine, such as they acquainted the Church with, must be stedfastly believed and stood unto, and not loosly laid hold upon, lest we lye open to the wind of false Doctrine.</p>

                        </gap> for example, the Doctrine of</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction of meats, <hi>wherein the Iewishly affected did place some holiness, and help to salvation: and yet they who most leaned to the same, were least profited there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. To place some holiness in Distinction of meats, and to count the observation thereof helpful to salvation, is an old errour, which even in the beginning did trouble the Church. 2. Never man got profit by
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:49391:145"/>
leaning any thing to the observation of Distinction of Meats. For, under the Law, distinction was command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for the leading of men to some Duties signified there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; but never did God give way, that men should esteem of this observation, as a thing conferring any whit to the purchase of salvation.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>To keep out this errour of leaning to Ceremonial ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations, he opposeth the Doctrine of Grace, wherewith he will have the heart established, and not with meats.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. The ground of devising and urging of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious ceremonies, is the unquietness and unstable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of mens hearts, wanting satisfaction in God and his Ordinances; and therefore seeking to support themselves by means of their own devising. 2. It is the Doctrine of Justification by Grace onely, and nothing of our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which getteth true rest to our hearts, and quiet set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to the consciences.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 10.</hi> We have an Altar, whereof they have no right to eat, which serve the Tabernacle.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Such as pertinaciously did plead for the standing of the Levitical Service, and ceremonies thereof, he secludeth from the enjoying of Iesus Christ, who is our Altar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, such as maintain the <hi>Levitical Ceremonies,</hi> and do urge them on the Christian Church, do cut themselves from right to Christ. 1. Because they deny, in effect, that he is come, seeing they will have those <hi>Figures</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, which did serve to <hi>Prefigure</hi> his coming, and will have his Church still under <hi>Ceremonial Pedagogie,</hi> as it was under the Law. 2. Because they joyn unto Christ, <hi>their own devices</hi>; as if either JESUS were not sufficient for salvation, or his <hi>Ordinances</hi> were not sufficient for means to attain thereunto. 3. The observation of the <hi>Distinction of meats,</hi> is a point of <hi>serving the Tabernacle:</hi> for so doth the Apostle reckon. 4. Such as will eat of JESUS, and be <hi>partakers</hi> of him, must beware to <hi>serve the Iewish Tabernacle,</hi> by keeping on foot, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> and appurtenances annexed thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: such <hi>Feasts,</hi> such <hi>Iubilies,</hi> such <hi>Altars,</hi> such <hi>Sprinklings,</hi> and <hi>Holy water,</hi> such <hi>Priests and Vestiments, &amp;c.</hi> as <hi>Levi</hi> had.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>He calleth Christ, by the name of the Altar; because he is the thing signified by the Altar, and by the Sacrifice, and by the rest of the Levitical Ceremonies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. Those <hi>Ordinances</hi> of <hi>Levitical Service,</hi> were <hi>Figures</hi> of Christ, some in one part, and some in another; and he is the accomplishment of them, even the Truth of them <hi>All:</hi> The <hi>true Tabernacle, the true Priest, the true Sacrifice, the true Altar, &amp;c.</hi> 2. Christs self is all the Altar that the Christian Church hath. Our Altar is he onely, and nothing but he. The Apostle knoweth no other.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>In that he saith, They have no right to eat, learn,</hi> 1. That Jesus is our food, who believe in him, by whom our souls are kept alive, and maintained every day spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, as the <hi>Priests</hi> were maintained by the old Altar bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily. 2. That before a man attain to eat, or draw bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit from Christ, he must have a right unto him. There is a possession following the right, and the right tendeth to the possession. 3. He who loveth to have the right, must take the course which Christ prescribeth, without mixing any thing therewith.</p>

Again, Like as the Sin-offering, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the body thereof was burnt without the Camp, yet the blood of it was brought within the Sanctuary, to make a Figurative Attonement: Even so, how basely soever men did use Christs Body, in casting of it without the City, yet was his Blood in high estimation with God, made Attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the people; and sanctified them.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 13.</hi> Let us go forth, therefore, unto him, without the Camp; bearing his reproach.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hence he draweth an Exhortation, To be ready to renounce the world, and to take up our Cross and follow Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Wherein he teacheth us,</hi> 1. That Christs sufferings with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the City, represented the state of his mystical Body, and Kingdom, thrust forth, and contemptibly rejected of the World. 2. That such as will be partakers of Christ, must resolve to be so handled also, and must sequestrate their affections from the World, and must be contented to be crucified unto the World, with our Lord and Master Christ Jesus. 3. That what reproach is suffered for Christs sake, is not the mans, but Christs reproach, for whom it is suffered: And, so the reproach is as honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble before God, as it is ignominious before the World.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 14.</hi> For, here we have no continuing City; but we seek one to come.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He giveth a Reason of this Exhortation. Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the instability of this present World, and our short and uncertain time of pilgrimage therein, should be a motive to make us loose our affections off it in time. 2. That the hope of a quiet, and sure, and blessed place of rest hereafter, should be another motive to make us renounce this World with the better will. 3. That the true Pilgrims imployment in this World, is, to be seeking how to come home to his own Countrey, and City, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for him.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 15.</hi> By him therefore, let us offer the Sacrifice of praise to GOD continually: that is, the fruit of our lips, giving thanks to his name.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Another Exhortation to offer Spiritual Sacrifices. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we learn.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. That as Christ hath abolished all properly called <hi>Priests,</hi> by Office; so hath he made all Christians spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Priests, by common duty. 2. As Christ hath offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the propitiatory Sacrifice of his own Body, once for all that are to be saved, and hath left no properly called Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, no Offering <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>or sin, no Propitiatory Offering, now to offer: So hath he appointed the spiritual Sacrifice of Thanks, to be offered by every faithful man and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, such as is Prayer, Praises, and Thanksgiving to God. 3. That these our Sacrifices of Prayer, and Praise, is the spiritual service of Saints, answerable to the Thank-offering of the first-fruits, and Calves, and Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks; which was the external Sacrifice of the Old Church. 4. That the Offering of these spiritual Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, is not tied unto set hours, as the Legal; but to be done continually. 5. That these our Sacrifices of Prayer and Praises, are not to be offered by the mediation of
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:49391:146"/>
Saint, or Angel, but by Jesus Christ onely. 6. That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit they be unworthy, as from us, yet being offered by Christs Mediation, they shall be accepted for service, at our hands.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 16.</hi> But, to do good, and to communicate, forget not: for, with such Sacrifice, God is well pleased.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Another Exhortation, to good Works, and Alms-deeds: Teaching us,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. That goods works, and Alms-deeds, are appointed to be of the number of spiritual Sacrifices, and a part of the Thank-Offerings of the Saints.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That because they are Sacrifices, they must not be offered to the Idol of our own credit, and estimation, or our own private ends; but unto God, even in obedience unto him, and for the glory of him. And, because they are a part of the Thank-offerings of the Saints, they must not incroach upon the Sin-offering of the Saviour, the onely Expiatory, the onely Propitiatory, and the onely Meritorious Sacrifice.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That being so offered, they are well-pleasing unto God: The smell of Christs Sin-offering, once offered, making our Thank-offering to be sweet smelling unto God.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 17.</hi> Obey them that have the rule over you, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit your selves, for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account: that they may do it with joy, and not with grief; for, that is unprofitable for you.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Another Exhortation, to obey such as had the Rule over them; their Guides, and Leaders, as the word importeth: That is, publique Office-bearers in the Church, appointed of God, to teach, and govern them, by the Word, and Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Censures.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. The Churches of Christ are not dens of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion, but Houses of Order: having some to be Guides and Rulers, and some to be instructed and guided, by the direction of Gods Word and Ordinances.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Even the meanest and poorest Churches, albeit no more powerful than were the Churches of these scatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Hebrews,</hi> must be so provided.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The right duty of the Office-bearers in the Church, is, first, to be guides, pointing out the way in Gods word, which the people should keep towards Heaven. Next, to be Leaders, going before them in the example of Faith, and the fruits thereof in their conversation. And third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Rulers, by the Rod of Discipline, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o take order with the scandalous, and to recal Wanderers, to incourage the obedient: for, thus much doth the word import.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The duty of the people, is, to obey the direction of such Guides, and Rulers, and to submit themselves unto their censures, and to maintain them in their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, every way; that this order may be continued, and not fall by any want, which the people may sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The Reason which he useth to induce them, is,</hi> They watch for your souls, as they who must give account.</p>
                  <p>Then, 1. The charge of Church-Rulers, is the heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est of all charges, because of souls.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The most assiduous and painful, setting, not of the body onely, but the spirit on work; because it is a charge, of <hi>Watching.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The most dangerous of all Charges, because the account of lost souls within the Church, shall be craved at their hands, whether they have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came them to do, to save them, or not.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The weightiness of their Charge, should affect their people, and move them to concur, for their parts, as they are able, for their encouragement.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Another motive is,</hi> That they may do their work with joy, and not with grief: for that is unprofitable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, <hi>saith he.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. Church-mens chief joy, should be their peoples obedience unto Gods directions in their mouth: and their chief grief, if it be otherwise.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Whether they will get joy or grief from their people, they must do their work, and follow their Charge.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The less comfortable people be unto their Leaders, their Teachers and Rulers, the less profit shall they have by their Ministery.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 18.</hi> Pray for us: For we trust wee have a good conscience, in all things, willing to live ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>His craving the benefit of their Prayers for him, Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. That albeit the Scripture giveth no warrant to seek the benefit of the Prayer of Saints departed, or of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels: yet it giveth warrant for seeking of the mutual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence in Prayer, of those that are living together, and militant here on Earth together. 2. That the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Apostle hath need of the prayers of the meanest Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, and may be helped thereby.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>He giveth a Reason, answering all the calumnies which were spread of him by his Adversaries; that they might, with greater freedom, pray for him, as for an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. They who are unjustly reported of, must comfort themselves in the Testimony of a good Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. 2. An honest heart may expect the better fruit of their own prayers, and others. 3. And such as we know are sincerely set to serve God, we may with the better cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage pray for them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>He expoundeth what he calleth</hi> a good Conscience; <hi>by saying, that he was willing to live honestly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, the purpose, desire, and endeavour to live ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly, is the evidence of a good Conscience, and the ground also of the good Testimony; because such a disposition escheweth to do evil, and is careful to do good.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 19.</hi> But I beseech you the rather to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He joyneth a Reason, for their own good, to pray for him, that the impediments of his coming unto them, being removed by their prayers, he might come the sooner.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. When our own good is joyned with the good of such as call for our prayers, we have the more induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to set us on work. 2. Many hinderances of our good and comfort, do stand in the way, which by Prayer might be removed.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 20.</hi> Now, the God of Peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Iesus, that great Shepherd of the sheep, through the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> of the Everlasting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Now, he prayeth for them, whom he had in the former words, requested to pray for him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. Prayer is a mutual duty, and ought to be made by us, for such as we desire to pray for us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>He stileth God, to whom he prayeth, first, the God of Peace: To teach us,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That Peace proceeded from God, and is preserved by him, in his Church; and that it doth please him well, that his children should be in peace, and should study thereunto.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Again, he describeth God, by the great work of Christs Resurrection wrought by him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. As Christs Resurrection is the work of his own power, <hi>Iohn</hi> 10.18. So also is it the work of God the Father, in this place: For, <hi>Iohn</hi> 10.30. the Father and Christ, in power are one.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>The Props of his faith in prayer, are, first, the office of Iesus, who is the</hi> Great Shepherd of the sheep.</p>
                  <p>Then, 1. Those who come under the reckoning of Christs sheep, are the onely people, of whom he, by special Office, professeth to take charge. 2. Howsoever he imploy the Ministery of men, to feed his flock under him; yet doth he keep the place and stile of <hi>Arch-pastor,</hi> or <hi>Great Shepherd,</hi> to himself. 3. People, howsoever they be furnished by Ministers, yet they have the Great Shepherd to acknowledge and relie upon: of whose care
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:49391:146"/>
and fidelity, for their feeding, and preservation, they may be confident.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>The next Prop of this Prayer, is,</hi> The power of God, who brought again from the dead the Great Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd.</p>
                  <p>Then, 1. The sheep must not think to be above the Shepherd: but must resolve, for bearing witness to the truth, to be put to death, as he was, if God please<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. Nor need they fear to be used so, seeing he is risen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: because, he that raised the Shepherd for the sheeps cause, can raise the sheep from death also, for the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds cause.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>The third Prop of Confidence for obtaining this Prayer, is,</hi> The blood of the Everlasting Covenant, <hi>through which he seeketh his petition to be granted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. It is Christs Blood which hath ratified the Covenant, and established our Reconciliation, to endure for ever; because the vertue of that blood is perpetual<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. It is through that Blood, that everything is purchased, for which we can pray. It is the price of the purchase of Sanctification unto us, as well as Salvation.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 21.</hi> Make you perfect, in every good work, to do his will; working in you that which is well-pleasing in his sight, through Iesus Christ: to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That which he prayeth for here, is,</hi> That they may be made perfect, in every good work, to do the will of God.</p>
                  <p>Then, 1. Onely the doing of Gods will, and what he hath commanded, is to be reckoned for a good work. 2. It is not enough to be given to some sort of good work, but we must endeavour our selves to work every sort of good work; having a due respect unto all Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments. 3. Whatsoever measure we have attained unto, we must not stand there, but perfection must be aimed at, which is still before us, until we come to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The way how this may be done, he sheweth to be,</hi> By Gods working in us that which is well-pleasing in his sight, even through Jesus Christ.</p>
                  <p>Then, 1. It is not by any strength of our own, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by good works are wrought, but even by the power of God working in us graciously. 2. It is through Jesus Christ, that this working is procured, conveyed unto us, and made acceptable unto God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>He closeth his prayer, with ascribing of Glory unto Iesus,</hi> for ever. Amen.</p>
                  <p>Then, 1. Christ Jesus is true God, worthy of Divine Glory, for ever. 2. The Prayer and Praises which we offer unto God, must come from so advised a minde, as we may seal the same with Faith, and hearty Affection, imported in AMEN.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 22</hi> And, I beseech you, brethren, suffer the word of Exhortation: for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I have written a Letter unto you in few words.</q>

                  </p>
                  <p>Then, 1. There is need of Preachers, by the word of Exhortation, to dilate and inculcate that which the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture hath in short. 2.

                  <p>SOme inconsiderate hand hath put to this <hi>Postscript,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearingly: For, this Epistle was ordained by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, to carry the news of <hi>Timothies</hi> Liberation, and a promise of his coming unto them, afterwards possibly, as the <hi>23 Verse</hi> of this <hi>Chapter</hi> sheweth, and not to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by <hi>Timothy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And again, The Apostle was bound by this Letter, to come with <hi>Timothy,</hi> if he had been to come shortly after the writing of this Epistle.</p>
                  <p>And thirdly, <hi>Timothy</hi> was not yet come to that place where the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> was when this Epistle was direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: for, then had he been certain of <hi>Timothies</hi> purpose; and behoved, if not to go with <hi>Timothy,</hi> yet to have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the reason of so sudden a change of his purpose and written promise: or else, to have deleted the promise of his coming out of the Epistle, by writing it over again, or some way else.</p>
                  <p>Whence we collect, <hi>That Postscripts are not a part of the Text, nor of the Apostles own writing; neither ought they to have such authority or credit as the Text hath, which always agreeth with it self, as proceeding from the inspiration of the Holy Spirit: To whom with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord, be Glory, for ever. Amen.</hi>

Every Chapter hath its number of admonitions, as is more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially shewn in their explications. All which admonitions, although they are written for the use of the Catholick Church, yet it appears the Apostle would have them read especially by all the dispersed Israelites, and those that were converted to the Faith, and that were not, of which design there are <hi>three</hi> Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters.</p>

                  <hi>Vers. 1. James</hi> a servant of God, and of the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, to the twelve Tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.</q>
               <p>The Writer is described in the inscription of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle, <hi>Iames a servant of God, and of the Lord Iesus Christ, viz.</hi> in the office of Apostleship, whereby hee might with authority teach all the Tribes of <hi>Israel,</hi> and admonish them concerning their duties: hee calls himself the <hi>servant of God,</hi> to shew that hee serves God the Father, by serving his Son Jesus Christ, and writes these things by the special authority of God and Christ. Those to whom the Epistle is written are Israelites, especially beleevers, cast out of the holy land, and dispersed through the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions; But (as to the hope of Heaven represented by the holy Land) gathered to Jesus our Saviour. Hee serious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commands (and as it is allowed to Christians) bids them to rejoyce, or greets them with a borrowed form of salutation, from the common use of the Heathens, but turned into a Christian sense.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 2.</hi> My Brethren, count it all joy, when yee fall into divers temptations,</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Admon.</hi> 1. That they take not ill or impatiently out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward afflictions and persecutions for the Gospel, but cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect this carnal judgement touching those external ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises whereby God tryed or proved their Faith and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity. For this end the Proposition is stated contrary to the judgement of the flesh, <hi>viz.</hi> It is to bee accounted matter of all joy, or the chiefest joy, when yee fall, by the providence of God, into divers persecutions or afflictions, whereby yee may be proved, whether yee will even in adversity, stick close to God: Hee confirms this Thesis with <hi>seven</hi> Arguments.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 3.</hi> Knowing this, that the tryal of your Faith worketh patience,</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. Those temptations are the tryal of your Faith, the polishing of it, and bringing it into open view: Therefore yee ought to esteem it matter of great joy when yee fall into divers ttmptations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Worketh] Argum.</hi> 2. Because this exercise will bring forth patience in you, which is of greater price than that your affliction may be compared with it: Therefore, &amp;c.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 4.</hi> But let patience have her perfect work; that yee may be perfect and en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 3. Joyned with an exhortation, There is need of divers afflictions, and that they stay upon you (<hi>viz.</hi> so long as God shall see fit) that the work of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience may be perfected, and that yee that have other en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments, may also have the gift of patience, and so the image of Christ may be compleated in you, that nothing may be wanting to you, for perfection of the parts of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness: Therefore yee ought to count it all joy when yee fall into afflictions.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 5.</hi> If any of you lack wisdome, let him ask it of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not, and it shall be given him.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 4. Propounded by way of answer to an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection; Wisdome is at hand, which may effectually ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister, to all that are afflicted (that ask this gift of God) reasons both of joy and patience in these tryals: Therefore wee ought to rejoyce in afflictions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Who gives</hi>] Hee confirms this Argument from the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant Grace of God, who gives to all that ask free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, abundantly, and without upbraiding their unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, or ingratitude in praying, and gives to the penitent person, whatsoever spiritual gift is asked, as much as is sufficient to salvation.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 6.</hi> But let him ask in Faith, nothing wavering: for hee that wavereth, is like a wave of the Sea, dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with the wind, and tossed.</q>
               <p>Hee explains the same Argument from the praying par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, requiring that he ask in Faith or confidence ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the promise of God concerning giving the gift, not doubting, whether God will grant that necessary gift promised to him. Of which confidence required, and wavering prohibited, hee gives <hi>three</hi> Reasons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For hee] Reas.</hi> 1. Because hee that wavereth, being tossed hither and thither in his prayers, doubtful whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hee shall finde God true and merciful, is like to waves of the Sea, which are by the wind driven hither and thither, and vanish without profit.</p>
               <q>
                  <pb n="279" facs="tcp:49391:147"/>
                  <hi>Vers. 7.</hi> For let not that man think that hee shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive anything of the Lord.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 2. Because that wavering, which ends not in the conclusion of Faith, makes prayers of none effect, which God doth not grant.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 8.</hi> A double-minded man is unstable in all his waies.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 3. Because such an unfaithful doubter or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain what to determine, is unstable, and unconstant in his counsels and actions, and no less ready to depart from God, than to remain with him, holding nothing firmly in the present business of Religion, which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 9.</hi> Let the Brother of low degree rejoyce in that hee is exalted:</q>
               <p>Hee returns to his purpose, and adds the <hi>fifth Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> to prove, that in the exercise of the cross, there may be matter of joy: Hee that through afflictions, or the cross, is humbled by the Lord, can glory in his tryals, as in the mark of his adoption and exaltation, to the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of being an adopted Son of God, and to the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of the Saints, which preferment doth far surp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ss the Riches of the Rich, and the Thrones of Kings: Therefore yee ought to glory in the tryals which the Cross makes.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 10.</hi> But the Rich, in that hee is made low: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause as the flower of the grass hee shall pass a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
                  <p n="11">
                     <hi>11.</hi> For the Sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass: and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his waies.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 6. Hee that is rich, and yet untouched by persecutours and afflictions, hath no matter of joy in his prosperity, but in the abasement of his mind, or in his preparation to bear the cross, or afflictions, with others that are afflicted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Because</hi>] The reason is given, Because hee that is not so wise, but trusteth in his riches, is vain, and shall come to nothing (as the flower of the grass shall wither and perish) with all his counsels.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 12.</hi> Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when hee is tryed, hee shall receive the Crown of life which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 7. Hee that patiently bears afflictions, and is found approved in the Faith, is already blessed, and shall at length obtain the promised Crown of eternal life, whereunto hee is now prepared by the exercise of the cross: Therefore this exercise by the cross is to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed matter of joy.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 13.</hi> Let no man say when hee is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, neither tempteth hee any man.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Admon.</hi> 2. Touching a right judgement of inward temptations, lest any one violate the sanctity of God, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in their thoughts, as if God solicited any one to sin, which is a familiar thing with the Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> to cast the blame upon God, as the Author.</p>
               <p>There are <hi>eight</hi> Arguments of the Admonition or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, all which prove that temptations to evil are not to be ascribed to God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For God] Argum.</hi> 1. God cannot be solicited or moved to sin: Therefore neither can hee solicit any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to sin, and consequently temptation to sin is not to be ascribed to God.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 14.</hi> But every man is tempted, when hee is drawn away of his own last, and enticed.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. Every mans proper lust is the true cause of temptation: Therefore it is not to be ascribed to God. Hee proves the Antecedent, by unfolding the method of temptation to sin in its <hi>five</hi> degrees. For, <hi>first,</hi> Man is drawn by his depraved lust from the true good, that hee may not rest quiet in it: <hi>Furthermore,</hi> hee is enticed by a false appearance of good, to follow that which is evil.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 15.</hi> Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin when it is finished, bringeth forth death.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Hee conceives in his will and heart the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of sinning actually. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Hee actually sins. And <hi>fifthly,</hi> Sin committed, by its desert bringeth forth as it were, and procureth death. And so original wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness bringeth forth actual sin, and by degrees carries it on to further encrease.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 16.</hi> Do not erre, my beloved Brethren.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 3. Yee will mistake, and hold a false and blasphemous opinion, if yee ascribe the cause of your impulse to sin unto God.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 17.</hi> Every good gift, and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of turning.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 4. God is the fountain and author of all good, (which is in us, or that which is given to us, either in the state of nature or grace) and of good onely; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause from him descends all good, and every gift which any waies conduces to our perfection: Therefore we must not say that God is the cause of evil or sin in us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of lights] Argum.</hi> 5. God is the Father of lights, knowledge, and understanding, holiness, and happiness: Therefore hee is not the Father of darkness or sin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>With</hi>] God is immutable in his nature, without all variableness, either to worse or better: From all eternity alwaies, so like himself in all things, that there is no foundation of changeableness of himself from himself, nor the least shadow of motion or turning in him: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is impossible that God should be the author of sin.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 18.</hi> Of his own will begat hee us with the Word of Truth, that wee should be a kinde of first-fruits of his creatures.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 7. God moved by his will alone, hath regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated and converted us by the Word of the Gospel, from the state of sin, to the image of his holiness: Therefore; &amp;c.</p>

                  <hi>That wee should be] Argum.</hi> 8. The end of our rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration is intended by God, that wee be holy, and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly consecrated, (as the first-fruits under the Law) to his glory: Therefore wee ought not to admit any blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous thoughts concerning him, as if wee were moved by him to evil or sin.</p>

               <p>The <hi>third</hi> Admonition is taken from the mentioning their regeneration by the Word of Truth, That they seriously determine how they may really shew themselves religious, and truly regenerate. And this Admonition is <hi>threefold</hi>; In the <hi>first</hi> hee teaches the manner of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and receiving the Word of God, whereby they might be prepared to practice, to <hi>vers.</hi> 22. <hi>Secondly.</hi> Hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands in general, that they bring the Word into practice, to <hi>vers.</hi> 29. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Hee commands in particular that they make manifest the virtue of their religion in the holiness of speech, and in works of charity.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>first</hi> branch of the Admonition, touching the hearing of the Word, hee requires <hi>five</hi> things. (1.) That they be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He that diligently looks into the word of God, studiously inquiring into all the will of God, which is called the <hi>Law,</hi> or <hi>the Doctrine of Liberty</hi>: Because it reaches the true means of freedom from sin and wrath, and of serving God ingenuously, as it becomes Gods freemen, who are bound by love and thankfulness to please God. (2.) He that perseveres continuing in the study of the Doctrine of Holiness. (3.) He that bewareth lest he forget the things which he hath learned. (4.) He that endeavoureth to practise that which Gods word commands: Truly he shall be blessed in his work, because although it is impossible he should deserve happiness by his works, yet it shall be declared by his works before all, that he is blessed, and in the exercise of good works, as walking in the way to heaven, he shall certainly obtain the blessednesse promised to the Saints, and so shall be blessed in his work.</p>

                  <hi>Vers. 26.</hi> If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this mans religion is vain.</q>
               <p>In the <hi>third</hi> member of the admonition he requires <hi>two</hi> things: (1.) That they which would be Religious, and truly so accounted, let them bridle their tongues and attend, that what they speak may be agreeable to the commands of God, and approved by him. He gives <hi>two</hi> reasons of this condition: (1.) He that doth otherwise, and thinks himself Religious, deceiveth his own heart. (2.) He is an hypocrite, whom such Religion will not profit, because the mouth speaketh out of the abundance of the heart: he is to be accounted little to regard his heart, who doth not bridle his tongue.</p>

                  <hi>Vers. 27.</hi> Pure religion, and undefiled before God and the Father, is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.</q>

               <p>As for the works of Charity, for example, he names, <hi>Compassion towards the fatherless and needy</hi> in their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction: For to <hi>visit,</hi> is liberally and bountifully to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour the misery and necessity of others, under which duty he Synecdochically comprehends the other duties towards our neighbour.</p>
               <p>As for an holy conversation, he comprehends that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the endeavour of preserving our selves, through the grace of God, undefiled from the world, or from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filements which are abroad in the world, and from the contagion of other mens sins, so that we pollute not our selves with wickedness, nor have fellowship with those that pollute themselves in the mire of sin.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>THere are <hi>two</hi> Admonitions contained in this Chapter: The <hi>first</hi> is to shun respect of persons, especially in Ecclesiastical matters, to <hi>ver. 14.</hi> The <hi>other</hi> to avoid vain boastings of faith, where good works are want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               </argument>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 1.</hi> My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Iesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</q>
               <p>The <hi>first</hi> vice which he admonishes them to avoid, is respect of persons, which is committed, when in the same cause more or less is attributed to any one, than is fitting, by reason of something in his person, which nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to that cause. So they offended amongst the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews, who did magnifie faith in Christ in the richer sort, but esteemed the same faith as nothing in the poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er sort, so that the rich, though unbelievers, were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed very highly; but the poor were accounted, though believers, of no value, but contemned. He dehorts them from this vice by ten <hi>Arguments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. Jesus Christ is glorious, and faith in him is equally glorious in all: Therefore you ought to beware of respect of persons.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 2.</hi> For if there come unto your Assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man, in vile rayment,</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <hi>3.</hi> And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay cloathing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool:</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <hi>4.</hi> Are ye not then partial in your selves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argu.</hi> 2. This respect of persons, is condemned even by your consciences (which he makes apparent from the example of their practice:) For rich men, unbelievers, coming into your Churches, haply out of curiosity onely, are so publikely honoured, out of meer respect to their riches, that in the mean time your poor brethren are slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>ver.</hi> 2, 3. He urges this testimony of their consciences by way of interrogation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And become] Argum.</hi> 3. They that respect persons are perverse Judges; whose thoughts are perverse, not that it is unmeet to honour the rich, or more to honour the rich than the poor; but that it is unmeet to honour the rich, though wicked, for their riches sake, with contempt of the faithful and godly poor, because they are poor: For so riches are accounted the sole cause of honouring men, and piety is contemned without riches: Therefore respect of persons is to be avoided.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 5.</hi> Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world, rich in faith, and heirs of the Kingdom, which he hath promised to them that love him?</p>
                  <p n="6">
                     <hi>6.</hi> But ye have despised the poor: Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgement-seats?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 4. By this respect of persons yee dishonour the poor, whom God hath honoured, by chusing them into the inheritance of his Kingdome, by adorning them with better riches, than these worldly riches are, <hi>viz.</hi> with the riches of Faith, and Love of God, and with promises of the inheritance of Heaven, which are saving graces: Therefore respect of persons is to be avoided.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Do not rich men] Argum.</hi> 5. Because by the respect of persons yee are so inconsiderate, that yee honour the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick enemies of the Gospel (who are honourable, neither in respect of Magistracy, nor in any other, except for riches sake, but tyrannically usurp power over you, which is not given to them, oppress you, and accuse you before Judges, and draw your bodies to the judgement-seats, and blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme Christs glorious name from whence yee are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated Christians) which is the highest foolishness: Therefore respect of persons is to be avoided.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 8.</hi> If yee fulfil the royal Law according to the Scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy self, yee do well.</p>
                  <p n="9">
                     <hi>9.</hi> But if yee have respect to persons, yee commit sin, and are convinced of the Law as transgressours.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 6. By preventing an Objection; Because in this respect of persons, yee are by the Law reproved as transgressors. For it yee would pay that civil respect which is due to every one according to his outward and civil condition, and according to every ones merits, yee may be excused if yee would give to men of greater for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune that which is meet, and not deprive your beleeving Brethren of that which is equal, fulfilling the royal Law of God, the King of Kings, by communicating to others a measure, according to the common rule of love, (even as your selves may expect a just measure from others) then indeed might yee be pardoned, <hi>vers.</hi> 8. But when yee give undue honour to rich men, but do not give due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the poor that are Beleevers, in this you respect persons, and are held guilty of sin, and transgressours of the Law: Therefore respect of persons is to bee avoided.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 10.</hi> For whosoever shall keep the whole Law, and yet offend in one point, hee is guilty of all.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 7. Confirming the former, If yee indulge your selves in this respect of persons onely, contemning the poor beleevers, yee shall be accounted guilty of the whole Law, although yee make shew of observing all the other Precepts, excepting onely this, Because, whosoever offendeth in one Precept alone, hee is guilty of the violation of all, not that all concur in one sin, but because there is a conjunction of all the commandements in one rule of justice, and in one alone the same autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of God is violated in all; and so the general guilt of all the Laws, or the curse of God by the violation of one Law is drawn upon you, although the difference of the guilt and curse remaineth in special degrees: Therefore respect of persons is to be avoided.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 11.</hi> For hee that said, Do not commit Adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now, if thou commit no Adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressor of the Law.</q>
               <p>Hee confirms this Argument in the example of the sixth and seventh Commandement; whereof in the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of either, the authority of him that commandeth both is violated.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 12.</hi> So speak yee, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the Law of Liberty.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 8. Propounded by way of exhortation; So ought yee to speak and do, especially towards the poor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, as knowing that your selves are to be judged without respect of persons, according to the Doctrine of the Gospel, which forbids respect of persons: Therefore, &amp;c.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 13.</hi> For hee shall have judgement without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy; and mercy rejoyceth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst judgement.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 9. Unless yee exercise mercy, especially to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards your poor and afflicted Brethren, yee shall have judgement, it is to be feared, without mercy: Therefore avoid respect of persons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rejoyceth] Argum.</hi> 10. If yee exercise mercy, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally towards your poor afflicted Brethren, as the Gospel requires, yee have no reason to fear wrath or judgement without mercy, but yee may by this be certified of Gods mercy, whereupon relying, yee may rejoyce against the severity of Judgement meerly, as from which yee are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered through the mercy of God: Therefore unless yee would renounce mercy, and make your selves obnoxious to judgement, yee ought to avoid this respect of persons which is joyned with cruelty.</p>

                  <head>The Second Part.</head>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 14.</hi> What doth it profit, my Brethren, though a man say hee hath Faith, and have not works? can Faith save him?</q>
                  <p>The other Admonition for avoiding the vanity of boasting, touching a vain and idle Faith. The Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is determined in the first words. That the Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Faith is unprofitable and vain, which is destitute of works. Hee proves this by <hi>nine</hi> Arguments.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. Because such Faith, which is void of fruits, cannot save him that boasts of his vain Faith: Therefore his profession is vain.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vers. 15.</hi> If a Brother or Sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,</p>

                        <hi>16.</hi> And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, bee you warmed, and filled: notwithstanding yee give them not those things which are needful to the body, what doth it profit?</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. Verbal profession of empty charity is vain, and unprofitable, both to him that professes it, and to the hungry, to whom words are given in stead of meat: Therefore also the meer Profession of Faith is vain.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 17.</hi> Even so Faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 3. Charity, which consists onely in an outward profession, is dead: Therefore also Faith which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in an outward profession, without works, is dead, and vain.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 18.</hi> Yea a man may say, Thou hast Faith, and I have works: Shew mee thy Faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my Faith by my works.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 4. Such a profession of Faith is apparently vain, when it shall come to the tryal, as it appears in the supposition of the Dialogue set down betwixt the true beleever, who can shew his Faith by his Works, and the boasting hypocrite, who cannot demonstrate his Faith by his life and works: Therefore that boasting of Faith is vain and unprofitable.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 19.</hi> Thou beleevest that there is one God, thou dost well: the Devils also beleeve, and tremble.</q>

Faith which is called <hi>Historical,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by wee beleeve the Truth of the Articles of Faith, touching the unity of God, and such like<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> although this bee good, yet it is not sufficient to salvation, it is not saving Faith; Because the Devils beleeve the Truth of the Divine Word, and tremble: Therefore much less doth the vain profession of Faith destitute of works profit to salvation.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 20.</hi> But wilt thou know, O vain man, that Faith without works is dead.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 6. Propounded by way of Dialogue; Hee that glorieth and resteth upon such Faith that is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out works, not knowing it to be dead, is a vain and empty man, as a vessel, the more empty it is the more it sounds: and hence hee proceeds to the seventh Argument.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 21.</hi> Was not <hi>Abraham</hi> our Father justified by works, when hee had offered <hi>Isaac</hi> his Son upon the Altar?</q>

                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 7. Proving that faith without works is dead, and consequently the profession of faith, which wanteth works, to be vain, from the example of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who in the foresaid matter touching the demonstration of his faith, whether it were alive or dead, is found and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared just by his works, and here by an interrogation he urges the conscience of the hypocrite. <hi>Abraham</hi> the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the faithful is justified before the whole world, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his faith was not dead, but alive by his works, when he had offered <hi>Isaac</hi> his son upon the Altar, in testimony of the sincerity of his faith; or that he by a lively faith believed in God, and pleased not himself in the vain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of an idle or dead faith, as many do: Therefore faith which is without works, is dead and vain.

If <hi>Abraham</hi> was justified by works, he hath whereof to glory, but not before God; therefore he is not justified before God by works: But <hi>Iames</hi> argues thus, <hi>Abraham</hi> is justified by works before men, who might say to him, Shew me thy faith by thy works, or demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate to me, that thy faith is not dead, but alive: From which antecedent it doth not onely follow, Therefore faith without works is dead; but also, the conclusion agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with <hi>Pauls</hi> conclusion, Therefore <hi>Abraham</hi> is justified before God, not by that dead faith, and void of works, but by a lively faith, and efficacious in works, and so the Apostles agree very well.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 22.</hi> Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?</q>
                  <p>He shews that this is the minde of <hi>Iames,</hi> by convincing the boasting hypocrite, glorying of a dead faith; from this, that the faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> together with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of faith, had works joyned with it, so that his faith is declared to be perfected by works, and not found vain or dead.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 23.</hi> And the Scripture was fulfilled, which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the friend of God.</q>
                  <p>From hence also he infers an exposition of that Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture which <hi>Paul</hi> cites in the matter of Justification by faith, and so he fully demonstrates his consent with <hi>Paul,</hi> Seeing that <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith is perfectly declared by his wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 24.</hi> Ye see then how that by works a man is justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and not by faith onely?</q>
                  <p>The conclusion follows from these premises, against the boasting of hypocrites, touching their vain faith, that all pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ssing faith before men, are justified by their works, and not onely by the profession of their faith, or by a dead and vain faith, which you hypocrites boast of.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 25.</hi> Likewise also, was not Rahab the harlot justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by works, when she had received the Messengers, and had sent them out another way?</q>

That <hi>Iames</hi> takes Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification for no other than as we have said, doth appear from this, that he calls <hi>Rahab an Harlot,</hi> or prostitute to filthy lusts: Therefore how impossible was it for her to be justified by workes before God, but onely by true faith, which sheweth it self to be true by works.</p>

                  <p>THis Chapter contains <hi>two</hi> Admonitions: The <hi>first</hi> for governing of the tongue, to <hi>vers. 13.</hi> The <hi>other</hi> concerning wisdom, which asswages the evils of the tongue, and avoids strifes and contentions, to the end.</p>
               </argument>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 1.</hi> My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive greater condemnation.</q>
               <p>As for the first Admonition, he commands them to bridle the tongue; namely, from invective and rigid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearsals of other mens vices or infirmities. <hi>Be not</hi> (saith he) <hi>many masters; i. e.</hi> arrogate not to your selves the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of mastership over others, and too much liberty of carping at things (as many do) but bridle your tongues. He confirms the admonition by <hi>ten</hi> Arguments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Knowing] Argum.</hi> 1. Because that unjust censurers should suffer heavier judgement from God the revenger of injuries: Therefore the tongue is to be bridled, lest ye suffer an heavier judgement.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 2.</hi> For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. Seeing that we are all liable to many fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, it becometh us to deal more diligently with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of others, not to arrogate the authority of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without a calling, or to shew our selves unjust in judging.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If any man] Argum.</hi> 3. If any man know how to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern his tongue, he hath this to manifest a perfect, or sincere man, who can moderate all his actions; and on the contrary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he that cannot moderately rule his tongue, but in all things carps at the carriages of other men, hath the sign of an hypocrite: Therefore the tongue is to be bridled.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 3.</hi> Behold, we put bits in the horses mouthes, that they may obey us, and we turn about their whole body.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <hi>4.</hi> Behold also the ships, which though they be so great, and are driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm, whithersoever the governor listeth.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <hi>5.</hi> Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things: Behold how great a matter a little fire kindleth.</p>
                  <p n="6">
                     <hi>6.</hi> And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: So is the tongue amongst our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and it is set on fire of hell.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 4. Confirming the former: Even as if thou guidest the bridle, thou also rulest the horse; and if thou rulest the stern of the ship, thou dost also the ship: even so, if thou hast rightly governed thy tongue, thou wilt also rule thy whole body, and thy outward actions, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though those instruments are small, and the tongue is a small member: Therefore, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Boasts] Argum.</hi> 5. The tongue carrieth it self highly, and boasteth it self gloriously, that it can on both sides perform much good in speaking the truth, in constancy, taciturnity, courtesie, and such like; and also much e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, in lyes, reproaches, calumnies, and such like: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ought to be governed with great care.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A fire] Argum.</hi> 6. Because as a small fire can kindle and devour much matter; so the tongue, unless it be
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:49391:149"/>
appeased and bridled, can stir up a world of evils, and create infinite sins; and seeing it is a small part of the body, it can involve and defile all the other members, and the whole body with wickednesses, and set on fire with its wickedness, the wheel or course of all natural faculties: Therefore it is diligently to be govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of bell] Argum.</hi> 7. There is some affinity of an evil tongue with Hell and the Devil, whom the tongue is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to serve, and from him to send the flame of lyes, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies and brawlings, to burn the whole world: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is need of great diligence in ruling the tongue.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 7.</hi> For every kinde of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of man kinde.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 8. There is no kinde of beasts, but may be tamed by humane reason or art, and experience teacheth us, that some of all kindes are tamed, <hi>ver<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 7. but the tongue no humane reason or art can tame; because it is in its own nature an unquiet and an unruly evil, full of deadly poyson, whereby it brings, and is ready to bring deadly mischiefs unto others: Therefore ye must dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently endeavour to bridle the tongue by Gods supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral grace.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 9.</hi> Therewith bless we God, even the Father: and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 9. The tongue is mutable, deceitful, crafty, one while pretending it self to very good, blessing God; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther while openly putting forth its nature expresly, by cursing men, and God obliquely, to whose similitude men are made: from the same mouth, sometimes sending forth blessing, sometimes cursing, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. But this is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd and monstrous, which is in no wise to be suffered <hi>ver.</hi> 10. Therefore ye must necessarily endeavour the ruling of the tongue.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 11.</hi> Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter?</p>

                     <hi>12.</hi> Can the fig-tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine figs? so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 10. Confirming the former, by a <hi>fourfold</hi> simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of a <hi>fountain,</hi> a <hi>fig-tree,</hi> a <hi>vine,</hi> and the <hi>sea.</hi> And he argues from this which is impossible according to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to an absurdity in manners: As it is not naturally that from the same channel of the fountain sweet and bitter water should flow, or a fig-tree should bring forth grapes, and a vine figs, or the same sea should both yield salt and sweet water: so reason doth not suffer us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that it is the tongue of a regenerated man, which although sometimes it blesses, yet being unbridled, it is carried otherwise to cursing; for a bad tree doth not bear good fruits: Therefore it becomes the Regenerate to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the simplicity of holiness in speech, and to endeavour to bridle their tongues.</p>

                  <p>The other Admonition, wherein he exhorts to wisdom, joyned with meekness, which remedies the evils and emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of the tongue. The proposition is propounded in this verse: If any man will shew himself a prudent Christian, he ought to shew it in works of innocency and meekness: The Arguments are <hi>six.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 14.</hi> But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lye not against the truth.</q>
                  <p>

If any man laying aside his meekness, che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risheth contrary vices in his heart, emulation and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there is no matter of glorying, but rather of shame: Therefore ye ought to study the wisdome of meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>

The wisdom of contention, envying, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging of private injuries, is not that which descends from Heaven, from God, but is earthly, sensual and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villish, having its original from corrupt nature and the Devil: Therefore ye ought to study the wisdom of meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. Out of your lusts, which fight inwardly in your members, as it were, amongst themselves, and war against the salvation of soul and body, arise braw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:49391:150"/>
contentions, wars amongst men, such lusts are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness, ambition, fleshly lusts, and such like. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ye ought to beware of them.</p>

               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 4.</hi> Ye adulterers, and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world, is the enemy of God.</q>

                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 4. Lusts stirring up the love of this world in you, draw your souls into spiritual adultery, and make you adulterers and adulteresses, who are-consecrated to God in spiritual marriage: Therefore beware of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whosoever] Argum.</hi> 5. Carnal lusts that are inward, whilest they draw you into the love and friendship of this world, they bring you into hatred and enmity with God: For whosoever thinks to please himself, or hath deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to ingratiate himself with worldly men, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming himself to their manners, he makes war against God, and fights in the Camp of his adversaries: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you must beware of them.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 5.</hi> Do ye think that the Scripture saith in vain, The spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy?</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 6. Confirming the former: The spirit of the old man (from whence all carnal lusts are stirred up) which by nature dwells in us, by its natural violence, or by the impulse of the Devil, is carried into envy and hatred, both of God and our neighbour, as the Scripture doth not in vain teach in many places, speaking of the corrupt nature of man: Therefore it follows, that the friends of the world, serving the lusts of the flesh, are enemies to God, and those carnal lusts also take their rice from the wicked spirit.</p>

Now God (<hi>viz.</hi> after ye were born again, and converted to the faith of Christ) gives more grace than that ye should be seduced into envy or hatred of God and your neighbour, by the old spirit dwelling in you, which he proves from the Scripture, teaching, that as God resisteth, and is an adversary to the irregenerate, proud, and those that are acted by the old spirit, so also he gives grace and help to the regenerate that repent, and are humble, that they may restrain their carnal lusts: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ye ought to shun carnal lusts. This is the first reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy against fleshly lusts.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 8. Propounded by way of Exhortation: If as it becomes the regenerate, ye embrace the friendship of God, and subject your selves in humility to be ruled by him, resisting the Devil, who leads on the troop of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He which detracts from the reputation of his brother, and judgeth or condemneth him, he also detracts from the Law, and judges or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth the Law. The reason is, because the Law for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids and condemneth rash judging and evil reports: but the backbiter on the contrary, in the very act whilest he diminishes the fame of other men, he allows that practice as if it were good, and so speaketh, and so doth contrary to the Law, and pronounces the Law neither good, nor worthy to be obeyed by any.</p>

                  <hi>The husbandman] Argum.</hi> 2. The husbandman patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the hope of harvest, or the precious fruits of the earth, bears a long time betwixt sowing and reaping, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the early rain, which falls after the seed is sown, and the latter rain, which falls about the time of harvest: Therefore it becometh you to suffer patiently until the Lords coming, under the hope of the fruits of patience, or of deliverance which will come from Heaven.</p>

The Lords coming is neer for the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of every one out of his tabernacle: and the time is short to the last judgement, if it be compared either with the time past, or with life eternal which is to come: Therefore your hearts are to be established, and by faith to be confirmed to patient expectation.</p>

Propounded by way of Exhortation, ye ought patiently to suffer injuries, even from them that are within the Church, without murmuring one against ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Therefore much more must ye bear injuries patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that are brought upon you by wicked rich men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lest</hi>] He confirms this Argument: Because otherwise it is to be feared, lest ye your selves, being guilty of this fault, be condemned by God the Judge, who stands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the door, ready to judge, if you grudge one against another.</p>
               <q>

               <p>

               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 11.</hi> Behold we count them happy, which endure: Ye have heard of the patience of Iob, and have seen the end of the Lord: that the Lord is very pittiful, and of tender mercy.</q>

Confirming the former, God is very merciful towards the afflicted, especially those that are injustly vexed by men, and is ready to pardon for his mercy sake, notwithstanding he is moved with their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions: Therefore ought ye patiently to suffer afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>

                  <hi>Vers. 12.</hi> But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath, but let your yea, be yea, and your nay, nay, lest ye fall into condemnation.</q>

He subjoyns <hi>three</hi> reasons.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Any] Reas.</hi> 2. Because otherwise ye will fall into the judgement and condemnation of God, as he hath threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Law.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 13.</hi> Is any among you afflicted? let him pray: Is any merry? let him sing Psalms.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Admonit.</hi> 4. Is concerning the manner of carrying themselves in prosperity and adversity, but especially sickness; whereof there are <hi>four</hi> branches: (1.) Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing those that are sick in minde, by reason of any afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that they may pray unto God; <hi>i. e.</hi> in God they may have ease from their trouble. (2.) Touching them that are cheerful in mind, lest they being drowned in securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty forget God, but that they change their chearfulness of minde into praising of God, and thanksgiving unto him: <hi>i. e.</hi> that they by some spiritual exercise cherish their chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, lest their joyfulness degenerate into fleshly lasci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viousness.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 14.</hi> Is any sick among you? let him call for the Elders of the Church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oyl in the name of the Lord.</q>
               <p n="3">(3.) Touching the sick in body, that before they fly to Physitians, they would turn themselves to God, and call for the Ministers of the Church, who may stir up repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, faith and comfort in them: Furthermore, that the Elders pray to God for the sick person. Thirdly, That if any one amongst the Elders, of what order soever, hath the gift of healing (which flourished in the Church in the Apostles times) let him in the name and authority of the Lord Jesus Christ (who gave this gift) use it, and by the example of Christs Disciples (who <hi>Mark</hi> 6.13. having received power from Christ, anointed many sick persons with oyl, and healed them) let him anoint him that is sick; concerning the restoring of whose health, the Holy Ghost hath certified him. For it is certain, that the Elders which were endued with the gift of healing, did not anoint any that were sick, but those onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning restoring of whose health they were certified by the Holy Ghost.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 15.</hi> And the prayer of faith, shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted sins, they shall be forgiven him.</q>
               <p>He shews, that there will follow a double effect upon this unction and prayer: (1.) If he that hath prayed for the gift of miraculous healing, believing by special reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation touching the success, this prayer coming from such a faith, will save the sick from a bodily disease: For the Lord saith, he will restore health to him, and will raise him up. The other effect is this, If any special sins have drawn the disease to the sick person, God being intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the sick, and the Elders, will forgive them.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 16.</hi> Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed: The ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.</q>
               <p n="4">(4.) Concerning the giving assistance to one another in the wounds and burthens of conscience, that whether admonished by the brethren of their sins, or tormented within by the burthen of sin, they would confess their sins one to another, and pray one for another, mutually succouring one another both by counsel and prayer to God, that they might be healed. There are <hi>four</hi> reasons of the branch.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That ye may be healed] Reas.</hi> 1. Because so the wounds of conscience, and errours of life might be healed, with which, as with diseases, they were sick.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Much] Reas.</hi> 2. Because the frequent prayer of a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous man, or true believer, stirred up by faith and love, availeth much, as a special means sanctified by God for the obtaining of things necessary for us.</p>

               <p>In the first place, <hi>Peter,</hi> the Penman of the Epistle, in the inscription is described from the Office of his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stleship, that he might give authority to this Epistle; Moreover, the Hebrews to whom he writ, are described, <hi>first,</hi> from their outward low condition, that they were strangers scattered through the Regions here mentioned, not excluding the rest that lived otherwhere. The <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,</hi> from the inward, spiritual, and excellent state, <hi>viz.</hi> that they were <hi>elected, foreknown, sanctified, partakers of the obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Iesus Christ:</hi> For to be elected through Sanctification of the Spirit to the obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus, is to be elected, that we by way of Sanctification might come to a full participation of the fruits of Christs obedience, and sprinkling of his blood, or the imputed righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Christ made obedient to his Father for us, unto the death of the Cross: And so there are set down <hi>four</hi> causes of the excellent condition of the believing He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews, or our spiritual state: (1.) The election of God he Father, comprehending both the <hi>eternal</hi> election, wherein God from eternity would have them before o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers separated, for the obtaining salvation in Christ: and that <hi>temporal,</hi> wherein God by an efficacious calling, actually separated them from others. (2.) The <hi>other</hi> cause is, the foreknowledge of God, by which he means the act of Divine predilection, or eternal love, whereby he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in himself, or willed out of his meer love, to do good to all his sheep, and namely, to them. (3.) The <hi>Sanctification</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> by which he means the whole progress of the spiritual change of our state, from the beginning of our conversion, even unto perfect holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and glory. (4.) The obedience of Christ, and the sprinkling of his blood, whereby is meant both the active and passive righteousness of Christ (as some di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish) yea, the whole work of redemption, together with his application to their Justification and Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto God: which causes of Salvation are illustrated by naming the three Divine Persons, to which distinctly indeed, but without division or separation of persons, those causes in their order are ascribed, whereby we may very easily perceive the distinction, grace, vertue, and the order of their working: For fore-knowledge and election is ascribed to God the Father, as to the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of our felicity: To Christ, Reconciliation, as M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>se <hi>four:</hi> (1.) That the Prophets have not onely foretold concerning this salvation which was to come; but have also diligently enquired into this grace and salvation, and searched after it, that they might foretel it unto us. (2.) That they did not onely enquire, touching the grace of the Gospel that is revealed; but also concerning the point of time wherein it should be revealed. (3.) That they did not depend upon uncertain conjectures in this search, but took counsel of Christs Spirit, the foreknower and foreteller of all things (which was present with them after an extraordinary manner.) (4.) Because the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of salvation was the same both in our and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets times, and is briefly comprehended in the humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and sufferings of Christ, and in his exaltation or glory following in the effects of Christs sufferings: Therefore ye ought upon this account to bless God, and to be streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened in your holy faith.</p>

                  <hi>Vers. 12.</hi> Vnto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us they did minister the things which are now reported unto you, by them that have preached the Gospel unto you, with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven, which things the Angels de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to look into.</q>
               <p>The same testimony is propounded in the answer of the Spirit, which answer brings in,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 14. From the prerogative of believers after Christ was offered, above the condition of the Prophets, unto whom it was revealed, That although they should receive the fruit of their faith with us, yet they should not see the fulfilling and end of their prophecies, but we who were born after Christ was offered, by whom the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies were for this end uttered, that we comparing the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction with the accomplishment might be confirmed in faith: Therefore ye ought to bless God, and be strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened in faith.</p>

                  <hi>By them] Reas.</hi> 15. Those things which the Prophets did prophesie by the Spirit of Christ speaking in them, the Apostles have told to you by the Holy Ghost sent from heaven: Therefore ye may be certain, that this is the true grace wherein you stand, and therefore ye ought to bless God, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Angels] Reas.</hi> 16. So great is the excellency of faith and grace in which ye stand, that the heavenly Angels themselves desire to look into it; partly, that they may further enquire into it, partly that having looked into it, they may more delight themselves in admiring the glory of God in the grace bestowed upon the faithful: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ye ought to be confirmed in faith, and to bless God. But here he alludes to the type of the two Cherubims, who standing upon the Ark of the Covenant, did turn their faces towards the cover thereof, as if they desired to look into it: whereby, besides other things, were signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that the mysterie of the Incarnation of the Son of God, and Mans Redemption, was worthy the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the very Angels themselves, and their greatest ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration.</p>

(2.) That they be sober, not onely avoiding intemperance of meat and drink; but also all immoderate use of delightful things. (3.)

Confirming the former: There ought to be some similitude betwixt you and the Holy God, who hath called you: Therefore ought ye to labour after this conformity.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 7. God is the Judge of every mans works, and more severely requires holiness from those that draw nigh to him, and call him their Father: Therefore ye ought to pass the time of your sojourning here in this life, in the fear of God.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 18.</hi> Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers;</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 8. Ye are redeemed from all manner of vain conversation in Legal purifications, separated from the thing signified, and placed in humane traditions, which are of no value, although it may be commended to you by the example of your Fathers, and by tradition: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unless ye would frustrate your redemption, ye ought to endeavour after true piety, and renounce a vain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Redeemed] Argum.</hi> 9. By redemption ye are the hired servants of God, that ye may no longer live according to your own will, or the world, or the Devil, but according to the will of him that redeemed you: Therefore ye ought to live in the faith and obedience of Christ.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 19.</hi> But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a Lamb without blemish, and without spot,</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 10. The blood of Christ the Son of God dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, represented by the typical Lamb, is of so much excellency, that it far exceeds the most precious things in this world: Therefore ye ought to stand in the grace of Christ, and endeavour after holiness, unless ye will vilifie this price.</p>

                     <hi>Vers. 20.</hi> Who verily was fore-ordained before the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the world, but was manifest in the last times for you,</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 11. Although Christ from eternity was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordained to the work of Redemption, yet he was not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested until the last times, and that especially for your sakes, who were even as the lost sheep of <hi>Israel</hi>: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ye are chiefly bound to glorifie God by your holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 21.</hi> Who by him do believe in God that raised him up from the dead, and gave him glory that your faith and hope might be in God.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 12. Christ was not onely manifested for your good that are believers, but also by Christ, or the merit and operation of Christ, that same faith whereby ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in God is obtained and produced in you: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is meet, that ye should live to God in holiness.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hath raised</hi>] God by raising Christ the Redeemer from the dead, and by glorifying him with that glory which he had with God from all eternity, hath demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto you, and to all the world, that Christ is truly the Son of God, or truly God; that your faith whereby ye believe in Christ, might be found to be <hi>faith in God:</hi> and so the solidness of your faith might appear to you for your greater comfort and glory: Therefore ye faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Hebrews, who live after Christ is risen, are so much the more bound to follow after faith and holiness, that ye may please God.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 22.</hi> Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit, unto unfeigned love of the brethren: see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently,</q>

                     <pb n="290" facs="tcp:49391:153"/>The <hi>Second</hi> Exhortation more especially to brotherly love. There are <hi>three</hi> branches of this Exhortation: Branch (1.) That they love fervently, not coldly, not remisly, as if they were ready upon small cause to hate. (2.) That they love with a pure heart, endeavouring the good of one another, not onely aiming at private advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. (3.) That without hypocrisie, they follow after brotherly love, loving not onely in word and tongue, but shewing love in deed, without dissimulation, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Souls</hi>] There are <hi>three</hi> Arguments of the Exhortation: <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. It is to be presupposed, that ye being justified by faith, in desire, in purpose, and an inchoate endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, through the virtue of the Holy Spirit, have pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified your souls to the sincere love of the brethren: Therefore ye ought exceedingly to love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 23.</hi> Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God which liveth and abideth for ever.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. This brotherhood of believers is more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent than that which is after the flesh, in as much as it doth not rise from natural generation, but from spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual regeneration, which requires a more firm, mutual, and excellent love: Therefore ye ought to love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fervently.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Word] Argum.</hi> 3. Confirming the former: This fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity of believers, as it hath its rise from an incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble principle, so it will never perish. The word of God which is the seed of our regeneration, is not corruptible, like the seed of natural generation: Therefore ye ought exceedingly and carefully to love one another.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 24.</hi> For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man, as the flower of grass: The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away.</q>
                  <p>He confirms both parts of the comparison, from the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Scripture: And, <hi>first,</hi> he proves the corruptibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of natural seed, from <hi>Isa.</hi> 40.6. which declares the glory of all flesh, and consequently all relation of fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity founded in flesh, to be corruptible.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 25.</hi> But the word of the Lord endureth for ever: And this is the word, which by the Gospel is preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto you.</q>
                  <p>He proves, that the seed of Regeneration is incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, from the testimony of the same Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi>; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Word of the Lord abides for ever. But he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, that this is spoken touching the word of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, as the matter stands, because the preaching of the truth concerning salvation by Christ, vouchsafed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, is operative for the bringing of believers to life eternal: Therefore it is incorruptible.</p>

               <p>The <hi>first</hi> Exhortation is to love and desire of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Word, which he had of late commended.

                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. As the mothers milk is fit and natural nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the infant; so the Doctrine of the Gospel is meet for nourishing those that are spiritually regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated: Therefore we ought to desire and receive it.</p>

The word is, as it were, spirituall, rational, sincere, pure milk, and free from all errour, which can deceive no man, most convenient for the feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the soul: Therefore the Word of God is to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired by you.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 3.</hi> If so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 4. The Word of God contains nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the goodness of God, and our Saviour Jesus Christ, towards believers, whose sweetness they that have tasted, cannot but desire it: Therefore if ye have tasted that God is good, the Word of God is to be desired by you.</p>

Coming to Christ according to the Word of the Gospel, ye are not onely consecrated and dedicated to God, as his Temple; but also ye obtain an holy Priesthood, that ye may offer up better Sacrifices than those typical; <hi>viz.</hi> the fruit of spiritual obedience, which will please God, and be grateful and acceptable to him by the intercession of Christ; and so ye may obtain a greater glory, than the typical Temple, considered in it self, had: Therefore ye ought to desire the Evangelical milk of the Word.</p>

                  <hi>Vers. 6.</hi> Wherefore it is contained in the Scripture, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and he that believeth on him shall not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>The <hi>first</hi> testimony, <hi>Isa.</hi> 28.16. proving the <hi>sixth</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument severally: (1.) That Christ is laid by God in the foundation of the Church, for a corner stone, which both adorns, and holds the Edifice together, which is full of honour and excellency, elect and precious in Gods ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and was first to be manifested in <hi>Sion</hi>; or the Church of the Jews, that from <hi>Sion</hi> might go forth the Law, and the word of the Lord from <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> And that hee should become a solid foundation to those that believe: hee proves from this, that they which believe in him, shall not be confounded.</p>

               <p>He confirms the last branch of the <hi>sixth</hi> Argument; <hi>viz.</hi> That they ought not to be moved at the scandal given by wicked men, who have rejected Christ; part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, because it is sufficient that Christ is precious <hi>to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers</hi>; partly, because unbelievers cannot take away the honour of Christ, which is given by the Father: Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this account he cites the <hi>second</hi> testimony of Scripture, from <hi>Psal.</hi> 118.22, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> From whence is proved, (1.) That Christ must be rejected of those who had rule in the Church. (2.) That their endeavours should be vain. (3.) It should come to pass, that they who would not believe in Christ, or they who would stumble against this stone, should be ruinated and perish. And here he cites the <hi>third</hi> testimony of Scripture, from <hi>Isa.</hi> 8.14. (4.)

               <p>The <hi>third</hi> Exhortation (drawn especially from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer) is of obedience to the Magistrate, which he calls an humane Ordinance; because, although all power in general is the Ordinance of God, yet the particular man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Government, rather by a Monarchy, than any other way, or by Aristocrary or Democracy, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Government mixed of these, is not determined by God, but it is left to be determined by every Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth; which when it is determined, it is called the Ordinance of man, which is ratified by God, or his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance: For although in Ecclesiasticals and Spirituals, Christ alone hath the Dominion and Authoritive power<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and retains it to himself, nor doth he suffer any Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but a meer Ministration subordinate to himself in his spiritual Kingdom; yet he hath in Civils constituted a subordinate Dominion, and called men <hi>Gods,</hi> although not absolutely: Therefore whatsoever the form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment be, wherein a Kingdom or Commonwealth shall agree, here the Apostle commands the believing He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews to yield themselves subjects, both to the King, as Supreme, and to Governours, who are sent of him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For the Lords sake</hi>] The reasons of the Exhortation are <hi>five</hi>: 1.

               <p>The <hi>fourth</hi> Exhortation is to Christian Servants, That they not onely reverence their Masters that are more milde and courteous, but also those that are severe and fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>

                  <hi>Vers. 19.</hi> For this is thank-worthy, if a man for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science toward God endure grief, suffering wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</q>
               <p>There are <hi>twelve</hi> Arguments of the Exhortation, which prove, that servants ought to bear the wrongs that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon them by their Masters.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. This is a grace, or the glorious work of Gods special grace working in man above the strength of nature, if any one by that account that he may please God, doth patiently suffer injuries done to him: Therefore Servants ought to suffer wrongs from their Masters.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 20.</hi> For what glory is it, if when ye be buffet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for your faults, ye shall take it patiently? but if when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. Confirming the former, from the contrary: Because it is no glory, but a common thing for Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors to suffer for their evil deeds; but to suffer wrongs for well-doing, is the glorious work of grace, accepted and approved of God: Therefore servants must suffer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, &amp;c.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 21.</hi> For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps:</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 3. Ye are called to bear the Cross, and to suffer injuries for the glory of God: Therefore suffer ye, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Christ] Argum.</hi> 4. Christ hath suffered for us, from his enemies, far more grievous evils: Therefore ye are bound, for the glory of God, to bear patiently the wrongs that are inflicted upon you by your Masters.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Leaving] Argum.</hi> 5. Christ in his sufferings hath left us an example of suffering injuries; and he will, that all believers should be conformable unto him, and imitate his example: Therefore ye ought to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer injuries inflicted upon you by your Masters.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 22.</hi> Who did not sin, neither was guile found in his mouth.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 6. Confirming the former: Christ was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together without sin; but ye servants, although ye are free from blame, for which ye are afflicted by your Masters, yet ye are not free from all sin, from all guile in your lips: Therefore ye are bound the more patiently to suffer injuries inflicted by men.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 23.</hi> Who when he was reviled, reviled not again, when he suffered, he threatned not, but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 7. Christ contained himself from all requital of injuries, and did not revile those that reviled, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently used him: Therefore ye servants ought to bridle your mindes, not returning evil for evil, and injuries from your Masters must be endured.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Committed] Argum.</hi> 8. If ye bear injuries by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Christ, ye have committed your cause to a just Judge, God will revenge the injuries inflicted upon you: Therefore suffer ye, &amp;c.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 24.</hi> Who his own self bare our sins in his own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy on the tree, that we being dead to sin, should live unto righteousnesse; by whose stripes ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 9. Seeing that Christ hanging on the Cross, hath really born and suffered the guilt and punishment of our sins in his own body, ye ought not to suspect, that God (whilest he afflicteth you by the hands of unjust Masters) doth as an angry Judge, require vengeance of your former sins: Therefore being certified, as touching the expiation of your sins, ye ought to be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>
                  <hi>To sin] Argum.</hi> 10. For this end Christ hath taken away the guilt and punishments of our sins, that the mortification of sin in us, and true righteousness cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted for by his death, may be promoted by all means, and consequently abstaining from revenge, ye follow af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter patience: Therefore injuries are to be born by you, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whose] Argum.</hi> 11. There is comfort and healing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for you in the stripes and wounds of Christ against all spiritual sickness of the minde, and all wounds of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which either your unjust Masters have inflicted, or shall inflict upon you his faithful servants; which he confirms in the words of <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. Therefore ye must patiently suffer injuries from your Masters.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 25.</hi> For ye were as sheep going astray, but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 12. Now ye ought to lead another kinde of life than you did in times past: For heretofore ye did go astray as sheep, in ignorance and sinfulness, to your own destruction: now being gathered to the Bishop and Shepherd of your souls Jesus Christ, ye ought to follow your Captain, and commit your selves, and all yours, (and especially your souls) to his care and custody: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ye servants ought patiently to bear the injuries done to you by your Masters.</p>

                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 1.

               <p>
                  <hi>Likewise</hi>] There are four Reasons of the Precept:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. Because in like manner, by the obligation of the Divine Law, husbands are bound to perform mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual offices to their wives, as wives are to their hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Heirs] Reas.</hi> 3. Because wives are not onely partakers of the honour and earthly goods, which belong to their husbands, but are also coheirs of saving grace with their believing husbands.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lest] Reas.</hi> 4. Because otherwise, brawlings and strifes would arise, whereby publique and private prayers of the husband, as well as of the wife, might be hindred and disturbed.</p>

The <hi>second</hi> is, <hi>Sympathy,</hi> which makes us affected (as it becomes us) both with the troubles and happinesses of our neighbours, grieving with those that grieve, and rejoycing with those that rejoyce.

               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 1.</hi> Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm your selves likewise with the same mind: for hee that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin;</q>
               <p>The Arguments to holiness in general are <hi>seven,</hi> which, that they may be the better conceived, wee must main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that Christ hanging on the Cross hath after four manner of waies acted in our behalf: <hi>First,</hi> That hee ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicially representing us, and bearing our person, did bear the guilt of our sins, and punishment due to them. 2. That hee being a Surety for us, did take upon himself the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying or crucifying of our old man by the virtue of his crucifixion. 3. Hee set forth himself an efficacious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to us, whereto wee might conform our selves in the denying our selves, and renouncing all things, which might hinder us in our progress towards Heaven. 4. As a Surety, Advocate, Patron, Father, Husband, Head, and common person hee did binde us with many bonds, to deaden us to sin, and to use all means whereby that might be effected: These presupposed, the following Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments more strongly binde.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, and publickly acted in our behalf after those foresaid waies: Therefore yee beleeving <hi>Hebrews</hi> ought to arm your selves with this meditation of Faith against all tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that yee may dye to the lusts of the corrupt flesh.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Who hath suffered] Argum.</hi> 2. Confirming the former, from the judicial uniting of Beleevers with Christ in his death: In whose suffering in the flesh beleevers are judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have suffered in the flesh: Therefore as they which have suffered in the flesh, or are dead, have ceased from sin, for which they have suffered, and are justified as well from sin, as from the punishment of sin, wherein they are already dead: so you beleeving <hi>Hebrews,</hi> whom I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count as having judicially suffered in the flesh, or as dead, ought to cease from sin, and no further have any thing to do with it.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 2.</hi> That hee no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh, to the lusts of men, but to the will of God.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 3. The judicial freedome of Beleevers from sin, purchased by the death of Christ, is for this end, that so long as wee live in this mortal life, we might not spend our time in following fleshly lusts, according to the will of men, but fulfilling the will of God: Therefore yee ought to labour that yee may bee conformable to the will of God.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 3.</hi> For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, when yee walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of Wine, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellings, banquettings, and abominable Idolatries:</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 4. Yee have sinned enough, and too much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God in the time past of your life, when yee did fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in ignorance and unbeleef the vices which did reign amongst the Gentiles, against the first and second Table: Now the time of Gospel light requires another carriage: Therefore yee ought to follow after holiness.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 4.</hi> Wherein they think it strange that you run not with them to the same excess of riot, speaking evil of you:</p>

By preventing an objection, Although un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleevers may be offended at your abstaining from for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer vices, and may blaspheme your Religion, for which they shall be punished in the day of judgement; yet it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoveth not you therefore to be moved, because if God doth not in this life, yet hee will in the day of judgement require an account of such reproaches: Therefore yee ought to go forward in the study of holiness.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 6.</hi> For, for this cause was the Gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the Spirit.</q>
               <p>

Serving to remove the stumbling-block laid by unbeleevers, who did blaspheme and condemn Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians for the dissimilitude of their courses to their own: To the faithful that are already dead, or not long since, or in former ages, the Gospel hath been preached, for this same end, as to the promoting of holiness, and with the same success, as to the judgement of worldly men; and lastly with the same hope of fruit or benefit, to wit, that they being condemned of men, and chastised of God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the flesh, or outward man, should obtain spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual life in their souls or inward man, yea and life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal with God: Therefore it is meet that yee beleeving <hi>Hebrews</hi> do not refuse to embrace the like manner and condition of life, but in the same condition, that yee fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after holiness.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 7.</hi> But the end of all things is at hand: bee yee therefore sober, and watch unto prayer,</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 7. The last judgement is at hand, which will put an end to the conveniences and inconveniences of this life: Therefore nothing regarding either, yee ought to follow after holiness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bee yee therefore</hi>] From these Arguments, and chiefly the last, hee infers an exhortation to holiness, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to <hi>six</hi> Christian Virtues.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Unto Prayer</hi>] The <hi>first</hi> special Exhortation is to diligent prayer, and for this end let them be sober, and vigilant, that they may be the more fit to pray, observing every oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of praying, and that in all their affairs, they so carry themselves, that they be not rendred unfit for prayer.</p>

                  <hi>Exhort.</hi> 2. The second special Exhortation is Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which hee requires them chiefly to follow after above all things, with singular care, and that their charity bee fervent and earnest.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Charity</hi>] Hee renders a special reason of this, because Charity prevents, and in preventing covers anger, brawl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, reproaches, contentions and hatred, lest they bee stirred up amongst men, and break forth and spread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, it doth repress the breaking forth of these evils, and remit, and cover them; and therefore in the first place yee ought to follow after it.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 9.</hi> Use hospitality one to another without grudgings.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Exhort.</hi> 3. To hospitality, which hee commands that it be not forced, but voluntary, For that good turn which is done with murmuring, is destitute of charity.</p>

                  <p>The other part of the Chapter follows, wherein hee encourages Beleevers against persecutions, and exhorts them not to be offended or troubled with persecutions, as a new thing.

                     <hi>Tryal] Argum.</hi> 1. Persecution will not hurt you, but will try and purge you, as fire tryeth and purgeth gold and silver: Therefore yee ought not to fear afflictions.</p>

                     <hi>Vers. 13.</hi> But rejoyce, in as much as yee are partakers of Christs sufferings; that when his glory shall bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, yee may be glad also with exceeding joy.</q>
                  <p>

Confirming the former, whilst yee suffer persecutions, yee are made partakers of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions appointed for the members of Christ, and are made conformable to him, who hath suffered the like things for the confession of Truth: Therefore yee ought not to fear persecution.</p>
                  <p>

                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 8. Although all affliction, and namely for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil deeds, is not glorious, yet when any one is evilly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated, not for his own desert (but for Christs sake, or because hee is a Christian) the affliction is glorious, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth it become the afflicted to be so troubled, as if he were ashamed of the name of Christ, but is rather obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to glorifie God, who by a certain degree of Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, hath honoured him: Therefore yee ought not to fear persecution.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 17.</hi> For the time is come that judgement must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of those that obey not the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of God?</q>

                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 9. The judgement that God will bring upon the sins of men, is begun in the Church, as in Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily towards his own houshold; whose sin God chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth and crucifies by the Cross of Christ: Therefore yee ought not to fear persecution<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <hi>What shall] Argum.</hi> 10. The afflictions which the faithful suffer, will argue that Infidels and Persecutors will at length be most severely punished: Therefore yee ought not to fear persecution.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 18.</hi> And if the righteous scarcely bee saved, where shall the ungodly and sinner appear?</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 11. Clearing the former Argument; Seeing that the condition of the faithful is so tedious, that they cannot be saved without great difficulty, and by afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, without doubt the condition of the wicked will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable: Therefore yee ought neither to backslide from the Faith, lest yee perish, nor fear persecutions, because they shall be brought to nought.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 19.</hi> Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God, commit the keeping of their souls to him in well-doing, as unto a faithful Creatour.</q>
                  <p>From hence hee infers an Exhortation, which hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms together with two other Arguments.</p>

                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 12. They that are evil entreated for Christs sake, are not properly afflicted by the will of man, but by the will of God, who hath determined to perfect his work in those that are his, through afflictions: Therefore yee ought not to fear persecutions.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 1.</hi> The Elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an Elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall bee revealed.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Exhort.</hi> 1. To Elders in the first place generally; That they execute their office in feeding the flock com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to them. The reasons of the Exhortation premised from the person exhorting, are <hi>four.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I pray] Reas.</hi> 1. Because the Apostle praies, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missively desires that from them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Also an Elder] Reas.</hi> 2. Because hee exhorts them as being an Elder himself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Witness] Reas.</hi> 3. Because hee was a Witness of the
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:49391:156"/>
sufferings of Christ, which Christ suffered in the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of his office, and a partaker of the sufferings for Christ with other Martyrs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of the glory] Reas.</hi> 4. Because by Faith hee was par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of the glory hereafter to be communicated to true and sincere Pastors at the coming of Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Feed</hi>] The exhortation it self prescribing in special the manner of feeding the flock, in <hi>four</hi> duties.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Oversight</hi>] (1.) That they diligently attend the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight of the flocks, not doing it lightly and negligently.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) That they do their duty, not by constraint, but of a willing mind. (3.) That they do their duty, not for the sake of filthy lucre, but with a ready and free mind.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 3.</hi> Neither as being Lords over Gods heritage; but being ensamples to the flock.</q>
               <p n="4">(4.) That without usurpation of Dominion over the Church, they go before the Church in Doctrine and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sample in all virtues.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 4.</hi> And when the chief Shepheard shall appear, yee shall receive a Crown of glory that fadeth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</q>
               <p>Hee subjoyns to this Exhortation <hi>three</hi> other Reasons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chief] Reas.</hi> 1. Because Jesus Christ, as the chief Shepheard, shall at length appear, who will require an account from the Ministers, subjected to him, of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of their office.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Yee shall receive] Reas.</hi> 2. Because hee will give to his Pastors a Crown of glory for their reward.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That fadeth not] Reas.</hi> 3. Because it is a flourishing Crown, which they shall receive, that will never fade a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, nor perish.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 5.</hi> Likewise yee younger, submit your selves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Elder: yea, all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.</q>
               <p>The <hi>second</hi> Exhortation is to the flock or people, who are intimated by the name of youngers; because as ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily Elders for the most part were chosen out of those that were aged, so the greatest part of the flock did consist of youngers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Subject</hi>] The branches of the Exhortation are <hi>three. First,</hi> To special subjection towards Elders, that as God hath enjoyned the Elders, and Episcopal jurisdiction, so hee had injoyned the flock subjection, whether youngers, that they obey the Elders, doing their duty, and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing right and just things in the name of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And all] Branch</hi> 2. Is to mutual subjection, that they submit to one another, <hi>viz.</hi> to the performing mutually the most humble duties of charity. For example, to the mutual receiving private admonitions, and mutually bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with one anothers Infirmities.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Submitting] Branch</hi> 3. That they indeavour after sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of mind, or Christian humility, without which they cannot duely submit to the Pastors, or to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; The reasons of the Exhortation are <hi>seven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cloathed] Reas.</hi> 1. Because humility or submission is a special ornament.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>God] Reas.</hi> 2. Because God resisteth the proud.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To the humble] Reas.</hi> 3. Because God gives grace to the humble.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 6.</hi> Humble your selves therefore under the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hand of God, that hee may exalt you in due time,</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 4. Because that submission which is mutually requisite, doth not respect men, so much as God, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mighty] Reas.</hi> 5. Because the strength and power of God ought to move you to subjection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That you] Reas.</hi> 6. Because God in due time will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt the lowly and humble to glory.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 7.</hi> Casting all your care upon him, for hee careth for you.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 7. By preventing an Objection. Because yee ought not to be moved, by those inconveniences which might disswade you from this submission of mind, but the care about the event of your obedience, which yee ought to yeeld to this command, and moreover all your solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness for the things of this life, yee ought to cast upon God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For</hi>] The reason of this is given, Because God takes special care for the concernments of his servants, and those things which may befall your walking in obedience to him, lest any damage acrew to you, or any necessary good be wanting.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 8.</hi> Be sober, be vigilant: because your adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the Devil, as a roaring Lion, walketh about seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whom hee may devour.</q>
               <p>The <hi>third</hi> general Exhortation or command to all is, that they do not indulge the security of the flesh, but that being composed to watchfulness in all sobriety, they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severe against every temptation in the grace which they have received.</p>
               <p>The Reasons of the Exhortation to this Christian war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare are <hi>nine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adversary] Reas.</hi> 1. Because yee have to do with an adversary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Devil] Reas.</hi> 2. Because yee have to do with the Devil, the worst of enemies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As</hi> a <hi>Lion] Reas.</hi> 3. Because the Devil cruelly, as a roaring Lion gapes after his prey.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Walketh about] Reas.</hi> 4. Because as a Fox walking up and down, hee looks about, and takes all occasions to mischief you, that hee may oppress and devour you una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 9.</hi> Whom resist stedfast in the Faith, knowing, that the same afflictions are accomplished in you Brethren that are in the world.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 5. Because yee must not think of flying from your adversary, but of resisting him onely, and that by a stedfast Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As those] Reas.</hi> 7. Because yee alone do not strive in this conflict of afflictions against the Devil, but yee have all the faithful Brethren your fellow-souldiers in the Church militant, and suffering together with you, whose condition yee ought not to disdain, or to wish for the enjoyment of any better condition than theirs.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 10.</hi> But the God of all Grace, who hath called us into his eternal glory by Christ Iesus, after that yee have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 8. Because yee shall have mee your Apostle, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with your selves striving in prayers, that yee may constantly go forwards in the way wherein yee are. But hee praies for these <hi>four</hi> things in their behalf. 1. That God would <hi>perfect</hi> that work of grace hee hath begun, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not yet perfect. 2. That hee would <hi>establish</hi> that which is right. 3. That hee would <hi>strengthen</hi> that which is weak. 4. That hee would <hi>settle</hi> or cause the building to cleave firmly unto Christ. The Arguments of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence are <hi>two. Argum.</hi> 1. The alsufficiency of grace in God. 2. The calling of the faithful to eternal glory through Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A while</hi>] In the mean while hee limits his prayer, that God would perform those things to them after they had been afflicted a while, and so hee adds the <hi>ninth</hi> Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, the Exhortation to the Christian warfare: Because the time of your conflict will not be long, but short, and afflictions will not be intollerable, but light in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to glory.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 11.</hi> To him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </q>
               <p>Hee concludes this and the rest of the Exhortations with a famous Doxology, ascribing the glory of all grace and strength to God, whereby hee perfects the work of grace.</p>

               <p>After this hee requires <hi>Temperance,</hi> whereby every one keeps himself from those enticements, whereby hee might be taken off from his duty. Hee would have <hi>Patience</hi> or <hi>Fortitude</hi> (which consists in bearing adversity, and not in ceasing from our duty, for the evils which pursue us) an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to Temperance, and these virtues are <hi>four,</hi> which are commonly called Cardinals, to these hee would have <hi>three</hi> other joyned.

               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 7.</hi> And to Godliness, Brotherly Kindness; and to Brotherly Kindness, Charity:</q>

               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 8.</hi> For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you, that yee shall neither be barren, nor unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the knowledge of our Lord Iesus Christ.</q>
               <p>The Arguments of the Exhortation are <hi>fourteen,</hi> all which prove, that wee ought to endeavour after these virtues joyntly.</p>
               <p>

               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 9.</hi> But hee that lacketh these things, is blind, and cannot see far off, and hath forgotten that hee was purged from his old sins.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. If yee were destitute of these virtues, you will declare that you see nothing afarre off, but that you are onely intent upon the things of this world, but blind in divine and spiritual things, and unthankful towards God, by whom yee confess your former sins are pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Therefore yee ought to endeavour after these vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 10.</hi> Wherefore the rather, Brethren, give dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to make your calling and election sure: for if you do these things, yee shall never fall.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 3. With the Exhortation repeated. By en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring after these virtues, yee will prove your selves to be effectually called and elected, and will solidly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm your selves in this perswasion: Therefore follow af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter these virtues.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For these] Argum.</hi> 4. If you follow after these virtues, yee shall be preserved from Apostacy, or falling back, neither will yee yeeld to temptations: Therefore yee ought to follow after these.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 11.</hi> For so an entrance shall be ministred unto you abundantly, into the everlasting Kingdome of our Lord and Saviour Iesus Christ.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 5. So a more abundant entrance into the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Kingdome of Christ shall be administred unto you, <hi>i. e.</hi> happiness, and that life eternal shall more largely open and unfold it self to you, that yee may more freely and abundantly peirce into the inward parts of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and enjoy the sense of that life in a more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant measure: Therefore follow after these virtues.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 12.</hi> Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you alwaies in remembrance of these things, though yee know them, and be stablished in the present Truth.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 6. Preventing an Objection; Although yee are established in the present Truth: yet I being an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, have now thought, out of a desire of your profici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, it necessary to exhort you, which yee should in no wise reject: Therefore, &amp;c.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 13.</hi> Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this Tabernacle, to stir you up, by putting you in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance:</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 7. Justice it self, by reason of my Apostolical office, requires that I excite you to holiness, by exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and admonitions of this sort, so long as I live: Therefore be yee obedient.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 14.</hi> Knowing, that shortly I must put off this my Tabernacle, even as our Lord Iesus Christ hath shewed mee.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 8. As the Lord hath foretold, I expect after a short time to end my life by a glorious Martyrdome: Therefore, as it lyes upon mee to exhort you to these vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, so it lies upon you to hearken to my Exhortation.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 15.</hi> Moreover, I will indeavour, that you may be able after my decease, to have these things alwaies in remembrance.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 9. This Exhortation which I have written to you, will be profitable to minde you of your duties, even after my death: Therefore hearken you to my admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 16.</hi> For wee have not followed cunningly devised fables, when wee made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Iesus Christ, but were eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses of his Majesty.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 10. Those things which I have taught you as touching Christs incarnation, or his first coming to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the office of a Redeemer, and as touching his divine nature, power, sufficiency, and efficacy to save the people of God, are not fables artificially feigned, which may be despised, or negligently without use and benefit past by: but they are serious and certain things: Therefore yee ought to hearken to these my admonitions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But as those] Argum.</hi> 11. Yee have been taught by us Apostles, both eye and ear-witnesses of the Truth of Christ already demonstrated, so that the certainty of this Gospel was so much as were possible to be concerning things done and past.

Christ, in whose Faith and Obedience wee exhort you to persevere, hath by the audible voice of his Father speaking from Heaven, received a glorious te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony from the excellent glory of the Father, that hee is the Son of God, wherein, as in a Mediatour and Surety for his redeemed people, God is well pleased, satisfying himself abundantly in his Mediation and purchase: Therefore obey yee diligently this Exhortation.</p>

                  <hi>Vers. 18.</hi> And this voice which came from Heaven, we heard, when we were with him in the holy Mount,</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 13. Those things are so holy, which appertain to the Kingdome of Christ, that the place it self wherein those things were declared (which are preached by us) was after a manner made holy, <hi>viz.</hi> Because of Gods ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary voice, and the divine glory of Christ there ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested: Therefore with greater reverence yee ought to hearken to our Exhortations.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 14. The Doctrine concerning Christ, in whose Faith and Obedience wee exhort you to persevere, is confirmed by the testimony of Scripture, or a most firm prophetical word: Therefore yee ought studiously to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey my Exhortations. Hee staies upon this Exhortation, confirming the certainty of prophetical Scripture, by <hi>seven</hi> Reasons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>More sure] Reas.</hi> 1. Because compared with other waies of revelation it is a most firm medium without and above exceptions, whereto other means of revelation, no less clear and true, are obnoxious: But this reason most especially did prevail with the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> who examined visions and revelations made to the Apostles by the Scripture of the Old Testament. For the divine authority of the old Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was confirmed in their minds some ages before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of Prophecie] Reas.</hi> 2. That the testimony of fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing future Truth, hath more evidence in it self of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine operation, than the testimony of him, who testifies that which hee hath seen or heard being present. For no man could foresee this Truth, but a Prophet, every Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever could see the Truth fulfilled.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Which] Reas.</hi> 3. Because the word of Prophecy is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be attended to by Beleevers, into the sense whereof they might enquire, to which truth and authority they might subject their consciences, and which they might apply to the ends and uses whereunto it serves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As] Reas.</hi> 4. Because yee should abide in darkness, unless yee attended to the Scriptures, which are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and in the faithful, as light that shineth in a dark place, to direct in all things what, and how to be done.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Until] Reas.</hi> 5. Because the Sun of Righteousness, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, will appear at length to those that religiously attend to the Scripture, <hi>viz.</hi> in the glory of the life to come, hee will bring with him the perf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 6. Because wee must firmly hold, for a Principle of Faith, and for a thing first of all to be beleeved, that the Scriptures are not of humane invention, but of divine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, not derived from the mind of the Writer, sense or explication, but out of the mind, sense, and explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, which therefore is not from the explication which men whether few or many invent, but from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, whereof the Spirit of God it self is the Author.</p>

                  <hi>Vers. 21.</hi> For the Prophecie came not in old time by the wil of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 7. Confirming the former. Because in the Scriptures there are Prophecies, which cannot be set forth by the wil of man, or from the humane sense or affection of the Prophet: but of necessity those holy men spake by the instinct of the Holy Ghost, who have left to us the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Oracles sealed in their Writings: Therefore it is meer that the Holy Ghost should be interpreter of their words by other places of his Scripture, and that the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful should attend to the Scriptures, and compare them with themselves, that they may understand the mind of the Holy Ghost.</p>

               <p>The marks of false Teachers, which also contain the reasons, why they ought to bee taken heed of, are <hi>nine</hi>: Not that they are all to be seen in some one Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, but that some of them may be seen in other Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</p>

From this, that they will deny the Lord or Master that bought them, which is spoken in the language of the Visible Church, wherein they were. That they would both boast that they were redeemed, and also the Church esteemed them so: which also in a judicial sense is true; whereby whosoever confesseth with his mouth Christ to be his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, and in the mean time denies him in deed, being judged out of his own mouth, is said to deny the Lord that bought him; Because as to the merit of the crime, it is as much as if hee was really bought, if hee suppose and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess himself bought, and yet denies him that bought him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bring</hi>] 2. Hee amplifies the crime from this, that by these heresies they deservedly bring upon themselves swift destruction.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Despise] Reas.</hi> 1. That it is not the naked disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of unlawful commands of a mistaking governour, but <hi>contempt</hi> of the Magistrate doing his duty, contempt of the very power and ordinance of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Presumptuous] Reas.</hi> 2. That it is presumptuousness joyned with contempt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And self] Reas.</hi> 3. That it is boldness in contempt joyned with complacency in that sin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To speak ill] Reas.</hi> 4. That it is boldness in contempt breaking forth into cursing, reproaches, evil speakings, which they cast upon Magistracy.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 11.</hi> Whereas Angels which are greater in power and might, bring not railing accusation against them before the Lord.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 5. That seeing they are vile fellows, they dare speak evil of Magistrates, which Angels that are more excellent than Magistrates, dare not speak ill of them: For although Angels are sometimes used to punish Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, yet they alwaies endeavour to maintain the estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Principalities, Magistrates, and Powers, against whom some Hereticks proceed.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 12.</hi> But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not, and shall utterly perish in their own corruption,</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 6. That hereticks are like to brute beasts in this; For as beasts, 1. Are irrational: 2. They are driven by force, and not by counsel: 3. They being taken perish: So those Hereticks who cannot bear Magistracy amongst men, or in the Church, but speak evil of this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance. 1. Being void of judgement, they are ignorant of Gods Ordinance. 2. They are carried by a wicked in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to blaspheme or to disgrace that which they do not understand. 3. As brute beasts they bring destruction to themselves, and perish by their own corruptness.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 13.</hi> And shall receive the reward of unrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, as they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time: Spots they are and blemishes, sporting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with their own deceivings, while they feast with you:</p>

               <p>He repeats the commination of their deserved condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and adds the <hi>Eighth</hi> Note in <hi>three</hi> demonstrations of their impudence. The first is in open luxury, because in the day time, neither fearing the light of the Gospel, nor the Sun, they discover their minds to be given to luxury, delighting themselves in banquettings. The second demonstration of their impudence, in open <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continency, which they will not in the least endeavour to hide, but betray in their eyes, the adulteries of their heart, and will shew forth their impudence in their lust, and so they will not onely pollute themselves, but will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so deceive and ensnare their unstable souls destitute of solid and saving Faith. The third impudence consists in covetousness, the arts and methods whereof they will so meditate, and have their hearts so exercised with a vicious habit: Briefly comprehending these vices hee calls those wicked men accursed.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers. 15.</hi> Which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray, following the way of <hi>Balaam</hi> the Son of <hi>Bosor,</hi> who loved the wages of unrighteousness,</p>

               <p>Hee compares the impudent covetousness of these men,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:49391:159"/>
to the covetousness of <hi>Balaam,</hi> whose History hee briefly repeats out of <hi>Num.</hi> 22. who for the desire of reward, erred from the way, which hee professed to follow, and at length gave himself to open impiety: wherein hee became so stupid, that hee was deservedly reprehended and chastised by his Asse; which likewise false Teachers, teaching false things, for filthy lucre sake, deserve.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 17.</hi> These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a tempest, to whom the mist of darkness is reserved forever.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note</hi> 9. Is vain speaking, joyned with pride and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie, in respect whereof hee compares them to fountains wanting water, and to clouds tossed and dissipated by a tempest, that they do not afford the Rain they seemed to promise; such are false Teachers, who ought to be shining Stars, and the light of the world, and yet have nothing but darkness, and the blackness of errours: Wherefore the Apostle pronounces them condemned to eternal dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in Hell.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 18.</hi> For when they speak great swelling words of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, through much wantonness, those that were clean escaped from them who live in errour.</q>
               <p>Hee shews their vain speaking in <hi>three</hi> things. (1.) In their swelling stile of teaching, and puft-up kind of speech, wherein with lofty words they dazle the eyes of the simple, and lead the unwary into admiration: which kind of speaking is very much covered with dark circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances. (2.) In this, that their doctrine might patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize the carnal concupiscences of men, as if there were no need to oppose them; and so they allure some with the lusts of the flesh, who before were convinced of their errours, wherein they lived whilst they were amongst worldly men, <hi>i. e.</hi> without the Church, they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced their society, and truly or resolvedly escaped from them (which may be, by the power of the natural light of conscience) and had betook themselves to the fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of the Christian Church, which also they might do without spiritual regeneration.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 19.</hi> While they promise them liberty, they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves are the servants of corruption; for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is hee brought in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage.</q>
               <p n="3">(3.) In the dissimilitude betwixt themselves and their promises. For they promised liberty to others, when they drew them into bondage of sin, and they themselves were the servants of corruption, both as to their practice, and the principles of their doctrine. For there is no other Christian liberty, than that which brings those that are freed from sin, and the servile yoak of the Covenant of works, to the free obedience of Righteousness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For</hi>] Hee proves these Libertines with their Disciples to be the most abject and miserable slaves to sin, by <hi>four</hi> reasons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Overcome] Reas.</hi> 1. Because they are vanquished and overcome by sin: to whose servitude they yeeld themselves, being allured by the deceiveableness of false doctrine: Therefore they are truly slaves.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 20.</hi> For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Iesus Christ, they are again intangled there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 2. Because they and their Disciples by Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy from an holy conversation, fall into a worse condition, than that was, wherein they lived, before they gave their names to Christ. For after they renounced in Baptism the pollutions of the world, and through the knowledge of Christ whatsoever, betaking themselves into the bosome of some Church of Christ, have escaped them, if afterwards they be intangled again in those pollutions, and have yeelded to them, their last end is worse than their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 21.</hi> For it had been better for them not to have known the way of Righteousness, than after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandement deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered unto them.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 3. Proving the former, because they knowingly and willingly run as fugitives to the tents of their adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries, from the known way of Righteousness, and from the holy commandement once delivered unto them; which sin is much more grievous, and the servitude harder, than if they had never known the way of Righteousness; for their condition would be better in ignorance than in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postacy.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 22.</hi> But it is happened unto them according to the true Proverb, The Dog is turned to his own vomit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and the Sow that was washed, to her wallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the mire.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 4. Making for removing of the scandal, which might arise from their Apostacy; because by their Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy they shew that they never were of the true Sheep of Christ, but in Baptism, and a visible sanctity of life, wherein they sometimes vaunted themselves to be Saints, they shew themselves to have been Sows and Dogs, and to have alwaies been so, without spiritual and internal reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of their nature; And therefore no wonder if it happen unto them according to the true Proverb, <hi>As the Dog, though purged by vomiting, yet hee licks up again that which hee hath vomited; and the Sow, though wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet shee returns to her wallowing in the mire</hi>: So Apostates, though they may profess repentance from their sins, and Faith in Christ, and obedience of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, yet, if occasion serves, they turn to their former manners.</p>

               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 4.</hi> And saying, where is the promise of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? For since the Fathers fell asleep, all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue as they were from the beginning of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> From their blasphemous speeches, that they will also dare impudently to deny the Lords coming to judgement, and openly accuse Gods promises of falsitie. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> From their pertinacious defence of their blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, that they would dare to dispute against the Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> coming, as if hee would not come at all, but that the world should endure for ever: Therefore because many

ages being past, the Judge doth not as yet come, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause all things remain in our times, as they did from the beginning of the Creation, they make their carnal sense the measure of their Faith, and cast the Word of God behinde their backs.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 5.</hi> For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the Word of God the Heavens were of old, and the Earth standing out of the water, and in the water,</q>
               <p>Hee reproves these blasphemous Dogs in <hi>five</hi> Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. Because they scornfully reject the knowledge offered them out of Gods word, and are willingly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, that by the word of God the world was created; for if they should acknowledge the Creation to be by the word of God, they ought also to acknowledge an end of the world, foretold in the word of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Earth] Argum.</hi> 2. They are willingly ignorant of, and shut their eyes against that constant miracle of the earth rising out of the water, and consisting by the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by which it is made solid, so that it crumble not to dust when the whole earth by its own nature being the lowest element, should sinck and be covered and drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the waters. In which miracle wee may perceive that nature is governed and establish'd by the will of God alone, that it may so continue, or otherwise as it shall please God.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 6.</hi> Whereby the world that then was, being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed with water, perished.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 3. That the earth contrary to nature appears out of the waters, and that all things do remain alwaies in the same state, is evident out of the history of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge, whereby the former order being changed, the world or mankind, that then was, is perished in those o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verflowing waters: Therefore it is not incredible, but that the world passing on shall suffer the change which the word of God hath foretold.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 7.</hi> But the Heavens and the Earth which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgement, and perdition of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly men.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 4. The Heavens, which now are, and the Earth which now is, are by the same word, and his ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacious will, reserved unto the fire of the last judgement, when the wicked, and especially the scoffers at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Christ, shall be condemned, and perish.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 8.</hi> But (Beloved) be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.</q>
               <p>Hee takes away an Objection, The wicked might say, why doth hee defer his coming? The answer is <hi>threefold. First,</hi> Although the Lord seems to defer his coming, yet his deferring ought not to be an offence to any, because this delay ought not to be estimated by our sense, but out of Gods eternity, to whom that space of time, which seems to us to be very long, is but as one day, and with whom one day and a thousand years do not differ as to the proportion of measure.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 9.</hi> The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, (as some men count slackness) but is long-suffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 2. This delaying doth not proceed from slack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, as some Judge, but from the patience of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, to wit, the Elect, whereas many as yet are not converted, and whereof God will have none perish, but all (in his time) to come to repentance, which cannot be unless the coming of Christ should be deferred to a season. For if God should anticipate the time of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, decreed by himself, some of them, which hee hath chosen to salvation from eternity, should perish.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 10.</hi> But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, in the which the Heavens shall pass a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with a great noise, and the Elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burnt up.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 3. And <hi>Argum.</hi> 5. Reproving scoffers from the manner of Christs coming, which is described in <hi>three</hi> things, (1.) It shall be unawares to men, as thieves use to come, at such a time when they know they are least expected<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (2.) It shall be with the greatest change of the whole universe: (3.) With the disanulling of all things, wherein the Atheists sought their felicity in the world, for the Heavens shall pass away with a great noise, the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also, and the works therein shall be burnt up: so that all ought to be sollicitous in preparing themselves, rather than to enquire curiously about the manner or time of his coming, or to complain of his slackness.</p>

                  <p>The second part of the Chapter follows, wherein hee draws this Doctrine into use by an Exhortation to follow after godliness, and to perseverance in it: The Arguments of the Exhortation are <hi>eight,</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. By requiring a testimony from their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences: All these visible works, especially, which are in the earth, are to be dissolved: Therefore wee ought to follow after holiness.</p>

                  <p>

Because so it becomes you, who expect with hope, and hasten with desire to meet the Lord at his coming, <hi>i. e.</hi> it behoves you, hoping for the coming of Christ, to labour patiently in your vocation, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour after holiness.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>

                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 15.</hi> And account that the long-suffering of our Lord is salvation, even as our beloved Brother <hi>Paul</hi> also, according to the wisdome given unto him, hath written unto you.</q>

                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 6. With preventing an Objection, yee ought to be so far from being overcome with weariness, because Christ seems to defer his coming, that on the contrary yee ought to account it a sign of salvation given to all of you, that this is not delay, but rather the forbearance of the Lord, and slowness to wrath.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Even as] Argum.</hi> 7. <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epistle written to you Hebrews, (according to the abundant measure of wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome given to him) diligently exhorts you to follow after holiness and patience under the hope of Christs coming,

                  <p>Hee takes occasion from the mention hee made of the Epistle of <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> of commending the rest of <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles for Canonical, and to take away the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence upon the difficulty of some places in his Epistles, from this, that neither the sayings of <hi>Paul,</hi> nor any other Scriptures are wrested, unless by those that are unlearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and unstable, or perverse men, and that to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of them that pervert them.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Of the word] Reas.</hi> 1. Is contained in the last words of this verse, <hi>viz.</hi> That his Gospel treats of the most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent object, <hi>viz.</hi> the word of life, <hi>i. e.</hi> of Jesus Christ the Son of God, who is called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>the Word,</hi> that wee may conceive the distinction of the person of the Son from the Father, and the order of their working, seeing that it is <hi>the Word</hi> of some one, <hi>viz.</hi> the word of the Father: And that hee may teach the spiritual and immanent man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Sons Generation, and that his subsistence is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separable from the Father, and that wee may behold espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially his office, which is to manifest God, and the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel of God concerning our salvation. Furthermore hee is called the word of Life: (1.) Because hee hath life in himself, and hee himself is life. (2.) Because hee hath purchased life for us, and hath shewed it to us; and <hi>Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> Because hee applies that to us, and brings it about, that wee may live an eternal life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That which was] Reas.</hi> 2. Of the excellency of his preaching, that it is the ancient Truth preached, <hi>viz.</hi> that which was from the beginning; partly inasmuch as there was never any other ground of salvation besides this in Christ alone, who is the Lamb slain from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the world; partly because Christ preached by the Apostle, did subsist, as to his Divinity, before his incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from the beginning of the world, the same SON of GOD, and MEDIATOUR of our sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and was in the beginning of the world, when created things did not as yet subsist, but began to be, or who is the same from eternity to eternity: Therefore the subject of our Gospel is most excellent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Which wee have seen] Reas.</hi> 3. Because the Truth
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:49391:160"/>
preached is certain, and experienced by the Apostles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they by the infallible testimony of their senses, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eye and ear-witnesses, had observed that Christ himself in his own time was manifested in the flesh, or incarnate. Partly by hearing with their ears day by day the Doctrine of Christ, which was published by an holy and audible voice: partly by seeing with their eyes, both the ordinary and miraculous works, his sufferings in the flesh, and glorification in his transfiguration, and his Resurrection from the dead, and by most clearly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving them, after a most deep inquisition into the truth of the thing: Lastly, partly by feeling with their hands, or handling his flesh, or his assumed humane nature. From whence the certainty of their testimony concerning Christ offered, is so manifest, that it cannot be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: Therefore most excellent is the truth that is preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by us.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 2.</hi> (For the life was manifested, and wee have seen it, and bear witness, and shew unto you that eternal life which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us.)</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 4. By a Parenthesis confirming the former; wee have known concerning Christ, (1.) That hee is life it self, the true Jehovah, who is essentially life in himself, and causally in respect of us: For hee is the Author of our life, not onely natural, but also spiritual and eternal, the Author of light and illumination, the Author of grace and every pious or commendable motion: (2.) That he is by divine inspiration manifested to be such, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to us, and by that revelation seen and acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by us to be that life: (3.) Whom wee have seen and acknowledge to be the life revealed, him wee testifie to be life, and preach him to you, <hi>viz.</hi> to be both God eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and the Procuror, Giver and Preserver of eternal life, to be communicated unto us. (4.) Wee have known the Son of God, the second distinct person of the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which was from eternity with the Father, and from the making of the world, did plead our cause with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and is now revealed unto us after his incarnation by divine Revelation: Therefore this our preaching of Truth and Life is both most excellent, and most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 3.</hi> That which wee have seen and heard, declare wee unto you, that yee also may have fellowship with us; and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Iesus Christ.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 5. Through the Truth preached by us Apostles, eye and ear-witnesses, beleevers are made partakers with us of the same felicity, and the same good things: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Truth preached by us is most excellent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And our fellowship] Reas.</hi> 6. They who are united in the Faith of the Truth preached by us, shall also be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the Father, and his Son Jesus Christ, by virtue of the Holy Ghost: Therefore, &amp;c.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 4.</hi> And these things write wee unto you, that your joy may be full.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 7. The summe of our preaching which is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to you, hath this end, that yee being made certain of your election and glorification, may have a true and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual joy, and that your joy may remain and be perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Therefore it is deservedly to be accounted the most excellent.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 5.</hi> This then is the message which wee have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.</q>

                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 8. The summe of our preaching is, that God is light, or a most present and perfect remedy against the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils of ignorance, errours, falshood, vices and miseries, which are in us: and that God in himself is most free from these evils, so that it is impossible for those that come unto him to be deceived, not to be illuminated and direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not to be delivered from sins and misery, and not to obtain eternal life: Therefore it is necessary that my preaching and the rest of the Apostles should be excellent.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 6.</hi> If wee say that wee have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, wee lye, and do not the Truth.</q>
               <p>The other part of the Chapter follows, wherein hee propounds partly negatively, and partly affirmatively, the notes or signs of him that is a true Beleever, who shall be partaker of the good things promised in the Gospel. And the Notes are <hi>five.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note</hi> 1. Is negatively propounded, with his confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Hee that is a true beleever doth not walk in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, is not given ever to sin, leading his life according to the lusts of the flesh: Because if any one profess him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to have communion with God (who is light and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,) and in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> mean time walketh in the darkness of his sins, hee is an hypocrite and a lyar, seeing that hee doth not that which is right, but that which hee professes with his mouth, hee denies in his works.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 7.</hi> But if wee walk in the light, as hee is in the light, wee have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Iesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note</hi> 2. Is propounded affirmatively, Hee that walks in the light, or hee that follows after holiness, that hee may be conformable to God (who is light and perfect holiness) hee is a true beleever, having communion tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with God and the Saints, to whom the fruit also of Christs death to the remission of sins doth wholly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 8.</hi> If wee say that wee have no sin, wee deceive our selves, and the truth is not in us.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note</hi> 3. Is negative. Hee that is a true Beleever is not so just in his own eies, that hee denies that hee cannot sin, either in word, or deed, or that hee hath not sinned after Justification, or that hee (as if hee could not want the daily intercession of Christ, and the daily applying of his merit for the delivering of his conscience from new guilt) is not touched with the sense of sin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so that hee must forthwith flye unto Christ as his Redeemer. For whosoever either in word or deed doth really so deny that hee hath sin in him for the present, deceives himself, and is an hypocrite, in whom there is no sincerity.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 9.</hi> If we confess our sins, hee is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note</hi> 4. Hee that is a true Beleever, is so affected with the sense of his sins, that hee acknowledgeth them before God, and doth confess from his soul that hee deserves e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal death, and that his guilt can no otherwise be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piated, but by the merit of the blood of the Son of God, and that hee cannot be sanctified, but by the divine vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Spirit of Christ, or be free from the pollution of sin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Faithful</hi>] The Apostle promiseth to him that doth so confess his sins, that upon the faithfulness and righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God, hee shall be absolved, and purged from the guilt of sin, or sanctified from the stain of it: For God is faithful, who hath promised these things, and God is just, who hath taken satisfaction from Christ the Surety, hee doth not exact the debt from him, for whom Christ hath satisfied; but on the other side, hee bestowes all the good things upon him that beleeves, which Christ hath purchased for his salvation.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 10.</hi> If wee say that wee have not sinned, wee make him a lyar, and his word is not in us.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note</hi> 5. Is negative. Hee that is a true Beleever, doth neither deny, nor extenuate his sins past, as if either with that Pharisee hee had performed all the commands of God from his youth; or as if there was no original sin, or as if it was not at all worthy of death: Neither is hee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent, as if the sins which hee had committed were light and venial, which need not the expiation of the blood of Christ, or as if there were not so much corruption in his nature, but that by his free will hee might confide in his own strength, to dispose himself for grace, and
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:49391:161"/>
merit it, or at leastwise bee able to obtain it. For hee that either so, or by any other means, directly or indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly denies that hee hath not sinned, and consequently denies that hee is not, nor hath not been so guilty of death, that hee needed such an expiation as the death of the Son of God is, hee is a blasphemer against God (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusing him of a lye, who hath in his word condemned all as sinners, and guilty of death, and hath affirmed that there is no remission of sins, but by the blood of his Son) neither is the Word of God received by Faith at any time in his heart, <hi>i. e.</hi> neither hath hee beleeved the Doctrine of the Law, not yet of the Gospel.</p>

               </argument>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 1.</hi> My little Children, these things write I unto you, that yee sin not. And if any man sin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wee have an Advocate with the Father, Iesus Christ the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous:</q>
               <p>The <hi>first</hi> Exhortation is to the following after holiness, that they sin not; The Reasons of the Exhortation (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides a friendly compellation) are <hi>eleven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. Because this is the end and use of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Gospel, and the Apostles writing. <hi>These things write I unto you, that yee sin not,</hi> saith hee: Therefore follow yee holiness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And if] Reas.</hi> 2. If yee follow after holiness, the sins which perhaps yee shall fall into, shall bee taken away through the intercession of Christ Jesus our Advocate and Lord: Therefore endeavour after holiness. When hee names <hi>one</hi> Advocate, hee excludes all others, for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise Christ was not <hi>simply</hi> our Advocate, but one of our Advocates.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Righteous] Reas.</hi> 3. Confirming the former; Christ our Advocate is <hi>righteous, i. e.</hi> not onely meet to intercede for sinners by reason of the Righteousness of his <hi>person,</hi> but also righteous in his <hi>office,</hi> who requires nothing of the Father in our behalf, but what is justly due to him interceding for us, from the covenant and merit of his death. Also hee is Righteous, that hee might cover us with his imputed Righteousness. And lastly, hee is righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, who upon the Covenant of Redemption promotes us in the following after Righteousness, and raises us up again, when wee fall, and at length perfectly makes us righteous or holy: Therefore beleevers ought both to endeavour after holiness, and if at any time they fall into sin, to hope for the virtue of Christs interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 2.</hi> And hee is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours onely, but also for the sins of the whole world.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 4. Confirming the second reason. The death and expiatory Sacrifice of Christ, was offered, not onely for us, <hi>viz.</hi> elected out of the Jews, and converted to the Faith of Christ, but also for the sins of all the elect, or redeemed in the world: Therefore yee ought to beware of the evil of sin, which cannot bee expiated, unless by the death of Christ, but if yee sin, yee may confidently expect the virtue both of the rich expiation, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of Christ.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 3.</hi> And hereby wee know that wee know him, if wee keep his commandements.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 5. By endeavouring sincerely to keep the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of God, as by a sure sign yee may know the truth of your Faith, or that yee truly beleeve in God, and love him sincerely: Therefore follow yee after holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, or sin not.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 4.</hi> Hee that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandements, is a lyer, and the truth is not in him.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 6. Hee that professes that hee knows God, <hi>i. e.</hi> that hee beleeves in him, and loves him, and doth not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after holiness (for according to the stile of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, to endeavour sincerely after holiness, is to keep the commandements) is an hypocrite, in whom there is no sincerity, or truth of Faith: Therefore endeavour after holiness.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 5.</hi> But who so keepeth his word, in him, verily is the love of God perfected; hereby know wee that wee are in him.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 7. Hee that endeavours after holiness, proves the sincerity of his love towards God, which love is perfected or manifested to bee sincere from an endeavour of keeping the word of God, and obeying it: Therefore yee ought to endeavour after holiness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hereby) Reas.</hi> 8. Hee that endeavours after holiness, or not to sin, or to keep the word of God, hath an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his communion with God, and knows that hee dwells in Christ by Faith: Therefore, &amp;c.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 6.</hi> Hee that saith hee abideth in him, ought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self also to walk, even as hee walked.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 9. Confirming the former, whosoever professes that hee hath communion with Christ, ought to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour after holiness, or to imitate Christ in his life and conversation: Therefore yee ought to endeavour after holiness.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 7.</hi> Brethren, I write no new commandement un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, but an old commandement, which yee had from the beginning, the old commandement is the word which yee have heard from the beginning.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 10. I require no new duty from you, when I urge you to follow after holiness, or the observance of Gods commandements, but I repeat an old commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which yee have not onely heard from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, from Christ and his Ministers, but yee have had it also commended to you out of the Law and Prophets: Therefore endeavour after holiness.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 8.</hi> Again, a new Commandement I write unto you, which thing is true in him, and in you, because the darkness is past, and the true light now shineth.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 11. This Commandement is not old in the old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the letter, as in times past it was, so long as you lived irregenerate under the Covenant of works, when the Law did command, and conferred no strength to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, but it is now in the newness of Spirit: To the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming whereof Christ will administer new grace to you: Therefore yee ought to follow after holiness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Which</hi>] What the New Covenant is, hee expounds in the next words, affirming that the command is new, both in respect of Christ, who quickens the Commandement, and in respect of themselves, who were now by regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made new Creatures, <hi>i. e.</hi> to whom grace was admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred, and was furthermore to bee administred to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Because the darkness</hi>] The reason is given to this sense, Because yee are not under the Law, but under Grace; yee are not in a state of irregeneration, but are renewed. For the darkness of the Legal Covenant, and the state of irregeneration, are passed away, and now Christ, who brings life and grace with him, and is the true light, is risen as the Sun of Righteousness, upon you that beleeve, and hath both communicated the light, and also the heat of life to you: Therefore the commandement is new to you, that yee ought to bee encouraged to follow after ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness with more alacrity.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 9.</hi> Hee that saith hee is in the light, and hateth his Brother, is in darkness, even until now.</q>
               <p>The <hi>second</hi> Exhortation drawing the former to the love of the Brethren: The Arguments of the Exhortation are <hi>ten</hi>; besides those <hi>two</hi> which are next recited, and may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so bee referred hither.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. Whosoever professeth himself to bee in the light, or regenerate, and hateth his Brother, hee lies yet unregenerated in the darkness of ignorance

and sin: Therefore yee ought to endeavour after bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly love.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 10.</hi> Hee that loveth his Brother, abideth in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. He that loves his Brother, remains in the light, and perseveres in the way of truth, in part possessing the lot and condition of the Saints: Therefore yee ought to follow after, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And none occasion of stumbling] Argum.</hi> 3. Hee that loveth his Brother, doth neither stumble himself in the way of holiness (alwaies seeing whither hee goes, <hi>viz.</hi> to God by Faith in the way of obedience) nor is hee an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of stumbling to others, whereby they may either be drawn into sin, or hardened in it: Therefore yee ought to endeavour after brotherly love.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 11.</hi> But hee that hateth his Brother, is in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and walketh in darkness, and knoweth not whither hee goeth, because that darkness hath blinded his eyes.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 4. Hee that hateth his Brother, hee wholly lyes and perseveres in sin, and swarving from the right way, which leads to salvation, hee is carried to a prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice, not knowing whither hee goes, because his mind is darkened with sin: Therefore yee must follow after bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly love.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 12.</hi> I write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his names sake.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 5. O faithful Children, both Gods and mine, your sins are freely forgiven you, for Christs name sake, <hi>i. e.</hi> for the merit of Christ which is preached to you, and is through Faith apprehended by you: Therefore this Exhortation which I have written, being to holiness, and brotherly love, yee are bound to obey it.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 13.</hi> I write unto you, Fathers, because yee have known him that is from the beginning; I write unto you young men, because yee have overcome the wicked one: I write unto you little children, because yee have known the Father.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 6. From the faithful of every age and order without exception is required the following after holiness and brotherly love: by name from the Fathers, who are therefore bound to obey, because yee are admitted to the knowledge of the antient of daies, or the eternal Son of God, knowledge of whom hath made you more blessed, than all that knowledge of things you have gained from the use and experience of many years: Therefore yee ought to follow after, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Young men] Argum.</hi> 7. Because as all, so young men are bound to obey, because victory is granted to them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Devil, in Christ, in whom also strength is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred for their daily conquering, which victory ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds all warlike praises.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Little Children] Argum.</hi> 8. Because as all, so are the faithful little children bound to obey these Exhortations, because, although they are not so skilful in worldly mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, God hath manifested himself to them, a Father in Christ, and hath given them to acknowledge God, their Father: Therefore, &amp;c.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 14.</hi> I have written unto you, Fathers, because yee have known him, that is from the beginning. I have written unto you, young men, because yee are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and yee have overcome the wicked one.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Father] Argum.</hi> 9. Inforcing the <hi>sixth</hi> Argument, Because, as all, so in the first place; The faithful Fathers are bound to obey the Exhortation, because it is given to them rather than to others, to know the Eternal Son of God, which benefit ought again and again to come into their consideration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Young men] Argum.</hi> 10. Reinforcing the seventh Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, because as all, so also the faithful young men <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 15.</hi> Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Exhort.</hi> 3. To beware of the love of the world, and of those things that are in it. By world hee understands the condition of unregenerate men, wherein they please them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and think themselves happy. By those things which are in the world, hee understands the enticements or the good things thereof, wherewith unregenerate men are taken, such are pleasures, riches, honours. To love, is to prize, to affect. The Arguments of the Exhortation are <hi>four.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If any man] Argum.</hi> 1. The love of the world bindes the heart to worldly things, and excludes the love of God, or of the Father, for the heart cannot bee carried out to contrary desires, or serve contrary Masters: Therefore have a care yee love not the world.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 16.</hi> For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. Confirming the former, The studies of worldly men, whereunto men are carried with a full car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reere, are such as the <hi>lust of the flesh,</hi> or sensual pleasures, of gluttony, or uncleanness; The <hi>lust of the eyes,</hi> or covetousness inordinately affecting matters of profit, and the <hi>pride of life,</hi> or an excessive desire of honours; Those desires (saith hee) are not of God, but from the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of unregenerate men: Therefore have a care<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c.</p>

Hee that renounces his perverse will, and the will of wicked men, and endeavours to do the will of God, shall live for ever: Therefore yee ought to beware of the love of the world.

Confirming the former, according to the premonition by the Apostles and Christ concerning that famous Antichrist which should come, many fore-running Antichrists have come already, who under the pretence of Teachers seduce men from Christ, and are the adversaries of Christ: Therefore it is the last time, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in yee are in danger of seducers, of whom yee ought dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to have a care.</p>

                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 9. Those that seduce men from the true Doctrine of the Gospel are the greatest lyers amongst men (as the interrogation intimates) because they in some way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deny Jesus to be the Christ, for they do not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge such a Christ, as the Father offers to us in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel: For they openly or secretly invade either his person, or his natures, or the proprieties of his natures, or his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, or his virtue, or his efficacy, or grace, or truth, or his glory: Therefore yee ought to beware of seducers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hee is] Reas.</hi> 10. All seducers, who draw hearers from Christ in any one Article, are Antichrists, both deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Father and the Son; and so overthrowing the true Religion, and the foundations of Religion with their lies, because there is no true God out of Christ: For in him dwells all the fulness of the God-head: Therefore yee ought to beware of seducers.</p>

               <p>Hee confirms this reason, from the inseparableness of the Father from the Son, that no man can have the Father for his God, who any way denies the Son, because God hath given himself to bee enjoyed wholly by us in Christ, and hee is sought for in vain elsewhere, or by any other way, than wherein hee hath manifested himself to us in Christ, who, as the image of the Father represents and offers to us whatsoever is necessary or profitable to bee known of the Father to salvation; and on the other side, whosoever give due honour to Christ, as to the Son of God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging him, such as hee hath manifested himself in the Scriptures, doth also acknowledge the Father, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem him for their God.</p>

                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 11. The truly antient and onely Truth of God alwaies constant to it self, is this, which I exhort you to hold, which <hi>viz.</hi> ye have heard from the beginning of the Gospel, not onely preached Christ, but also promised, and declared by the Prophets in the Scriptures: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore yee ought to retain that Truth: and here hee open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brings forth what hee aimed at, or the Exhortation.</p>

God upon this condition hath promised us life eternal, if wee retain stedfastly the Doctrine of Christ: Therefore yee ought stedfastly to continue in the Faith and obedience of Christs Doctrine, and beware of seducers, who do their indeavour to withdraw you from the Truth: And here again the Apostle professes openly his aim in these Arguments.</p>

Whosoever they bee that do not persevere in the Faith of Christ, neither abide in communion with him; furthermore, whatsoever they are in the esteem of men, they shall with shame depart from the judgement fear of Christ.

That the worlds not acknowledging you for the Sons of God, should bee no hinderance to you in the following after Righteousness, seeing that this contempt is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to you, with God your Father, whom also the world contemns, but it ought rather to stir you up, to union and conformity with God in the following after Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: Therefore, &amp;c.</p>

Although hee that is regenerate may bee overtaken by sin, yet hee cannot give up himself to sin, because of the nature of Regeneration, or because of the seed of God remaining in him (that is, because Gods Word, and the Spirit, or lively Grace of God in Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, is communicated in the number of those gifts, of which God doth not repent) by virtue whereof the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate is continually withdrawn from sin, and is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on to follow after Righteousness; neither can hee sin, or indulge himself in sin: Therefore yee ought to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after Righteousness, if you would prove your selves born of God.</p>

                     <hi>Vers. 16.</hi> Hereby perceive wee the love of God, because hee laid down his life for us, and wee ought to lay down our lives for the Brethren.</q>

Wee owe this gratitude to Christ, who hath laid down his life for us, and our Brethren, that wee bee ready to pour out our lives for the good of the Church, or our Brethren: Therefore so much the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ought wee sincerely to affect them, and perform the inferiour duties of love towards them.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 17.</hi> But whose hath this worlds good, and seeth his Brother hath need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?</q>

Confirming the former; They who do not so love their brethren, as to communicate of their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance to those that want, being moved to it out of bowels of mercy, are Hypocrites, and far from that love, which is ready to lay down its life for the brethren.</p>

                     <hi>Vers. 18.</hi> My little children, Let us not love in word, neither in tongue, but in deed, and in truth.</q>
                  <p>Hence is inferred the Exhortation it self; that they testifie their mutual love in deed, and in truth, and not in words, and in tongue onely.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 19.</hi> And hereby wee know that wee are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him.</q>

                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 11. By love of the brethren, as by the fruit of sincere Faith, wee know that wee are sincere, or truly faithful, and born of God: Therefore wee ought to love the brethren.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Before him] Argum.</hi> 12. By love wee shall confirm our confidence with God, and shall from this effect of Faith help conscience in the conflict of Faith, to the giving of us a testimony of our absolution and justification by Faith: Therefore, &amp;c.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vers. 20.</hi> For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things.</p>

                        <hi>21.</hi> Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have wee confidence towards God.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>Hee confirms this Argument by comparing of a watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and an evil conscience, in this verse, in the effects of condemnation; with a good conscience, in the following verse, in the effect of absolution: as when an evil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science condemneth him, that is altogether void of bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly love, the sentence of condemnation is ratified by God the supream and omniscient Judge, until they flye unto Christ; so on the other side, when a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science (which howsoever it accuse us of imperfection) doth not condemn us, as if wee were altogether destitute of this fruit of persevering in brotherly love, wee retain a confidence of going to God, as our Father in Christ: Therefore by following after brotherly love, wee shall assure our hearts before him, as it is, <hi>vers.</hi> 19.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 22.</hi> And whatsoever wee ask, wee receive of him, because wee keep his commandements, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 13. Conscience of brotherly love gives confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of obtaining those good things, which wee ask of God according to his will; because wee can reason from our endeavour of keeping and doing Gods Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (which are pleasing to him) that wee are of the number of those that are true beleevers, who through Faith in Christ, are in favour with God, and whose prayers God doth not reject, as hee doth the prayers of Hypocrites, and wicked men: Therefore yee ought to follow after brotherly love.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 23.</hi> And this is his Commandement, that wee should beleeve on the name of his Son Iesus Christ, and love one another, as hee gave us commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 14. Confirming the former, and answering an objection, Lest any man should abuse the things spoken before to defend the merits of works, or justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by works. The Commandement concerning brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly love, is consequently included in the precept of saving Faith, which is to bee placed upon Christ. For when God commands Faith in Christ, which works by love, he also commands that wee should love one another: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if any man have respect to the Precept concerning Faith in the Son of God, it is necessary also that hee have respect to the command touching mutual love, and that hee obey it: Therefore yee ought to follow after bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly love.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 24.</hi> And hee that keepeth his Commandements dwelleth in him, and bee in him; and hereby wee know that hee abideth in us, by the spirit which hee hath given us.</q>

In whom there is an indeavour to obey the commands of God, and namely the precept touching Faith in Christ (which worketh efficaciously by brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly love, hee hath communion with God, and knows that hee hath communion with him by the free presence of the Holy Ghost; which spiritual presence hee may know by its effects, <hi>viz.</hi> from a desire in him to obey Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, concerning lively Faith in Christ working by love: Therefore yee ought to follow after brotherly love.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IV.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>IN this <hi>Chapter</hi> the Apostle is wholly in establishing their Faith, and in stirring up their love towards the brethren. The <hi>Chapter</hi> contains <hi>two</hi> parts: In the <hi>first</hi> he exhorts to try the spirits, that they may beware of Impostors, <hi>to vers. 7.</hi> In the <hi>other</hi> hee again provokes them to bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly love, <hi>to the end.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 1.</hi> Beloved, beleeve not every spirit, but try the spirits, whether they are of God: because many false Prophets are gone out into the world.</q>
               <p>The occasion of mentioning the Spirit of God, in the last verse of the former Chapter, hee exhorts them to beleeve no spirit or doctrine coming from any spirit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they have examined and proved whether it bee of God. The Arguments of the Exhortation are <hi>six.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. Many false Prophets or Hereticks are risen, and are now gone out openly into the world: Therefore yee ought not to beleeve any doctrine, unless it bee first examined.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 2.</hi> Hereby know yee the Spirit of God; every spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that confesseth that Iesus Christ is come in the flesh, is of God.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. Yee have a rule ready, whereby, as by a touchstone, yee may examine every spirit, or the doctrine of any spirit, whether it bee of God. This is the <hi>first</hi> part of the Rule, whatsoever spirit doth seriously and truly confess the person of Christ, according to the divinity wherein it did exist from eternity, and according to the humanity, which hee truly assumed in his incarnation; and doth also seriously acknowledge him to be the Christ, according to all his offices, and attributeth to him alone the whole glory of a perfect Saviour, this spirit, or this doctrine is of God.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 3.</hi> And every spirit that confesseth not that Iesus is come in the flesh, is not of God: and this is that spirit of Antichrist, whereof you have heard that it should come, and even now already is it in the world.</q>
               <p>This other part of the Rule is negative, Whatsoever spirit, or whatsoever doctrine doth not really and firmly confess Jesus Christ after that manner, <hi>viz.</hi> as is above-said, but doth diminish any thing from his person, or from his offices, or his virtue, or efficacy, for the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or most fully perfecting salvation for us; hee is not of God; but it is the spirit of Antichrist, which spirit is now already in the world, although it hath not as yet so prevailed, that it can erect a Throne to it self, openly in the Church: Therefore seeing yee have this Rule, yee ought not to admit any doctrine, unless it bee examined.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 4.</hi> Yee are of God, little Children, and have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome them: because greater is hee that is in you, than hee that is in the world.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 3. Your victory, as touching seducers, is as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ready, as if it was already gained: Therefore tryal being made, yee need not fear to contend with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of God</hi>] Hee confirms this Argument by <hi>three</hi> Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons from God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. Yee are elected and regenerated by God: Therefore yee shall certainly overcome seducers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In you] Reas.</hi> 2. Yee have the Spirit of God dwelling in you, whereby yee may discern, and beware of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postors: Therefore yee shall certainly overcome them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Greater] Reas.</hi> 3. The Spirit of God dwelling in you is more powerful than the Devil, that spirit, the seducer that is in the world, or in wicked deceivers: Therefore yee shall certainly overcome them.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 5.</hi> They are of the world, therefore speak they of the world, and the world heareth them.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 4. By answering an objection, yee ought not to bee troubled, that the lying world hearkens to the lyes of seducers; for those seducers are of the world, and teach lyes, which are pleasing to the world, but on the contrary, yee ought the more diligently to beware of, and shun seducers, by how much the more the world is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to them: Therefore yee ought to try the spirits, whether they bee of God, and not admit any doctrine without examination.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 6.</hi> Wee are of God: hee that knoweth God, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us, hee that is not of God, heareth not us: here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by know wee the Spirit of Truth, and the spirit of errour.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 5. By preventing an objection, Seeing that wee Apostles and sincere teachers have our doctrine and effectual calling from God, both to the Faith of Christ, and to the preaching of Faith; it is sufficient that Gods elect, or those that are taught by him should hear our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, although perhaps the number of them may bee but small: Therefore hear us, and tryal being made, reject the spirit of errour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hee that is not of God] Argum.</hi> 6. It is the property of a man not renewed, who hath not as yet any commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God, not to adhere to our Apostolical do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, but to beleeve seducers. And this is the sign, whereby any one may be discerned, whether hee bee lead by the spirit of errour, or of truth; For hee that hath not hearkened to the doctrine of the Apostles, is lead by a spirit of errour, but if hee shun errours, and hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly adhered to the Apostles doctrine, hee is lead by the spirit of truth: Therefore yee ought to prove and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the Spirits, that yee may beware of seducers.</p>

                  <head>The Second Part.</head>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 7.</hi> Beloved, let us love one another; for love is of God: and every one that loveth, is born of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and knoweth God,</q>
                  <p>The other part of the Chapter follows, wherein hee exhorts to brotherly love. The Arguments of the Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation are <hi>twenty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. Love towards the brethren is from God, <hi>viz.</hi> as a special gift which is given onely to the elect: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought yee to endeavour after it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Everyone] Argum.</hi> 2. Confirming the former; Hee that is indued with love towards brethren, as brethren, is of the number of the regenerate: Therefore yee ought to endeavour after love.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Knoweth] Argum.</hi> 3. Hee that exercises love, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth God, <hi>i. e.</hi> believes in him, and loves him: Therefore yee ought to love the brethren.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 8.</hi> Hee that loveth not, knoweth not God, for God is Love.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 4. Hee that is altogether without love towards the brethren, doth neither beleeve God, nor love him. The reason of this is, because God is love; All love as to his essence, altogether lovely in himself, and in his Image every way altogether loving us, and the author or efficient of all love in all his children: so hee that is void of love, cannot know God: Therefore yee ought to endeavour after love.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 9.</hi> In this was manifested the love of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, because that God sent his onely begotten Son into the world; that wee might live through him.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 5. Confirming the preceding Reason, God hath so loved us, who are now his people, that hee hath sent his onely begotten Son, that wee being freed from death by his sufferings, might obtain eternal life: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee ought to love his adopted Sons, or our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vers. 10.</hi> Herein is love, not that wee loved God, but that hee loved us, and sent his Son to bee the propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for our sins.</p>
                     <p n="11">
                        <hi>11.</hi> Beloved, if God so loved us, wee ought also to love one another.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 6. Confirming and illustrating the former, God hath freely loved us, unworthy, and undeserving, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so enemies, who have not onely not merited his love, but
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:49391:164"/>
have, no, not first desired it, but God hath first loved us, and that most exceedingly, by sending his Son, who offered up himself a sacrifice for the expiating of our sins, and for the obtaining all the gifts, which are necessary for the preparing of us to the possession of eternal life. From whence it follows, that wee ought to exercise bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly love one towards another. <hi>Vers.</hi> 11.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 12.</hi> No man hath seen God at any time, if wee love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 7. Although God is invisible, who could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver with corporeal senses bee seen of any in his essence, yet if wee love one another, wee have communion with him, and hee dwells in us: Therefore wee ought to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after love.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Perfected] Argum.</hi> 8. From our love of Brethren, our love is perfected towards God, or demonstrated to bee sincere; such God accepts and approves: Therefore, &amp;c.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 13.</hi> Hereby know wee that wee dwell in him, and hee in us, because hee hath given us of his Spirit.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 9. Wee have not onely communion with God, but wee are also brought to a certain knowledge and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion, as touching our communion with God, and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual inhabitation, from this, that God hath given his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, or the spirit of love to us, from which spirit hee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self cannot bee separated: Therefore, &amp;c.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 14.</hi> And wee have seen, and do testifie, that the Father sent the Son to bee the Saviour of the world.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 10. From the experience of the Apostles, to this sense; Although no man hath seen God at any time, yet wee Apostles have seen the effect of the greatest love in him, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Father hath sent his Son to bee the Saviour of the world, or all his elect children, dispersed throughout the whole world, neither can wee conceal from men so much good, but out of the love which is in us to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the elect Brethren, wee testifie boldly concerning that love of God towards men: Therefore all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ought to do the same, every one according to his measure.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 15.</hi> Whosoever shall confess that Iesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and hee in God.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 11. Inferred from the former, and confirming it; because, not onely the Apostles, but also whoever hee bee, who out of love to God, and the Brethren, shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess both in word and deed, the excellency and virtue of Jesus Christ the Son of God, as wee do; hee hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God, as well as wee: Therefore yee ought to follow after brotherly love.</p>
                  <q>

                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 12. Also from the experience of the Apostles, to this sense; We Apostles, being perswaded by experience and faith, as touching Gods love to us, are constrained both to bear him witness (that hee is love it self, both in himself, and towards others) and to love him and his children: Therefore all the faithful, who beleeve, and have experienced the same, ought to do likewise.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>God is love] Argum.</hi> 13. Seeing that God is love it self, whosoever constantly abides in the Faith of divine love towards him, and in the endeavour both of exercising love towards God and the Brethren, hath constant com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God, and God with him: Therefore that this communion may remain firm, yee ought to follow after brotherly love.</p>

Both that love of God towards us, which is to bee beleeved, and that love of God which is to bee exercised towards God and the Brethren, is known to bee perfect and sincere, and is urged to bee fulfilled by us, for this end, that wee may stand without fear before God in the day of judgement: and as now thinking of that day, wee may have boldness, as if wee were now standing at Gods tribunal: Therefore wee ought to follow aft<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>As hee] Argum.</hi> 15. Giving a reason of the former; from the love of God found in us, wee firmly gather, that wee in this life are beloved of God, and are made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to God in this world, who is love: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee may bee perswaded, as by a certain sign, that wee are of the number of those, to whom there is no condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in the life to come: Therefore yee ought to follow after brotherly love.</p>
                  <q>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 16. Confirming the former. The love of God apprehended by faith, and kindling love in us towards God and the Brethren, doth so confirm us in a sure belief touching our salvation, that wee do not fear wrath and judgement: and by how much the perswasion of Gods love towards us doth the more ardently excite in us the endeavour of loving God and our neighbour; so much the more strongly the fear of condemnation is cast out, at leastwise that which is joyned with torment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Feareth] Argum.</hi> 17. As a conclusion deducted from the former Argument; whosoever is tormented with the fear of condemnation, is not strongly enough confirmed in the belief of Gods love, and the exercise of love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God and the brethren, but wan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 18. The love whereby wee love God, is not the cause of the love whereby God loves us, but an after ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: Therefore let us endeavour from the perswasion of Gods love towards us, more and more to love God, and by how much the more vehemently wee endeavour to love God in himself, and offering himself in his children to bee loved by us, wee shall bee so much the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed of his love towards us: Therefore yee ought to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after love.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>For hee</hi>] Hee confirms this Argument by this Reason; Because wee are more moved to love by sight, than by hearing: hee that loveth not his Brother whom hee hath seen, and the Image of God in him, hee cannot love God, whom hee hath not seen: Therefore the boasting of love towards God is vain, where love of the Brethren is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

               </argument>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 1.</hi> Whosoever beleeveth that Iesus is the Christ, is born of God: and every one that loveth him that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat, loveth him also that is begotten of him.</q>
               <p>The marks of those that are true beleevers, or born a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and live sincerely, are <hi>six.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note</hi> 1. Hee that is truly faithful, or begotten of God, beleeves seriously that Jesus is the promised Christ, <hi>viz.</hi> the Redeemer of the world; for whosoever solidly receives this truth, and applies it to himself, acknowledges it in his heart (as the Scripture requires) is born of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And every one] Note</hi> 2. Hee so loves God, that hee loves the Brethren, or those that are begotten of him.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 2.</hi> By this wee know that wee love the children of God, when wee love God, and keep his comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note</hi> 3. Those that are truly faithful, do so love the Brethren, that they also love God, and out of love to God, they endeavour to keep his commandements.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 3.</hi> For this is the love of God, that wee keep his Commandements, and his Commandements are not grievous.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note</hi> 4. Explicating the former; They that are truly faithful, demonstrate the sincerity of their love, in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to observe Gods Commandements out of love to him, so that his commandements, how much soever they bee hard and unpleasant to the flesh, yet they are not grievous, but such as they desire most willingly to perform.</p>

                  <hi>Vers. 4.</hi> For whatsoever is born of God, overcometh the world, and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our Faith.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note</hi> 5. Giving the reason of the former; They that are truly faithful, or born again, do overcome the world, that is, they overcome whatsoever opposes it self to the Spirit of God, <hi>viz.</hi> deceits, inticements, and the terrours of the world, and all hinderances, which may draw them from obedience to Gods commandements; so that their conflicts bee daily, yet they do not yeeld, but are sure to triumph, as conquerors, as often as their enemies oppose them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And this] Note</hi> 6. Explicating the former; They that are truly faithful, do not lean to their own strength in warring against the world, but on Christ by Faith, who hath overcome the world in their behalf, and doth admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister strength to them for the overcoming the world, which is the most certain, excellent, and compleat way to conquer.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 5.</hi> Who is hee that overcometh the world, but hee that beleeveth that Iesus is the Son of God?</q>
               <p>The reason of the victory got over the world by Faith, is, because it is impossible, that any one should overcome the world, unless it bee hee, that (despairing of himself) by Faith leans on the sole truth and strength of Jesus Christ, as of the omnipotent Son of God, who hath not onely overcome the world for his, but doth also make all his conquerors.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>other</hi> part of the Chapter follows, wherein hee proves that wee ought to beleeve in Christ, as in the Son of God. The Arguments are <hi>fourteen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. Because Jesus Christ is hee, who when hee came, brought with him the solid substance of Legal Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, as to that which chiefly belongs to the abolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of sin. For hee came with <hi>water,</hi> or with that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness in himself, and virtue for the sanctifying his, which was signified by <hi>water,</hi> and <hi>washings,</hi> in the old Law, to be in the Messias that was to come, when he came. And hee came with <hi>blood,</hi> or with a full expiation of their sins, by the propitiatory Sacrifice of his blood offered on the Cross, for the taking away of the sins of his people.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Not by water</hi>] Hee confirms that, because Christ came not with one propriety of a Mediatour, which is the <hi>Sanctity</hi> of his <hi>Person,</hi> and virtue of sanctifying his, signified by <hi>water,</hi> or legal washings; but hee comes also with another propriety, which is <hi>expiation,</hi> and full <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation,</hi> signified by the sprinkling of blood, or by the slaying of beasts. The admirable symbole of which conjunction was the flowing of water and blood out of his side on the cross, as our Apostle hath diligently observed in his Gospel, <hi>Chap.</hi> 19.34. That wee may all know, that whom Christ justifies, hee also sanctifies; and on the contrary, those whom hee sanctifies, the same hee also justifies: Therefore yee ought to beleeve in Christ.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Spirit] Argum.</hi> 2. The spirit witnesseth the same, <hi>i. e.</hi> the manifestation of the spirit in divers gifts poured forth upon Christs Disciples, witnesseth that Christ is the Son of God, and by its dictate makes this firm in the hearts of those that are faithful: Therefore yee ought to beleeve in Christ.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Truth</hi>] Hee confirms this Argument, that the Spirit in these operations is true, and far from all deceit, because it commends nothing to us besides the Word of God, or Truth it self.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 7.</hi> For there are three that bear record in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost, and these three are one.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. Because as the three persons of the God-head, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost are one in es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, so they also consent together in witnessing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm this one thing, That Jesus Christ is the Son of God. For the Father witnesseth of him: (1) Pronouncing with an audible voice, both in Christs Baptism and Transfigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that he was his beloved Son, in whom hee was well pleased. (2) In the works which hee gave to Christ to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish, <hi>Iob</hi> 5.16.36. Furthermore the word bears record of Christ, that is, Christ (wherein hee is God) bears record of himself, being incarnate, that hee is the Son of God: partly affirming that very often with a lively voice, partly making it manifest in his whole doctrine, that hee is the same which came out of his Fathers bosome, and laid open his counsel touching mans salvation; <hi>Hee that cometh from above</hi>; hee that <hi>cometh from Heaven,</hi> is above all, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.31. (3) The Holy Ghost bears re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, partly by his descending upon him in his Baptism, partly by his descending upon his Apostles and Disciples in the day of Pentecost, partly by inspiring the doctrine of Christ into the Pen-men of the Scripture, and by commending it to the world, that it might teach men, and perswade and confirm them touching that truth, as truly divine: By which hee may gather a Church, and lead it into all truth to eternal life, These three are said to bear record in Heaven; (1) Because they immediately bear witness from Heaven, as from their Throne. (2) Because the Majesty of these witnesses chiefly shines in Heaven. (3) Because this testimony is not heard, observed, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, unless by souls lifted up to Heaven. (Lastly) Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this testimony for the most part is perfected in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, although it should never bee received on earth: Therefore yee ought to beleeve in Christ for his testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies sake.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 8.</hi> And there are three that bear witness in earth, the Spirit, and the Water, and the Blood: and these three agree in one.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 4. Because three witnesses in earth consent to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to prove that Christ is the Son of God, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and the <hi>Water,</hi> and the <hi>Blood,</hi> which are called
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:49391:165"/>
witnesses in earth; (1) Because this testimony is mediate, and is produced out of the works which are to bee seen in the earth. (2) Because uttering of this testimony is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in men that are in the earth, and is acknowledged by the Visible Church. (Lastly) Because this testimony doth not onely sound in the Church, but also utters its voice amongst the men of the world, and is heard of them to their conviction: For (1) The Spirit or manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit partly in miraculous gifts (which are shed abroad in the Church) even to the amazement of the world for many years after Christs ascention: Partly in ordinary gifts, which as yet flourish in the Church, and suffice both to testifie, that Christ (who is preached a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us) is God; and to draw an acknowledgement from them, who are without the Church, that God is in us who beleeve in Christ, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. Furthermore, the operation of the Spirit in the hearts of the faithful doth so quicken the words of Christ, and by them doth so instruct, comfort, and confirm the elect, that it leaves no doubt as touching the Divinity of Christ.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Water,</hi> which is the virtue of Christ, sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his, it so expresly speaks of Christ, that those also, who are without the Church, seeing the light of good works in Christians, are forced to glorifie our Father, and the Father of Christ, who is in Heaven; so that also being even perceived in women, it brought their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeving husbands to God, who at the first did not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the Word of God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.1.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, As for <hi>Blood,</hi> which is the price of redemption, and the virtue of Christ expiating sins, and reconciling men to God, that blood speaks better things, than the blood of <hi>Abel,</hi> so that it makes the consciences of the faithful quiet and peaceable, and opens a way to the Throne of God, and so confirms their hearts against the world, and all things which are evil in it, that they may bee bold and able to resound even with their own blood, this testimony to those enemies that hear them, in the midst of torments with joy, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.11. Therefore wee ought to beleeve in Christ as the Son of God.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Vers. 9.</hi> If wee receive the witness of men, the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God is greater: For this is the witness of God which hee hath testified of his Son.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 5. For the sake of the testimonies of faithful and true men wee beleeve their assertions: Therefore for the sake of the testimony of God, which is greater, te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying of his Son, we ought to beleeve in Christ as the Son of God.</p>
                  <q>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Argum.</hi> 6 Hee that beleeves in Christ, as the Son of God, is so much rectified, that hee rests in the witness of the Spirit in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S <hi>Luke</hi> writ the Book of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and the <hi>Acts</hi> of the <hi>Apostles</hi> to a certain noble <hi>Theophilus,</hi> for the use of all the faithful; So <hi>John</hi> wrote this familiar Epistle to one Noble and Holy Matrone, and her children, not onely that hee might appropriate the Doctrine (which hee had commended in his former Epistle to the universal Church of the faithful, to this private family) but also that hee might teach the Pastors, how they ought to teach publickly, and from house to house, from the Apostles example, <hi>Act. 20<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 20.</hi> The parts of the Epistle are <hi>three;</hi> the <hi>Preface,</hi> containing the direction of the <hi>Epistle,</hi> and <hi>Salutation, to vers. 4.</hi> An <hi>Exhortation</hi> to perseverance in the obedience of the Gospel, or a constant exercise of Faith working by love, <hi>to vers. 12.</hi> The <hi>third</hi> is the conclusion.</p>
            </argument>
            <q>
               <hi>Vers. 1.</hi> THe Elder unto the Elect Lady and her Children, whom I love in the Truth: and not I onely, but also all they that have known the Truth:</q>
            <p>The direction of the Epistle shews, who, to whom, and with what minde hee wrote this Epistle. The writer is <hi>Iohn</hi> the Apostle, who makes no doubt of his authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in this family, content with the title of the ordinary and common ministery; hee calls himself an <hi>Elder,</hi> by which name hee being now very antient, hee also notes his age, to the end that his admonition, who could not live long by reason of his age, might bee the more deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fixed in them. The person whereunto it is chiefly writ, is the Elect Lady. To signifie civil and due honour, hee calls her <hi>Lady,</hi> acknowledging her more happy spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual condition in the Lord. Hee calls her <hi>Elect,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in that this Matron had (from the sincerity of her Faith) declared her self to bee elect, a farre more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent commendation, than that shee was accounted a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in a civil condition by men; Her children are adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, because they were partakers with their Mother of the Grace of God, in the knowledge of Christ.</p>
            <p>As for the mind of the Writer towards those, to whom hee writ, hee professes both his love and sincerity of it, and also testifies concerning the love of all other beleevers, that embraced the truth of the Gospel, and had heard of this family.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Vers. 2.</hi> For the Truths sake which dwelleth in us, and shall bee with us for ever.</q>
            <p>That hee might manifest his sincere love, hee affirms, that the cause of it is the common Faith of the Truth of the Gospel, wherein hee was confident that this Lady would persevere, and her children with her, and the rest of the faithful would enjoy the virtue and fruit of the truth of the Gospel for ever: Therefore the whole Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face is intended for the confirmation of the Faith of this pious family. (1) Because shee is an Elect Matrone, (2) Because her children are faithful, (3) Because they are beloved of the Apostle, (4) Because they are beloved of all the Faithful, (5) Because they are beloved rather for the Truth, than the nobility of their stock, (6) Because the Truth of the Gospel in them, both as to the faith and the fruits of it, would remain, and indure in them for ever.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Vers. 3.</hi> Grace bee with you, Mercy and Peace from God the Father, and from the Lord Iesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in Truth and Love.</q>
            <p>In the salutation, or Apostolical blessing (wherein is not contained a bare wish, but also a certain applying of that wished good) hee confirms them (1) Concerning the <hi>Grace</hi> or good will of God towards them, whereby hee freely makes us acceptable to him, and bestows upon us all things that may repair Gods Image in us. (2) Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:49391:166"/>
concerning the Mercy of God, which if it be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished from Grace, signifies the taking away our sinnes and miseries. (3) Concerning the <hi>Peace</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> which comprehends reconciliation, peace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and all the degrees both of inchoate and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect felicity: And because a blessing is expected in vain, unless from the true fountain, hee brings them to <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Father</hi> (from whom the whole divine essence is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to the Son, and the Holy Ghost) and to Christ the Mediatour (the second Person of the God-head in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate, invested with the office of salvation for us) whom hee calls the <hi>Son of the Father in Truth and Love</hi>: (1) Because hee is full of Truth and Grace, together with his Father, of the same nature or essence, because hee is his most true and beloved Son, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.14. (2) Because the mind of the Father is no other, nor his will no other towards us, than hee is, The same purpose of both is firm concerning us, and the same love towards us. (3) Because hee reveals the truth of the Fathers counsel and purpose to us, and the love where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with hee loves us, hee brings it forth, and derives it, or communicates it to us, and shews himself every way to bee the Son of the Father, both in truth of Doctrine, and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual love towards us resembling his expresse Image.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Vers. 4.</hi> I rejoyced greatly that I found of thy children walking in the Truth, as wee have received a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement from the Father.</q>
            <p>Here follows the body of the Epistle, wherein hee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts this Matrone with her children to persevere in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of the Gospel, <hi>i. e.</hi> in Faith working by love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God and the Brethren. The Arguments of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation are <hi>nine.</hi> The <hi>first</hi> is premised in this verse, wherein hee confesses his joy, that this family hitherto had continued in the obedience of the Gospel; hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms them as to what was past, and also stirs them up to persevere for the future. Your constancy in the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Gospel, will administer to mee and all the faithful (who hear of you) abundant matter of spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al joy, and consequently of thanksgiving to God: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore persevere in the Faith.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Vers. 5.</hi> And now I beseech thee, Lady, not as though I wrote a new Commandement unto thee: but that which wee had from the beginning, that wee love one another.</q>
            <p>From hence hee infers an Exhortation chiefly to the Matrone or Mother of the Family, under whose tuition the children were, together with the <hi>second</hi> Argument. The commandement for the demonstration of the effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of your Faith in the love of the Brethren hath nothing new in it, besides that which yee have learned by the gift of God from the beginning of your vocation, and have accustomed your selves to, <hi>viz.</hi> that from the Faith and love of Jesus Christ, yee also love the Christian brother-hood: Therefore go forward in the obedience of Faith working by love.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Vers. 6.</hi> And this is love, that wee walk after his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements; this is the Commandement, that as yee have heard from the beginning, yee should walk in it.</q>
            <p>
               <hi>Argum.</hi> 3. There is no other true love, either of our neighbour, or of God, besides that which consists in a constant indeavour of keeping all Gods Commandements, and walking or going forward in that obedience: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; or thus: The command, or the summe of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine delivered to us in the Gospel, is, that wee should keep faith and a good conscience, that wee should beleeve in Jesus Christ, and love our neighbour: Therefore per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severe yee in the obedience of faith, or this commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Vers. 7.</hi> For many deceivers are entred into the world, who confess not that Iesus Christ is come in the flesh, This is a deceiver, and an Antichrist.</q>
            <p>
               <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>gum.</hi> 4. There is danger, lest yee bee deceived, by reason of the multitude of seducers that are gone out into the world, and impudently boast of themselves: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore yee ought the more diligently to endeavour after per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance. But hee calls seducers, not onely those who openly oppose the person of Christ, his offices and power, but also those who did not confess Christ, nor ascribe all glory unto him, which the Spirit of God in holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teaches us to ascribe unto him. For whosoever hee was, hee is so far forth Antichrist, as hee doth neither confess nor acknowledge Christ, such as hee hath shewn forth himself to us in his holy Doctrine.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Vers. 8.</hi> Look to your selves, that wee lose not those things which wee have wrought, but that wee receive a full reward.</q>
            <p>
               <hi>Argum.</hi> 5. Unless yee constantly persevere in the true Faith of the Gospel, or the obedience to it, yee will lose all the fruit of that Faith which yee have hitherto professed, and afflictions also, which yee have suffered, and the works which yee formerly performed; because by your drawing back yee will manifest, that your Faith was never sincere, but a vain profession without truth: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore yee ought to indeavour through perseverance to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a full and plentiful reward, promised to all those that faithfully cleave unto God.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Vers. 9.</hi> Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the Doctrine of Christ, hath not God: Hee that abid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the Doctrine of Christ, hee hath both the Father and the Son.</q>
            <p>
               <hi>Argum.</hi> 6. Whosoever transgresseth the Doctrine of Christ, and doth not constantly abide in it, <hi>i. e.</hi> hee that either teaches, or receives a contrary Doctrine, or doth not abide in the obedience of Christs Doctrine, hath no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God, but is without God in the world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hee that abideth] Arg.</hi> 7. Hee that remains constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Faith of, and obedience to Christs Doctrine, hath and will have communion with God and Christ, and for his reward hee hath the Father and the Son by the Spirit dwelling in himself.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Vers. 10.</hi> If there come any unto you, and bring not this Doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed.</q>
            <p>
               <hi>Argum.</hi> 8. Propounded by way of Commandement; Yee ought earnestly to endeavour after perseverance in the Faith, that whosoever hath been discovered to bee a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducer of men from the Doctrine of Christ, or teacheth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Doctrine than that Christ hath taught, must not bee entertained, yea, not so much as courteously saluted, so that any respect bee, or seem to bee given to his errour, or to him for his errours sake, but rather by all means to be so handled, that it may bee understood both by him, a false Prophet, and by All) that the errour which hee teaches is detested.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Vers. 11.</hi> For hee that bideth him God speed, is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of his evil deeds.</q>
            <p>Hee gives the reason of this Argument, or Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, because hee that doth the least matter in favour of a seducer, whereby it can be gathered, that his errour is any way liked by him that salutes, or entertains him, hee is partaker of his evil deeds.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Vers. 12.</hi> Having many things to write unto you, I would not write with Paper and Inke, but I trust to come unto you, and speak face to face, that our joy may bee full.</q>
            <p>The conclusion remains, wherein are <hi>two</hi> Articles: In the <hi>first</hi> hee excuses his brevity, hoping to come to this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and being present, to instruct and confirm it more fully in the doctrine of Faith, that all the faithful in it might out of a larger and more fruitful instruction receive more fully of spiritual joy.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Vers. 13.</hi> The children of thy Elect Sister greet thee, <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>In the <hi>second</hi> Article hee salutes this Matrone from the children of her Sister, who was also faithful, and shewed the signs of her Election: <hi>Amen,</hi> sealing up the Doctrine of the whole Epistle.</p>

            <p>The <hi>second</hi> part of the Epistle follows, wherein hee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts him to persevere in the demonstration of his love to the Saints, and namely to some of the servants of God, who brought this Epistle to him. There are <hi>eleven</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to prove that <hi>Gaius</hi> ought to go forward in the duties of Charity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. From the former demonstration of his sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Faith working by love. Thou hast obtained a very commendable testimony of thy sincerity, from the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, which came from thee, who have had experience of thy liberality, and hath given mee cause both of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing on thy behalf, and giving thanks to God, and thee also: Therefore it is thy duty to proceed in the duties of Charity.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Vers. 4.</hi> I have no greater joy, than to hear that my children walk in Truth.</q>
            <p>
               <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. Confirming and explaining the former. No greater joy can betide mee, than that my Disciples, which I have begotten to God through the Gospel, do daily proceed in the exercises of Faith and Love.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Vers. 5.</hi> Beloved, Thou dost faithfully, whatsoever thou dost to the Brethren, and to strangers.</q>
            <p>
               <hi>Argum.</hi> 3. The works of Mercy and Charity, which thou exercisest towards the holy servants of God, and stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, demonstrate thee to bee truly Faithful: Therefore proceed in them.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Vers. 6.</hi> Which have born witnesse of thy Charity before the Church, whom if thou bring forward on their jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney after a godly sort, thou shalt do well:</q>
            <p>
               <hi>Argum.</hi> 4. The Brethren, which bring these letters to thee, have born witness openly of thy Charity in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick assembly of the Church: Therefore go forward both to deserve well of them and others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thou shalt do well] Argum.</hi> 5. If now thou shalt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive those that come unto thee, as thou hast before, and furnish them when they depart from thee, both with all things necessary for their journey, and accompany them somewhat in their way to another place, as it becomes thee, and is a thing befitting thee to accompany the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of God, thou shalt do an excellent office, and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> work that becometh thy piety towards God: Therefore see that thou do it.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Vers. 7.</hi> Because that for his names sake they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles.</q>
            <p>
               <hi>Argum</hi> 6. To preach the name of God, or the Gospel of Christ (who is God) they went forth of their own accord, taking nothing of the Gentiles, nor of those that were converted, nor of those that were not, lest they should give occasion to any, of saying that they preached the Gospel to the Gentiles for advantage: Therefore deal thou more liberally with these.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Vers. 8.</hi> Wee therefore ought to receive such, that wee might bee fellow-helpers to the Truth.</q>
            <p>
               <hi>Argum.</hi> 7. All that favour the preaching of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, are bound to promote the endeavours of men, as far as they are able, that they may share in the work of the Gospel, by sustaining, or some way assisting the preachers of it: Therefore be thou not wanting herein.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Vers. 9.</hi> I wrote unto the Church, but <hi>Diotrephes,</hi> who loveth to have the preheminence among them, receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us not.</q>
            <p>For this end I have written to the Church, wherein thou wast, that by the publick charges they might have provision necessary for their journey, but I am afraid of the success, because that ambitious <hi>Diotrephes,</hi> who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to have the preheminence over all the rest of his fellows, may undervalue both mee and my Letters of commendation.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Vers. 10.</hi> Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which hee doth, prating against us with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious words: and not content therewith, neither doth hee himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth them out of the Church.</q>
            <p>The Apostle adviseth him, that hee will deal with this ambitious lover of preheminence before the Church, when hee comes, and gives <hi>five</hi> reasons of his purpose.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. Because <hi>Diotrephes</hi> did many evil deeds.</p>

            <p n="3">3. Because hee did neither entertain, nor did bestow any kinde of respect upon the true Christians that held fast the Doctrine of the Apostles in all things.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Argum.</hi> 9. Thou oughtest not to follow the evil car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of thy Pastor <hi>Diotrephes,</hi> or obey his wicked com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, because this would bee evil, and contrary to true Faith, and love towards God; but thou oughtest to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that onely which is good, and agreeable to sound Doctrine: Therefore go on in exercising the duties of love.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hee that doth good] Argum.</hi> 10. Confirming the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mee; hee that indeavours to do good, is born of God; but hee that doth evil, is void of the true and saving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, or faith in him: Therefore go thou on to do good, that thou mayest approve thy self to bee of God.</p>

            <p>The Preface contains an inscription, and salutation; The inscription shews the direction of this Epistle, from whom, and to whom it was written. The writer of this Epistle is (1) described from his name; (2) from his Apostolical office, under the name of a <hi>servant</hi> (in which title hee more glories, than in the natural relation which was betwixt him and Christ the Lord.) (3) From the distinction of himself, from <hi>Iudas</hi> the Traitor, from whom, not onely in his disposition, but also in his name, hee desired to bee differenced.</p>
            <p>Those to whom hee writes, are described from four properties of the Elect. (1) They are <hi>in God the Father<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> i. e.</hi> reconciled by Christ, they have communion, or an holy fellowship with God. (2) They are <hi>sanctified</hi> by the special operation and inhabitation of the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi> (3) Preserved by the gift of <hi>perseverance</hi> from <hi>Christ</hi> the Redeemer, who suffers none of his to bee <hi>taken</hi> out of his <hi>hand.</hi> (4) <hi>Called,</hi> not onely with an <hi>outward</hi> call, but with an <hi>inward</hi> and <hi>effectual</hi> calling.</p>

            <p>In his salutation, by Apostolical authority, hee does not onely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>, wish, but applies to the confirmation of their Fait<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

(3) And <hi>Love,</hi> which, as the spring of all good things, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends grace, and all those effects, which conduce to our sanctification, and the compleating of our salvation. Hee desires that all these may bee <hi>multiplied</hi> in respect to the degrees of increase and manifestation, in other various effects, such as the glory of God and their salvation should require.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Vers. 3.</hi> Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation, it was needful for mee to write unto you, and exhort you, that yee should earnestly contend for the Faith, which was once deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered unto the Saints.</q>
            <p>The body and substance of the Epistle follows, wherein hee propounds the cause and scope of his writing, which hee further prosecutes. Two Reasons of his writing hee sets down: (1) His earnest desire, not onely in respect to his office in preaching the Gospel, wheresoever occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion was offered; but also of writing concerning the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Salvation</hi> of the Elect, obtained by <hi>Christ,</hi> and by degrees is to bee perfected, which is the summe of the Gospel. (2) The second Reason: The necessities of the Church, being in danger by seducers, which urged him to write this Epistle. These things being premised, hee propounds the scope of the Epistle, which is, that they would by all means indeavour to preserve the Apostolical doctrine to themselves and posterity, from the corruption
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:49391:167"/>
of seducers. Sound Doctrine hee calls the <hi>Faith, viz.</hi> to bee beleeved, because it contains all things necessary to bee beleeved unto salvation. <hi>Once delivered to the Saints,</hi> hee saith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Because with one consent all the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles fully and perfectly delivered the same Truth, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Scriptures written before, concerning sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to bee obtained by Faith in Christ; that they might have an immutable rule for obtaining eternal life, and without addition or diminution to bee observed to the coming of the Lord. For this Faith, hee wills them to <hi>contend,</hi> because the <hi>Flesh,</hi> the <hi>Devil,</hi> and the <hi>World,</hi> and the servants of Satan which are in it, will never cease to oppose this Truth, so that of necessity it lies upon all true Beleevers to maintain an irreconcileable war with these.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Vers. 4.</hi> For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying the onely Lord God, and our Lord Iesus Christ.</q>
            <p>The Arguments of his Exhortation are <hi>nine,</hi> whereof most of them are taken from the sins and punishments of seducers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. Which proves that the Apostolical Faith is to be diligently preserved from the corruptions of seducers, which was once committed to the Church. Because the danger was great, by reason of seducers, who had <hi>privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly crept</hi> in, as adversaries to this Doctrine: Whom hee so describes, that each part of the description might serve to this end. For (1) The manner of insinuating their errour to the Brethren was latent and private; for before they could bee well observed, by indirect waies and means, they closely instilled their errours into the minds of some. (2) Not without the divine decree were they permitted to follow their own devices, for the sifting and winnowing of the Church. For in the holy and eternal Counsel of God they were reprobated, and destined, that through their sins they should come to this condemnation, no less c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rtainly, than if their names were written in a book. (3) They were <hi>ungodly,</hi> touched with no sense and reverence of the <hi>Divine Majesty,</hi> either to serve him, or beleeve in him. (4) <hi>The Grace of our Lord Iesus Christ,</hi> or the Doctrine of Grace (which is set forth in the Gospel, to this very end, that men denying all ungodliness might live holily:) they directly perverted to a quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary end, and turned it into an occasion of all <hi>lascivious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> and carnal delights. (5) Indeed, in their doctrine and deeds, they denied our <hi>onely Lord</hi> and Master, and our God Jesus Christ, whom hee calls <hi>the onely Lord God,</hi> not excluding the Father, and the Holy Ghost, but crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and feigned Deities: Therefore against these sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, the purity of the Faith is to bee <hi>preserved.</hi>

               <hi>Vers. 5.</hi> I will therefore put you in remembrance, though yee once knew this, how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the Land of Egypt, afterward destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them that beleeved not.</q>

               <hi>Argum.</hi> 2. God destroyed the unbeleeving Apostate Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites in the wilderness, after they were brought out of <hi>Egypt</hi>: Therefore warned by their examples, yee ought to beware, lest seduced, yee perish with others.</p>

God destroyed <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> and the Cities about them, after they had given themselves over to <hi>fornication and filthy lusts</hi> (with which these Impostors polluted themselves) and for an example to those that should come after, cast them into eternal fire; You must beware therefore of these Impostors, which may draw you into the like sins and punishments.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Vers. 8.</hi> Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise dominion, and speak evil of dignities.</q>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 5. Because these Impostors are as <hi>vessels, fitted to destruction,</hi> whom God in like manner will destroy: the reason whereof hee gives from nine or more sins which reigned in them: From which their fruits, as so many marks, they shewed forth themselves to bee openly known and discerned. (1) The first vice of these Libertines was; That deluded with <hi>dreams</hi> they <hi>defiled</hi> the <hi>flesh,</hi> that is to say, they securely gave themselves over to lust, and other hainous sins<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by their diabolical inchantments they were bewitched in their minds and consciences, as if they had been taken with a <hi>dream.</hi> (2) The second vice was; They were adversaries to Civil <hi>Government,</hi> not enduring any kind of <hi>Magistracy</hi> or <hi>Dominion,</hi> but heaped up re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches and evil speakings upon those honourable <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances</hi> of God, even as at this day wee see in the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of the fanatick Anabaptists.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Vers. 9.</hi> Yet Michael the Archangel, when contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Devil, hee disputed about the body of Moses, du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>st not bring against him a railing accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but said, The Lord rebuke thee.</q>
            <p>Hee amplifies this vice, from <hi>Michael</hi> the Archangel his disputing with Satan about the body of <hi>Moses,</hi> that his sepulchre might not bee known to the Israelites, who would superstitiously have worshiped his reliques being dead, whose words they despised while hee was alive. Hee durst not, or could not by reason of his sanctity, cast such reproaches upon Satan, as those Hereticks did upon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistracy: It was enough for the Archangel to say, <hi>The Lord rebuke thee,</hi> or restrain thy purposes. From whence the Apostle fetched this history, they vainly inquire, who acknowledge the Scriptures to bee of divine inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Vers. 10.</hi> But these speak evil of those things which they know not: but what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things they corrupt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</q>
            <p n="3">(3) The third vice; That seeing they were ignorant of divine ordinances, Christian duties, and of all spiritual things, not only void, but uncapable, yet impudently they dare to belch out their blasphemies against those things. (4) The fourth vice, they are taxed with, is, That those things which naturally they know, as sensitive animals, in them they deport themselves below the very beasts, and prompt themselves to all lust and intemperance.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Vers. 11.</hi> We unto them, for they have gone in the way of Cain, and ran greedily after the errour of Balaam for reward, and perished in the gain saying of Core.</q>

(7) The seventh vice, is, <hi>Sedition,</hi> (like that of <hi>Core</hi>) whereby they oppose themselves to the true Ministers of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and by their tumults disturb the peace of the Church, who shall perish in their sedition, as <hi>Core</hi> did.</p>

the fear of God, and attended to nothing but gluttony and intemperance: feeding their own flesh, but not the souls of their Auditors. (9) The ninth vice, or rather an heap of vices, is shadowed under divers similitudes, that they were most unfit for the work of the Ministery, and indeed reprobate to every good work: for as empty clouds carried about with every wind, that saving doctrine which they seemed to promise, yeelded no dew or showres any where, but frustrated the earnest expectation of their hearers; and although they bear the shew of good fruit, and boast themselves to bee such, yet they are but au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumne, and fruit-spoiling trees, because if they promise any fruit, yet they bring it to no ripeness or maturity: Much rather may they bee called unfruitful, in as much as they bring forth no wholesome fruit, neither in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, nor their followers: And as trees cut down, wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, and rooted up, they leave no hopes of bringing forth any fruit, so they continue in their wickedness, dead by nature, and by their further wickedness contract ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial hardness of heart, as if dead the second time, and now given up to a reprobate sense, all hope is gone of their repentance and amendment.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Vers. 13.</hi> Raging waves of the Sea, foming out their own shame, wandring Stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever.</q>
            <p>Lastly, Such they are that cannot leave off to bee wicked, but like waters of the boiling Sea, alwaies they discover their filthiness; nor are they more constant in their doctrine, than wandring Stars in their motion. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst whom hee denounces the most palpable and deep infernal darkness, as the just meed of their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
            <q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vers. 14.</hi> And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord cometh, with ten thousand of his Saints,</p>
               <p n="15">
                  <hi>15.</hi> To execute judgement upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them, of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him.</p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 6. Whereby hee proves, that wee should beware of seducers, &amp;c. Because <hi>Enoch</hi> the seventh inclusively from <hi>Adam,</hi> by a spirit of prophecie foretold of the sins of these Impostors, and their condemnation in the day of judgement: when Christ shall bring along with him myriads of Saints and Angels to execute judgement upon all the ungodly, and especially will punish those who have stubbornly used their tongues against God, and his most holy Truth. Concerning the prophecie of <hi>Enoch,</hi> whether it was written before, or no, or how the Apostle came to know the Truth of it, wee say the same as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that the Spirit of God, which spake in <hi>Enoch,</hi> dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the same to the Apostle, even that which by <hi>Enoch</hi> hee had foretold long before; both what and how much hee should commit to writing, the same was prescribed to the Apostle.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Vers. 16.</hi> These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own lusts, and their mouth speaketh great swelling words, having mens persons in admiration because of advantage.</q>
            <p>That a conclusion may bee drawn, touching the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of these seducers, according to the prophecie of <hi>Enoch,</hi> and that by consequence they are to bee avoided, by way of assumption, hee shews these seducers to bee such, as <hi>Enoch</hi> had described them, to bee destroyed, from four marks.</p>
            <p n="1">(1) The first mark: They were <hi>murmurers,</hi> and <hi>complainers,</hi> never content with their condition, no waies satisfied concerning the righteous ordinations of God in Church or Common-wealth, impatient of any restraint, they carp'd at every thing, and discommended all things.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) They appointed to themselves a rule, neither from divine Laws in divine or Ecclesiastical things, nor from humane Laws in humane or civil Affairs, but onely their own wills and pleasures.</p>
            <p n="3">(3) Though they were the vilest slaves to their own lusts, yet that they might maintain some esteem, where there was none to controul their insolency, they spake high swelling words, in a lofty stile, ordered to create admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration with the people.</p>
            <p n="4">(4) On the other side, if there were any that they feared, or from whom they hoped for any gain, those they unworthily flattered, highly esteemed them, admired them, cryed them up, they nothing regarding whether they were worthy or unworthy.</p>
            <q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vers. 17.</hi> But, beloved, remember yee the words which were spoken before of the Apostles of our Lord Iesus Christ:</p>
               <p n="18">
                  <hi>18.</hi> How that they told you there should bee mockers in the last time, who should walk after their own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly lusts.</p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 7. Wee must beware of seducers, because the rest of the Apostles foretold that such Sons of <hi>Belial</hi> should arise in the Church, as <hi>Enoch</hi> had foretold.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Vers. 19.</hi> These bee they who separate themselves, sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual, having not the Spirit.</q>
            <p>That a conclusion may bee drawn for the avoiding the forementioned seducers, hee affirms that the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> with whom they had to do were Impostors, and that by two marks. The first mark, That they separated themselves from the true Church of Christ, and from the sound do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Apostles, not out of any necessity, or from any divine warrant, but onely upon their own pleasure, that they might not abide under the Lords yoak, or his discipline. The second mark, They were <hi>Natural,</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not the Spirit, Because they being void of Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating Grace, onely savoured and followed the things to which Nature leads, or natural Reason not divinely il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminated; therefore they were destitute of the Spirit, or of the Grace of God sanctifying; It remains that sense and the flesh should reign in full power, and would force them to all pollutions both of body and soul.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Vers. 20.</hi> But yee, Beloved, building up your selves on your most holy Faith, praying in the Holy Ghost,</q>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 8. Proving perseverance in the Faith, propounded by way of precept against the contrivances of these sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers: Because the Holy Ghost hath prescribed the means by which both they may persevere, as also they that have fallen back may bee recovered. And hee propounds a Reason, whereby they may slight the devices of Satan, <hi>viz.</hi> (1) If they would lay their foundation upon the most holy Doctrine of the Apostles, which hath no mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of humane inventions, and would not depart any thing at all from it. (2) If they would daily take care to carry on the superstructure, and would strive unto per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in the knowledge and beleef of the Truth reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Word of God. (3) If they were diligent in their prayers, out of a sense of their necessities, following the guidance of the Holy Spirit, which helps the infirmities of the Saints, and shews them for what, and how they must pray according to the will of God.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Vers. 21.</hi> Keep your selves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Iesus Christ unto eternal life.</q>
            <p n="4">(4) If they indeavoured to love their brethren and neighbours out of a sense of the love of God towards them. (5) If they would set the coming of the Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their eyes. (6) If they apprehended eternal life. (7) If against their own unworthiness they adhered to the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Christ, who is so to bee our Judge, that hee will take the Gospel, and the free benefit of our Redemption (procured by himself) for his rule. From this it follows, that wee ought to persevere in the Faith.</p>
            <q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vers. 22.</hi> And of some have compassion, making a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference:</p>
               <p n="23">
                  <hi>23.</hi> And others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire: bating even the garment spotted by the flesh.</p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 9. Is propounded by way of precept, because a reason is given of God to the Church, whereby not onely
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:49391:168"/>
they may persevere, but they may reduce into the way those that wandred out, and raise up those that were fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len: To wit, if they would handle every one according to his condition, <hi>i. e.</hi> putting a difference between those that erre; mercy and compassion was to be used towards those that were tractable and meek; but if any one was stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, and more securely shall indulge himself in his sin, with fear, and a more severe castigation, they should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to preserve him to wit, by excommunication, if otherwise hee could not be amended. There are <hi>two</hi> Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons given of this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. Under a fit similitude, for where wee see any one in danger to be burnt with fire, we stick not to snatch him out by force: So are they to be cured, who repent not, unless they be sharply handled, who are to be rescued from hell and destruction even by the severest censures.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reas.</hi> 2. By an allusion to a Legal type, <hi>Levit.</hi> 15. Because where there is danger of infection and contagion, as in obstinate offenders, and such as lead the way to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, their society is to be avoided, and wee must depart from such Libertines, given up to the pollution of the flesh. As in times past under the Law there was a sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from Lepers, and those that were pestilentially in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, which is the consequence of excommunication.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Vers. 24.</hi> Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory, with exceeding joy,</q>
            <p>The third part of the Epistle remains, to wit, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, in which hee shews, that all the praise of their perseverance is to be given unto God, lest any man should ascribe too much to the power of man, whose diligence in the use of means, as to the premises, is so much urged. These <hi>five</hi> following Reasons shew, that the praise of not perseverance is wholly to be attributed unto Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Is able] Reas.</hi> 1. Because the power of preserving be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, wholly abides in him, that in this life they might not fall or faint in the course of holiness.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To present] Reas.</hi> 2. Because there is power in him to present all his in the day of judgement unblameable in the sight of God, with exceeding joy.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Vers. 25.</hi> To the onely wise God our Saviour, bee glory and majesty, dominion and power, now and ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>Reas.</hi> 3. Because hee is the onely wise God, that by his own waies and means hee may accomplish this whole business.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saviour] Reas.</hi> 4. Because hee is our Saviour, by his merit, office, and efficacy, it is necessary hee should accomplish what hee hath undertaken.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Glory] Reas.</hi> 5. Because in every one of his works hee willeth the manifestation of his glory. So that chiefly in this business he will have the glory of his Majesty appear, his infinite power to be seen, and his supream authority o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all men and things, to be eminently discovered and acknowledged, both now and for ever. Therefore you that are true beleevers shall persevere, and all the glory of your salvation shall bee given unto God, to whom of right it belongs, and shall be ascribed for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>
