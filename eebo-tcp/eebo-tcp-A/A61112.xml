            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>And <hi>(all Israel)</hi> did eat &amp; drink before the Lord, on that day with great glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,

               <p>Then <hi>Solomon</hi> sat on the throne of the Lord, as King in stead of <hi>David</hi> his

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He three first works we
read of after the floud,
were, <hi>A work of Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
(the building of an
Altar, <hi>Gen. 8. 20.) A
work of pleasure,
(Noah</hi> his planting of a Vineyard, and
drinking of the wine thereof to excess,
<hi>Gen. 9. 20, 21.) A work of policie</hi> (the
building of <hi>Babel,) Gen. 11. 4.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>National calamities are frequently
in sacred Writ compared to a floud:<note place="margin">Dan. 9. 26.</note> and
such were the evils (civil and spiritual)
<hi>England</hi> long laboured under:<note place="margin">Isa 28 2.</note> a floud,
which covered the tops of our highest
Mountains (Princes and Nobles)
and threatned destruction (as that did to
<hi>Seths</hi>) to the two <hi>pillars</hi> of our Land,
<hi>Magistracie</hi> and <hi>Ministrie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:105600:3"/>
Now upon the asswaging of such
flouds, there are three sorts of works which
men (according to their different princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples)
entertain themselves withall: <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
persons</hi> with works of piety, and
grateful acknowledgements to the <hi>God
of their salvation. Sensual persons</hi>
about works of pleasure, excessive drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and sports (like Swine, wallowing the
more in the mire, the more the Sun shines
on them.) <hi>Subtile persons</hi> about works
of Policie,<note place="margin">Hag. 1. 4.</note> the repairing and <hi>cieling</hi> of
their own ruined houses, stepping in first
after the good Angels coming down, to get
cure for their civil evils: in short, there
are ten that complain of a leprosie, to one
who is thankeful for the cure. To the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
memory therefore of our deliverance,
and to invite men to offer the <hi>sacrifices
of praise</hi> to God, I here build this <hi>altar,</hi>
and that (after the law thereof, <hi>Exod.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:105600:3"/>
20. 25.) of rude and unpollisht stones.</p>
            <p>Heretofore we were ready to dance
about every image of power, made of the
peoples <hi>Ear-rings</hi> and <hi>Jewels</hi> broken to
pieces (their laws and liberties violated)
while our <hi>Moses</hi> was in the cloud, and
we thought our selves justified with say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<note place="margin">Exod. 32. 1.</note>
               <hi>As for this Moses, we wot not
what is become of him:</hi> but God hath
been pleased to restore him to us again,
and by him to conduct us (in a happy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree)
out of that <hi>wilderness</hi> condition
the Nation was in.</p>
            <p>Now to inkindle in our breasts a joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and pious sense of this divine favour,
is the end of this ensuing Sermon, to
which the slightness of the materials may
possibly render it not altogether dispro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned
(bonfires designed for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing
and expressing a publick joy,
art not made of solid timber, the slightest
<pb facs="tcp:105600:4"/>
materials are then most serviceable) God
hath not onely furnished us with an <hi>oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,</hi>
but an <hi>ability</hi> to rejoice, the joy
of His Majesties entrance to his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
being assisted by the three Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
blessings,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 24. 13.</note> 
               <hi>Plenty, Peace, Health,</hi>
(rarely in conjunction, observed to grace
the Inauguration of our English Kings.)</p>
            <p>I had not here been challengeable for
so bold an attempt as the giving any cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of His Sacred Majestie, (every
pencil especially at so great a distance is
not permitted to draw a Kings picture)
but I considered that honour and praise,
are reckoned, not among the <hi>free-will-of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,</hi>
but the <hi>necessary sacrifices</hi> to
these <hi>gods</hi> upon earth,<note place="margin">Psal. 82. 6.</note> good and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
Princes. It is prophesied of good
King <hi>Solomon, Psal.</hi> 72. 15. that <hi>prayer
should be made for him continually,
and daily should he be praised, (a
<pb facs="tcp:105600:4"/>
double honour</hi> which those that <hi>ruled</hi>
ill before never had,) besides the Text
(in the latitude of its sense) did invite
me hereunto, the <hi>Lxx</hi> reading it thus,

               </gap>, <hi>when the righteous
are commended, the people rejoice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I easily foresee that some passages herein
will be indited of bitterness, which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
an ordinary policie would have prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted
me to expunge,<note place="margin">Jer. 8. 11.</note> but that I was well

He increaseth the Nations, and destroyeth them: He enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
the Nations, and straitneth them again: <hi>and in the
Text we find him sometimes setting up a</hi> righteous, <hi>and

<hi>sometimes</hi> mourning.</p>
            <p>That method which God observed in <hi>making</hi> of the
World, he sometimes observeth in <hi>governing</hi> of it;

may sing praises to God, when they see his Wisdom
and Power issuing all things at last into excellent <hi>order,
beauty,</hi> and <hi>composure.</hi> Moreover, the holy God doth
by this variety of <hi>Providence</hi> (adverse and prosperous)
most wisely keep alive a quick and vigorous sense of
himself in the minds of men: for we shall always find
that a constant tenour of felicity,<note place="margin">Vid. D. <hi>Iack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> Atheism. sect. 1. c. 4.</note> an undisturbed enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the World doth choke and smother the innate
notions of a Deity in the minds of men; and on the
other side, a perpetual indigence and constant night of
affliction starves them. Men may lose their taste, rel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
and sense of God (as they do of their meat) both by
too much fulness and satiety in a long continued pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity,
and by too long fasting in a tedious course of
misery. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> (while his Sun was not overcast) cries
out <hi>Exod. 5. 2. Who is the Lord, that I should fear him?</hi>

            <p>To come nearer to the Text: It presents us with
the <hi>bright</hi> and dark side of this <hi>pillar</hi> of divine <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi>
whereby God guides his people through the
Wilderness of the World. I shall especially determine
my discourse unto the first words of the Text, wherein
we may note two things,</p>
            <list>
               <item>1 A case supposed, when (or, if) the <hi>righteous be in
authority.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2 The Wise mans observation, or judgement there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>the people rejoice.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>I begin with the first. The case proposed, when the
righteous are in authority, <hi>God and Religion justifie and
abet Rule, Soveraignty, and Authority in the World: God</hi>
doth by his setting up such to rule; and <hi>Religion</hi> doth,
in that we see here, that righteous men (called thereto)
do not decline it. God never intended that the <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
Sword</hi> should be turned into a <hi>plough-share:</hi> No
government so opposite as Civil and Spiritual (too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten)
in the <hi>administration,</hi> but none that so sweetly
agree in their <hi>institution</hi> and <hi>original. Order</hi> (which
the Magistrate preserves) <hi>God</hi> is the <hi>God of, 1 Cor. 14.
33.</hi> and <hi>Law</hi> (by which he proceeds) is but <hi>reason im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved,</hi>
(which grace doth not <hi>destroy</hi> but <hi>suppose.</hi>)</p>
            <p>More particularly, God justifies Rule and Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
two ways,
<list>
                  <item>by his Word,</item>
                  <item>by his Wonderful Providence.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>First <hi>by his Word:</hi> The Gospel doth very sparingly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:105600:7"/>
meddle with State matters, but when it doth, it enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
to obedience, by as obliging principles as it doth
to Religion; even a principle of <hi>Conscience, Rom. 13. 5.
We must be subject for Conscience sake:</hi> (not barely for
safeties sake) and a principle of the highest <hi>fear, Rom.
13. 2. They that resist</hi> (the powers) <hi>receive to themselves
damnation:</hi> a doctrine taught the world (in the type)
long before by that fire and earth-opening which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
the opposers of lawful authority. <hi>Num.</hi> 16.
33, 34. High and honourable are the Titles given to
Kings and Rulers in sacred Scripture of which I shall
note but these two peculiar: 1 That of the <hi>Lords anointed</hi>
so often (as a glory) about the heads of Princes in sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Writ: and it is observable, that this title is given
to the meanest among the order of Kings, (even a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
<hi>Cyrus. Isa. 45. 1. Cyrus mine anointed</hi>) when it
is never given expresly to the high-priest, though anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
too, and that with a most sacred and costly oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
kept in the Temple, and to be used onely at his
Consecration; nor yet to Prophets, though anointed
too, as well as Kings.</p>
            <p>2 Another Title given to Kings, is that of <hi>Gods, Psal.
82. 6. I have said ye are Gods,</hi> and <hi>Exod.</hi> 22. 28. A
title never given to any but to men in civil Power and
Authority, representing God in their <hi>persons</hi> (as a Judge
doth a King) and in their <hi>power;</hi> a King may (as God
doth) abrogate and establish Laws (as the exigences of
State and Councel may direct) which the Church
(having not <hi>dominium fidei</hi>) cannot do.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, God justifies and abets Rule and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<hi>by his providences.</hi> A Traitour the Latine phrase
doth most elegantly stile one that is <hi>reus laesae Majesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi>
one guilty of hurt Majesty; now because after so
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:105600:7"/>
many treasons, I cannot but rationally conceive Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
to be greatly hurt, and the reverence due to lawful
Authority too much impaired in the breasts of many
men, I shall therefore the more largely discourse on this
argument; [the several providences whereby God hath
eminently appeared from heaven to justifie and second
his Vice-roys upon earth.]</p>
            <p>1 By those <hi>eminent judgements by which he hath gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
branded the opposers of lawful Authority.</hi> These
three sins, high ingratitude, oppression, and rebellion,
very seldom have their dooms adjourned to another
world, because they so much thwart Gods government
of this. None of all those persons guilty of rebellion
in Scripture, went to their Graves in peace, <hi>Achitophel,
Absalom,</hi>

               <hi>Sheba, Abner, Abiathar, Ioab, Athaliah, Zim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri,
Adoniah:</hi> we shall seldom find any men (like blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Sampson</hi>) endeavoring to pull down the <hi>pillars</hi> upon
which Gods house stands, (for such are Kings) but they
themselves (like him) perished in the ruine. The
Heathen Historian observed, that there was hardly one
of <hi>Caesars</hi> murtherers (though a heathen Prince) that
survived the wickedness three years, all dying violent
deaths, some by shipwrack, some in battle, some by the
hand of justice, others by their own, and that very
sword which they had first prophaned by his bloud. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of this kind all Stories are full of: It was a truth
known to a proverb in <hi>Solomons</hi> time,<note place="margin">Sueton. in vitâ Jul. Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar. Vid. no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas <hi>Casaubon</hi> in locum.</note> 
               <hi>Prov. 24. 21, 22.

               <note place="margin">Prov. 17. 11.</note> Treason is a sin for which God allowed no san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary

of the altar and slain while under the guilt of this sin.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:105600:8"/>
We must know that God's justice is an attribute that
he is very jealous of,<note place="margin">Acts 5. 36, 37.</note> his own son shall die to declare it
to the world, and therefore no wonder that he is so
severe against those who lift up their hands against
the Magistrate who is the <hi>Minister</hi> of his justice in the
world.<note place="margin">Rom. 13. 4.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, <hi>God abets authority and rule, by that aw and
reverence to it</hi> so deeply <hi>implanted</hi> by him <hi>in the minds
of men.</hi> The great power of God seen in giving law
and bounds to the raging waves by so inconsiderable a
means, as an heap of little sands, falleth under frequent
notice and observance: but why do not we as much ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the lusts of men kept within their bounds by a
little gilded dust, (a weak man armed with power and
authority from God)? these are compared to the raging
sea, Psal. 65. 7. <hi>Thou stillest the noise of the sea, the rage
of their waves, and the tumult of the people.</hi> How strange
is it to see a Magistrate sometimes <hi>drive away evil with
his eye</hi> (as <hi>Solomon</hi> speaks,)<note place="margin">Prov. 20. 8.</note> killing and crushing wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
(though armed and daring) like the <hi>Basilisk,</hi> with
a <hi>look,</hi> his bare presence! much of God is observable
in it. It is God who restrains popular insolencies by an
implanted reverence to authority, it is he which keeps
this <hi>beast,</hi> the multitude, from knowing its own strength,
and so from attempting to cast its rider. This <hi>David</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
acknowledged, Psal. 144. 2. <hi>It is God who

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, <hi>God abets Kings and Governours by those
strange preservations vouchsafed by him to their persons.</hi>
There goes another kinde of <hi>life-guard</hi> about a King
then men generally are aware of: God hath this as his
especial title, Psal. 144. 10. <hi>The God that sheweth sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
unto Kings;</hi> and he tells one of his Governours,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:105600:8"/>
Hag. 2. 23. <hi>I have set thee as a signet upon my right
hand.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 21. 1.</note> The <hi>hearts</hi> of Kings, but much more the <hi>times of
Kings</hi> are in <hi>Gods hands:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 31. 15.</note> 
               <hi>Caesarem vehis &amp; fortunam

<hi>heathen Prince</hi> that spake it was aware.<note place="margin">—<gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, Theocr.</note> Kings are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to more then ordinary dangers, and therefore have
a more then ordinary power concerned in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection.
Many an Assassine hath found himself daunted
with the raies of Majesty, and deterred (by an unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
reverence possessing him) from his intended vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany,
and hath found cause to say to his Prince as <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban</hi>
to <hi>Iacob,</hi> Gen. 31. 29. <hi>It is in the power of my hand
to do you hurt, but God hath spoken to me, saying, speak
not to Iacob neither good nor bad:</hi> the instances of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
Princes falling by the hands of Assassinates are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
but great deliverances hath God vouchsafed to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Kings, not above one being to be instanced in
suffering any personal violence by a private hand.
Hence the title of <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> given to Kings by the

A King doth not fall like common men, a prodigie in
nature commonly gives us notice of his death.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, God justifies rule and authority, <hi>by giving <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
so often publick spirits to men in publick places.</hi> A pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
place may well enough suit an ambitious spirit, but
a publick spirit is the <hi>seal of authority,</hi> it is Gods spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
gift. Men are indeed naturally desirous to be at the
top of the <hi>tree</hi> of <hi>fortune</hi> (as it is called) not that they
might be <hi>more fruitfull,</hi> and do more good, but that
they might be nearer <hi>the sun,</hi> and more out of the reach
of the hand of <hi>violence;</hi> But a publick spirit, it is (I
had almost said) <hi>donum miraculosum</hi> given as a seal to
authority, and we shall finde the highest instances of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:105600:9"/>
it, in persons eminently called by God to some publick
trust,<note place="margin">1 King. 3. 11.</note> in <hi>Moses</hi> praying God rather to <hi>blot him out of his

            </p>
            <p>It is noted of <hi>Augustus Cesar,</hi> that when once he
was possest of the Empire, all his former arts of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness,
fraud and tyranny (the low stratagems of a
particular, narrow spirit) he wholly discarded, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
himself intirely to the love, defence, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
of the commonwealth of Rome, and like
<hi>Saul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Boeclerus</hi> diss. politi. in Caes. Aug.</note> when called to the government was turned into
another man: <hi>ut satis constaret</hi> (saith one) <hi>divino quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam

Men that are intended but for a narrow place and
sphere (like <hi>the snail</hi> in its little house) turn out <hi>horns</hi>
(not <hi>arms</hi>) to every body else.</p>
            <p>It is seldome seen that God so far owns an <hi>Usurper</hi>
as to vouchsafe this seal of authority,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Aristot. &amp; Polit. c. 10.</note> a truly publick
spirit. It is seldome that he gives him a heart to use
his power really to the peoples good; some good things
he may sometimes do to compound with the people,
but nothing out of a publick spirit and a real fatherly
affection. Men naturally seek their own, and love to
be at ease:<note place="margin">Judg. 9. 9.</note> 
               <hi>Cain</hi> spake his own sense, and of most
wicked men, Gen. 4. 9. <hi>Am I my brothers keeper!</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious
spirits (like <hi>flame</hi>) the higher they rise, the
more they are contracted into the narrow point of self
by the constringency of ambient fears, jealousies and
distrusts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:105600:9"/>
It is Gods highest owning of a person in power,
when he makes him like <hi>Mordecai,</hi> Esth. 10, 3. a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<hi>seeking</hi> cordially <hi>the wealth of his people</hi> and <hi>speaking
peace</hi> to them:<note place="margin">Isa. 22. 21.</note> when (contrary to his natural tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per)
like <hi>Solomon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 51. 12.</note> he gives him <hi>largeness of heart,</hi>
in which there may be room for more then himself,
when he gives him <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> LXX.</note> or (as the
word imports) a <hi>royal,</hi> a <hi>princely</hi> spirit.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, God seals to Authority and Sovereignty <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
by that <hi>extraordinary direction and assistance which he
often gives his substitutes in the administration</hi> of their
office, which is sometimes very strange. It is the speech
of <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 16. 10. <hi>A divine speech is in the lips
of a King, his mouth transgresseth not in judgement. (Deo
nimirum,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iansen.</hi> in locum.</note> 
               <hi>cujus vices gerit, ejus sententiam moderante.</hi>)
The intimacy between God and a good King is greater,
then men think of: God hath made Princes in judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
(as it were) his own oracles to the people: <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility</hi>
is more annexed to the <hi>chair of Moses,</hi> then
to the <hi>chair of Peter:</hi> supposing the <hi>Prince</hi> be not
wanting to himself (by conversing with Gods law and
mans) he is most likely to have God of his <hi>councel.</hi> A
King sometimes sees <hi>per emissionem radiorum,</hi> by an
unexpected emission of those beams of light and wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
whereby he scatters the mists of fraud and
imposture cast before his eyes to procure wickedness
indemnity.</p>
            <p>There were three ways especially by which God of
old bore witness to a person, and justified his bearing
rule and authority over a people. 1. (as was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served)
by giving him a <hi>publick spirit</hi> suitable to his
publick place. 2. by <hi>moving</hi> the <hi>hearts</hi> of <hi>people,</hi> to
own and obey the person so set up by God, 1 Sam. 10.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:105600:10"/>
26. 2 Sam. 19. 14. 1 King. 12. 20. 1 Chron. 29. 23,
24. Psalm 144. 2. 3. By giving him an <hi>understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <hi>Grotius</hi> telleth us, he that diligently reads over
the old Testament, <hi>Plures reperturus est Principes Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetas,
quàm Prophetas sacerdotes:</hi> shall finde more
Kings who were Prophets, then Prophets that were
Priests, that so they might be the better fitted for the
discharge of their weighty office: and no question, God
is more assistant to Kings under the Gospel, to teach
them what they shall do, then we are aware: He judgeth
amongst the Gods in an especial manner <hi>(judicio insito)</hi>
as <hi>Iehoshaphat</hi> told his judges, 2 Chron. 19. 6. <hi>Ye judge
for the Lord, who is with you in judgement.</hi>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixthly, God justifies Authority and Magistracy by
his <hi>strange continuance thereof so long in the world
against all opposition</hi> made against it. Great bandying
there hath been against government at all times, by the
sons of <hi>Belial;</hi> opposition against the <hi>eminency</hi> of
Magistracy,<note place="margin">Jam. 4. 25.</note> 
               <hi>(the spirit within us lusteth to envy)</hi> against
the <hi>restraint</hi> thereof, Jude v. 8. <hi>Some despise dominion,</hi>
not onely Governours but Government it self is a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
to them; Government is stiled the ordinance of
God, those that are above other ordinances, are above
this most of all.</p>
            <p>There are three inward and three outward guards
which God (in mercy) hath vouchsafed the world to
keep sin out of it:<note place="margin">Rom. 2. 15.</note> the three inward are, <hi>the common

whispers of that. 3. <hi>the checks of an enlightened con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science:</hi>

               </gap> (as the word is) lay aside and null (what
they are able) Magistrates and Dominions:<note place="margin">Jude v. 8.</note> but now,
as we argue that the Scripture, the light of nature, the
Ministry, the checks of conscience, are of Gods own
appointing, and owned by him, in that all the malice
of men and devils could never quite remove, null, and
abolish them, so we may conclude, Magistracy sealed
to,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3. 17.</note> by heaven, in that (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) men without law
could never quit themselves thereof. Many people
have thrown off Governors, but never any could throw
off Government, no sooner have they cut off one head
but another comes up in the room thereof: Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Magistracy is a bush of thorns that pricks
and tortures wicked men, and it hath been often on
fire, and had long ere this been consumed, but (as we
have reason to believe) God is in it, his mighty power
is engaged in its defence: This God owns: Psal. 75. 3.
<hi>The earth and all the inhabitants are dissolved, but I bear
up the pillars of it.</hi>

us that in the succession of about six ages,<note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Grot.</hi> de imper. sum. pot. c. 3. sect. 14.</note> no man
of any learning and reputation attempted any

which he generally vouchsafeth upon the due <hi>exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of justice</hi> by men in power and Sovereignty. It
is seldome seen that <hi>private revenge</hi> (though the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

of it might be just and deserved) hath been happy

private revenges take off one enemy, and invite
many: but publick revenge executed by the rules of
justice procures Gods especial blessing upon a person or
nation, Jer. 22. 3. <hi>Thus saith the Lord, Execute judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

the world did govern it, and administer justice often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
immediately by his own hand, and punished ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
a person (as we reade) with death for the violati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his laws, whereas now God hath committed (as
all spiritual judgement to his son, so) all civil judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the Magistrate, and therefore Gad hath a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
blessing pronounced upon him for executing the
<hi>justice of the Lord,</hi> Deut. 33. 21. and in him every
righteous magistrate.</p>
            <p>These eight particulars laid together will evidence
God to be a very great abettour and justifier of <hi>rule and
Sovereignty</hi> in the world.</p>
            <p>We learn hence two things. 1. The <hi>unjustness</hi> of
that <hi>charge</hi> so often drawn up against <hi>Religion,</hi> as if an
<hi>enemy</hi> to <hi>government,</hi> a patron of State-disturbance.
When ever there have been state troubles, atheists cry
out <hi>Tantum relligio potuit,</hi> &amp;c. religious persons have
been alway thought the <hi>Iona's</hi> in the ship, when there
hath been a <hi>storm</hi> in the state, <hi>Eliah</hi> esteemed <hi>a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler
of Israel,</hi> 1 Kings 18. The apostles, Acts 24. 5.
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and Acts 17. 6. <hi>those which turnd the world up side
down.</hi> so Esth. 3. 8. Some conceive this was the reason
why <hi>Cyrus</hi> gave command, so punctually to build the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:105600:12"/>
Temple but <hi>threescore cubits broad,</hi> and <hi>threescore cubits
high,</hi> even a politick jealousie of the strength thereof,
as occasion might serve. The heathens used to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
the Gospel upon this account, as may be collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
probably from 1 <hi>Pet. 2. 14, 15. Submit your selves
unto Governours, as unto them who are sent of God,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>For so is the will of God, that in well-doing you may put to
silence the ignorance of foolishmen, whose</hi> mouths upon
neglect of this duty, were like an open Sepulchre to
bury the good name of Christianity and the professors
of it. So 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 1. And we read in history of a pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
set up with this inscription, <hi>Nomini Christianorum
deleto qui Rempublicam evertebant.</hi> Polititians have
been always jealous of pretenders to Religion, lest it
should be used like the holy <hi>Ephod</hi> to hide a Sword in.
<hi>Erasmus</hi> when he saw the stirs and commotions in
<hi>Germany</hi> occasioned thereupon, to the grief of all good
men,<note place="margin">Ep. ad Fratr. inferior Germ.</note> thus exprest himself, <hi>Annon haec mea fuit vox ad
primum gustum libellorum Lutheri, res redibit ad seditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem?</hi>
and one well notes that however the Rulers of
this World have been very jealous of the strength of
the Church, and very careful to keep that under hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
yet they have suffered <hi>Babylon</hi> to be built in its
full strength, though <hi>Romes</hi> profest principles lead to
removal of Magistracy and State commotions.</p>
            <p>Now these jealousies and reproaches might be occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned
two ways, 1 By the spiritual pride of professors,
thinking that the Gospel <hi>jubilee</hi> freed all servants from
obedience to Masters, and Subjects from obedience to
Princes, especially if in the state of Gentilism; an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
which the Devil (no doubt) leavened the minds of
men withall,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Daven.</hi> in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loss. c. 3. v. 22.</note> (as a learned man speaks) <hi>Ut inde in odium
vocaret Christianam religionem apud Ethnicos, quasi or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinis
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:105600:12"/>
perturbatricem,</hi> to bring Christianity into disgrace,
as if a disturber of the peace and order of a Nation.
2 From the (misapprehended) honour of appearing in
Religions defence: deluded people apprehend they may
fight for Religion, and cannot die (they thinke) with
greater assurance of honour here, and heaven hereafter,
then,<note place="margin">Luke 11. 51.</note> when they fall like <hi>Zechariah</hi> between the <hi>Temple
and the Altar.</hi> People like the Turks will receive this
Jewish practice of opposing <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> into fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
when Polititians have once christned it with the
name of Zeal for Religion and Liberty.</p>
            <p>But Religion may say (as <hi>Elizabeth) God hath rolled
away my reproach,</hi> for howsoever politick pretenders to
Religion (that stand by the Altar but to warm their
own hands) have upon every slight ground opposed
lawful Authority, and thrown dirt in the face of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours,
yet the doctrine of the Gospel warrants no
such thing. The Pulpit was never intended to be a
Circle, in which to raise up the evil spirits of sedition,
and state commotions. No Religion in the doctrine
of it, so greatly secures the power of Kings, and the
peace of States, as the Christian doth. We are bidden
by the Gospel to be obedient <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 18.
to the crookedst and frowardst Masters God sets over
us, so that Religion can never be pretended against
Loyalty.</p>
            <p>And therefore when I take a sad review of the evil
of our late disturbances, I take not so much notice of
the loss of <hi>King, Liberty, Property, Parliaments, Bloud,</hi>
(though very great) as of the impairing so far the <hi>credit
of Religion,</hi> in the violences offered to the person of
His <hi>sacred Majesty,</hi> and that by persons so highly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to it. I am sorry the Papists seem to have now
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:105600:13"/>
a 30<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
               <hi>of Ianuary</hi> to return us for a 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>November.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But blessed be God who put it into the heart of the
<hi>Parliament</hi> to begin their work at the removal of this
stain and blot from <hi>Religion,</hi> not suffering the bloud of
a Prince to lie any longer (like <hi>aquafortis</hi>) upon Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
credit to corode and eat thereinto. We finde
their practice justified by the holy Ghost, who having
told us of King <hi>Iehoash</hi> being murdered by his servants,
out of hand tells us who they were that did it, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi>
24. 26. to wit, none of the professours of the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
none of the <hi>Israelites</hi> but <hi>Zabad the Ammonite,</hi>
and <hi>Iehozabad the Moabite,</hi> that so the honour of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
might not suffer for a moment in the breast of the
Reader, and thus our <hi>Senatours</hi> tell the World (as soon
as God favours them with an opportunity) that it was
not <hi>Law</hi> but <hi>Violence,</hi> not <hi>Religion</hi> but <hi>Pretences,</hi> not
the <hi>Nation</hi> but a <hi>Faction</hi> that attempted so unparallell'd
a wickedness.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, This doctrine may serve to give a <hi>check</hi> to
all <hi>traiterous attempts</hi> against <hi>Majesty</hi> and <hi>Authority.</hi>
There is a threefold treason that falls here under chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge,
that of the heart, of the tongue, and of the
hand.</p>
            <p>1 That of the <hi>heart,</hi> of which those were guilty
<hi>Jude v. 8. who despise dominions,</hi> and those men of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lial,

Owl-ey'd creatures that can see nothing in a King but
flesh &amp; bloud and a little state, (like children that can see
nothing in the rainbow but onely a few fine colours.)
Oh methinks those words, <hi>by me Kings reign, Prov.</hi> 8.
should strike reverence and religion into every <hi>Atheist</hi>
against those whom the Scripture stiles <hi>Gods</hi> among
men. Let us not think slightly of a King, when God
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:105600:13"/>
hath enjoined reverence to himself and him both in a
breath in the Old Testament, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24. 21. in the
New, 1 <hi>Pet. 2. 17. Fear God, honour the King:</hi> The
murder of common and ordinary men, we observe that
God makes use of the very <hi>birds</hi> and <hi>beasts</hi> to discover,
but a very thought that impeacheth Majesty, that doth
(not <hi>cut off,</hi> but) <hi>soil</hi> the skirt of a King, the Scripture
tells us <hi>a bird of the air shall discover it. Eccl.</hi> 10. 20.
God at one time or other suffers this sower leaven to

            <p>2 This may give a check to the treason <hi>of the
tongue,</hi> to those who <hi>speak evill of dignities, Jude v.</hi> 8.
when a King hath given a title of honour to a person,
all the Subjects must own it and honour him accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly;
how much more when God hath given such
eminent titles to Kings, should we look upon our selves
as bound so to do?<note place="margin">

all consecrated daggers. In heathen Writers indeed,
nothing of more familiar occurrence then Panegyricks
in commendation of the assertors of publick liberty (as
they stiled them) by the assassinating of a Ruler, when
the people once pleased to vote him a Tyrant; a thing
easily pardonable in them, being able (by the dim light
of nature) to discover no more in a King then a head of
gold, supported by the clayie toes of popular election
and acceptance: but Scripture shews a higher Charter
then so, whereby Kings hold their Crowns, <hi>Prov. 8, 15.
by me Kings reign:</hi> Herein is a considerable difference
between Christianity and Gentilism; in Gentilism there

his person, when judged an Encroacher upon the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick

less (though a truer) honour for the Magistrates person,
but then reflects a higher upon his office; stiling it

            <p>2 A righteous Prince doth a Nation much good by
<hi>his very presence</hi> therein: Little do men understand
how great a blessing the very presence of a good King
is to a people whom God looks upon as an <hi>universale

in his <hi>office,</hi> but in his <hi>person,</hi> and the people as <hi>holy</hi> in

               <hi>and I will pardon it.</hi> So 2 <hi>Chron 32. 25.
the wrath of</hi> the Lord came not upon <hi>Hierusalem</hi> in the

            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>By the successfulness of his counsels,</hi> He is
great matter of joy to a people generally. That Prince
is most likely to be attended with success who makes
use of this wisdome,<note place="margin">Prov. 14. 8.</note> not to promote his own unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable
designes, but to discover other mens: It is a
maxime in law, <hi>When a state is in preservation of law,
nothing can hurt it.</hi> And it is a proverb in Scripture,
Prov. 10. 9. <hi>He that walketh uprightly walketh surely.</hi>
The instances of unfortunate and righteous Princes are
very few.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reason of state</hi> indeed seldome makes use of that to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick
<hi>ab honesto,</hi> for it is generally thought that religion
makes a Prince a <hi>lamb,</hi>

that cases of <hi>conscience</hi> were not written for
a <hi>Prince</hi> to read. That a Prince who is to be <hi>faber for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunae
suae,</hi> must use crooked instruments as well as strait;
turn aside to counsels, which nice Casuists possibly will
not justifie. But we shall finde God blasting such do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
as this by his Providences frequently; a <hi>Mounte-bank</hi>
may sometime remove a fit, but it is the <hi>Physician</hi>
must cure the disease: and thus sometimes, the wily
stratagems of unrighteous politicians (those <hi>slight heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi>)
may remove a fit of a distemper the body poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
groans under,<note place="margin">Jerem. 6. 14.</note> but it returns afterward with greater
violence, it is righteousness onely is the Physician to
cure it. Righteousness may possibly lose a throw or
two, but it constantly wins the game; Not I, but the
Lord saith to a wily politician <hi>King Shallum,</hi> Jerem.
22. 15. <hi>Shalt thou reign because thou closest thy self in
cedar?</hi> (because thou managest affairs of state politick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)
<hi>did not thy father eat and drink and do justice, and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:105600:16"/>
judgement, and then it was well with him? He judged the
cause of the poor and needy and then it was well with him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That policy and cunning do not carry it, and that
the game goes not always to him that can best cog the
die, appears both in <hi>nations and particular men.</hi>
See it in nations. The <hi>Asiaticks</hi> more quick and
acute generally then the <hi>Europeans</hi> anciently, were
conquered by the <hi>Grecians:</hi> The <hi>Grecians</hi> by the <hi>Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens,</hi>
The <hi>Athenians</hi> by the <hi>Spartans,</hi> The <hi>Egyptians</hi>
by the <hi>Persians,</hi> many nations by the <hi>Turks,</hi> and yet
the latter the more dull and unpolitick people: see it
in particular persons, who more acute then <hi>Machiavel,</hi>
and who more unfortunate in his counsel to <hi>Caesar Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia?
Clement</hi> the seventh, a politick person but not
successfull; <hi>Achithophel,</hi> drowned in his own depth. It is
a thing which Scripture often tells us of,<note place="margin">Psal 9. 16.</note> Gods <hi>blasting</hi>
the unrighteous <hi>counsels</hi> of <hi>Polititians.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 12. 20.</note> It is one of Gods

backward and maketh their knowledge foolish,</hi> Job 12. 17.
<hi>He leadeth counsellours away spoiled, and maketh judges
fools.</hi> It is a truth of everlasting faithfulness, <hi>that can
never be brought about (safely) by bad means, which
could not be by good.</hi> Besides, righteousness brings suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
to counsels, because politicians generally hunt coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

Goodness delivers from those lusts and impurities, which
shrivel, shrink and crumple the spirits of men and make
them particular and selfish: As soon as ever the sun of
righteousness shines in upon the soul, (like the flower)
it opens, and expands it self in care for and love to our

(like <hi>Sampsons</hi> hair) but the excrements (the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scouring

the strength thereof,<note place="margin">Act. 27. 31.</note> Zach. 12. 5. 2 Sam. 5. 12. It is the

and heresies are the red Dragons teeth, whereby

being no such enmities as those which are founded in

to preserve her portion sacred and entire, Church
goods (like <hi>Manna</hi>) corrupt and breed worms while

a good Prince is an occasion of great joy to a

heaven upon them. Virtue (in many particular persons)
hath not her portion paid her till arrived at full growth

            <p>Thus we see how justifiable the custome of people
is, to rejoyce when the righteous are in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The words may be understood as deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the <hi>duty</hi> of <hi>a people</hi> in such an instance of divine
favour as the bestowing of a righteous Ruler on them:
An expression parallel hereunto occurs, Prov. 11. 10.
<hi>When it goeth well with the righteous, the city rejoyceth:</hi>
Commonly the generality of men rejoyce little at the
happiness of good men, but they should rejoyce then,
it is their sin if they do not: so here, the people do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce,
that is, they should rejoyce, and express a grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
sense of the mercy vouchsafed them. A people
should let the world see that the King hath their hearts;
the heart of a nation being a throne to be reserved one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for God and a good King to rule in: we are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
commanded to honour bad Princes, but never
commanded to rejoyce in them.</p>
            <p>Great is the honour God hath now done a nation,
having given them a King who bears his own image
three times over, once as he is a <hi>man,</hi> again as he is a
<hi>Magistrate,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Chron. 9. 8.</note> and a third time as he is a <hi>righteous person:</hi>
would we foretell the fate of a people,<note place="margin">Psal. 109. 6.</note> (foresee what
mercies or judgements God hath in store) let us fix
our eyes much upon these stars,<note place="margin">Isa. 32. 1.</note> the Rulers and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
therein, and their dispositions and affections,
Isa. 1. 26. <hi>I will restore thy judges as at the first, and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:105600:18"/>
thy Counsellours as at the beginning, afterward thou shalt
be called the City of righteousness, the faithful City.</hi> On
the other side, No such signe of ruine to a people as bad
Governours. God had a purpose of wrath against the
Kingdome of Israel, and not one good King had they
in the whole Catalogue.</p>
            <p>The more the Jews sinned, the more God impaired
the goodness and excellency of their government;
Their government was (like that of man in innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy)
a <hi>Theocracie,</hi> God being their Ruler, and immediate
Law-giver: Provoked by their sins, he sets up Kings o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
them, allowed a power little less then absolute: then
<hi>Dukes</hi> who were indeed <hi>ex gente Judaicâ</hi> but in subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to some foreign power or other: Not yet reformed,
they are governed by <hi>Rulers</hi> which were <hi>aliens,</hi> but yet
in their own Land, and with a reservation of some
power to themselves in <hi>Spirituals</hi> and <hi>Civils,</hi> afterward
(they being deaf to the voice of this rod) the <hi>Scepter</hi>
departs from <hi>Iuda,</hi> all form of civil politie is cancell'd,
they scattered over the face of the earth, and left (like
water in a vessel) to take shape, figure, law from that
State or Nation Providence should dispose them in.</p>
            <p>Two things we learn also from this branch of the
Text.</p>
            <p>First,<note place="margin">Use.</note> That there are no such <hi>enemies</hi> to Prince or
people as they, who (by any evil counsels) make a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
               <hi>breach</hi> upon a Princes <hi>righteousness.</hi> Such persons poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
a fountain. A Prince cannot sin at so cheap a rate as
common men: seldom do such Counsellours go to
their graves in peace, sometimes they are given up by
Prince as a Sacrifice to popular fury to expiate their
own guilt: sometimes he disgusts them himself. A
King cannot endure continually to be reproacht and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:105600:19"/>
put to the blush, by that wickedness which the sight of
such persons renews the memory of; and therefore at
last, hates (like <hi>Amnon</hi>) the sight of those by whom
he hath lost the honour of a constant righteousness.
See this truth justified in <hi>Haman,</hi> a wicked Counsellour
to <hi>Ahasuerus,</hi> destroyed by him, <hi>Sejanus</hi> by <hi>Tiberius,
Empson</hi> and <hi>Dudley,</hi> and <hi>Wolsey</hi> under the <hi>Henries,</hi> and
many others occurring in history, burning their fingers
at last, by holding the candle to a Prince, whilst walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in ways of darkness. Hence one well notes, <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum
sibi ad ruinam gradum struit, qui non reveretur con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientiam
Principis:</hi> The first step to ruine, is to bear
no reverence to a Princes Conscience. Worthy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
of a Courtiers remembrance is the counsel of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,
Prov. 28. 23. He that rebuketh a man, afterward
shall finde more favour then he that flattereth with his
lips.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nothing procures a man greater favour with his
Prince (that owns any degree of good Nature) then

gotten in a Civil War (the <hi>Romans</hi> allowed no Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, we have now great matter of joy, in that we
have <hi>a fixed and established Ruler</hi> over us. We might
be well assured that the Nation was <hi>sick</hi> before, by its
shifting of sides so often, and never continuing long
in one posture of Government; (an evil too big for
any other Teacher to make men understand, but sad
experience.)</p>
            <p>Frequent shifting of Governours is the great punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the sin of a people, <hi>Prov. 28. 2. For the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression
of a Land, many are the Princes thereof: but by a
man of understanding the</hi> (perishing) <hi>State thereof shall
be prolonged:</hi> with this evil God punished the revolted
Kingdom of <hi>Israel,</hi> which had as many Kings (within
one) as the <hi>Kingdom of Iuda,</hi> and yet lasted not much
above half the time thereof: with this judgement God
avenged the bloud of his servants upon the <hi>Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire</hi>
(even the frequent changing of Governours from
<hi>Cesar to Constantine</hi>) by the murdering of them so fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently.</p>
            <p>This is a very great evil upon many accounts, for in
such vicissitudes of Government, there will (of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty)
be fresh favourites, who are never wanting to make
use of such troubled waters to heal their lame fortunes.
In such vicissitudes people never learn the art of <hi>obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Res dura, &amp; regni novitas me talia co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunt, moliri. <hi>Dido in Virg.</hi>
               </note>
nor a Prince the <hi>art of Government,</hi> self-preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
being the mystery chiefly employs his study, in
order whereto he is often prompted to several counsels
ungrateful and disobliging: Laws (in such times) usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:105600:20"/>
lose their force, Rulers letting go these reins of
Government when ready to be thrown out of the sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,
to save themselves from a dangerous fall: God
<hi>rains snares</hi> upon a Nation in such a condition, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
voic't up for Law to day, which shall be Treason to
morrow: besides such times produce abundance of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfied
persons who heated by such violent motions
and turns, catch fire at last, and endanger the peace of
the Nation.</p>
            <p>Matter of joy then we have, in that His Majesties
restauration silenceth all disputes amongst ambitious
spirits, (who shall be greatest?) The Nation before,
did (like <hi>Penelope</hi>) but <hi>texere &amp; retexere</hi> in her Lords
absence in foraign parts, but make and unmake Laws
and Rulers: and there was little observable of <hi>England,</hi>
but what <hi>Solomon</hi> notes of the <hi>locusts, Prov. 30. 27.
The Locusts have no King over them, yet go they forth by
bands;</hi> so, that we should (without our legal and setled
King) go forth so by bands and armies as we did to the
terrour of our Neighbour-Nations. But we hope that
while our Lillies point to the North, they will <hi>labour
and toyl</hi> no more, now that our hearts and prayers
point toward His Majesty, God will bless us with that
rest and consistency which all great bodies (especially
Nations) naturally tend and move unto.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We have matter of joy in that this setled
Ruler is <hi>a King:</hi> The government of <hi>England</hi> now
bears conformity to Gods government of the World,
(it is administred by one.) When God promised to
bless <hi>Abraham,</hi> he doth it thus, <hi>Gen. 17. 6. I will make
Nations of thee, and Kings shall come out of thee:</hi> when
he would bless <hi>Sarai,</hi> he doth it thus (v. 16.) <hi>I will
bless her, and she shall be a mother of Nations, Kings of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:105600:21"/>
people shall be of her;</hi> and when <hi>Ishmael,</hi> v. 20. <hi>Behold
I have blest him, twelve Princes shall he beget:</hi> and he
commanded his own people, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 14. (long before
they came to <hi>Canaan</hi> to set a King over them) hence
the <hi>Iewish Masters</hi> tell us three things were especially
appointed them when they came to <hi>Canaan,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sckickard. de jure Reg c. 1. Theor. 2.</note> to choose
them <hi>a King,</hi> to build God <hi>a Temple,</hi> and to root out the
<hi>Amalekites.</hi> The sin indeed of the <hi>Israelites</hi> was (as
they confest) very great <hi>in asking of a King,</hi> because
they quarrelled with that excellent form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
they were already under,<note place="margin">Jud. 8. 22, 23.</note> in which God was their
King, and Law and Justice administred immediately by
himself, or by persons extraordinarily stird up and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired
by him; a Form of government which good men
(when invited thereto) would never attempt to alter:
and the rejection of this Form of administration will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to be the sin of the people, (and not the bare
asking of a King) upon a diligent comparing of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
1 <hi>Sam. 12. 12. 1 Sam. 8. 7. 1 Sam. 10. 19.
1 Sam.</hi> 8. 20.</p>
            <p>Much might be alledged in commendation of regal
Government, but I shall add but this one consideration
(as having so great affinity with the Text,) It is hard
for a Ruler (in any other Government) to be more then
ordinary <hi>righteous,</hi> and be matter of <hi>rejoycing</hi> to a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
(above others) <hi>sine metu ostracismi<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> nor can the
deserts of a Subject (under another Form) be high and
eminent, but he is more <hi>feared</hi> then <hi>favoured,</hi> oftner
<hi>ruined</hi> then <hi>rewarded</hi> (the envy of the fall of so eminent
a person, proving dangerous to none, being divided
amongst the Many that Rule and Command) and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
it is a considerable commendation of Kingly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration,
that we can say of it, the <hi>Ruler</hi> may do
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:105600:21"/>
good offices with the <hi>fewest fears,</hi> and a <hi>Subject</hi> perform
noble services with the <hi>highest hopes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sure I am this Nation of <hi>England</hi> is of a more noble
and generous spirit then to sit contentedly under any
other then a <hi>Royal</hi> shadow; this was ever our way of
Government.<note place="margin">

in the persons, but none in the Government, till of late
(as indeed we shall finde Monarchies in History lasting
for many hundred years in a Nation, but <hi>Venice</hi> is the
only instance of a <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> which hath continued
a thousand years, and that too for some special rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.)</p>
            <p>Upon this account we have matter of great joy, that
we are now returned to our old Form of Government
(the Nation was like a fish before, <hi>sick</hi> till it came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
where it was first spawn'd.) To those that think
this no such matter of joy, I shall propound the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
that <hi>Abimelech</hi> did to the men of <hi>Sichem, Iudg.
9. 2. Whether is it better for you that all the sons of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubbael</hi>
(which are <hi>threescore and ten persons) reign over
you, or that one reign over you? remember also, that he is
your bone and your flesh.</hi> This government (so highly
abetting that unity which all things tend unto) hath
been received with the greatest expressions of joy in
<hi>Scripture, Num. 23. 21. 1 King. 1. 39. 2 King.</hi> 11. 14.</p>
            <p>3 We have matter of very great joy in that we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
have <hi>a righteous King</hi> to be our Ruler. Our <hi>Elder</hi> is
now like those which stood about the throne, <hi>Rev.</hi> 4. 9.
who were <hi>clothed in white garments</hi> and had <hi>crowns</hi> on
their heads.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:105600:22"/>
We have a King who is <hi>legally righteous:</hi> one born
our King, invading no mans right, standing upon no
mens skulls to be higher then his brethren; He sits
upon the throne of his Fathers, upon a throne that the
law makes his: when God would prescribe the laws of
the King who should be over his own people, He first
provides for the legality of his title, Deut. 17. 15. <hi>Thou
shalt in any wise set him over thee, whom the Lord thy
God shall choose.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this is matter of joy to a nation, because it rolls
away one of the greatest reproaches from it (the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of a fellow subject to usurp the throne of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty.)
The nation before was under the curse of <hi>Cham,</hi>
Gen. 9. 25. being a <hi>servant of servants:</hi>

to sit under the shelter of <hi>a gourd</hi> which came up in <hi>a

(like <hi>Saul</hi>) from among the stuff, (the common sort
of people) Majesty loseth its reverence, 1 Sam. 10. 27.
and a people their safety, Zach. 9. 6.</p>
            <p>Then again, a small measure of charity will warrant
us to stile his Majestie <hi>religiously righteous:</hi> For that
may be said of him which can of no Prince in the world
besides, that he hath had <hi>evils</hi> enough to discover
and improve his <hi>virtues,</hi> and <hi>enemies</hi> (under freedome
and malice too much) to report and greaten his <hi>vices,</hi>
if he had been chargeable with any:<note place="margin">Against viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous persons.</note> 
               <hi>His Majestie</hi> in his
late <hi>Proclamation</hi> hath made a practical commentary on
those words of <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 14. 35. <hi>The Kings fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
is toward a wise servant, but his wrath is against him
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:105600:22"/>
that causeth shame.</hi> Who observeth not his constancy
<hi>in religion?</hi> All His injuries from enemies could not
conquer his <hi>charity,</hi> all the difficulties He beheld be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Himself and his throne, tire out his <hi>hope,</hi> nor yet
any temptations from Rome, stagger <hi>his faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What a <hi>Christian</hi> spirit doth He discover in endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
so many ways <hi>the union</hi> of his people? the
law of love, is once more, become <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>a roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
law,</hi> Jam. 2. 8. His Majesties declarations assure us
that He would not have us (like lines) running all to
one and the same centre, the King; yet never touching
one another, in any hearty love and affection.</p>
            <p>And certainly it is high time for us to think of joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hearts and hands: We well agree in the main, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
and loyaltie,</hi> why should we fall out about <hi>mint
and cummin?</hi> It hath alway been the Devils policy to
set the people of God at variance about circumstances,
how hot were the disputes and contentions in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
times about <hi>meats and drinks?</hi> how high the
animosities in after ages about the time of the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
<hi>of Easter,</hi> the precedence of their Bishops, &amp;c.
and in our own times about matters which (in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
considered) commend no man to God: The
Devil hath alway endeavoured to choke the Church
of God (like <hi>Adrian</hi>) with gnats and flies, disputes
about matters of small moment in religion: oh how
are we benighted that seem yet ignorant of Satans de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices!
It was the infant state of the Church in which
men were set at distance by circumstances. Words that
stand <hi>in regimine</hi> in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> tongue, lose a <hi>letter</hi> or
two and yet no breach is made in the <hi>sense:</hi> truly there
is no thinking we shall stand long (peaceably) <hi>in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gimine,</hi>
in government and order, if superiours and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriors
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:105600:23"/>
be loth to part with some <hi>punctilio's</hi> and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
in their opinions and practises, which may be
done without any breach made upon the <hi>sense</hi> of Creed
or Scripture: The noble, large and ingenuous spirit of
the Gospel will accept men <hi>every where</hi> (as God doth)
Acts 10. 35. for <hi>righteousness</hi> and innocence sake. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
is that rule of the Apostle in matters of indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency,
Rom. 14. 3. <hi>That the strong do not despise the
weak, nor the weak judge and condemn the strong.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to return; this consideration also is a matter of
very great joy to a people, to sit under the wing of so
virtuous a Prince: When Rulers and Kings rise up and
worship the Lord, then <hi>sing O heavens, and be joyfull
O earth,</hi> break forth into singing O mountains. Isa. 49.
7, 13. God hath not done thus to every nation: few
virtuous men, but fewer virtuous Princes: many righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
persons in <hi>sheep-skins</hi> and <hi>goat-skins,</hi> but few in
<hi>Ermines.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here give me leave to pause a little and to take
notice of a considerable (because so rare a) circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
in the happiness of his late <hi>Majesty</hi> of blessed
memory, even the transmitting to posterity so much
of his wisdome and virtue (surviving in his issue.) A
great part of that stock of honour, many an eminent
Monarch hath died possest of, his unworthy son who
succeeded him hath embezelled: <hi>Rehoboam</hi> the impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent

one reason why the fame and memorie of that emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent

fresh and precious after his death, as his virtue (disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
in doing and suffering so much) did merit, <hi>quia

which gave the world no assurance that they were his

reason why <hi>Samuel</hi> was rejected of the <hi>Israelites,</hi>

But to proceed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> His Majesty is more then a Ruler, <hi>He is a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
deliverer to us; from the several evils the nation groaned
under,</hi> evils sufficient for a history: the nation seemed
like that roll, Ezek. 2. 10. <hi>Written within and without
with lamentations and mourning and wo.</hi> What invasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
upon our rights civil and sacred did we long stand
sad spectatours of? We have seen arms, the iron-mole
that stained our religion, and eat out order and law: <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stronomy</hi>
shews us the <hi>Dragons Tayl</hi> placed as near
as may be to <hi>Charles-wayn,</hi> and we beheld the
Embleme too plainly expounded in our own nation;
those which should have been <hi>the tayl and not the
head</hi> (to use the Scripture phrase, Deut. 28. 13.) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading
the throne of Sovereignty; throwing down the
stars (the Nobles and Senatours) to the ground, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
dishonourable abatements into the fairest coats of
arms: we beheld every common bird feathering its
nest from the Eastridge feathers, (the unworthiest
persons inriching themselves with the lands of Princes):

               <hi>Let us
take to our selves the houses of God in possession.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another greater evil then these mentioned, was
this; Our Adversaries had taken away not onely our
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:105600:24"/>
happiness but our innocence,<note place="margin">Job 27. 6.</note> (that which <hi>Iob</hi> when

Psal. 62. 4. <hi>They onely consult to cast him down from his

            <p>Well, his Majesty (under God) is become (in a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
degree) a Deliverer to us from our many evils: now
we understand the words of Solomon, Prov. 16. 15. <hi>The
light of the Kings countenance is life, and his favour</hi>
(nay his presence) <hi>is like a cloud of the latter rain.</hi> Our
case had been wofull, if his Majesty when desired to

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly and lastly, <hi>We have all the assurance we can
ordinarily have that his Majesty shall prove a very happy
and successfull Ruler to us,</hi> To omit many happy omens
and prognosticks of his prosperous reign, as his edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation

much, that I lay them not down as pretending to a
prophetick, or designing to gratifie a secure and supine
spirit, (men are apt enough of themselves after storms
and tossings to fall asleep; pillows need not be sown
under their elbows) <hi>all Gods promises of temporal bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
are but conditional, 1 Sam.</hi> 2. 30. Never any peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
held their happiness by a fairer Charter then <hi>Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Levit. 14. 41, 45.</note>
but yet the plague of sin (after its being scraped
with so many judgements) so far spread in Gods house,
that it was at last so pulled down,<note place="margin">Eccles. 9. 18.</note> that <hi>one stone was not
left upon another: one sinner</hi> (but much more many) <hi>may
destroy much good,</hi> the sins of Prince and people may be
as a winde easily able to scatter this refreshing cloud,
yet no bigger then a mans hand: but I propose these
happy <hi>omens</hi> to let us see what engagement we have to
thankfulness and prayer, (men use to pull cheerfully,
when they perceive the thing coming, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 2.) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
such mollifying considerations may serve to allay
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:105600:25"/>
any swellings and risings which an insensibleness of our
present hopes may possibly occasion.</p>
            <p>First then, A special token for good is this: <hi>It is Gods
usual method to make those Princes most fortunate and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
whose first days he hath most exercised with crosses:</hi>
No Princes in sacred Writ so eminent as <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
whose first days were cloudy and full of evils.
<hi>Lewis</hi> the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>France, Henry</hi> 7<hi rend="sup">h</hi>. of <hi>England</hi> and
Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> were famous in their times for their
justice, prudence and felicity, but withall not unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with closses in their first days:<note place="margin">Vid. Suet in Vit. Aug. Caes.</note> 
               <hi>Augustus Cesar
was one of the best Emperours Rome</hi> had, which was (in
a great measure) due to those five Civil Wars which
exercised his vallour and prudence: we have never
so great security the day will be fair and clear, as when
the Sun riseth in clouds and mists, and at last scatters
them and quits it self of them.</p>
            <q>Nube solet pulsa, candidus ire dies.</q>
            <p>Thus hath it been with Kings, those shine most brightly
in History, whose risings were obscured with a cloud of
crosses and adversities: Affliction in a Kings youth,
doth <hi>fastum detrahere &amp; nervos intendere:</hi> it makes him
humble and vigilant, and so the fitter person for God
to bless,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 26. 16.</note> and sucess to crown: Kings (like <hi>Saul</hi>) lose
their armour and honour, whilst a constant felicity lulls
them asleep: Gold gaineth; but dross loseth by the
furnace, and thus a common servile spirit is broken, or
made desperate by affliction, but the spirit of a King
improves in Wisdom, Courage and Vertue: whereas
it is often seen that Kings glorious in their rise, set in a
cloud, and end their days ingloriously upon one account
or other.</p>
            <p>Now how great His Majesties sufferings have been,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:105600:25"/>
would be (I know) an ungrateful office on such a day
of rejoicing as this, sadly to recount: we could not
know them without our bloud, nor hear them without
our tears.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That usual method God observes in bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the greatest blessings upon his people, was exactly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
in His Majesties restauration: <hi>for,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1 <hi>It was accomplisht without humane means and helps.</hi>
His Majestie was not possest of his Kingdoms till his
Friends had used their outmost power and policie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
him, and his enemies their outmost malice and
cunning to deprive him. We saw a formidable and
successful army scattered without blow,
<q>
                  <l>Et quamvis nullo maculatus sanguine miles,<note place="margin">Psal. 76. 5.</note>
                  </l>
                  <l>Quae potuit fecisse, timet.—</l>
               </q>
The King had been long called <hi>Nullus</hi> in that old Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick
verse (and such, in times of affliction, the eyes
of people are usually much upon) and God did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
him till he was <hi>Nullus</hi> indeed, though in another
sense (as the Devil will always be found a Lyar, even
when he tells truth;) He was <hi>Nullus</hi> in the hopes of
his Friends, <hi>Nullus</hi> as to any present assistances and
powers of his own, <hi>Nullus</hi> in his enemies thoughts and
esteem.</p>
            <p>And then God reinvests him with power and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour;
and thus he useth to bestow his blessings upon
a people,<note place="margin">See Isa. 60. 22.</note> 
               <hi>Deut. 32. 36. The Lord shall repent himself
concerning his servants,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Zach 4. 6.</note> 
               <hi>he will judge his people, when he
seeth that their power is gone,</hi>

               <hi>I looked and there was none to help, therefore mine
own arm brought salvation.</hi> Thus is <hi>England</hi> saved and
His Majestie restored, alone by the <hi>arm of God made
bare</hi> (devested of all humane assistance) now God doth
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:105600:26"/>
not use <hi>magno conatu nihil agere,</hi> when things come to
us in a manner extraordinary, we naturally expect great
matters.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2 <hi>His Majesties restauration was after a long night of
misery and affliction upon the Nation:</hi> We had written
<hi>Ichabod</hi> upon Church and State:<note place="margin">Hag. 2. 7.</note> 
               <hi>I will shake the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land, I will
shake all Nations, and then the desire of all Nations shall
come,</hi> (sore throws before the birth.) Thus God shook
our heaven and our earth,<note place="margin">Dan 12. 1.</note> (our Church and State) he
shook all the three Nations,<note place="margin">Ezek. 37. 11.</note> and then His Majestie
(their true desire) is restored:<note place="margin">Dan. 9. 25.</note> Religion and peace (like
<hi>Abrahams</hi> sacrifice) are usually intangled in a thicket,<note place="margin">Psal. 104. 3.</note>
before they are laid upon Gods altar; commonly given
in after many incumbrances and difficulties, the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners
of them.</p>
            <p>It is the speech of God concerning the husbandman,
<hi>Isa. 28. 24, 25. Doth the husbandman plough all day to
sow, doth he open and break the clods of his ground, when
he hath made plain the face thereof, doth he not cast abroad
the fitches, and scatter the cummin, and cast in the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
wheat?</hi> Surely if the husbandman will do thus, God,
after he hath suffered the ploughers to make long fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
on the back of the Church (as the Psalmist speaks,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 129. 3.) will at last cast in his precious seed.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
               <hi>The afflictions of Prince and people, separated from each
other, have been great enough to endear each to other:</hi> we
have found that head and members, when parted, both
bleed,<note place="margin">Sen de Clem.</note> and that <hi>ut Regi viribus opus est, ità &amp; populo
capite.</hi> Should I now dwell upon our Soveraigns crosses,
I could justifie my self by the example of the Holy
Ghost more largely relating the sufferings of Job (yet a
Prince too) then <hi>Solomons</hi> greatness and splendour:<note place="margin">Job. 29. 25.</note>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:105600:26"/>
but these the world is a witness to, as it is of an Eclipse
of the Sun.</p>
            <p>As for the Nation, never was that more eclipsed and
fuller of darkness, then, when (like the Moon) in most
direct opposition against our Sun (our lawful Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign.)
Our <hi>Moses</hi> rod was no sooner vilely thrown to
the ground (his power usurped by the populacy) but
it became a serpent to sting and afflict us. Very guilty
indeed the Nation hath formerly been of opposition
against Kings. The <hi>Scotch</hi> History mentions about 50
of their Kings deposed or imprisoned, or falling by the
hand of violence; and a learned Antiquary had (some
years since) computed 30 several rebellions in <hi>England,</hi>
since the Conquest. If any shall account the mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so known a matter a discovery of the nakedness of
my mother Country, I shall acquit my self by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of <hi>Ezra</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Nehem. 9.</note> confessing the sins of
their people in the day of their return from the captivity,
<hi>Ezra</hi> 9. 7. But I hope that experience will teach us now
to value His Majestie, if not for his Vertue, for his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity:
It is seldom the croud of men learn any thing
by Aphorisms and politick Lectures,<note place="margin">Job. 41. 8.</note> but <hi>stripes enter
into fools,</hi> and (I hope) as the phrase is in <hi>Job,</hi> we shall
<hi>remember the battle and do so no more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>His Majesty is greatly propense, humbly to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
ascribe the honour of his restitution to the divine bounty
and wisdom, in his publick declarations, and more private
religious expressions.</hi> Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi> was pleased once

God is most especially jealous of Pride in Princes: the

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Another good omen of His Majesties happy
reign, is this, there meet most eminently in him, those two
things which establish the throne, and they are Mercy and
Truth: Prov. 20. 28. Mercy and Truth preserve the
King, and his throne is established by Mercy. <hi>Hence</hi> David
<hi>prays for the King thus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 16. 5.</note> Psal. 61. 7. O prepare Mercy
and Truth which may preserve him: Solomon <hi>especially
recommends these two to his son</hi> Rehoboam, Prov. 3. 3, 4.
Let not Mercy and Truth forsake thee so shalt thou finde fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
in the sight of God and man: <hi>(These two (be it
spoken with reverence) uphold the throne of God
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:105600:27"/>
and therefore God especially upholds them,</hi> Psal. 25. 10.
Psal. 108. 4.)</p>
            <p>A Statesman would have said, that <hi>Policie</hi> and <hi>Power</hi>
preserve the King: No, the Wise man (who best
knew) tells us they are <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Truth:</hi> and with
good reason, for there are no two things so contrary to
the end and to the continuance of government, as <hi>cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
and <hi>treachery:</hi> such a Prince as hath both these meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in him, hath lost the two cheif instruments of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and they are <hi>amor &amp; fides</hi> (love and trust) for no
man can love that Prince who owns no mercie, nor trust
him that regards not truth, and it will be hard to recount
many cruel and treacherous Princes, happy and fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.<note place="margin">1 <hi>King.</hi> 12. 7. Temperatus timor cohibet (populum) as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siduus in vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictam exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat. <hi>Sen. de Clem.</hi>
               </note>
None ever counted it a Princes <hi>honour</hi> to rule
over men as they do over beasts (meerly by fear,) and
the experience of all times hath proved it not to be his
<hi>policie: Semper metuet quem saeva pudebunt,</hi> was a <hi>poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tica
licentia,</hi> which a wise Prince will never warrant him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in. If executions be few, they will be charged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the merit of the persons;<note place="margin">Lucan. lib. 8.</note> if frequent, upon the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
disposition, then which nothing renders him more
ungratefull, man being naturally a compassionate crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>But it is not <hi>mercy</hi> alone, will establish a throne, there
must be <hi>truth</hi> too,<note place="margin">Prov. 17. 7.</note> fidelity, open-heartedness, <hi>He must not
be</hi> made up <hi>totus ex artibus.</hi> Princes which (like-<hi>Absalom</hi>)
kiss all men alike, seldom succeed happily, because they
occasion the disappointment of so many (which a man
cannot so well bear as an expected injury.) Cruelty and
Treachery have gotten many a Throne, but they have
establisht none.</p>
            <p>Now both these meet most eminently in our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign:
<hi>Mercy,</hi> though provoked more then ever Prince
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:105600:28"/>
was, he was not <hi>(in natali imperii)</hi> born like <hi>Esau,</hi> all
over red with the bloud of those who had forfeited
their lives to his justice; but his first and great (I may
now add, frequentest) request to the Houses was, that
the <hi>Act of Indemnity</hi> might be as speedily and as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensively
drawn up as might be: His Majestie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
himself with the submission of his adversaries:
<q>Poenaeque genus vidisse precantes.</q>
The fears and jealousies of guilty minds (no question)
represented His Majestie (as vapours do the rising Sun)
of a bloudy colour and disposition; but he hath defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not only the hopes but the fears of his adversaries,
by shewing his greatness (as God whose Viceroy he is)
even by <hi>pardoning</hi> and forgiving offences.<note place="margin">Num. 14. 17.</note> And His
Majesties whole demeanour assures us, that this clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
is <hi>virtus Personae,</hi>

               <hi>I believe never

he deals justly with all men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall close this fifth particular, by superadding this
one observation:<note place="margin">De Gub. Dei, l. 7.</note> It is Gods usual method to suppress
and expel a power or people guiltie of such or such a
vice, by persons eminent for the contrary vertue. Thus
<hi>Salvian</hi> takes notice how God punisht the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:105600:28"/>
(a lascivious people) by the <hi>Vandals,</hi> a Nation eminent
for their chastity and temperance; so the <hi>Persians</hi> (a
luxurious and riotous generation) He overthrew by the
<hi>Macedonians,</hi> eminent (at that time) for their abstinence
and moderation in diet: and thus God now useth his
Majesty to succeed and suppress persons lately in power
highly challengeable for the want of Mercy and Truth:
<hi>Mercy,</hi> we might be well assured they were never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
to build Gods Temple, there was such a noise of
fatal Axes continually heard in the Nation: <hi>Truth,</hi>
breaking all the bands (like the possest man) of Oaths
and Covenants wherewithall they had been bound: the
character of <hi>England</hi> at that time we might finde in
<hi>Isa. 59. 14. Iudgement was turned away backward, and
Justice stood afar off, Truth was fallen in the streets, and
Equity could not enter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixthly, Another <hi>token for good</hi> is this, <hi>After great <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
distractions and confusions long in a nation, God usually
sets upon the throne Princes eminent for success, wisdome
and courage.</hi> When a nation is full of distraction and
confusion, God generally takes one of these three
courses with it. 1. He sometimes <hi>leavs it in confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
suffers the people to be without any settled form
of government, and to hold up one another till he cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects
all, thus he dealt with the Israelites, Judges 21.
25. When <hi>there was no King in Israel,</hi> but every man
was a law to himself. God sometimes deals by a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(as they did by the ship, Acts 27. 15.) cuts the
cables and anchours that held it, and lets it drive. Or,
2. He sometimes <hi>sets a Tyrant</hi> over it, (as it is an hundred
to one, but when the ill <hi>humours</hi> are in <hi>motion,</hi> they
gather to <hi>an head</hi> at last.) Thus we read <hi>in the Iudges,</hi>
he dealt with his own people. Or, 3. He raiseth up
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:105600:29"/>
               <hi>some eminent person</hi> whom he qualifies with all Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
dispositions for so great a work as the healing of the
breaches in a nation. Thus we finde him raising up
<hi>Moses</hi> after the <hi>Egyptian</hi> oppression, <hi>Gideon</hi> after the
<hi>Midianitish</hi> slavery, <hi>David</hi> after <hi>Sauls</hi> injustice, and
<hi>Nehemiah and Zorobabel</hi> after the <hi>Babilonish</hi> captivity,
to become healers to Israel. Thus <hi>Iulius,</hi> and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus
Cesar,</hi> in the <hi>Romane Empire</hi> were raised up by
God to be repairers of the breaches in that govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
under which Christ was to be born, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<hi>Constantine</hi> as a shadow from the heat of the <hi>ten
Persecutions,</hi> and <hi>Charles the great</hi> in the <hi>West,</hi> and
<hi>Queen Elizabeth</hi> after many changes both in Church
and State, and <hi>Henry the</hi> 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> before her, happily curing
the issue of bloud the nation had so long laboured
under.</p>
            <p>Great and many are the evils which <hi>England</hi> hath
languished under these many years, now to use the
word of <hi>Mordecai</hi> to <hi>Esther,</hi> Esther 4. 14. <hi>Who knows
but his Majesty is come to the Kingdome for such a time
as this.</hi> God hath taken all the forementioned courses
with our discomposed nation; 1. We were left to
the unconstant counsels, and giddy determinations of
those who stiled themselves, <hi>Custodes libertatis,</hi> (it
would pose a wise man, to tell who they were) some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
this party,<note place="margin">1 King. 1. 5.</note> sometime another pretended to the
title of the supreme authority of the nation. 2. Then
he set over us, a person that like <hi>Adonijah</hi> got him <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots
and horsmen,</hi> and said, <hi>I will reign;</hi> but now we
hope God hath set him over us, whom he will make a
great blessing to this great people; when a nation hath
been under many Rulers <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, how the
state thereof must be prolonged, <hi>Prov.</hi> 38. 2. even by the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:105600:29"/>
               <hi>advancement of a man</hi> of <hi>understanding,</hi> which we hope
God (according to the method of his providence)
hath now blest us withall, even a man who shall <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store</hi>
again the <hi>Kingdome</hi> to its ancient dignity and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
and the Church to its due honour and discipline.</p>
            <p>If we now lay all these particulars together, we shall
easily, I think, see, what great cause we have to shout
and rejoyce and cry, <hi>God save the King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have hitherto indeavoured to be the <hi>helper</hi> of your
joy, give me leave (in a few words) to be the <hi>directour</hi> of
it, and so conclude. Let us take care that our joy be sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned,
with <hi>sobriety,</hi> with <hi>trembling</hi> and with <hi>religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>With sobriety.</hi> This passion of joy doth very much <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
expose the soul to indecencies, and therefore the greater
need of vigilance; let us not so <hi>dance</hi> before the <hi>ark,</hi> as
to discover our <hi>nakedness,</hi> so as to allow our selves in
any intemperate and unwarrantable transports.</p>
            <p>It had been high indiscretion in <hi>Noah</hi> and his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
when in the <hi>ark,</hi> and perceiving the <hi>Dove</hi> approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with an <hi>alive branch,</hi> to have made such a noise and
lumber, as should have frighted her away: We have
seen the Dove and the olive-branch of mercy &amp; peace,
and settlement after so many tossings and tempests
nearly approaching us, oh let us not fright them away
by our revellings and debauches.<note place="margin">Deut. 12. 13, 14.</note> He that is hardened in
his wickedness after <hi>ten mercies,</hi> (for so give me leave
to account this <hi>unum magnum</hi>) is little better then he
that was hardened in it after <hi>ten judgements.</hi>

            <p>Let our joy be seasoned with <hi>trembling;</hi> this should <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
be the handmaid of all our joy, Psal. 2. 11. <hi>trembling,</hi>
not out of <hi>distrust of God</hi> but <hi>our selves,</hi> not for fear
God will not continue, but that we shall not deserve
our happiness. God forbid, that the <hi>Tree of fortune</hi> (as
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:105600:30"/>
it is called) should be so fairly <hi>blown,</hi> that we might
onely see how great hopes sin is able to <hi>blast.</hi> God
hath threatened an unreformed people, that they should
go out of <hi>one fire,</hi> and another should <hi>devour them,</hi>
Ezek. 15. 7. and hath counselled <hi>England</hi> in <hi>Israel</hi>
long ago, 1 Sam. 12. 24, 25. A bell sounds no longer
then the <hi>tremor partium</hi> is continued, our ears now hear
the joyfull sound of the restoring of <hi>King, Parliament,
liberty, Church, &amp; State,</hi> but this is likely to be continued
no longer then there be a holy <hi>trembling</hi> about us, and a
holy fear of forfeiting our mercies by our sins; A good
<hi>memento Joshua</hi> gave the <hi>Israelites,</hi> Josh. 24. 20. <hi>If you
forsake the Lord, then he will turn and do you hurt after he
hath done you good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Let our joy be seasoned with <hi>devotion;</hi> expressing it
self in these duties.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>In a holy and devout admiration of the wisdome and
counsel of God, in this happy issue of his Providences:</hi> He
that should take but a superficial view of <hi>England,</hi> for
these last years past, would be ready to conclude, a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Providence little concerned therein, that it was a
land (contrary to what is said of Canaan, Deut. 11. 12)
<hi>which God cared not for, and which the eyes of the Lord were
never upon fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the beginning of each year to the end thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then, whoso deliberately observes victory favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
now this party and anon the other, to encourage the
prosecution of the war till God had punished both; the
strange ballancings of parties for the safety of the whole,
the removal of so many persons of power and interest
without power and might, (like great Oaks pulled up by
a hair) the strange state of the nation, being (like a ship on
fire) perishing and sinking in it self, and even then a
fear and a terrour to the nations round about: his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty

friends hopes were almost at an end; finally, the great
ship of the State turned about with a very small helm,
(by means much disproportioned) <hi>whoso is wise and

God <hi>wonderfull in counsel and excellent in working,</hi>

have interested himself in all the counter motions
and seeming casualties we have stood specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours
of.</p>
            <p>Our duty now is to admire the handy work of God,
to come and <hi>behold the works of the Lord, and what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solations
he hath made in the earth,</hi> Psal. 46. 8. We
should not be a nation, <hi>seeing many things but observing
them not,</hi> Isa. 42. 20. What one saith of parables, that
they tend <hi>tum ad involucrum,</hi>

(for the concealment of truth before, and for the
illustration thereof, after they are unfolded) is true of the
many contrary occurrences in the worid; they seem to
obscure a divine Providence, (while in contest and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
they occasion short spirited men to cry out, <hi>Te
facimus Fortuna Deam,</hi> to conceit the world but a kinde
of lottery, &amp; that are no eyes in the <hi>wheels</hi> of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
but in the happy issue and result of all, they
greatly evidence and advance a divine superintendency;
reason being warranted to conclude it excellent wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
which could set so many crooked pieces into so
comely a fabrick, issue so many discords in so sweet a
close, and happy composure in the Church of God:
God gets himself glory when he <hi>hath accomplished his
whole work upon mount Sion,</hi> Isai. 10. 12.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, Let our devotion express it</hi> self in fervent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
prayers for the Nation, and for his Majesty.</p>

but <hi>mistio</hi> is <hi>opus naturae:</hi> Men may compound
things of different nature (clay and iron and silver and
gold, as in Nebuchadnezzars image) but to make a
reall mistion, and incorporation between things, is the
sole prerogative of nature: His Majesty (under God) hath
compounded the people of the nation, and put us into
better form and order,<note place="margin">Non opus est Concilio non syllogismis, ad s<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </note> but God alone can <hi>miscere ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi>
give us <hi>one minde</hi> and <hi>spirit:</hi> books enough have
been written for unity, Scripture calls aloud to us (in
every Epistle almost) to avoid contentions, every one
sees the evil of dividing, our adversaries have confest
our differences but circumstantial, and such as call onely
for a little mutual forbearance: and yet we stand at di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
and our hearts (like stones) ready to fly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
off one from each other after our lying in the fire:
This assures us that the publick fires are not likely to
be quencht but by buckets taken out of the Church
(the fervent prayers thereof.) This expedient the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
(after his holy counsels) useth as his reserve,
Rom. 15. 5. <hi>Now the God of patience and consolation grant
you to be like minded, one toward another.</hi> To engage us
to follow his example, let us consider they are our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions

<hi>if it were possible to live amongst men of
the same opinion with ones self:</hi> Certainly this makes
Christians so weary of the world to see the sons of one
common mother fall out about circumstances, it is
this which makes them so earnestly long to go to that
place, where alone unity in the faith is to be attained,
<hi>heaven:</hi>

claim, to the title of the <hi>Kingdome of heaven,</hi> because
of a greater measure of holiness and unity, obtaining
therein.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In prayers for his Majesty as we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned,
1 Tim. 2. 1, 2. Psal. 72. 15. that God would

1 King 3. 11. <hi>a prosperous reign,</hi> God owns it as his

Isa. 22. 23. let <hi>such a nail</hi> be never so well headed with

of the assemblies</hi> to fasten it, or else it will take but
little hold.</p>
            <p>3. In <hi>praises to God</hi> for all that joy which he hath
been the authour of,<note place="margin">Gen. 8. 20.</note> we should own God as the <hi>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>

Isa. 65. 18. <hi>I create Hierusalem a rejoycing and her people
a joy.</hi> But in such a work as this (the restoring of a
King to his throne) God challengeth the being owned
as the sole authour and contriver of it; Psal. 144. 10. <hi>It
is he that sheweth salvation unto Kings,</hi> Dan. 2. 19. <hi>He
setteth up Kings and pulleth them down,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 21. 3.</note> Dan. 4. 25. Job
12. 18.<note place="margin">Psal. 84. 39.</note> It is especially noted as an eminent instance of
divine power, that God <hi>looseth the bonds of Kings,</hi> and
<hi>girdeth their loins with a girdle;</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp;c.</note> the <hi>Chaldee paraphrast</hi>
and the LXX seem to understand it of Gods bringing
Kings brought low and captivated again to their royal
throne, and his girding them again <hi>regali baltheo:</hi> a thing
often noted in Scripture, as Gods peculiar work: And
to assure us it is so, He sometimes sets up the meanest
persons, and brings down the most mighty and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Monarchs from their throne, 1 Sam. 2. 4, 5. Job
12. 15, 19. Luke 1. 52.</p>
            <p>Let us therefore thankfully own God in this great
work, and pay him the tribute of praise and honour,
let our zeal vent it self in hearty praises to the <hi>God of our
salvation,</hi> and not so much in speaking <hi>Satyrs</hi> against
the authours of our late misery, it being hard to throw
dirt at them, but some of it must light upon our Church
and nation in whose bosome they were so long nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
We may with <hi>Deborah,</hi> Judges 5. 9. say, <hi>our hearts
are towards the wise leaders and captains,</hi> and counsellours,
who were forward in the work, but we must <hi>bless the Lord</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But I am sensible how far this loquacious passion of
joy hath transported me; I shall end all with the words
of the</hi> Psalmist, <hi>Psal.</hi> 72. 18, 19. Blessed be the Lord God of
Israel who onely doth wondrous things, and blessed be his
glorious name for ever, and let the whole earth be filled
with his glory. Amen, and Amen.</p>
