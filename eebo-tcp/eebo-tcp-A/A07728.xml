            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F STVDY HAD GOTEN
me as moch eloquence, as true and
vnfeyned loue of my countrey gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
me cause to lament: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> durst
I boldely say, that there is none so
wycked, none so vnnaturall, none
so farre vnder all the senses of humanitie, but I
coude fully perswade hym, nothynge so moche to
be eschewed, as sedition, none soo worthy all pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyshement,
as they whyche trayterously make of
one nation two, of them that euen now were fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
sodaynly to be vtter ennemies. But seing min
eloquence, whiche I muste nedes graunte to be
very smalle, can not so serue me, as I desyre in so
weighty a mattier, I wyll see what loue, sorowe,
and pitie can do, whiche if they coulde as ernest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
worke, as they be greatte in me, I wolde truste
to make all honeste stomackes to deteste and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre
sedicious traytours. Take awaye the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes
of god, destroye all the lawes of
nature and of man, may not eyther the hygh com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modyties,
that come of mutuall concorde betwene
all the kynges subiectes, and the kynges grace, or
the excedynge damages, that ensue open sedition,
kepe any honest harte, in maynteynynge the one,
and fleinge the other? But in so shamefull an act,
why do I speke of honest hartes? For who is he,
that can thynke him selfe to haue any veyne of an
honeste man, that feareth not god, that loueth not
his countrey, that obeyeth not his prince, that fy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
dothe as moche as he can to pulle away na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb facs="tcp:9831:3"/>
honesty, and al good lawes? What is he that
can say, he is an englyshe man, and that he careth
not, though the welth of Englande be troden vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the foote? A beast he is, a man he can neuer be
iudged, that passeth but on his owne welth &amp; ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
Alas how vnworthy is he to be shaped after
the fourme of a manne, howe vnmete to dwell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge
men, whiche seeth what foloweth sedition,
and yet woll endeuour hym selfe to styrre the qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ette
and obedient hartes of the people to sedition?
He that with hym selfe ernestly ymagineth, howe
moche bloode muste nedes be shedde, what a nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
muste nedes be slayne, howe many good tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
shall be robbed and spoyled, howe many fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
and honeste howseholders shall be vtterly
vndone, howe many gentyll men for lacke of their
rentes shalbe fayn to lay their landes to morgage,
or vtterly to selle them away, howe many honeste
women shall be defiled, howe many virgins raui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed:
He that setteth the blody feld before his eies,
here legges, there heedes, these deadly wounded,
those vtterly deed, is it possible, that any man can
so cast of humanitie, so hate men, that he had lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
haue so many deed, as nedes must die in suche
cruel diuision, than to haue them aliue &amp; his fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des?
If our mooste gratious prince, god saue his
lyfe, and theyrs that so wyshe, had giuen you some
great occasiou, to haue gone from hym: yet to go
agaynst hym and his trewe subiectes, good cause
you can haue none. Howe can ye saye, you fyghte
in a good cause, which in one acte offende so many
<pb facs="tcp:9831:3"/>
of goddis commandementes? Who is he that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
nature hath not taught, to be obeysaunt to his
soueraygne lorde the kynge? Peter, Paule, Christ,
fynally all say, that say well, Obeye thy prince. I
am sory, that Turkes hethen creatures, men caste
away, if Trouthe say truthe, I am sory that they
shoulde so farre excelle vs, in a thynge that onely
perteyneth vnto vs, and lytell or nothing to them,
Obedience is the badge of a trewe christen man.
And be not we ashamed, that the Turke shal sende
for the greattest mans heed in his countreye, and
byd hym leaue the body at home, and fynde theym
here in this so vnreasonable a requeste obediente:
and are we not ashamed, that we beinge demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
a lyttell money, to come with clubbes, bylles,
and bowes, to oppresse hym, in whose defence we
ought all to shede our beste blode. Loke howe Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyd,
whiche was chosen of god to succede Saul
kynge of Israel, trembleth, howe sory he is, that
he had cut a pece of Sauls garment, whiche nowe
ful of iniquitie sought al the wayes that he coude,
to kyll Dauid. Loke vpon the circumstances, Da<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uids
harte was innocent, pure, and cleane, whiche
dyd cutte his vesture for none other intente, but to
shewe his fidelitie vnto hym: and to declare, that
he had oportunitie, and myght haue slayne Saul,
if he had lysted so to do. There was no denne soo
derke, no rocke so vnclymable, no mountayne so
hygh, but kyng Saul wold vp to it, and seke the
dethe of Dauid. An other tyme Saul was a slepe
in his tente, Dauyd commeth in, he myght haue
<pb facs="tcp:9831:4"/>
kylled hym: what dothe he? nothynge but take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
a spere that was at his heed, and a vessell of
water, whiche stode besyde hym. This is the texte.
Dauid cut the typpe of the skirte of Sauls cloke,
and by and by he repented hym, that he had cutte
the kynges vesture, and began to crye, Our lorde
be mercyfull vnto me, that I do no suche thing to
my soueraygne lorde: Our lorde kepe me, that I
neuer lay handes on hym, bycause god hath anoin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted
hym. What is he that canne extende his hande
towarde a kynge, and be innocent? Rede farther.
Thou shalt se, that he which sayd he kylled Saul,
and brought the crowne vnto Dauid, was slayne
by Dauids commaundement. Yet here is more to
be marked. Saul felle on his owne swerde, and
wolde in any case be deed. After this came the son
of Amalachites, and feyned, that he had holpe the
kynge to dye, layinge for his excuse the kynge was
halfe deade and more before, and desyred hym to
ryd hym out of his peyne. Not withstandyng Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid
thought hym worthy to dye, which layd no vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent
handes vppon he kynge, but holpe a kynge
to dye. And whan Dauid harde that Saul was
deade, what lamentation maketh he? how renteth
he is vestures? howe fasteth he, and causeth al his
to faste frome mornynge to nyghte? And doo we
thynke theym not worthye mooste cruelle deathe,
that thus haynouslye robbe and spoyle the kyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
trewe subiectes, and farther mooste bloodely
bent ayenst his hyghnes, comme with a huge and
a riottous army agaynst his capitaynes, to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
<pb facs="tcp:9831:4"/>
of his lawes and common welth? Alas
what vnkyndnes may so kynde and so louynge a
prince recken in these traytours, for whose sakes
and sauegarde of lyues, I dare well say, his grace
wolde haue shedde his bloudde? what vnnatural
hartes? That they shulde for none or smalle cause
runne into suche outragious malyce ageynste his
grace, and foolyshely pretende to hate them onely,
whiche his highnes beste loueth? and nedes muste
beste loue, as longe as suche their vertues, quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
fidelitie so compelleth his grace to do. Who
can iustely blame hym for makynge them greate,
that in dede haue al those thinges, which at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynnynge
of nobilitie only made them noble? But
what meruayle if suche vile &amp; abhominable tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours,
highly hate all those, in whome vertue shy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,
whiche in dede can promote none but suche
as honestie gyueth reputation vnto? It farre pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
Coblers crafte to discusse, what lordes, what
byshops, what counsaylours, what actes statutes
and lawes are mooste mete for a common welthe,
and whose iudgement shuld be beste or worst, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernynge
matters of relygion? Good lorde, is it
possible that suche a nombre of men, shulde caste
them selfe away, there where a Cobler shalbe cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a capitayne? If England coude speake, might
it not say thus? I am one, why doo you make me
twayne? Ye are all myne, howe canne any of you,
where none ought so to do, seke the distruction of
me, my mooste noble and prudente prynce kynge
<hi>HENRY</hi> the, <hi>VIII.</hi> and his trewe subiectes? It
<pb facs="tcp:9831:5"/>
is a shrewde hande that scratcheth out the eyen, a
shreude fote, that for his faute putttih the necke in
ieoperdy. Lyncolneshire thou art a me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre of myn,
I thought if nede had ben, if myne ennemies had
infested me, to haue founde helpe and succour at
thy hand: and thou thus traiterously settest vpon
me? whan meate, whiche shulde kepe the body lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty,
sleeth, what meruayle if hungre kylle many a
one? If thy weapon, whiche shoulde defende the,
fyght ayenst the, what wonder to see an other ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
dagger busy with thy bosome? If Lyncolneshyre
seke to distroye Englande, what wonder is hit, yf
Fraunce and Scotlande sometime haue soughte
to offende me? Alas who canne blame me, if I be
woo, whiche fynde none (I thanke the prudence
of my prynce and his counsayllours) that seeketh
my sorowe, but suche as I haue to longe nourys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
and pampered vp. Lyncolnshire I toke the
for my frende, so dyd the kynge also, and I truste
he woll do ageyne, if thou pourged of these tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours,
hereafter do as thou shalt wyshe thou had<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
nowe done. Thus Englande myght say, and
moche more, which I wyl say for her. If the feare
of god, the loue of the common welth, and loyall
obeysance to our moost gratious prince, had mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
the reste of his subiectes no more thanne they
dyd you, myght not we haue feared, least it shuld
haue chanced vnto vs, as it dyd to them that came
of the serpentes tethe? The fable is not longe, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
feyned without good cause. Cadmus by the
consent of the poetis, kylled a great serpent, whose
<pb facs="tcp:9831:5"/>
teth he was commaunded to sowe in the ground,
of the which sodeynely arose harneist men, a rowe
on the one syde, an nother on the other, whiche
streight fell to gether by the eares, in soo moche
that they were almooste deed, er they were fullye
borne. The poetes wolde declare, that where as
is dissention, bothe the parties go to wracke. But
what nedeth me to vse a fable, whan I maye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
this thynge with so many histories? Fyrste
what brought downe the grekes? or to begynne
somewhat farther, what was the cause that some
tyme the Lacedemoniens were vnder the Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens,
sometyme contrarye? Loke the histories, you
shall euermore for the most parte fynde, that neuer
great realme or common welth hath ben distroyed
without sedition at home. Dissention dissention,
hath bene the ruyne, the venome, the poyson of all
great estates. In so moche that the discorde of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitaynes
onely, ofte tymes put the grekes to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
calamitie. How oft was Athens vexed by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the priuate hatrede betwyxte Aristides and
Themistocles, Cimon and Pericles, Nicias and
Alcibiades their capitaynes? Surely the diuision
of Grece, that is to saye, the Lacedemonyens a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geynste
the Atheniens, the Corinthians and The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans
indifferent, frende to nere nother, made the
Romayns lordes of Grece. Nowe what broughte
downe the Romayns, which were conquerours of
al the hole world wel nygh? Doth not Silla, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,
Cinna, Pompeius, and Cesar seditious citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sins
make almost the ende of the reigne of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maynes
<pb facs="tcp:9831:6"/>
You se in other landes sedition hath ben
euermore the bringer in of al sorowe and mischief.
Hath sedition doone no hurte in Englande? haue
we hadde no experience before nowe? I wolde we
had not, howe be it I truste the kynges grace will
so prudently and gratiously order this, that here
after Englande shall haue lytel feare of insurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
Is there any in Englande, that hathe not
harde of Palme sonday filde, Blacke hethe felde,
and many other, whiche bycause they are almoste
forgoten, I wold no body shuld at any time speke
of theym? I am of Platos mynde, I wolde haue
no histories to make mention of theym, that haue
fought ayenste their countrey. I wolde no sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
shulde be wrytten of, no nor spoken of, I wold

But seinge it is to farre past, and the hurt to gret,

wydowes made they, howe many fatherles chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne,
what bloode they coste vs, fewe be but they

Englande, to infeste vs, neuer dyd hurte, excepte
we were diuided. Iulius Cesar, the best capitayne
that euer the Romaynes hadde, and peraduenture
that euer was, at his fyrste settynge vpon vs, dyd
no man hurte but hym selfe. I praye you see what
opinion he hadde of vs. Rede Paulus Orosius.
where at the fyrst he came but with .lxxx. shyppes,
<pb facs="tcp:9831:6"/>
at his retourninge he came with no lesse than syxe
hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred shippes, furnished with piked souldiours.
And as Cesar hym selfe writeth, Mandubratius,
sonne of the kynge of London, called Imanuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,
stale out of Englande and folowed hym, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge
than at variance with Casseuelaunus kynge

O cruel sedition, O venomus hatred, O vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky

rancour, O blynde &amp; euer hurtfull enuy, O seldom

to make an hole in the shyppe that thou saylest in?
what wylful frowardnes is this, to lese both thyn

the Cobbler be chief captayne. I pray god there be
no polshorne pedlers, I had almost called them by

They can not abyde scripture to com in place,
and beare the rule of religion, as it was wont, and
euer ought to do. But god shal fyght for the kinge
in this behalfe: vnto whom for the settynge out of
his moste holy worde, I dare boldly saye, god is
more bound, if god may be bound to man, than he
is to al the priestes, monkes, friers, cardinals, and
popes that haue ben this fyue hundred yeres. It
was no lesse than a lerned kynges act, to sende the
popes bulles into their owne pastures. To make
of a pope a byshop, whiche is in dede as well both
as one, well sought, nouther of bothe: It was a
princis dede to dryue out him, ayenste whose abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
no man coude open his mouth, peyn of losse
of goodes, lyfe, and honeste fame, thanke be to
their tyrannous decrees, and abomynable lawes,
whiche I might calle lustis, but that I am vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande
well ynoughe. He is gone, but to many of
his lyuerey tarieth styll. I dare say, if it be proued
this sedition to come of them, they wyll not tarye
euer. I speake neuer ayenste the good, bycause I
knowe not where they dwelle. This I knowe
well, the kynges grace for a fewe good, hath suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
an abhomynable sorte of the yuelle raygne to

Haue you any more to say, than they had? Naye,
you haue moche lesse. For they lacked noo matter

(of the which many are among your rout)
do that, that all these, and the better parte of you,

haue we al praied, god sende the kynge such coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saile,
that one daye he maye see goodes that were

Cade, Iacke Strawe, Wyll Wawe, Wat Tyler,

If they be spirituall, that consume the day eyther

we call carnall? It were not honest to vtter al that
the vysitours in their inquysitions brynge home,
that these holy hooded religious haue theym selfe
confessed, and confirmed with the subscription of
theyr owne handes. What thynges can they be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed
of, that confesse suche crimes, as no honest
man can well reherse, nor good man abyde to here?
They shall pardone my shamefastnes, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent

Or what maketh matter, if traytours hate
