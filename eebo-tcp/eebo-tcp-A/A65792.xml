         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>THough I confess</hi> our
Nation is easily affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
<hi>with</hi> the <hi>modes</hi>
of <hi>France,</hi> yet by no means
<hi>would I have</hi> thee mistake this
Paper for <hi>an English PRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VINCIAL
LETTER,</hi> such
keen-edg'd tools may possibly
hereafter come in fashion even
among us too, and for my part
I never shall blame the sharpness
of the <hi>knife,</hi> if the <hi>branch</hi>
it cuts off be <hi>fruitless</hi> and the
<pb facs="tcp:99124:3"/>
season <hi>fit.</hi> But here I would
have thee expect a milder, yet
manly proceeding. A person
who knows himself clearly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent,
whom his Friends and
acquaintance know highly deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
whom all the world
knows eminently learned; a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
whose writings every un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>envious
Reader admires, and
every judicious approver in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably
esteems, finding
himself, by glad experience in
the perusal of his works, grow
still more solidly and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standingly
vertuous: This per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
most injuriously <hi>accus'd</hi> (and
as yet no more then accus'd) af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a long patience, comes now
abroad, seriously to demand a
proof of their <hi>Charge.</hi> If they
<hi>convince,</hi> he promises <hi>satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;</hi>
if not, he expects <hi>it</hi> from
them. A long while they have
rail'd against him, and every
<pb facs="tcp:99124:3"/>
day their clamours still grow
lowder, especially, since his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval
to a farther distance
hath left them free to <hi>their</hi> own
full cry. At last the <hi>noise</hi> has
<hi>wak'd</hi> again this little child of
his, that else might have still
<hi>slept</hi> quietly in its private clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set.
It had indeed before been
particularly shewn to divers of
of the <hi>opposers,</hi> modestly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting
their courage to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it; but its unhappiness is,
that none as yet appears to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
their calumny, and yet
tbey still go on to calumniate. It
therefore now resolves to come
forth in publick, and earnestly
conjure every one into this ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
that they neither raise
themselves any ungrounded
scandal, nor give regard to such
as shall be raised by others, till
this so just, so necessary, a <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge</hi>
be fairly and rationally
<pb facs="tcp:99124:4"/>
answer'd; <hi>desiring them in the
mean while to rest securely
on this safe Dilemma: Either
his Adversaries can maintain
their accusation, and then they
are uncharitable not to do't; or
they cannot, and then they are
uncharitable to accuse. From
both which, that thou maist be
free, is the endeavour of this
paper<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and</hi>

            <opener>
               <salute>HONOURED SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WHilst my Adversaries
were content to
whisper up and
down their grave,
but empty, censures of me, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
confiding, and credulous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
zealous devotes (their proper
Auditory) or, at most, amongst
unlearned men, whose busie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce,
though it direct them now
and then to a large and indulgent
Casuist, yet doth it afford them
litle leasure to consult with true
Divinity; I contented my self like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
to leave them to the applause
of such admirers, looking upon it
as lost time to prepare any Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy.
But their confidence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
now rais'd to that height as
to presume to pour their Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
<pb facs="tcp:99124:5"/>
into your ears whom God
hath blest with a judgment sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly
capable to discern truth,
and an authority fit to bear sway
amongst prudent persons; I can
no longer decline the task, but
humbly offer what I conceive
may suffice to justifie me in your
candid thoughts. If this short
discourse serve to dispel the mist
which hath lately been cast before
your eyes, I shall rejoyce for both
our sakes; if otherwise, for my
own; hoping your charity will
make me see my failings, and
acknowledg them:</p>
            <p>In the first place, my <hi>Doctrine</hi>
is accused of <hi>Heresie,</hi> nor is my
<hi>person</hi> more favorably treated;
but we have heard of old, that it
were impossible in the world to
be innocent, if it were all one to
be accused and to be guilty; That
nature hath furnished us with an
eare for the defendant, as well as
plaintif. This Justice then I beg
of such as are competent judges
in so great a cause; for, in truth, it
belongeth to the supremest courts
<pb facs="tcp:99124:5"/>
of Theologie to censure dogma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Tenets; which office not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,
now-a-daies, the
most ignorant amongst us are the
most ready to usurp.</p>
            <p>To this <hi>Calumny</hi> then I answer,
That if any Doctrine of mine be
found to contradict any authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
constantly acknowledg'd for
infallible in the Catholick Church,
I am ready to disown, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
it; If this profession ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
not a man <hi>Catholick,</hi> or <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox,</hi>
I should be glad to learn
what doth. To speak more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
if we regard the testimonies
of <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> or consent of
<hi>Fathers,</hi> unless I abound there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
more then my opposers; if
perusing the decrees of Councells,
and Popes, we find therin any
thing expresly repugnant to what
I have taught; Lastly, if, in any
one point, I have thwarted the
universal <hi>Practice of the Church,</hi>
let me be esteem'd to have lost the
cause. But withall let me beg this
favour, that where the clear Text
condemns me not, the gloss of
<pb facs="tcp:99124:6"/>
privat Expositors may not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
me guilty. I know no
reason why any <hi>Divine</hi> should
forfeit the right his degree and
quality gives him of interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
because others of the same
Profession dissent from him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The <hi>Practice of the
Church</hi> is urged against me, and
that with lowder noise, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
confidence of victory. But let
them reflect, how many such
Eclesiastical <hi>Practices</hi> have been
layd aside, and obliterated. Who
now a daies administers the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist</hi>
in Baptism to <hi>Infants?</hi>
What is become of the <hi>three</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mersions?
Where shall we see
those so much anciently reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renc'd
solemnities during the
whole Octaves of <hi>Easter</hi> and
<hi>Pentecost?</hi> Is the sacred Host
now received into our hands? Is
it brought home; or carried about
us in our travails? Are both the
kinds or <hi>species</hi> given to the Laity
in publick Festivities? Of all the
<hi>Penitential Canons</hi> what elss re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines
but a faint shadow? Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb facs="tcp:99124:6"/>
for the <hi>Saints</hi> departed is long
since lay'd aside. The decrees of
the Apostolical Synod concerning
blood and suffocated meats are
no where observed. What alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
may we not find in the
election of <hi>Prelates,</hi> and <hi>Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical</hi>
Courts? Finally, in our
<hi>Fasts</hi> and <hi>Vigils?</hi> Did they
throughly weigh all this, they
would not so violently presume,
and confidently proclaim the <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise</hi>
of the <hi>Church</hi> to be an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of <hi>Faith:</hi> They would
perceive that these Practises are
mutable, and consequently can
yeeld no firme foundation of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
            <p>But what is this to my particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
case, who oppose, or controul
no one modern <hi>Ecclesiastical
Practise;</hi> for we are not to think
whatever is generally done by all
Christians must therefore imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly
become an Ecclesiasticall
custome, no more then we are to
conclude that an opinion, or truth,
assented to by all individual Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiks
must needs become an
<pb facs="tcp:99124:7"/>
Article of their Faith; For so
the earth's standing still, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<hi>Columbus</hi> his discovery of
the new world might claim a
place in their Creed. Such cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes
then alone are to be stiled
<hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> as are grounded on
<hi>Ecclesiastical constitutions,</hi> on the
<hi>Canon</hi> Lawes, on the <hi>Rituals,</hi> or
<hi>Ceremonials</hi> used by the whole
Church, not on the Zeal, or fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor
of the multitude: But of
any of these we hear no mention.
The very name of <hi>Practise</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
<hi>Custome</hi> and <hi>prescription,</hi>
and custome has the force of a
law. But none that I know of,
forgets himself so farr as to affirm
that the Practice, whose denyal
he obtrudes on me, induceth a
necessity upon any one of putting
it in execution. To conclude,
they asperse not only mee, but
the Church her self, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth
these concessions to be
<hi>Priviledges,</hi> that is, grants
contrary to the general <hi>Rule</hi> or
<hi>Custome.</hi> Our supream Pastors
call them <hi>Graces,</hi> or <hi>Indulgences</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:99124:7"/>
which my opposers either pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
for customes, and Practises, or
else speak nothing to the purpose.
Thus whilst they seek to calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niate
me, they unawars attaque
the Church, esteeming nothing
so sacred as the satisfaction of
their precipitate passions.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Those, who are not
altogether so fierce against me,
will have my Doctrine not indeed
<hi>Heretical,</hi> but yet neerly <hi>ally'd
to Heresie:</hi> I conjure these men to
tell me what it is to be <hi>near to
Heresie,</hi> and not to blast my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
with specious, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>significant
censures. For, <hi>Truths</hi>
and <hi>falshoods</hi> are indivisible, and
not, like quantity, more or <hi>less</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching.
Yea the sublimest
Truths (if not all) are on each side
closely confind with falsities. The
mystery of the Sacred <hi>Trinity</hi>
hath; on this, the precipice of the
<hi>Tritheit,</hi> on that, of the <hi>Sabellian
Heresie:</hi> you no sooner step out
of the <hi>Orthodox</hi> limits of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation,</hi>
but you are plunged in
the prophane blasphemies of
<pb facs="tcp:99124:8"/>
               <hi>Eutiches</hi> or <hi>Nestorius;</hi> Besides
if to be <hi>of Faith</hi> signifies to be <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd,</hi>
to be <hi>almost</hi> of Faith
will signifie to be <hi>almost</hi> reveal'd,
and to be <hi>near Heresie</hi> will import
the contrary truth to have nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly
escaped <hi>Revelation,</hi> which
for my part let him understand
that can, I shall clear my self
when I comprehend their accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation.</p>
            <p>A fourth Engin, wherewith
they labour to possess and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
weak capacities, is, that <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophical</hi>
controversies admit
what latitude of liberty you please,
but <hi>Theological</hi> ones not so. I
cannot sufficiently admire their
forgetfulness: Was there ever <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi>
whose very <hi>Profession</hi> inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
him not in disputes of <hi>Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?</hi>
Is there an university in the
world wherein such questions are
not treated? What else doe
School-men propose to themseves
but the discussing, and clearing
against Infidels and Hereticks, the
mysteries of our <hi>Faith</hi> by Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of <hi>Nature,</hi> and <hi>Philosophy,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:99124:8"/>
and the illustrating that obscurity
which overshadows them, by the
light and conformity of <hi>Reason,</hi>
to the unspeakable confort of the
Faithful? How then comes that
to be unlawful for me which in all
others is not only allow'd, but
highly commended?</p>
            <p>It were well (say they) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
you containd your self
within the bounds of opinions
generally receiv'd, and presum'd
not to transgresse the dictates of
more ancient School-men. I am
at a loss again, do they conceive
the Dictates of their so much
magnifi'd Masters in Divinity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible?
If they are not, for as
much as yet appeares, error may
happen to be on both sides, since
though truth can be but one, the
mistakes of such as seek it may
be manifold. But according to
this Principle, though both sides
go astray, yet must no charitable
hand hang out a lanthorn to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten
so noble a portion of the
Church as is the School. Surely
<hi>Molina</hi> had other thoughts when

he glori'd in the first discovery of
<hi>Scientia media,</hi> or Gods condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
foresight of our actions,
boasting that St. <hi>Augustin,</hi> and
all the rest of the ancient Fathers
were ignorant thereof; which
bold fancy of his, how eagerly it
hath been since embrac'd (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the brand of <hi>Heresie</hi>
stigmatized thereon by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of St. <hi>Dominick</hi>) the yet
fresh, and uncomposed tumults
of the School suffer us not to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get.</p>
            <p>But they will have us at least
to confess, that where ever the
whole Authority of the School
is engag'd in any one <hi>Opinion,</hi> it
must of necessity be true and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
all opposition. The same
discourse returns again upon them.
That Authority is either <hi>fallible,</hi>
or <hi>infallible;</hi> if <hi>fallible,</hi> then can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
any multitude of Patrons
whatsoever secure it from lyable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to error, and it will appear
impiety to deny the Church a
means of clearing her sight therein?
If it be pretended <hi>infallible,</hi> I ask
<pb facs="tcp:99124:10"/>
whence are we assur'd thereof?
If by any other authority than
their own; let us beg the favour
to see it produc'd; if by their
own only, we shall then submit
when they shall have extricated
themselves out of the maze, or
circle, in which they dance. But,
to proceed; by what means can
we imagin this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
on a suddain immur'd with the
prerogative of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> certitude?
<hi>Philosophers,</hi> besides that of <hi>Faith,</hi>
acknowledg no other then such as
springs from <hi>Demonstration;</hi> of
which kind it hath not been my
fortune to encounter any; when
they offer at it, I shall most wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
listen. It is a received Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im,
that a Doctors Authority
reaches no further than the force
of the reason he brings, can carry
it. If this be verify'd of each
particular, how come they to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
more collectively? Look
upon their own assertions, do they
not define that the Judgment
of <hi>three grave Divines</hi> in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
begets a <hi>probability?</hi> Yet
<pb facs="tcp:99124:11"/>
if I have any reason left me, three
compar'd to many thousands no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
prejudice the universality of
the contrary part; Nay, many
of them have thought and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
that the Judgment even of
<hi>one,</hi> who hath throughly look'd
into a difficult point, may be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to establish a probability
against the opposit multitude.
What then have I or any other of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended,
if, after mature inspection,
we have preferr'd the substance
of <hi>reason</hi> before the shadow of
<hi>popularity?</hi> Adde to this, the
very boast of <hi>universal</hi> consent
of Doctors is altogether vain; who
hath examined the hundreth part
of them? who can dive into the
sentiments of such as have not
written, whose number notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
and authority is far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then theirs who covet to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in print? So that, if you scan
the expression, under the notion
of <hi>all</hi> Doctors, you will find to
be understood a few only, who
bear sway in the Universities;
a handful, God knows, out of a
plentiful Harvest.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:99124:11"/>
They rest not yet satisfy'd, but
accuse me at least of <hi>Indiscretion,</hi>
that, in a Kingdome averse, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
from the Communion of
the Cath. Church, I have printed
a book or two, from which they
conceive <hi>Hereticks</hi> may take occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to reproach us with intestine
<hi>dissentions</hi> in <hi>Religion.</hi> Though
I am not one who challenge the
reputation of <hi>Prudent,</hi> or go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to cleer my self wholly from
all lyableness to the opposit imbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cillity;
yet in in this place I see no
ground for their crimination: do
they not daily hear the Heterodox
party exprobrating the wars which
in Catholick Countries are wag'd
upon the subject of <hi>Efficacious
Grace,</hi> and <hi>Jansenisme?</hi> whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
falls once under the press,
it little imports whether it first see
light here, or in any adjacent
Catholick Country: Take for
proofs the French <hi>Provincial Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;</hi>
not only vulgarly known,
but render'd also into our vulgar
tongue; and truly if I mistake
not, the publishing such truths
<pb facs="tcp:99124:12"/>
is more expedient here then in any
part of the world; nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more importantly conducible
to the reduction of our separatists,
then the discarding superfluous
controversies, and contesting with
them only necessary Doctrines;
without engaging for the uncertain
and wavering opinions of Doctors
as for the Faith deliver'd us by
Christ and his Apostles. We
find by experience, that great
Wits, which over-rule the weaker
capacities, if an assent be crudely
requir'd from them upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt
of sole Authority and
command; without reason, either
for the truth of the thing it self,
or at least for the necessity
of believing it, they reject it with
scorn, and conceive thence an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
aversion: To these the
milk of <hi>reason,</hi> that is, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
of Faith with inferiour
Sciences, must, as much as is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
be prepar'd; which task hath
hitherto been the aim of all my
endeavours. We may observe
every day that disputes undertaken
<pb facs="tcp:99124:12"/>
without these grounds, are doubtful;
and either depend upon the acute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and dexterity of the manager,
or perhaps on pure chance; and most
commonly conclude in wordish and
endless perplexities. All which I
would not have so understood as
though I confess'd my writings
had found no acceptance or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
in Catholick Countries,
for even thence I have receiv'd not
a few congratulations. In fine,
what needs there more to justifie
my printing here, then barely to
say, I must perforce do it where
I live and find supplies sufficient
for such expences as are necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
            <p>They have a quarrel likewise
with the time of my writing, in
affirming, that, in this unhappy
conjuncture when we are already
perplext with several dissensions,
new ones ought, by no means, to
be set on foot. I should take this
reprehension in very good part,
if they went about to compose
those other disorders; but from
the time that an attempt was made
<pb facs="tcp:99124:13"/>
in <hi>Wisbich</hi> Castle to usurp autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
over the Clergy, they have
never ceas'd to contrive and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
against the known rights of
our Church, nor can any sight how
quicksoever foresee the end of those
commotions: so that these truths
were now, or never to be advanced.</p>
            <p>When all these arguments are
spent in vain, at last, they cry out,
that all <hi>Hereticks</hi> took the very
same method I do, in propagat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their pestilent errors; but
they do not particularise in what
precisely this method consists, and
how farr it differs from the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
of Catholick Divines; whence
'tis most impertinent to conclude
that what both <hi>Catholiks,</hi> and <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi>
indifferently do, should be
ill because <hi>Hereticks</hi> do it. But
besides, in my case, it is absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
false. What <hi>Heretick</hi> ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he began to innovate, put
forth a body, or course of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy</hi>
and <hi>Divinity,</hi> thereby to
circumscribe himself within cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taind
limits, and at once to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
his sence concerning all
<pb facs="tcp:99124:13"/>
points of Faith? This is a quite
different method from that of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks;</hi>
they go not thus to work,
but fasten first upon some particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Article, and thence, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
are driven, by the inevitable
necessity of a bad cause, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taind
that with the violation of
others. Besides, <hi>Hereticks</hi> crafti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pick out what the unlearned
and ignorant are apt to applaud,
they pursue the easiest things,
making conventicles their Schools,
women and Laymen their Judges,
which Character whether it be
more appliable to my adversaries,
or me, let those judge who are best
acquainted with our proceedings.</p>
            <p>Thus much, Honoured Sir, I
could not but take the liberty to
say in my own behalf: Nature, and
Equity requiring, that every one
be presum'd good, till he be prov'd
otherwise. Let my opposers then
either demonstrate this my Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie
insufficient, or from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
cease to vent their calumnies
amongst men of so great prudence
and Authority.</p>
