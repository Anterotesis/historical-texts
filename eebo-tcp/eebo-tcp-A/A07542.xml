            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>WHen I had compos'd these unpolish'd lines, and being urg'd by some of my friends, to put

them into the wide world, to shift for themselves; I thought it somewhat an unnaturall part, to turne my new-borne Muse out of doores harbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse being unknowne, lest she should be tost to and fro, with some hollow blast of arrogant breath. Then musing on the many undeserved favours that I have received from your Lordship, which I know not how to requite; I thought of presenting my home-bred Muse to your Honour; being
<pb facs="tcp:13104:3"/>
the first fruits of my poore indeavours in this kinde, and as part of the testimony of my humble service in thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes to your Lordship. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though somewhat discoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, when I considered the greatnesse of your person, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with your worth, and gifts of minde, meeting with learning and pietie, which makes you shine as a fixed Starre in our English region. And then looking backe how unworthy my plaine Muse is
<pb facs="tcp:13104:4"/>
of your Honours acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; But when I considered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, what small and weake indeavours (such which might claime kindred with this of mine) have beene ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of great personages when they have been drawn as a clew from the bowels of love (which I hope your Lordship conceives no lesse of mine.) And the Eagle though shee soares aloft, doth not disdaine to stoope low, and the Sunne that is so glorious, doth not
<pb facs="tcp:13104:4"/>
deny his spangled beams, nor cloud his smiling counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance from these infereour darke bodies here below, and that the noblest spirits are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with the humblest mindes (which I have ever found in your Lordship) then my doubts vanisht as the mist before the heate: so I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to present (as here I doe) these lines to your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours protection, Humbly craving your Lordships ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation, that they may beare

                  <head>TO THE READER.</head>
                  <p>WHen first I entertained thoughts of composing a few lines, for my own private use, (having opportunity, more than enough, without begging, or borrowing from other occasions) I did not intend that any (unlesse it were
<pb facs="tcp:13104:6"/>
some familiar friend) should so much as see my melancholly Muse in her closet, much lesse to see her in an open market, especially in so meane a dresse, (it being no other, but that which shee was wrapt in at her first breathing, without altering matter, fashion, or trimming.) But because I kept her not so close, as I might have done, some, which I call friends, have betrayed her, and preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me in my purpose: for shee was seene walking abroad with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out my consent. Thus when I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
<pb facs="tcp:13104:6"/>
that when I gave her an inch, she did take an ell; I sought to restraine her. But ever when she was faultie in this kinde, shee came not home alone, but brought one or other to excuse her, and to plead for her libertie, and so being backt by her acquaintance (which she had got in a short time) shee grew bold; then I conceived, that if I did not give her leave, shee would take it unaskt; then part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for feare, that she might be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, and partly by perswasions, whether willingly, or unwillingly,
<pb facs="tcp:13104:7"/>
I gave consent that shee might come and goe at her pleasure, But withall, charging her that shee should keepe a good decorum, that I by her meanes, might receive no blame.</p>
                  <p>I suppose it is not expected, that she should goe in gaudy attire, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe I desire, that shee should take up any upon trust, nor borrow much, for she hath no necessitie of it; I have not mounted upon Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles wings, nor pierc'd the clouds for words to advance her worth, but in tearmes nearest at hand,
<pb facs="tcp:13104:7"/>
such as I am best acquainted withall, and as any indifferent Reader may well understand. Shee is not adorned onely with leaves, but she beareth fruit too, is blacke frosts hinder not, or wild beasts crop not the branches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it come to maturitie, or a worme ingender in the root; from envious tongues to cause it to wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>If she meet with any that will not afford her a good word, yet let him vouchsafe her a good looke, aud shee will not die in his
<pb facs="tcp:13104:8"/>
debt: wherein she failes (if thou be able to judge) take it in the best sense, she gives occasion, to use thy charitie in conception, in that she sung in winter, her throat might be hoarse, and being the first time that she sung, she would not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine her voice; I make no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, but she can answer for her selfe, to give satisfaction to any reasonable man.</p>
                  <p>But because I have knowne her from her infancie, and seene her behaviour, being alwayes mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest, temperate, sober, loving, and
<pb facs="tcp:13104:8"/>
honest, not apt to flatter or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble, nor yet to hide the faults of her friends, neither censorious, or harsh to any, but to such as doe more than deserve it.</p>
                  <p>I cannot but commend her; and I could wish that shee were grafted upon a better stock: that her fruit might be more pleasant.</p>
                  <p>Shee began to plucke at the wings of Time, but seeing the feathers fal so fast of themselves, she stept upon vanitie, which shee found to be nothing but the ruines of time, so staid not there; then
<pb facs="tcp:13104:9"/>
beeing cloathed in mourning weeds, and in a melancholly hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, with a sad tune, shee sings a Tragedie of Darknesse; but Light comming in, she changeth her note, putting on fresh gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, falles in love with him, and sings his praise. But hee proving somewhat inconstant, here could not make a match, but remaines in promise for after times. But Life being the thing that hath gained such report, and so much desired, she tunes a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie; but finding the miseries
<pb facs="tcp:13104:9"/>
of it breake in here upon her, and that it is not the thing that it is taken for, being full of changes, her concords falls into discords; Then shee sets her selfe against Sinne, the cause of all disorders, having assistants which beares their parts, and the burthen of the song, with the heavenly pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; and hell is forced to sing the base: then being in triumph, she ventures upon Death as a party with Sinne, and gets the day. But finding the day of execution re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed, she frames her songs of
<pb facs="tcp:13104:10"/>
degrees for her friends; to take off their hearts from those dying comforts, and sets them in a way, that they might not out-live their happinesse.</p>
                  <p>The Verses are various in kinde as the subjects are, each one hath his severall. I need not shew, how those that are interwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, doe agree with the bases, and how the couplets are entire, &amp;c. For such that know the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of them already, and for such as doe not, let time and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, teach them; Let those
<pb facs="tcp:13104:10"/>
that are wise, affect matter more than words, but chiefly, that which tends to raise the soule in her flight heaven-ward, which my Muse in her songs desires. Now <hi>I</hi> leave her with you, use her well: shee hath undergone a heavie Presse to gaine your acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, shee will beare her owne charge, she will bee constant to you, her acquaintance will bring you profit, if you turne her not out of doores; howsoever she will speak the best, or say the least of her ill usage.</p>

                  <head>AN ACCIDENTALL Melancholy Vision which occasioned the Poëms.</head>
                  <lg>
                     <l>ME thought I saw, Time, in his speedie course,</l>
                     <l>His sithe new ground, his glasse being almost run,</l>
                     <l>All men did strive in vaine, to breake his force,</l>
                     <l>Tears would not stay him til his work were done,</l>
                     <l>He cut downe all, none could his fury shun.</l>
                     <l>Alas (thought I) he'l take me in his way,</l>
                     <l>My heavie heart, tooke earnest of decay.</l>
                  </lg>

Me thought, all sorts, me company did beare,</l>
                     <l>My eyes did fail, my tongue grew speechlesse to,</l>
                     <l>My eares were stopt, my breath grew short, my feare</l>
                     <l>Did so increase, I knew not what to do:</l>
                     <l>But yet I heard, from whence, or what, or who,</l>
                     <l>I could not tell; my spirits were agast:</l>
                     <l>With world adue, me thought I breath'd my last.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <lg>
                     <l>But yet my spirits were but in a trance,</l>
                     <l>For Darknesse with his mantle spread me ore,</l>
                     <l>With that, I did my courage much advance</l>
                     <l>'Gainst darknesse, yet the combate was so sore</l>
                     <l>That I grew sadder than I was before,</l>
                     <l>But yet thinke I, ile in defiance stand,</l>
                     <l>For I will never be at his command.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <lg>
                     <l>Like one destract, I was o'rewhelm'd a while,</l>
                     <l>With griefe, and care, lest I should lose the day,</l>
                     <l>Then in comes Light, and with a cheerfull smile</l>
                     <l>Revives my spirits: Darknesse slinkes away,</l>
                     <l>So on the sudden, ended was the fray.</l>
                     <l>Light shin'd a while, but what will <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

                        </gap> ever?</l>

Then light began, much like a pleasant spring,</l>
                     <l>My heart grew warme, I had the sense of it:</l>
                     <l>The winters past (thought I) now birds dosing,</l>
                     <l>Why should I thus now melancholly sit?</l>
                     <l>Come, come, rejoyce, I hold it very fit.</l>
                     <l>I was on suddain ravisht in my soule,</l>
                     <l>But that which follow'd, did my joyes controule.</l>

                  <lg>
                     <l>For life brought Care, she lookt on me so strange,</l>
                     <l>Best things below, doe prove but pleasing toyes,</l>
                     <l>I found his friendship subject still to change,</l>
                     <l>Worm-eaten pleasures, breeds uncertain joyes,</l>

I turn'd about, and law sin was in hold,</l>
                     <l>Nay now (thought I) Ile have of sin my will,</l>
                     <l>Seeing that he was so impudent and bold,</l>
                     <l>To tempt me by his promises to ill:</l>
                     <l>The soules of many he doth daily spill.</l>
                     <l>I gave my voyce against him; by and by,</l>

                     <l>To tune my soule, and strike the pleasant string.</l>
                     <l>But Death peept in, which more ill newes did bring.</l>
                     <l>What must I die? is all my labour lost?</l>
                     <l>Sin set him on, seeing he by me was crost.</l>

                  <lg>
                     <l>But yet resolving, while I had my life,</l>
                     <l>To try an action, so my cause was tried;</l>
                     <l>And Death was cast, which ended all my strife.</l>
                     <l>But then the Divell, he could not abide,</l>
                     <l>That sin, and death, should die: for then his pride,</l>
                     <l>Would be abated; so he got them quit:</l>
                     <l>Now farewell world, I must into the pie.</l>

But then at last, I found another shift,</l>
                     <l>I slighted death, and thought on heaven above,</l>
                     <l>I thought it best, to make it still my drift,</l>
                     <l>To get the sense of Gods eternall love: </l>
                     <l>Me thought'twas brought me by the heav'nly Dove:</l>
                     <l>And musing of him when he was ascended,</l>
                     <l>And what he brought; so was my Vision ended.</l>

                     <head>The alluring nature of sinne.</head>
                     <l>When sinne with heavens Angels found successe,</l>
                     <l>And since that time (on earth) hath found no lesse,</l>
                     <l>It goes on still, to bring men downe to hell,</l>
                     <l>Where Sathan is, which once above did dwell,</l>
                     <l>Yet for reward, doth promise much content,</l>
                     <l>So serpent like, it doth men circumvent.</l>
                     <l>Sinne first begins, much like a rubbing sore,</l>
                     <l>A little give, that little cals for more.</l>
                     <l>Thus many littles doe rise to a summe,</l>
                     <l>And so insnar'd from sin, then few do come.</l>
                     <l>Man loves his sin, but sin returnes him hate,</l>
                     <l>Man bids a price, but sin holds up its rate.</l>
                     <l>Man gives his hand, his eye, or any part,</l>
                     <l>All will not serve, till sin hath got the heart.</l>
                     <l>What think'st thou me (saith sin) to be so base,</l>
                     <l>That give delight, to any of that race?</l>
                     <l>That doth me love, and tread my pleasant wayes,</l>
                     <l>Ile give thee mirth, come now fulfill my joyes.</l>
                     <l>If rich thou wilt, then rich thou sure shalt be,</l>

                     <l>And as he findes his swellings to arise,</l>

                     <l>But (fearfull) Death did stare him in the face,</l>
                     <l>And did his glory, utterly disgrace</l>
                     <l>His name was fearfull, and men at it bend,</l>
                     <l>The thoughts of Death brought forth untimely end</l>
                     <l>To some; the rest that liv'd the course of nature,</l>
                     <l>The feare of him did weaken so their stature,</l>
                     <l>That when he came, he had not much to doe,</l>
                     <l>Halfe dead before, for they were sinfull too,</l>
                     <l>And captives like, he chain'd them in the grave,</l>

                        <pb facs="tcp:13104:100"/>
A man so cruell as it doth appeare,</l>
                     <l>Men durst not aske, he kept them so in feare,</l>
                     <l>He scorn'd to take a courtesie from any,</l>
                     <l>Nor did regard their teares, though nere so many.</l>
                     <l>The old mans plaint he never did regard:</l>
                     <l>The strong mans valour, with death did reward.</l>
                     <l>The young mans person never did respect,</l>
                     <l>The infants smiling ever did neglect.</l>
                     <l>The virgins beauty he did still defie,</l>
                     <l>The fathers griefe he slighteth presently:</l>
                     <l>The mothers weeping he did still disable,</l>
                     <l>Although she mist her children at the table:</l>
                     <l>The childe though kneeling, begs life for his father.</l>
                     <l>Then death in fury, saith he'l have him rather,</l>
                     <l>The loving daughter seekes life for her mother,</l>
                     <l>But death lookes in, and cries, give me another.</l>
                     <l>The masters cares considers not a whit,</l>
                     <l>The servants paines with death, so payes he it.</l>
                     <l>The Bridegroomes joy he turneth into sorrow,</l>
                     <l>The Brides delight, today, he spoyles tomorrow.</l>
                     <l>Or any one that sueth for his friend,</l>
                     <l>If he grieves much, death brings the sooner end,</l>
                     <l>On him; but helpes him not a jot, but brings,</l>
                     <l>On all men death: and kils all other things.</l>
                     <l>Thy servants Lord, that were by me maintain'd,</l>
                     <l>In all the world, yet death hath all them gain'd:</l>
                     <l>And while they had a being here on earth,</l>
                     <l>They trouble had: but seldome knew what mirth</l>

Did meane: yea some of them that I am sure,</l>
                     <l>Through feare of death, a bondage did endure.</l>
                     <l>At home, abroad, or ever where they went,</l>
                     <l>They still did thinke, his bow was ever bent:</l>
                     <l>No comfort in the world then did they take,</l>
                     <l>Of any thing that God did for them make.</l>
                     <l>I was to them aburthen, yet they call,</l>
                     <l>For joy: but then the King of feare spoyl'd all,</l>
                     <l>And fresh disco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fort brought into their harts,</l>
                     <l>Frighting their mindes; death breeds such inward smarts</l>
                     <l>The thoughts of death bring out the guilt of sin,</l>
                     <l>Annoye without, distemper all within,</l>
                     <l>And to this day, it is his practice still,</l>
                     <l>With darts of death the bloud of all to spill.</l>
                     <l>Where as he findes me, he doth hate me so,</l>
                     <l>His venome spits; and is a cruell foe,</l>
                     <l>The birds, the beasts, the fish, all that have sense,</l>
                     <l>A suit of death against him doth commence,</l>
                     <l>And he by might doth ever get the day,</l>
                     <l>And as his right he takes them all away,</l>
                     <l>The plants that live a bare life and no more,</l>
                     <l>Scarce men can see life in them, 'tis so poore,</l>
                     <l>Death findes it out, as plainly doth appeare,</l>
                     <l>And kils their fruit, some once, some twice a yeare:</l>
                     <l>At last the stock to death must give a place,</l>
                     <l>For fruit and stocke death doth at last disgrace.</l>
                     <l>Nay, if there were of persons, or of things,</l>
                     <l>A world of millions more, he'd use his stings.</l>

Till all were gone, if thou didst not restraine,</l>
                     <l>His power; then still like a King he'd raigne,</l>
                     <l>The more he slayes the more he doth desire,</l>
                     <l>The lower men are, he is rais'd the higher.</l>
                     <l>He hath confest the ruine of mans life,</l>

                     <l>Hath been betwixt us, ever since the first,</l>
                     <l>I doe perceive; he for mans bloud doth thirst,</l>

                     <l>What have I done, that death should envie me?</l>
                     <l>Was I not made, to quicken men by thee?</l>
                     <l>Why then should death a greater power have,</l>
                     <l>I being free, to make me like a slave?</l>
                     <l>If I doe ill, correct me with thy hand,</l>
                     <l>But why should Death have me at his command?</l>
                     <l>Death had his being at the first by sinne,</l>
                     <l>And as a vassall to him still hath been.</l>
                     <l>Sinne goes before, then Death he takes his place,</l>
                     <l>They both conspire against mans living race,</l>
