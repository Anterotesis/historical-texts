            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Phanatical-Tenderness,
OR THE
CHARITY
OF THE
Nonconformists, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>I Have been long perswaded to Publish to the World the barbarous usage and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solent
behaviour of the malitious Nonconformists of the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>Bristol</hi> (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Faction) toward me the space of twenty years past, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as they acted under the pretence of <hi>Religion,</hi> with a barefaced contempt of
<hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Laws</hi> established, or as they privately suborned their Instruments
under pretensions of Legal Proceedings. I hitherto desisted, not thinking it meet to add
weight to the sorrows which opprest good men, while they beheld their most beaute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and dear <hi>Mother</hi> torn and bespattered by tender Consciences, &amp; men breathing out
nothing but Zeal and Purity. But when these Fits of rude Zeal, not curable by the
Gentle Means, which had been long administred, brake out into open madness, and
needing severer Remedies, the Patients are reduced to an unwilling Submission, I
would gladly in Peace thank <hi>God</hi> for confirming his great <hi>Mercies</hi> of <hi>Restauration,</hi> with
these signal ones of <hi>His Most Sacred Majesties</hi> and our admired and envied <hi>Churches</hi>
Preservation. To my attainment of this Peace, I thought nothing more conducing
than a Publication of the practices of these men upon my <hi>Reputation, Estate,</hi> and <hi>Person.</hi>
My Verbal Relations have seemed incredible to many; I will therefore exhibit in Print
the Actions, the Actors, the Times and Circumstances, with that ingenious Fidelity
which becomes a <hi>Clergyman</hi> and a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> aggravating or heightning nothing out of
Passion, but so sincerely and nakedly delivering each passage, that my bitterest enemies
shall not be able to contradict; or if to contradict, yet not to j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>stifie me guilty of any
Error, unless in sparing them through forgetfulness of some of their many injuries.</p>
            <p>Those, which blacken the first Pages, are not so amazing as them standing at the foot
of the Catalogue, no wickedness being fully audacious in an instant, but strengthned
by Time and Counsel, and growing by Success. Yet have they, among many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discerning
Tempers, been received and allowed as sufficient Cause of Justification for
what did follow of a more violent Nature. Calumnies indeed some of them are, and
therefore not of themselves matter of complaint in the judgement of one, who would
be esteemed a man; but as they moved forward the most fatal Engines of Cruely, I
conceived that they ought in order to take place in this account. The most eminent
Sufferers, whom the World hath seen to fall under the rage of a Faction Confederate
as Religious, had the Guardes of their Allies and Subjects affections first weakned by
poysonous infusions, and their good Opinion subverted. <hi>Speak aluod, render him odious,
and you render him helpless,</hi> said <hi>Harison</hi> the <hi>Machiavillian Mouth</hi> of a Traiterous
Council in Consultation against a <hi>Most Gracious Soveraign.</hi> Prejudices entertained
obstruct scrutiny into the Quality of an Enemies Practices, and ill Actions are sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
blamed, when done to a Person supposed to be ill deserving. And the more
numerous the Party is, which designs against any man, the more innumerable shall
his crimes be, his very innocence and care swelling the list of accusations. Names
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49426:4"/>
are here plainly used, this Publication requiring it as necessary, but not with intent to
asperse any. For as the Actions were manifest in the Places where Acted, so must the
Names be in those other Places, it which it's desired that the Deeds should be known.
And as their Hearts could imagine, and their Tongues and Hands prosecure evil with
delight, so I may conjecture, that according to the custom of other Debauches, these
will be so fat from taking offence at the Particularities of my Pen, that they will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

rejoyce and glory in the Repetition, as an opportunity of new acting them. The
Adversaries base Temper shall not be gratified by any king of Confornity with them
in Obloquy; but seeing they would not but be guilty of the Commissions, I must (though
I pity them and blush at it) proceed in the Relation. In the recital of the last Passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
(I confess) I blame my self, not for any thing unduly represented, but that I have
not retained that Patience in Penning which I had in Sustaining them. But I entreat
those sharp Judgements (whom nevertheless the <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>Loyalty</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> doth
sweeteh) that observe discomposures, to pardon the imbecilities occasioned by a renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

the Salary whereof was then but ten pounds yearly, where nevertheless his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
became indifferently plentiful by the frequency of Persons Sons of Quality sent to
him from diverse Parts to be disciplined; but especially by the bountiful support of the
never to be forgotten most Loyal and Pious Lord Viscount <hi>Scudamore,</hi> of <hi>Holme-Lacy</hi> in
<hi>Herefordshire,</hi> and of <hi>Iames Scudamore</hi> of <hi>Ballingham</hi> in the same County Esquire. Here his
especial care (not to speak immodestly of others committed to his charge) was to insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
to his Sons, <hi>That the Institutions of the Church of</hi> England <hi>were above any purely
Primitive, and most rationally accommodated to the benefit of the Present Age, replete
with the most lively excitements to Faith and Holiness, and only such as could make men happy
in their Temporal Concerns, establishing their Welfare in Peace by an undisputable Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to their Lawful Prince,</hi> and other daily Discourses tending to the Confirmation of
our Minds in these Perswasions. About the beginning of the year fifty five, the most
bloody Regicide <hi>Oliver</hi> publishing an Edict, <hi>That no sequestred Minister, refusing to take
the Engagement, should be tolerated as a Publick Schoolmaster within</hi> England <hi>or</hi> Wales:
My Father was forc't to quit the Employment, but not the House, the <hi>Feoffees</hi> of that
School constituting me Schoolmaster. Within two years after my Father died, not
permitted in this State of Nature, to see the so passionately desired Restauration, but
translated to a better, where after the congratulatory Hymns of <hi>Cherubim</hi> and <hi>Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phim,</hi>
he makes one in the <hi>Triumphant Chorus,</hi> rejoycing for our Felicity.</p>
            <p>But here began my Conflict with those Holy Men, whom an Infernal Inspiration
had Sanctified, and made the Worlds hopeful Guides to Eternity. For in a short time
after one <hi>Fawcet</hi> (who had been a eminent Covenanter and Pulpit Instigator to Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
and was sent down by the Company of <hi>Haberdashers,</hi> to be <hi>Lecturer</hi> at <hi>Newland</hi>
aforesaid) and one <hi>Bromidge</hi> (a <hi>London Brazier,</hi> Father to the late <hi>Sheriff Pilkintons</hi>
Wise, but purchasing an Estate in the Parish of <hi>Newland,</hi> and dwelling there) a zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
<hi>Covenanter,</hi> also used diverse Stratagems, encouraged by the imbecillity of my
years and judgement to Kid-nap me over to their leud and disloyal Principles. But
<hi>God's</hi> blessings upon my Fathers Instructions had fortified me against this danger, and
my Youth was sufficient to answer Arguments, the strength of which I have alway
thought to consist more in the invincible Malice and Perverseness of their Minds, than
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49426:4"/>
any Reasons that Party did ever produce. This Project of Proselyting me into an
Uncooth, Rude, and Rebellious Religion failing, the Reader (I suppose) conjectures
the Consequence, That nothing calm or suitable to Christian Perswasion would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
but Violence take place where Consent was not obtained. Therefore they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
by all possible means to prevail with the <hi>Feeffees</hi> of the School to eject me; but
my Fathers memory (with peradventure some other sansfactions) in the Chief of
them so overruled, that nothing more than the appearance of some snarling teeth was
done to my Prejudice. But when <hi>God</hi> was pleased to smile, and reinstate us in the Frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a just and free subjection to the <hi>Vndoubted Heir</hi> to these <hi>Crowns,</hi> the most Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
of <hi>Kings</hi> (eligible above all men, were our Condition to that degree unfortunate
as to have the Scepter Elective) and by his reestablishment to bring us to his <hi>Sacred
House</hi> and <hi>Altar,</hi> there to rejoyce with the thankful who kept Holy-day, then did
these Snaps of Sedition retire into silence ashamed of their devices. At this School, and in
serving the Cure of St. <hi>Briavils</hi> (having entred into <hi>Holy Orders</hi> soon after His <hi>Majesties</hi>
Return) I continued untill after the <hi>Bartholomew Act,</hi> when the Viccaridge of St. <hi>Philip</hi>
and <hi>Iacob,</hi> in the City of <hi>Bristol</hi> became void by the Non-Subscription and Conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Edward Hancock</hi> acting as Incumbent there. To the acceptance of this Church I
was invited by Mr. <hi>Nathaniel Cale,</hi> (my Fathers intimate Friend) <hi>Mayor</hi> of <hi>Bristol</hi> that
year, Mr. <hi>Henry Iones</hi> then Rector of St. <hi>Stephens</hi> in <hi>Bristol</hi> and diverse others. In which
Vicaridge, as soon as I was s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tled, the Factious Parties began to practice against me
without any provocation, more than my exactness of Conformity, which I must boast my
self to admire in others, and alway strictly to have enjoyned to my self) having not
time to know Persons or enquire into Dispositions, had my Inclinations otherwise led
me. Within the space of four or five days (at the utmost) after my Induction came
seven Men (of whom I knew but one to my Lodgings, with much smoothness and
expressions of respect, desiring to be known to me, as being Parishioners and Vestry-men;
and after some short discourse had in my Chamber, desired me to receive a Treat from
them at the <hi>Kings Arms</hi> in <hi>Christmas-street,</hi> then a Tavern. Where after a small sitting,
their ill looks and affected words sufficiently instructed me what the men were; but every
second or third man very kindly presented me with Service and a Glass. The Company
being-suspitious, the Treat could not be pleasant; but taking my leave, they importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
me with a sort of unusual Complements to a longer stay, which I refused. Two
of these were not acquainted with the design, but my retiring so unexpectly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oon cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the others passionately to urge unto the two (Mr. <hi>William Baber</hi> Powdermaker to
King <hi>Charles</hi> the first at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Nicholas Willis</hi> then Churchwardens of that
Parish, and brought along to palliate the others contrivance) who were unwitting of
the Project. That they had discovered their design, <hi>Thomas Edwards</hi> Wheelright and
<hi>Henry Lang</hi> a Sergeman were the principal Actors in this Hony Plot, and raving at
their want of success, could not but divulge it. The next day Mr. <hi>Baber</hi> and Mr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi>
came to acquit themselves to me, and declared all the passages, <hi>viz.</hi> That if they
could have made me drunk, partly by scandal, partly by Articling against me, they did
not question to remove me. Not long after died one <hi>Iames Powel,</hi> who during much
of the time of confusion had been Chamberlain of the City, and alway both a Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of that Execrable Murder of our <hi>Martyred Soveraign,</hi> and violent Persecuter of all
such as he imagined Loyal and Affectionate to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Church. This person (forsooth)
must be buried without Divine Service read at the Interment, because he had sometime
before his death conjured his Relations so to bury him, to which if I consented I should
be liberally gratified. My Answer informed them that I was unacquainted with such
Testaments, and such sorts of Liberality, which was more properly Scandalous Bribery;
and I met the Corps brought to the Churchyard Gate, beginning, according to prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,
the Service for the Occasion: but the Bearers ran forward with such haste, that
it would have given thoughts that their Master had whipt them forward, fearing the
late arrival of his Purchase. Me they violently pluckt aside, and took from me the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
Book,</hi> giving me diverse Blows, together with incredible Scurrilous Language, and
the <hi>Clerke</hi> putting his hand upon the Coffin, using perswasions not to inter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

with Innocent Blood. Alderman <hi>Miles Iackson</hi> and Alderman <hi>Sandy</hi> stood by behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
these violencies, and were not observed with the least word or motion to offer their
Authority towards the curbing them. I complaining to my <hi>Diocesan</hi> of the so unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable
carriage of these men, He immediately sent for Dr. <hi>Gilbert Iones</hi> then <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:49426:5"/>
of the <hi>Diocess,</hi> and commanded him severely to prosecute these Offenders: But
he making me and five more Witnesses to daunce attendance weekly for the space of
above half a year, I never heard more proceeding against them, than these words three se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Court days directed to them; <hi>Gentlemen your business here before me is very foul,
but I will do you all the kindness that I can,</hi> In Conclusion, the good aged <hi>Bishop</hi> was
tired with chiding and threatning, and we with attending, and so our admirable <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor</hi>
punished these <hi>Rioters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These abuses were followed with Scandals of so notorious a nature, that none the
most debaucht Villians could be said to be guilty of greater, and the Abettors tutered
by one <hi>Ralph Farmer</hi> (vulgarly before my living in <hi>Bristol</hi> called <hi>Malitious Farmer)</hi>
who had been first a <hi>Maltster,</hi> then a <hi>Sequestrator,</hi> and lastly, became such a <hi>Minister</hi> as
the times encouraged, and held St. <hi>Nicholas Church,</hi> from which the late Reverend Mr.
<hi>Towgood Dean</hi> of <hi>Bristol</hi> was sequestred. Particularly a Plot was laid for me at the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
of the Daughter of one <hi>Iohn Dowl,</hi> alias <hi>Gotly</hi> (a strange two legged Beast (as I found
afterward) but utterly unknown and unheard of by me before that time) with whom
upon invitation I dined and departed within half an hour after dinner, but could not
deny the promise of coming again to Supper, upon the very earnest importunities of
this <hi>Dowl</hi> with pretence of especial Friends of mine, (whom he named) who had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to be there likewise; I coming at the hour appointed, seeing many disorderly
Persons there, but none of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ose mentioned, took my leave and went home, yet was I
reported to have Danced and drank till past Mid-night, to have been so drunk that
I was not able to go, but to be driven home in a Wheelbarrow. These reports coming
to the before-mentioned Alderman <hi>Cale's</hi> Ears, and he acquainting me of the rumor,
by his advice I convened the Authors before the <hi>Bishop;</hi> having first made my Complaint
to his <hi>Lordship,</hi> and discovered the improbability of receiving Justice from the <hi>Chancellor,</hi>
if I should sue them in the Ecclesiastical Court. The Authors were the said <hi>Iohn
Dowl,</hi> and two other most profligate Persons, whom I had never seen before, <hi>Thomas
Boice</hi> and <hi>Robert Bowen.</hi> With them I also convened the Bridegroom, and divers of
the Brides Relations. <hi>Dowl, Boice,</hi> and <hi>Bowen</hi> were by chance overheard to be advised
by <hi>Ralph Farmer</hi> to speak confidently, and if the <hi>Bishop</hi> should condemn them, yet the
infamy would stick to me. The <hi>Bishop</hi> being informed hereof examined them singly.
They all three agreed in their story alledging what was before spoken; but <hi>Boice</hi> affirmed
that I was there (concerned as is mentioned) till Eleven of the Clock at Night, <hi>Dowl</hi> said till
One, <hi>Bowen</hi> till Two in the Morning. On my side, the <hi>Bridegroom</hi> and the Relations
testified that I departed the House at Seven of the Clock that Night, and that they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
saw nor heard any thing tending to excess or folly of the nature of what his Father-in-law
and the other two declared. Furthermore going home, I was met neer the
Door of my House, at seven of the Clock by three Country Gentlemen, who intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a desire to speak with me, and promised to be with me within an hour; but staying
longer, I was in Bed by nine of the Clock, and scarcely lain down when the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
came and were brought up into my Chamber, and their business being only to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
a Licence, and treat with me concerning the time of Marrying the Persons there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
mentioned, departed. These I brought also and my Servants, who all testified so much;
yet the three found thus malitiously false and (although unknown then to me) long
known to the whole City to be the vilest of Men, sticking at no sort of Rudeness, Lies or
Debauchery, found among the Godly, sober Party, the Credit of Saints and Angels.</p>
            <p>Besides many other contumelious reports, groundless and silly (such as Church-ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
had forged in their extravagant mirth, and used to tell of Parsons even before my
Birth) impudently, packt upon me, for the space of several years; I could not walk
the streets without vollies of scurrilous Terms, and reflections, thrown at me by Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentices,
and Journymen, the Masters standing by and shewing themselves therewith
pleased.</p>
            <p>But my Patience (I thank God) preserved me from the harms intended me by that
sort of Battery, and I was no more afflicted, then so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> as Compassion for their Malice
and Folly, moved me to Sorrow; neither did I forbear passing through any street by
reason of the reproachfulness of the Inhabitants, or gratifie any ill temper by anger, or
so much as turning my head to look upon the Persons of disingenuity. Nevertheless I
was not Ignorant that the ill Characters of my Person, were not the sole aim of their As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persions,
but had learned from the Examples of <hi>Superiors</hi> (at the pedestral of whose Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators
I presumed to stand) that the blackning a Name by Obloquy, made a grand Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
in Ruin.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:49426:5"/>And these were preparatives for justification of Actions to follow, which were fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Arrests of me and my Servants; of my self for words pretended to be spoken, of
which they never stood to the trial, of my servants for the like, and for treading be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the Paths of some of their grounds in their looking after my Tithes. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they dared not stand to a Legal Deremination, yet this was expensive, and
they hoped by continual Actions to impoverish me, and likewise to tire the patience
of my Friends, whom I made use of as Bayl, that if they could not drive me out of
the City, yet they might secure me in a Prison. The before named <hi>Dowle, Boyce</hi> and
one <hi>Francis Bell</hi> were the Principal Actors herein.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of <hi>December</hi> in the year that Sir <hi>Thomas Lancton</hi> was Mayor (I
cannot exactly speak the number of the year) I had occasion to send a Letter by a Trow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to one <hi>Henry Hyman</hi> living near <hi>Monmouth,</hi> who was wont to furnish me with
Provisions of Corn, Bacon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and not finding the Trowman aboard his Trow, his
men directed me to the place where he was at the <hi>White Hart</hi> in <hi>Corn-street.</hi> Where
finding him, I had scarcely delivered my business and called for a Flagon of Beet,
when before I tasted it, came into the Room one <hi>Atwood</hi> and <hi>Dickenson</hi> Chief Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable
and Constable of <hi>All-Hollows Ward,</hi> (the later being a reverend Heelmaker and
Speaker in an Anabaptist Conventicle) who after some gaping one upon another, and
a short silence, began to demand of me what business I had there. I Answered, That
I would return them an Account if they first satisfied me what Authority they had to
examine me. But their Answer was short, That they were Constables and must bring
me before the <hi>Mayor.</hi> I refusing to go unless they shewed me a sufficient Warrant,
they laid hands on me and dragged me forth, <hi>Dickenson</hi> striking me diverse blows,
because, forsooth (not knowing the man but guessing by his words and gesture) I said
I believed him to be some zealous <hi>Tub preaching Cobler.</hi> The <hi>Mayor</hi> being not at home,
they drew me to and fro through the Streets (as if some notorious Malefactor) in quest
of the <hi>Mayor,</hi> and after two hours finding him, <hi>Dukenson</hi> presented me, informing
him where they found me, and beginning to preach to the <hi>Mayor</hi> and both <hi>Sheriffs</hi>
(present then) how unseemly and scandalous a thing it was for Ministers to frequent
publick Houses, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> (whose thoughts were clear of Phanatical Dregs) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
by what Warrant they had thus apprehended me; They produced Sir <hi>Thomas</hi>'s
Warrant to search all Publick Houses and suspicious Places, and to apprehend all such
Strangers as they any where met with, who could not give an account of the Places
of their Abode or Business in Town, it being soon after an insurrection in the <hi>North.</hi>
The <hi>Mayor</hi> replied, you intimate that you know Mr. <hi>Godwyn</hi> to be a Clergyman, and
do you not know his place of Abode? They confessed, yes. What then is this (said
he) to your Warrant? But furthermore tell me whether you found Mr. <hi>Godwyn</hi> do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there any ill or unlawful Act, or, can you prove that he sat there drinking be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the limits by the Law exprest? They answered, no, but began as before to
Cant and tell him, That Ministers of the Gospel ought to be Pure and of good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
and Example. But the <hi>Mayor</hi> and <hi>Sheriffs</hi> threatning them for this Fact,
they departed. Yet this they reported (and diverse in the City Lovers of the <hi>Church</hi>
as well as Enemies believed it) That they had taken me in a House Drunk, and that
the <hi>Mayor</hi> had ordered me to provide Sureties the next day for the Behaviour, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to indict me the next Quarter Sessions.</p>
            <p>Diverse litigious Actions and approbrious Reflections (too tedious to insert here) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this year thrown upon me, the next year Mr. <hi>Willoughby</hi> was <hi>Mayor,</hi> in whose
time certain Persons in and near the City died of the Plage. But one Mr. <hi>Walter
Chester</hi> a Gentleman of my Parish falling sick and dying of a Prurisie, because I had
during the time of his sickness been diverse times at Prayer with him, and had admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred
to him the Holy Eucharist, the <hi>Mayor</hi> upon slight Information that he died
of the Plague, shuts up my House and places Musqueteers at my street and back Doors.
The <hi>Physitian</hi> who was daily and almost hourly with Mr. <hi>Chester</hi> in his sickness lived
almost in the Heart of the City, the <hi>Apothecary</hi> dwelt by the <hi>Toulzey,</hi> where the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates</hi>
and <hi>Merchants</hi> daily met, yet no notice was taken of them, whereas my
House in the Suburbs must be shut up. And both to remove all pretence of the <hi>Mayor</hi>
and other <hi>Magistrates</hi> not knowing who was the sick Mans <hi>Physitian</hi> or <hi>Apothecary,</hi>
and manifest this an Act of Malice against me, the last is shewn by their fearless dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
and reception of the former. For Dr. <hi>William Sermon</hi> the <hi>Physitian</hi> and
Mr. <hi>Martin</hi> the <hi>Apothecary</hi> in the presence of the <hi>Mayor</hi> and <hi>Aldermen</hi> at the Toulzey
made Oath that Mr. <hi>Chester</hi> died not of any Contagious Disease but of the Plurisie;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49426:6"/>
so did one Woman who attended him in his sickness, and two others who laid him
out (as they term it) sware that there was not the least spot or token of the Plague upon
the body. But before this Oath taken, the <hi>Mayor</hi> and the rest discourst Dr. <hi>Sermon</hi> and
Mr. <hi>Martin</hi> as unconcernedly as if beforehand satisfied there was no occasion for their Oath.
Yet after their Oaths and a Permission that the Deceased Persons Body should be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in the Chancel of his Parish Church, the Musqueteers were continued at my Doors
two days, and when the Corps of my Friend and Parishioner was carried by my
Door to be Buried I was denied by the Guard (which was strengthned with the
<hi>Mayor</hi> and <hi>Sheriffs</hi> Sarjeants and Officers more at that time than before) to do my
Office as Incumbent or perform the last Requisits of Friendship towards a Person I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
loved. But then I furiously brake through them, and accompained my truly
kind Neighbour to his last Repose. And here Malice took its old Course, and
Mr. <hi>Thomas Dayes</hi> (since an Alderman of the City as I have been informed) was
the Author of a report (which was spread abroad with the wonted celerity of a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
willing to fix scandal) that he died not of a Plurisie, but a violent Fever occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by high Drinking with me. Meeting him upon the arrival of the scandal at
mine ears, I desired him to intimate to me the place and time when Mr. <hi>Chester</hi> and
I had been together more than one quarter of an hour in a month before his sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
He answered, That he had heard so much; but being prest to let me under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
by whom this was told him, and what probable Inducements he had to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
what tended so highly to the defaming of a Clergyman, I could obtain no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
but after a Hum and Haw or two pretended, he was glad that it was not true,
and that he would satisfie those to whom he had spoken it that he believed the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
to be false. I thanked him for his first great civility in so freely murdering my
Reputation, and the second in taking me to be so eminent a Coxcomb as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
That he would make it his business to give himself the lye, and then took my
leave of him.</p>
            <p>Within three weeks after this one <hi>Crow</hi> my Parishioner his Wife coverously buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Clothes of some who died of the Plague, fell sick and died of it likewise. I
had not heard of either his death or sickness, but took a Boat with six Friends to go
down to the Port of <hi>Kingroad</hi> to see the Saint <hi>Patrick Frigat,</hi> which was newly built,
rigged and ready to sail. In my absence notice was given of this mans Funeral, but
the Cause of his Death concealed. My <hi>Clerk</hi> desired Mr. <hi>Forcith</hi> Rector of the next
Parish of St. <hi>Peters</hi> to bury this Person, which he readily did, neither he, nor any
Neigbour accompanying the Corps to the Grave suspecting the Disease whereof he
died to be what it afterward appeared. Two days after came Constables, Sarjeants
and Watchmen armed with Musquets and Swords acquainting me from the <hi>Mayor</hi>
that my House must be shut up in regard of the danger the City was in by suffering
me or any of my Family to walk the Streets, seeing I had been so desperate as to
Bury a man dying of the Plague. I knowing nothing of it, thought it had been the
old story of Mr. <hi>Chester</hi> revived, but afterward diverse persons dying suddenly, who
had been at that Burial, I understood the ground of my confinement. To remove
the mistake I sent four of the persons who were with me on board the St. <hi>Patrick</hi> that
day to testifie my not Burial of that Corps, they knowing me to be ten miles out of
the City. But Mr. <hi>Mayor</hi> replied That I was a bold adventurous Person and made
more Scruple of a Ceremony than running the City, and that if I had not buried <hi>Crow,</hi>
yet if I were at liberty I would bury others, and therefore the Guards should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued.
So by this sort of preventive Justice my house was shut up a whole month.
Yet all this while diverse Inhabitants of the City, present at <hi>Crows</hi> Burial, who did eat
and drink in the House were not any way taken notice of.</p>
            <p>The same year being repairing my Vicaridge House, I cut down an Ash in the
Church-yard which was serviceable for that Purpose, and was Indicted at the Quarter
Sessions for making waste upon the City Lands. Now the pretence of calling the
Church-yard the City Land was that the <hi>Mayor, Aldermen</hi> and <hi>Common Council</hi> had
the Right of Presentation to that Vicaridge. Their folly could amount to no more
than putting me to expences, for esteeming it my duty to defend the Rights of my
<hi>Church</hi> I proceeded to traverse the Indictment, but it was let fall, they thinking it not
safe to go on to a Tryal.</p>
            <p>Alderman <hi>Morgan</hi> (as I take it) succeeded Mr. <hi>Willoughby;</hi> nevertheless upon St. <hi>Iohns</hi>
day in <hi>Christmas</hi> in Mr. <hi>Morgans</hi> year, while I was reading the Evening Service for that
Festival, a great company of Boyes (fifty or more) with shouts and hideous noises at
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49426:6"/>
the Church Doors interrupted the Devotions of the Office. The <hi>Sexton</hi> going forth
of the <hi>Church</hi> endeavouring to curb them, was beaten into the <hi>Church</hi> with Stones;
the <hi>Sexton</hi> going forth again with the <hi>Clerk,</hi> they were both dealt with in the
same manner. Seeing no remedy I persisted to the finishing of the Days Duty as
well as I could in such a disturbance: which ended, as we passed out of the <hi>Church</hi>
diverse of the Boyes fled, but some continued fearless and impudent. Among
others one <hi>Bingham</hi> more impudent than the rest let down his Breeches and in
most unseemly manner affronted me and those People who came forth of the
<hi>Church.</hi> I confess my indignation compelled me to make him taste the severity
of my Cane and the Tce of my Shoe. But the provocation was the greater in regard
I had thrice before complained to his Grandfather and Grandmother <hi>Thomas Wright</hi>
and his <hi>Wife,</hi> with whom he lived, of his rudeness at other times when I was read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<hi>Divine Service,</hi> and have still a confirmation that he was encouraged thereto
by them and his Mother (then married to one <hi>Hart</hi> a Seaman) which opinion
what I am to deliver fixes in me. For going directly from the <hi>Church</hi> to visit a
sick Parishioner, while I was praying with her the Lads Grandmother and Mother
with other women were at the door of the sick Womans House, brawling and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
noises little inferiour to that of the Boyes at the Church door. When I
came forth I was saluted with variety of approbrious terms, and the Path leading
homeward being by the side of a Ditch the Mother suddenly gives me a thrust
which had inevitably plunged me in the mire and dyed my Gown, had not a
man coming by observed her motion and plucked me back by the arm. I used
all mild expressions to perswade them to come to my House and reason the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
with me there, that it did misbecome them in that nature to make an uproar
in the Street, and more to that purpose. But they the more furiously belched out
foul language, and after such Terms used, the Grandmother threatned me to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
the <hi>Mayor</hi> with what I had done. To all that was said I made no reply,
but walkt on with silence until that last womanish threatning, to which turning
about I answered, The <hi>Mayor</hi> will much thank you for it. Immediately the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
bawls out, <hi>What do you not care a Fart for the Mayor?</hi> The Brawl oceasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
a great concourse among which were some good people, but especially five
men, who had often rebuked the women for their misbehaviour. To these (as
soon as the women had spoken the words) I said, <hi>It's a thousand to one but these
malitious women will inform and insence the Mayor with the words pretended to be
spoken, whereas you can testifie that nothing like it came from me.</hi> I did not in the
least suspect that the <hi>Mayor</hi> could be so wretchedly silly as to take notice of it, but
conjectured that through their want of discretion a Gossipping or Pick-thank sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
might be promoted. But the next morning came two Sarjeants to my House
requiring my appearance before Mr. <hi>Mayor</hi> immediately at the Toulzey. I desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to see their Warrant, but they answered that they were the <hi>Mayors Sarjeants</hi>
and their Persons were Warrants. I refused to go without a Warrant, but they
laid hands upon me and compelled me. At the <hi>Toulzey</hi> were present the Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother
and the Mother, who sware that I said <hi>I did not care a Fart for the Mayor.</hi>
The <hi>Mayor</hi> and <hi>Aldermen</hi> then present (expect Sir <hi>Thomas Langton,</hi> who departed
saying to his Brethren, You do not do well to hearken to Womens Title Tattles,
I'le be gone) required me to give sureties for the answering at the next Quarter Ses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and the Behaviour in the mean time. But I had sent for the five men before
mentioned, who offered to swear That being between me and the women they
heard all the words by me uttered at that time, while the Women were Brawling,
but that they did not hear any such words spoken by me. Sir <hi>Iohn Knight</hi> the
Elder (who esteems himself an Oracle of the Law) told them, this was <hi>a Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Oath and would signifie nothing.</hi> I argued, That if I had spoken such words,
the place where they were said to be spoken was not within any part of the <hi>City,</hi>
but in <hi>Glocestershire,</hi> and that in the Womens Oath there was no mention of any
particular <hi>Mayor</hi> of <hi>Glocester</hi> more than <hi>Bristol,</hi> or <hi>Bristol</hi> than <hi>Coventry;</hi> but to
manifest that I was not so ungratefully ill-bred as causelesly to affront so eminent
a Magistrate and one of my Patrons, I offered to take my Oath that <hi>I was so far
from speaking those words, that they were not so much as in my thoughts,</hi> until the
Womens speaking them. But Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> could speak nothing but Law, and that
discreetly and accepted neither my asleveration as a Clergyman, nor my Oath as a
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49426:7"/>
man; two witnesses swearing positively, and my Oath being only negative and
in my own Cause. I urged again, That if any person had been faulty in speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
rudely of another, to any ingenious men his being ashamed thereof was suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
satisfaction, and that it was satisfaction enough in my judgement that my
self and five more (persons of known repute) could swear the words not spoken
by me, and what I offered was argument enough that I esteemed such language
misbecoming me, that it could not appear other than Malice and Revenge in the
women; and lastly, that if the words had really been spoken, I saw no ground
that they had for such proceeding, but that my rudeness was my own punishment.
Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> insisted upon the positive Oaths, and required surety, which I denied so
much as to seek for: So my <hi>Mittimus</hi> was made and I was committed to <hi>Newgate</hi>
Prison for the space of six days, Sir <hi>Iohn Knight,</hi> Alderman <hi>Willoughby,</hi> Alderman
<hi>Hix,</hi> Alderman <hi>Stevens,</hi> and Alderman <hi>Lawford</hi> signed the Mittimus: during
which time I desired on <hi>Sunday</hi> and <hi>Newyears</hi> day to have the liberty to officiate
at my <hi>Parish Church</hi> paying a Keeper to go with me. The <hi>Goaler</hi> dared not
permit this without the <hi>Mayors</hi> leave. I wrote to the <hi>Mayor</hi> to desire that liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but was denied. At six days end I gave Bayl, but the night before I went forth
of the Prison, the Keeper of it (being sent for into my Chamber to receive his
Chamber-rent and Fees) began to perswade me to a submission and to cast my
self wholly upon the <hi>Mayor</hi> and <hi>Aldermens</hi> mercy: my answers averse to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
seemed strange, especially in regard of their Power, and that (although
persons very rich in their own private fortunes) they would prosecute me with
the Chamber-stock, and in fine would certainly ruine me. I replied, that little
of their love to Justice would appear in their relying only upon their Power and
Riches; that the trust was presumed to be put into the manegery of those that
were impartial, who would not be moved to wrong doing by either favour or
spleen. At last after much discourse to this purpose I said, <hi>Come, Come, Mr.</hi> Holt
<hi>(the Keepers Name) thy are a company of Noddies and know not what they do.</hi> This
was a grand Offence and moved the <hi>Sophies</hi> to high indignation, especially by the
Keepers (to obtain with his Masters the repute of being diligently jealous of their
esteem) adding and swearing more than was spoken, although words in themselves
meerly frivolous. Hereupon I was again committed and detained under close con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement
ten days more, and then Bayled forth. During my Confinement the
<hi>Mayor,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Knight,</hi> the two <hi>Sheriffs,</hi> Mr. <hi>Robert Aldworth</hi> the Townclarke
who had been a Collonel in Service against King <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>1st.</hi> and Son
of that insolent and ungrateful Rebel <hi>Alderman Aldworth,</hi> who being <hi>Mayor</hi> of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stol</hi>
shut the City Gates against his <hi>Master,</hi> and the <hi>King</hi> forcing his entrance, with
an unusual Clemency, not only prohibited Military Execution (as in those cases)
but was graciously pleased both to pardon the Traytor and recommit to him the
Sword. Yet his <hi>Majesty</hi> had no sooner left the <hi>City</hi> but <hi>Aldworth</hi> did (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
his many pretensively thankful asseverations of future Allegiance) conspire
against his <hi>Prince,</hi> whose most eminent Compassion reprieved him from the jaws
of Hell, and made the <hi>City</hi> a <hi>Parliament Garrison.</hi> Mr. <hi>Robins</hi> Steward of the <hi>Sheriffs</hi>
Court was sent with diverse others to the <hi>Bishop</hi> with the Complaint of my rude car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
toward the <hi>Mayor</hi> at one time, and most of the Magistrates of the City came at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.
Sir <hi>Iohn Knight,</hi> as most potent in Law, laid open the offence in a speech very co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious
and prodigiously eloquent, concluding with a Prayer that I might be prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
for this misdemeanour in the <hi>Ecclesiastical Court;</hi> Mr. <hi>Aldworth</hi> seconded him;
but Mr. <hi>Robins</hi> expresly denied to speak against a Clergy-man in a Cause whereof
he was altogether dislatisfied. The <hi>Bishop</hi> (when Sir <hi>Iohns</hi> Gaping fit was over)
had liberty to deliver his sentiments, that he thought the <hi>Magistrates</hi> had done ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ill in Committing a <hi>Clergy-man</hi> to Prison on pretence of misdemeanour of words;
that if any words deserving punishment had been spoken, he accounted himself
the proper Judge; That they had shewed too much of prejudice and little
knowledge in endeavouring to inflict on any man for the same offence two pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments,
unless in such case as the Law did especially provide; That he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
care to examine the whole matter and found that there was nothing but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
in it, being confident that the words (which the Women testified) were not
spoken, and that (if spoken) he saw no remedy that they had by such ways of
proceeding; That it was a blemish to their Authority and Judgements to give ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:49426:7"/>
to such impertinent Informations: lastly, That he required them fortwith to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lease
me. But Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> to manifest his Subtilty as well as Eloquence, had reserved
to the last what he had to alledge of most weighty Consequence, That I had as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted
and beaten a Boy (<hi>Bingham</hi> before mentioned) in the Church-yard of
St. <hi>Philip, &amp;c.</hi> upon St. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s day in the Even last; That by the Statute of the
fourth of King <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth, every <hi>Clergy-man</hi> fighting, striking or brawling
within the Precincts or limits of any <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Church-yard</hi> be forthwith suspend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from his Office. His <hi>Lordship</hi> replied, That Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> mistook the meaning
of the Statute, it being intended to curb the licentiousness of extravagant Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
who except by the sense of a Penalty, knew not how to distinguish Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
Consecrate from Unconsecrate; That Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> shewed himself missed by pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
in speaking so sharply a <hi>Clergy-man,</hi> and forgetting the Occasion,
the Boys insolence in disturbing Divine Service, and beating the <hi>Clerk</hi> and <hi>Sexton</hi>
with stones; That withall he had done well in shewing his respect to the
<hi>Church</hi> by promoting Prosecution against the Women, who followed Mr. <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyn</hi>
through the Church-yard brawling, terming him <hi>Rogue</hi> and <hi>Papist Villain,</hi>
with many other approbrious Terms, which (although it proved otherwise)
might have provoked him to unadvised Expressions; that the Statute urged by
Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> enabled the <hi>Ordinary</hi> of the <hi>Diocess</hi> to proceed against Lay persons of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
against the Tenor of it to suspension <hi>ab ingressu Ecclesiae</hi> as well against
Clergy-men to suspension <hi>ab Officio;</hi> That therefore he must either proceed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>Sextons</hi> of the <hi>Cathedral</hi> for correcting, in his view, Boyes or others
misbehaving themselves in the <hi>Church,</hi> or suffer <hi>Divine Service</hi> to the Reproach of
<hi>Religion</hi> to be huddled up with a mixture of all sorts of confused noises; which
was Mr. <hi>Godwyns</hi> Case; And that seeing Sir <hi>Iohn,</hi> in the precise Letter of the
Law, termed this Act of Mr. <hi>Godwyns</hi> an <hi>Assault</hi> upon the Lad, as <hi>Bishop</hi> he must
proceed against the <hi>Master</hi> of the <hi>School</hi> within the limits of the Cathedral to a
suspension as often as any silly Woman should complain that her Son, or Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
or Cozens Buttocks were <hi>assaulted</hi> by the <hi>Master.</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> retired with
much regret that his Learning and Faculties were slighted; but before departure
gravely informed his Lordship, that it would not redound to his <hi>Honour</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
such as delighted in affronting Magistrates, and to encourage <hi>Clergy men</hi> to
be Strikers and Revengers of their own injuries. At the <hi>Quarter Sessions</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
two Indictments were drawn up against me, and found by the <hi>Grand Iury.</hi>
These being upon appeal removed to the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> in the <hi>Hillary Term</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
coming to <hi>London,</hi> as I passed through <hi>Chancery Lane</hi> in order to advise
with Mr. <hi>Gregory</hi> (now Sir <hi>William Gregory,</hi> one of the Honourable <hi>Barons</hi> of the
<hi>Exchequer</hi>) I met with <hi>Aldworth</hi> before-mentioned, who with much pretended
kindness saluted me, and desired my company for a short space in <hi>Lincolns Inn</hi>
Walks. I consented and received there diverse fawning and bemoaning expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
intimating how much he respected me, and was troubled at the unhappy Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
between the City and me. He importuned me not to proceed, for that
his affection to me was such that he would make up the Breach, and beget in the
<hi>Magistrates</hi> an advantageous understanding of me; That his acquaintance with
me since my coming to <hi>Bristol</hi> assured him that what was Sworn by the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
was malitious and false, with much more of that nature. In fine I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
not to proceed, if he promised me faithfully to take care that no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
thereof should be taken. This with exceeding pleasantness and smiles he
thankt me for, bidding me not doubt in the lest but that he would do that and
more than I could imagine conducing both to my credit and interest,
s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eing my ready inclinations to a peaceable composure. I relying on these pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
returned to <hi>Bristol,</hi> immediately after my return was taken into custody
by Process out of the <hi>CrownOffice</hi> for not prosecuting the Traverse, and was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to pay Charges and give security to traverse the Indictments. The next Term
I met him in <hi>Westminster-Hall,</hi> where he began to accost me with the same whee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle;
and my retort of his breach of Promise gave him no blush nor moved
him from any Complement, only he assured me that small charges would sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
nothing in respect to the kindnesses which he intended me. Many endearing
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49426:8"/>
expressions I received, but bluntly told him that I would no more believe a
Person who had once forfeited his Credit in an affair of such a sort, that in
might have been at will preserved, wishing him to attend the <hi>Court</hi> to make de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
for that I resolved by the first opportunity by Counsels Motion to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to quash the Indictments. Which the next day by the now Mr. <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron
Gregory</hi> was performed, the <hi>Court</hi> severely checking Mr. <hi>Townclark</hi> for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vising
and defending such Prosecution. Now it pleased <hi>God</hi> to frustrate the
malitious intentions of these people without any great affliction to me. Yet I
cannot but observe by the way, that seeing how desperately the two <hi>Women</hi>
and <hi>Holt</hi> sware, had their knowledge been better informed, they would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
have sworn to a higher Pitch. For the <hi>Perjury</hi> being the same as if
they had sworn <hi>Burglary</hi> against me, the <hi>Oath</hi> would not have choaked them
sooner in one case than the other. <hi>Holt</hi> not long after died ravingly mad,
and crying out against <hi>Perjury,</hi> and demanding <hi>what's the reward of False Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</hi>
Mrs. <hi>Wright, Binghams</hi> Grandmother lived two years after or thereabouts,
and then falling sick, and being near death, was frequent (as divers, who vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sited
her, informed me) in very horrid expressions as despairing, although preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively
she was very religiously addicted. I was told likewise by certain Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
who visited her, that she was very desitous to speak with me, and to that
end I came thrice, as well out of pity as Conscience of Duty to Pray with and
discourse her, but her Daughter (<hi>Bingham</hi>'s Mother) denied me admittance.
This Daughter is yet, or was lately alive, but, poor Wretch! most unfortunate
ever since that Oath taken, living before that very prosperously. She's laden
with infamy and scorn by the miscarriages both of her Husband and self; and
her other great calamities ought not to be reflected upon, if the leudness of
her life, and no apparent sense of that misery did not spur me on thus to
mention so great an Object of Compassion, <hi>on whom I beseech God to have
mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the same year of Mr. <hi>Morgan</hi>'s Mayoralty (Sir <hi>Iohn Knight</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi>
being the principal Contrivers) I had two more admirable Trials of my
Patron's affection. The first was the old Project of Scandal, (and (were not
my Evidence Mr. <hi>Burroughs</hi> then Swordbearer now dead) I would more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
say Subornation of Perjury to render me scandalous) to the carrying on of
which they busily tampered with such as were esteemed meet for their purpose,
whom while supplied with drink, they found ready to say any thing that
might gratifie their Masters, Their chief Factor was one <hi>Thomas Warren,</hi> whose
employment it was to pick up Merchants of Fame. Of such seaven (Men
and Women) were selected as able to carry on the work, whose Names, and
the Substance of what they were to Testifie being brought to Mr. <hi>Aldworth,</hi> he
drew them up in form ready for Oath and Signature. This was discovered
by Mr. <hi>Burroughs,</hi> (a zealously loyal Churchman) who gave me the respect of
a visit, and to advise me to look to my self, for that he overheard some whis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perings
of design against me, and saw Papers handed from one to another by
the <hi>Mayor, Townclark</hi> and others upon that day dining with the <hi>Mayor.</hi> In short,
the <hi>Mayor</hi> and other <hi>Particles of Iustice</hi> were on a certain day drawn together
into the <hi>Council Chamber</hi> of the City, to sit, as in a Council of War, to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
of a Poor Vicars Repute; and <hi>Thomas Warren</hi> was File-leader of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutioners;
For two of the seaven appeared not at all. The five managed one
by one by <hi>Warren,</hi> and brought to <hi>Aldworth</hi> (who stood in the Stairs leading to
the Chamber to preexamine and instruct) denied to swear what they had said.
<hi>Warren</hi> was angry, and <hi>Aldworth</hi> askt them <hi>what they came thither for, if th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
would not Swear?</hi> To whose question they answered, That Mr. <hi>Warren</hi> made
them drunk, and that (whatever they had said in their drink) they would
not swear what was read to them out of Mr. <hi>Aldworth</hi>'s Papers for all the world.
So the <hi>Right Worshipful</hi> and <hi>Worshipful</hi> departed as wise and honest as they came.
Their intentions had been buzzed about the City among the Conventicling
Parties, before Mr. <hi>Burrough</hi>'s discovery, although not so privately, but that
some of the <hi>Ort<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>odox Party</hi> discerned somewhat of contrivance against me though
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49426:8"/>
they knew not what it was, the day only being known when something of an
high nature was to be proved against me. This brought the Factious Birds in
Flocks, and the uncertain rumour brought the ingenious sorrowful men to be
spectators. Diverse of these last saw <hi>Warren</hi> busie in whispering and introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
the Witnesses one by one, but Mr. <hi>Burroughs</hi> only heard the words spoken
by and to Mr. <hi>Aldworth,</hi> having, by virtue of his Office, more liberty than
others to come within hearing.</p>
            <p>This Holy Stratagem was improsperous, but Malice being alway active, they
are furnisht with a new Devise. Matter of Scandal was some years laid aside,
but in the same Mr. <hi>Morgan</hi>'s Mayoralty I was sent for to the <hi>Toulzy</hi> by a <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant,</hi>
and there brought up into the <hi>Council House,</hi> where Sir <hi>Iohn Knight</hi> twat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
at his accustomed rates, demanding of me particularly <hi>by what pretence of
right I received Tithes within the liberties of the City;</hi> my Answer was, <hi>As law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Incumbent of the Vicaridge of St.</hi> Philip <hi>of</hi> Jacob <hi>within the City.</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
<hi>That the City by its Charter was exempted from all payments of Tithes, the
Chamber paying fourteen</hi> (to the best of my remembrance) <hi>pounds yearly to the
Abby of</hi> Tewkesbury <hi>part of the Queens Dower pro omnibus Decimis Villae Bristol.</hi>
I justified the Tithes my right, as being received by my Predecessors so long
as that the memory of man could not alledge to the contrary, and that I
would defend the Rights of my Church to the utmost of my power, not fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Gods</hi> blessing upon endeavours and a Cause so just. The Parishioners, such
as were Phanatical and willing to contribute to ruine the <hi>Church,</hi> had private
notice to be ready, and the Chief of them called up into the <hi>Council House<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
and commanded to pay no more Tithes to me or any succeeding <hi>Vicar</hi> of that
Parish, assuring them, that if I brought any action against any of them, their
charges should be reimbursed out of the Chamber stock. I urged that the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor</hi>
of St. <hi>Michaels</hi> in the City received Tithes time out of mind for Lands
within the liberties of the City, and that the City Chamber paid the Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent
of little St. <hi>Augustines</hi> an annual Composition for <hi>Priors Hill,</hi> in regard it
was made common to the Citizens for certain uses, and ceased to be beneficial
as formerly, together with other Lands within that Parish, upon which Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
were erected. Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> learnedly confuted me with saying, that that of
St. <hi>Augustines</hi> was matter of benevolence, and the other should be enquired into.
I departed, and in pursuance of my Promise, served <hi>Thomas Warren</hi> and others
with <hi>Subpenaes</hi> out of the <hi>Exchequer</hi> for non-satisfaction for my Tithes. They
defended the Cause for a while, but, after considerable expences, coming to the
succeeding <hi>Mayor</hi> Alderman <hi>Stevens</hi> with a Bill of Charges, and to Petition
for an Order for Reimbursement according to the former Assurance, the <hi>Mayor</hi>
(although very forward in encouraging them the preceding year, and as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
concerned in the former practises against me) had considered of the
matter, and answered that no such Order should be granted; That Alderman
<hi>Morgan</hi> galloped too fast in promises, but that he would trot on considerately
in performancies of his engagements in rash attempts. This answer cooled my
Adversaries, and for that time they came to Composition; neither did I find
any further trouble from the following <hi>Mayors</hi> or other than due respects.</p>
            <p>But the turbulent <hi>Spirit of Phanaticism</hi> began by banding together, to bring
to pass by their own Purses and Subtilties, what they failed of effecting by the
<hi>Magistrates.</hi> To this end divers of them (fourteen in number) entred into a
Combination and mutual engagement to detain my Tithes, not only within the
Liberties of the <hi>City,</hi> but those parts of the Parish which lay without the <hi>City.</hi>
The Names of these were <hi>Iohn Dowl, Thomas Warren, Iohn Teage, Richard
Winston, Robert Miles,</hi> and <hi>Francis Bell,</hi> Principal Conspirators; with whom
associated in Councel <hi>Thomas Edwards, Thomas Wright, Henry Lang</hi> not
sued, but promoters of the others obstinacy. The rest were rather drawn in,
and therefore after some time left them. But three years they held me in Law,
making <hi>Affidavits</hi> of one sort or other, and bringing down <hi>Commission</hi> upon
<hi>Commssion.</hi> At length (when they had almost worn me out) they began to
suspect and disagree among themselves. For the Greater charged the Meaner
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49426:9"/>
with such Large Bills in Parnership from time to time, that they began to fear
themselves ensnared, and to shew their Bills. This I by accident hearing was
not wanting to add fewel to their jealousie, which increasing, they deserted the
Knot of Complicators, and not only compounded with me, but became also
Conformable. The rest stood off, but not much longer. The miss of so many
Contributors troubled them; for Seditious men as they are Malitious and care
not how deeply they engage in mischief, so are they for the most part Seditious
out of Covetousness. These also began to be jealous one of another, and by
degrees compounded, all except <hi>Teage</hi> and <hi>Winston,</hi> who in conclusion were the
<hi>Asses,</hi> which bare the others burdens; for they were compelled to agreement
on almost arbitrary Terms. Thus was the storm over, which by most rational
mens conjectures would have sunk or wrackt me; but <hi>Divine Providence</hi> reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
me to further trials, permitted not this Divice to be successful; their own
follies ruined what in their first consultations was perniciously resolved. Then
I had some rest for two years, the following <hi>Mayors</hi> Sir <hi>Robert Yoemans</hi> and
Alderman <hi>Streamer</hi> being so generously and discreetly affected to Loyalty and
the Discipline of the <hi>Church,</hi> that the sly <hi>Conventicler</hi> durst not attempt by them;
The <hi>Bishop</hi> would not be moved, and the Law gave him no encouragement.
The Adversary had, during the late times of Confusion, concealed the Vica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridge
Rights, and hoped to have involved them in Custom, insomuch that at
my first coming thither my yearly accounts of the Vicaridge Tithes, Offerings
and other Customary Duties amounted not to thirty pounds; which (by their
own wrangling and disingenuous practises chiefly) I had by this time raised to
be an hundred and ten pounds yearly, being perfectly assured they were worth
thirty pounds more. But I thought I had done enough, and was desirous of
embracing that tranquility, which then seemed to Court me.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless within half an year after the birth of my confidence that I should
be at rest (having patiently wearied the men of commotion) it pleased <hi>God</hi>
that I was afflicted with a violent <hi>Quartan Ague,</hi> which worried me two years
together. Towards the end of this distemper a certain <hi>Quaker</hi> named <hi>Morrice
Williams</hi> (whose Wife was Master and Governor according to the methods of
perverseness in general use among Sectaries) fearing a Law Suit for the tithes of
many years in arrears, came to me and reckoned with me, the account arising
to twenty three pounds and upward. This Debt he said he could not pay in
ready mony, neither otherwise, in regard of his Wifes unmanagable temper.
But he desired me for the future to take my Tithes in kind, wherein I shoul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
have no opposition, but a free allowance from him so to do, and also to take
as much more as my Tithes yearly until the Debt should be satisfied. T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>is
was on both sides concluded, but not put in execution, <hi>Morrice Williams</hi> soon
after dying. His Widow I designed to compel to payment, being able to prove
the account and acknowledgements of her Husband. To this end I caused her
to be summoned into the Ecclesiastical Court, where she was required either to
produce and prove a will, or to Administer to her Husbands Estate. She deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
any Will made, or to take any Oath in order to Administration. Her refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
being entred I administred as Principal Creditor, and by virtue of my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration
took into my Possession divers Head of Cattle. But Mr. <hi>Thomas Day</hi>
(beforementioned) being Landlord of what ground <hi>Morrice Williams</hi> farmed,
caused the Cattle to be brought back by an illegal <hi>Replevin.</hi> His reasons for
fetching them back were grounded upon a pretended Right that he had to
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hem, as being made over to him by <hi>Morrice Williams</hi> in his lifetime; and
that the cause of this Conveyance was that <hi>Williams</hi> and his <hi>Wife</hi> being obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<hi>Conventiclers,</hi> if their Cattle should be seised for penalties, in meeting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Tenor of the <hi>Acts against unlawful Assemblies,</hi> they might be disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
from paying his rent. So here was a present Fraud to bassle the proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
of Justice, out of pretence of an inconvenience that might possibly follow.
Mr. <hi>Day</hi> was that year one of the <hi>Sheriffs,</hi> which swelled his confidence, and
gave his dishonest thoughts the larger Wings. But yet this knack of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance
of the Cattle did not look safe; therefore at last the Widow <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ued forth
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49426:9"/>
of the <hi>Prerogative Court</hi> Letters of Administration, and although not sworn, was
returned sworn by one (<hi>Matthew</hi> I suppose) <hi>Hazard a Nonconformist Preacher.</hi>
I opposed my Letters of Administration to hers, and upon a Commission in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
being made what <hi>Bona notabilia Morrice Williams</hi> had out of the <hi>Diocess</hi>
at the time of his death, there was only proof that a certain man owed him
five pounds for Hey received from <hi>Williams;</hi> but upon close examination it was
found a desperate debt, the Debtor owing many hundreds more than he was
able to pay, (whereas it is required that he had of such a value in <hi>Goods or Good
Debts</hi> to make it a Prerogative Case) neither could they prove whether this
Debtor was then within the <hi>Diocess</hi> or not. This notwithstanding (I being
confined by sickness to my Chamber, and not able to appear in or look after the
managing of my Business) the Administration was granted to the Widow. And
after my recovery being in <hi>London</hi> with my <hi>Proctor</hi> admiring how the Cause
was so carried, I received only this satifaction from him; <hi>This it is to bring into
any Court a Cause which is against the interest of the Court.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Day</hi> was not content with this Victory, nor with ordinary Courses for
recovery of Damages pretended to be sustained in driving of the Cattle, but sued
my Servant to an Outlawry in the <hi>Kings Bench.</hi> The Outlawry was surreptiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
obtained; and the proceedings were in the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> on purpose to make
the Charge excessive before I could be able to make defence. Therefore the Writ
was taken out in the Middle of <hi>Hillary Term,</hi> and the Man arrested and impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned,
no Bail or Remedy to be taken, but that he must continue a Prisoner until
by <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> he could be brought to give Bail before one of the <hi>Iustices</hi> of
the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> which could be no sooner than <hi>Easter Term.</hi> Had not Malice
and Zeal to Faction spurred him on, that is, if bare reparation for a Trespass
had been the utmost of his intention, the Man might any day, or almost any
hour of any day have been Arrested, the Cause would sooner have come to
Tryal, and (if Justice had favoured him) his damages would have certainly not
have been the less for his fair and legal proceeding to Judgement. However I
resolved to stand to Trial, having delivered a Writ of <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> to the under-Sheriff,
Mr. <hi>Day</hi> began some other Phanatical Practises, and daily and hourly
after the delivery of the Writ, some or other from him were tampering with
my Servant, instilling into his mind many fearful apprehensions of Mr. <hi>Days</hi>
power and his own Danger, and at length wheedled the silly Wretch out of
three pounds, and into a General Release.</p>
            <p>But now I am to relate Passages, in comparison of which, all that hath been
said is so slight and insignificant, that the past actions of mine enemies seem ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Complements and Civilities than matter of Complaint. And if the truth of
what I am delivering were not known to many men of indisputable worth and
integrity, inhabiting in and near the Places of Action, I should forbear to write
what I must suspect that few or none would believe. But here <hi>Malice</hi> met
with an <hi>Agent,</hi> who besides his Power knew how to manage a Church-murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Weapon. I was advised by Dr. <hi>Ironside</hi> (the beforementioned <hi>Bishop</hi>) and
my ever <hi>Honoured Lord</hi> to procure a Qualification to make me capable of some
kindness, which his <hi>Lordship</hi> would confer upon me as opportunity should serve.
I hereupon wrote to one Mr. <hi>Francis Melsam</hi> then belonging to the <hi>Paper Office</hi>
in <hi>Scotland Yard</hi> to make search for a Vacancy, and to give me necessary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions
to whom I must repair for obtaining of it and when. But he very
expeditely sent me down a Qualification under the <hi>Lord Denzill Holles</hi> Hand
and Seal, acquainting me that he had given the <hi>Lords Secretary,</hi> as his accustom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Fee, five <hi>Guyneas,</hi> and left the consideration of his diligence to my own Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
I returned him seven <hi>Guyneas,</hi> and the Instrument withal to be altered,
the <hi>Clark</hi> in drawing it having committed a mistake, naming <hi>Thomas Godwyn
Vicar</hi> of St. <hi>Peters</hi> instead of <hi>Vicar</hi> of St. <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Iacobs Church;</hi> which recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
amendment of that error was sent back to me. I came divers times to
make offer to his <hi>Lordship</hi> of my service, and to render him thanks for this so
ample a favour, but his <hi>Lordship</hi> being either beyond Seas, or in the Country at
such times as I was in <hi>London,</hi> I had not the sight of my <hi>Worthy Patron.</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49426:10"/>
his being one of the <hi>Five Members</hi> filled my mind with inauspicious jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,
fearing that he could not be washt white with all those <hi>Sacred Lavers</hi> of
<hi>Royal Clemency and Grace</hi> wherein he floated, who scorned to publish any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognitions
of the Horrid Indignities and Affronts thrown upon an Incomparable
<hi>Prince.</hi> Within three years after my becoming a <hi>Chaplain</hi> (to a <hi>Lord,</hi> whom I
could not love, neither was very solicitous to know) Dr. <hi>Ironsides</hi> died and the
truly Heroick Dr. <hi>Carleton</hi> (now <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Chichester</hi>) succeeded. He obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the <hi>Synagogues of Satan</hi> to be more in esteem and frequented than the
<hi>Temples of our everblessed Redeemer,</hi> and the insolent behaviour of those that
were trained up in those <hi>Nurseries of Pride and Mischief,</hi> with a <hi>truly Episcopal Zeal</hi>
laboured the suppression of them. These endeavours must be supposed to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
not only with the utmost reproaches of a Calumniating and Viperous
Generation, but also all the sly Arts of Revenge. Which nevertheless could
not reach his <hi>Lordship;</hi> and therefore they consult how to wound him through
the sides of the <hi>Obedient Clergy.</hi> Of whom likewise two only appeared open to
their attempts, the Reverend Mr. <hi>Pleydel Rector</hi> of St. <hi>Peters Curch</hi> there, and
now <hi>Archdeacon</hi> of <hi>Chichester,</hi> and my self. In conclusion Mr. <hi>Pleydell</hi> also brake
the Snare, but that laid for me was of greater strength. For the <hi>Lord Holles</hi> denied
the Signing and Sealing the beforementioned Instrument, and expresly before the
late <hi>Lord Chancellor</hi> accused me of forgery. His <hi>Lordships Secretary</hi> was said to
be gone into <hi>France,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Melsam</hi> was removed and not to be heard of. A
pretence was likewise formed to the <hi>Lord Chancellor</hi> that I held two Benefices by
the means of this forged Qualification, and that St. <hi>Philips</hi> in <hi>Bristol</hi> was lapsed
into the <hi>Kings</hi> Hands by my accepting another Benefice, being not legally ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
to hold a Plurality. One Mr. <hi>Thomas Cary</hi> was by the forwarding and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derhand
assistance of the <hi>Holy Rabble,</hi> preferred to be a Petitioner for a presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
on the account of the Lapse, and the <hi>Lord Chancellor</hi> exasperated with the
<hi>Lord Holles</hi>'s Complaint and other Calumnies (requisite at such a time for
compleating such a Project) would not receive my Addresses, petitioning either
for a new Presentation to correct what might be pretended to be error, or a sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pension
of Mr. <hi>Carys</hi> Presentation, until the <hi>Lord Holles</hi>'s <hi>Secretary</hi> should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to <hi>England,</hi> when I doubted not to clear my self of the imputation. Mr. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
being presented, I wrote to the <hi>Bishop</hi> to entreat his Lordship to forbear in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituting
him, for that I was assured by good Counsel that my Title was good,
and that I resolved to defend it. His <hi>Lordship</hi> received my Letter very joyful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and for a while denied Mr. <hi>Cary</hi> Institution. But by some artifice two of
my Friends were wrought upon to believe that his <hi>Lordships</hi> rejecting Mr. <hi>Cary's</hi>
Presentation, would highly redound to his <hi>Lordships</hi> injury by incensing the
<hi>Lord Chancellor,</hi> who hereby would be compelled to complain of the <hi>Bishop</hi> to
His <hi>Majesty</hi> and the <hi>Council-Table.</hi> That the <hi>Bishop</hi> would hereby incur His <hi>Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties</hi>
Displeasure, and be so far from promoting my interest, that he would ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
me utterly uncapable of future favour, which would be the consequence of
Submission, and room made for it in my <hi>Lord Chancellors</hi> Breast by Friendly Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation.
This plausibly told to these two Gentlemen, (whose Names I forbear to
mention, in regard of the trouble which the discovered fraud gave them) and by Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
free from injurious intentions, to whom it had been derived from many and
different tempers, they readily deliver the same to the <hi>Bishop</hi> as their perswasion, and
his <hi>Lordship</hi> thinking it safest, and best conducing to the growth of my hopes, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
Mr. <hi>Cary.</hi> Half an hour had not past after his receiving Institution e're
a Letter to his <hi>Lordship</hi> from me was brought with the news, that I had proved
the Qualification to be Signed and Sealed by the <hi>Lord Holles,</hi> and that Mr. <hi>Lord
Chancellor</hi> would be assured thereof the next or second day by the <hi>Lord Holles,</hi>
who promised to make my <hi>Lord Chancellor</hi> a visit on purpose to clear my inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence.
The <hi>Bishop</hi> was not more joyous at the removal of the <hi>Lord Holles</hi>'s mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apprehensition,
than afflicted with his last Act, and that he was induced to it
before he consulted me. But he could not recall what was done, therefore he
advises whether there were yet no remedy left. To this he was answered,
<hi>That although no other</hi> Patron, <hi>might revoke his Presentation after Institution, yet
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49426:10"/>
the</hi> King <hi>might before Induction.</hi> Whereupon his <hi>Lordship</hi> immediately dispatch
an Order to the Churchwardens not to deliver to Mr. <hi>Cary</hi> the Keys of the
<hi>Church,</hi> nor suffer him to be inducted. But this wrought no cure; for the
before named <hi>Thomas Warren</hi> by Ladders, had put up a Boy upon the Roof of
the <hi>Church,</hi> which Boy went in at the Steeple Window, and down by a Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope
into the <hi>Church,</hi> and opened a door which was only bolted within, and
Mr. <hi>Thomas Palmer</hi> (so famous for his service to the late <hi>Parliament-General
Blake,</hi> for his holding the Church of <hi>All Saints Bristol,</hi> which was the right
of that Reverend, truly Loyal and Orthodox Mr. <hi>George Williamson</hi> ejected thence
by Sequestration, and no less nototious for his scandalous piecemeal Conformity
in the <hi>Churches,</hi> wherein he hath been concerned since the Restauration of the
<hi>Church of England,</hi> his private wheedling of Nonconformists, and publick resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of his <hi>Diocesan</hi> in his charitable endeavours of Regulation) this Mr. <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>
was ready at the violation of the <hi>Church,</hi> and did induct Mr. <hi>Cary,</hi> and (if
I may inoffensively write what I only conjecture) probable reasons prompt me
to speak him the principal Contriver. Mr. <hi>Cary</hi> thus got into Possession, I that
had nothing left wherewith to sustain a necessitous life, must either quietly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquish
my right, or foolishly contend against one that fought me both with my
own weapons, and those of a rich and insulting Party.</p>
            <p>But now I must return to shew by what Providence the <hi>Lord Holles</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
convinced that there was no Forgery in this matter, unless in him or them
who were guilty of framing the Accusation. Waiting on a certain day upon
Sir <hi>Iohn Baber,</hi> (who was divers times pleased to treat me with the respects of
a Kinsman, and was a Neighbour and intimate of that <hi>Lords</hi>) he advised me by no
means to frequent the way through <hi>Coven-Garden,</hi> should my business thereabout
be never so urgent; for he understood that the <hi>Lord Holles</hi> would certainly
take me up with a Warrant, and prosecute me to the Pillory for Forgery. I
could not but be enraged hereat, and many suddain conceptions traversing my
mind without order, I nevertheless without much hesitation replyed to Sir. <hi>Iohn,</hi>
that my innocence would protect me, and did now render me fearless; that I
would either presently, or at the first opportunity of admittance shew my self to
his <hi>Lordship</hi> and (if he attempted or mentioned any such thing) let him know
how much I dared contemn the threatnings, and could glory in the sufferings
of further proceedings. Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> blamed me as very ill advised, earnestly dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
me from such dangerous rashness. His Counsel nevertheless had not prevalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
but I took my leave of him, and for some time walkt under the <hi>Piazza</hi> before
his <hi>Lordships</hi> Door until I had digested some necessary considerations which then
exercised my thoughts. While I was thus walking my Brother Mr. <hi>Morgan Godwyn</hi>
a Person in Orders, and now <hi>Vicar</hi> of <hi>Bulkington</hi> in <hi>Warwickshire</hi> past along, to
whom I related Sir <hi>Iohns</hi> words and my own resolution. My Brother approving
my intent, went with me to his <hi>Lordship,</hi> who was so far from menacing, that very
complementally he desired us to sit and talkt very much like a good natured Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
who would not willingly destroy a Pilcher or Spart. In discourse he
chanced to use the name of Mr. <hi>Newman.</hi> Now I had formerly been to wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his <hi>Lordship,</hi> but missing him met with his <hi>Secretary</hi> and Mr. <hi>Francis Melsam</hi>
before mentioned, with whom sitting, as they talkt (though of matters not
concerning me) twice or thrice they repeated the name of Mr. <hi>Newman.</hi> Which
that I should remember some years afterwards, moved me to the greater thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
to my <hi>Gracious Preserver,</hi> in regard it surmounts my reason. But I (remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
it) had spent much time in enquiry about the <hi>Court</hi> and other places for
Mr. <hi>Newman,</hi> although to no purpose. My fancy stedfastly perswaded me that
this Gentleman either knew what his <hi>Lordship</hi> had done, or could direct me to
Mr. <hi>Melsam,</hi> which would be equivolent. After so much labour in vain his
<hi>Lordship</hi> puts the discovery in order, which more justly and ingeniously he
had never occasioned. He speaking of Mr. <hi>Newman,</hi> I soon told his <hi>Lordship,</hi>
That I was confident that Mr. <hi>Newman</hi> knew the Hand and Seal of the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to be his <hi>Lordships</hi> Act. <hi>Doth Mr.</hi> Newman (saith he) <hi>know any thing of
it? Well, Mr.</hi> Godwyn, <hi>I will send to speak with him to morrow. But I cannot
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49426:11"/>
believe I did it, for although the Hand be very well counterfeited, yet I am assured
that I never had such a Seal in my life time, but pray come again to morrow in
the Evening, and I will tell you what Mr.</hi> Newman <hi>saith.</hi> I departed with this
Order, but had not so much silly patience to wait until his <hi>Lordships</hi> Meanders
and Intricacies should entangle the Gentleman. Therefore enquiring of his <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships</hi>
Porter we found his habitation to be in the <hi>Palace Yard</hi> at <hi>Westminster,</hi> the
Gentleman to be a <hi>Iustice of the Peace,</hi> and a <hi>Barester</hi> of the <hi>Temple.</hi> We first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
to know whether he had at any time heard of one Mr. <hi>Thomas Godwyn</hi>
Vicar of St. <hi>Philips</hi> in <hi>Bristol?</hi> He answered, <hi>Yes. Did you, Sir, ever hear that
he was Chaplain to the</hi> Lord Holles? He replied, <hi>I know it. But pray, Gentlemen,
why do you enquire this of me? Because</hi> (as we answered) <hi>it is made a doubt whether
the</hi> Lord Hollis <hi>did ever qualifie him or not, it being reported that what he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
as his</hi> Lordships <hi>Act is meerly forged. It is</hi> (saith he) <hi>no such thing; I saw
the</hi> Lord Holles <hi>Sign and Seal it at</hi> Somerset House, <hi>for the Secretary being sent
about his</hi> Lords <hi>business, left it there with me, the Writting having three blanks,
which I my self filled up; and when it was to be Sealed the Secretary having forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
to leave the Seal, his</hi> Lordship <hi>askt my advice whether another Seal were not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient?
upon my answer that it was, his</hi> Lordship <hi>borrowed his Son Sir</hi> Francis
Holles'<hi>s Seal, and therewith Sealed it. Moreover</hi> (saith he) <hi>by mistake the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
was penned as directed to</hi> Thomas Godwyn <hi>Vicar of St.</hi> Peters, <hi>and in
regard of this error was remitted to be amended, which I saw done in my</hi> Lords <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
and instead of St.</hi> Peters <hi>was inserted St.</hi> Philip and Jacob. I then inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him that I was the Person, telling him likewise of my danger, and entreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him the trouble to certifie his <hi>Lordship</hi> with what he knew and had spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.
He presently performed it, his <hi>Lordship</hi> seeming to hear it with astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
But that which more astonisht me, was the borrowed posture of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
gravity, which he put on to cover the former denial; for it is most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible
that (Sir <hi>Francis Holles</hi>'s years then considered) his <hi>Lordship</hi> knew not
his Sons Seal, which he must have seen probably above one thousand, at least di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
hundred times. His <hi>Lordship</hi> further pretended much sorrow, that he had
wronged me by so unhappy a mistake, but although he conclnded himself sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized
some way or other when he set his Hand to the Writing, yet seeing I had
suffered thereby in my Reputation and Fortune, he would upon his <hi>Honour</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
his utmost to redeem them, both with the <hi>Lord Chancellor</hi> and otherwise.
I entreated a short Certificate of this from his <hi>Lordship</hi> to the <hi>Lord Chancellor;</hi>
to which he replied, Mr. <hi>Godwyn, I will readily do more than that, and will on
purpose go to morrow to my</hi> Lord Chancellor, <hi>to testifie your integrity.</hi> I desired
his <hi>Lordship</hi> to excuse himself that trouble, a short Letter from him being as sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory
to my <hi>Lord Chancellor</hi> as his oral testimony. But he answered, Mr. <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyn,
suspect me not, I will upon my Honour speak to my</hi> Lord Chancellor, <hi>and set
you upright in his esteem.</hi> But here we have place to observe, that sometimes men
are possest with very thin and soft thoughts of Honour, when their words make
them seem impregnable against the temptations of vitious and malitious popula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
The <hi>Lord</hi> at the time promised came to my <hi>Lord Chancellor,</hi> but (as the
following discourse will demonstrate) was so far from the least endeavour of
wiping of the Stain, with which he discoloured me, that contraywise (think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what was done already to be insignificantly regardless) such additions of
Scandal and Notorious Debaucheries were delivered into my <hi>Lord Chancellors</hi>
hand in memorial (I would call it a Libell if a Noble Hand were not in some
measure concerned in it) containing a whole sheet of Paper, written on both
sides, that no wretched Criminal in <hi>Newgate</hi> could be laden with more. It was
more than a year after e're I could learn from whose hand this Paper came; but
when I knew it, no Act (except the thought of the Commission of any of those
objected against me) could more seize me with horror. I came to Mr. <hi>Thynne</hi>
(one of my <hi>Lord Chancellors Secretaries)</hi> very joyfully suspecting nothing of the
Policy of the Upstart Vulgar in the Constitution of Nobility, to overwhelm the
memory of past injuries by the accumulation of greater. Mr. <hi>Thynne</hi> produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
this Paper, I desired of him, and presently after of Dr. <hi>Sharp</hi> to know who
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49426:11"/>
was the Author, and what were the means of Justification, of which I was
solicitous out of self assurance, that no proof or probability of such guilt could
rest upon me. They answered that they could not satisfie or direct me in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
At length walking in my <hi>Lords</hi> Gallery with the <hi>Doctor</hi> my great vexation
turned to suddain laughter, which he seemed to behold with more trouble
than he did my discontentedness, and desires to know what might cause a change
so suddain. I answered, it was the remembrance of a Dystich in <hi>Hudibras,</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>Thus Iustice while it winks at Crimes,</l>
                  <l>Stumbles on Innocence sometimes.</l>
               </q>
The <hi>Doctor</hi> demanded what I meant thereby; I answered, that it was one pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
in that list of accusations, and that I would (if he pleased) relate unto him
a Peice of Impudence scarce to be parallel'd, yet nothing more signally accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and rewarded. I shewed him the Article, desiring him to hear what I had
more to say.</p>
            <p>On a certain evening in the Summer season near eight of the Clock, Mr. <hi>Cary</hi>
(now presented by My. <hi>Lord Chancellor</hi> to St. <hi>Philips</hi> Vicaridge) with three
Country Gentlemen, (who intended to take Horse at the Lamb at <hi>Lawfords Gate</hi>
near my Vicaridge House) and a <hi>Citizen</hi> called upon me, desiring me to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
them to that Place and partake with them of a Glass of Sherry. I denied
not, but after each mans Club of half a Pint, I paid my own and Mr. <hi>Carys</hi> shot,
and returned home, and was in my Bed by one quarter after nine of the Clock
at farthest. A merry vein took the rest and held them there until six the next
morning. The rest retired to what Lodgings they could get; Mr. <hi>Cary</hi> only
and the Citizen went home. I received from the lips of the Citizen and two
of the Country-men at what high rates they had drank, and in what a trim they
parted, they prefacing their story with these words, <hi>It's well you departed so soon.</hi>
I could speak more plainly, but do not judge it requisite. Only I add, That the
Authors of the Libel knowing the time of our ingress into the Tavern, and the
time of my departure, must necessarily know my departure home in season,
and consequently my not being with the Company at their breaking up, and
Mr. <hi>Carys</hi> being there till the last minute of the stay made by the rest. Yet my
reservedness was traduced and punished for idleness and intemperance, and Mr. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rys</hi>
night Studies met with the recommendations of the <hi>Saints,</hi> the Patronage of a
great <hi>Lord,</hi> and by their means a remarkable reward.</p>
            <p>I do not think that the <hi>Lord Holles</hi> did himself frame that Paper of Articles;
but whether in consultation with the <hi>Bristol Agitants</hi> he did not encourage it,
I dare not against my opinion affirm. I only affirm his Promise beforementio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
made to me upon his <hi>Honour,</hi> was either never, or at least not at the time
Promised performed. And I have great reason to think that he never intended
the Performance. For Sir <hi>Iohn Baber,</hi> some little while after telling me, that
the <hi>Lord Holles</hi> would return me the Instrument, with what indorcement should
be necessary for the vindication of my repute among my Friends, (such as might
probably think amiss of me, when fame was grounded upon so great authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty)
the <hi>Lord</hi> acknowledged that he did promise it to Sir <hi>Iohn,</hi> but being then
busie will'd me to come again, and that he would look for it, and lay it aside
for me against my next coming. I confess I expected not performance, but
had a desire to make a through inspection into the nature of a <hi>five Member Man</hi>
changed. At my next and last coming his <hi>Lordship</hi> told me that he did make a
promise to Sir <hi>Iohn Baber,</hi> but through forgetfulness of the Promise, on a certain
night being in a passion he burnt it, but truly was exceedingly sorry for it. And
this being the word of a <hi>Lord</hi> I was bound to believe it, although I should other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
have thought the sorrow such as needed the <hi>Doctors</hi> consolation to his <hi>groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Board.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I became apprehensive what <hi>Honor</hi> and <hi>Promises</hi> were in the esteem of them
that had dared to lift up their hands against <hi>Gods Sacred Vicegerent,</hi> and was
left to the remedy of Prayer for deliverance from all such for the future. But
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49426:12"/>
whither to betake my self I knew not, having neither money nor imployment.
Yet I had not long waited when the Reverend and my kind Friend Dr. <hi>Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roffe</hi>
took me down to <hi>Shrivenham</hi> in <hi>Barkshire</hi> to officiate there as his Curate:
Where for some months I lived very quietly and pleasantly, having no <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natical</hi>
broyls, entangled with no Law Suits, nor pestred with daily passing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midst
the throngs of screwed faces distorted with hypocrisie, malice and the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of ill Consciences. But after some time spent there, my singular good <hi>Lord</hi>
Dr. <hi>Carleton Bishop of Bristol</hi> procured me a small Rectory of forty pound <hi>per
annum</hi> called <hi>Filton</hi> within four miles of <hi>Bristol,</hi> wishing me to be contented
therewith until some better opportunity shewed it self.</p>
            <p>During the time of Mr. <hi>Cary's</hi> Possession, divers Persons learned in both the
National and Canon Laws, advised me that St. <hi>Philips</hi> Vicaridge was not lapsed
when Mr. <hi>Cary</hi> became pretender to it by that Title, but that by my accepting
<hi>Filton</hi> it became void and would be lapsed. I therefore resolved to take no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of it (if others should pass it without observation) until it were lapsed into
the <hi>Bishops</hi> disposal; at which time I readily received a Collation thereto from
his <hi>Lordship,</hi> and upon the 10th day of <hi>Iune,</hi> in the year 76. (as I take it) was
peaceably inducted into the <hi>Church</hi> by Mr. <hi>Archodeacon Pleydel</hi> before named, six
<hi>Vestry men</hi> (the <hi>Church-wardens</hi> being not at home) and some other substantial
<hi>Parishioners</hi> being present. From the <hi>Church</hi> I went to the Vicaridge House and
took possession thereof without the least opposition, and after some time spent
in it in discoursing I departed, first delivering the Keys of the <hi>Church</hi> and House
to the Parish Clerk in the sight of the <hi>Archdeacon</hi> and of those Vestry men and
Parishioners, who had accompanied me, to be kept for my use, and so went
home to <hi>Filton.</hi> In the morning I returned, and at the usual time began to
read Divine Service, and proceeded therein unto almost the end of the second
Lesson without any persons gain-saying or motion to the contrary, except that
Mr. <hi>Cary,</hi> while I was reading the <hi>Seraphick Hymn,</hi> went up into the Pulpit, and
after some stay there, being beckoned to by his Brother <hi>Iohn Cary</hi> (a factious bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
fellow) came down again, and with his Brother and <hi>Thomas Warren</hi> went
forth of the <hi>Church,</hi> and in a short space returned with about ten more in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.
Eight of these (Mr. <hi>Thomas Cary</hi> standing by, bidding and encouraging
them with promises of Indemnity) came to the Reading Desk, interrupting
and requiting me to cease Reading and come down. One took the <hi>Bible,</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the <hi>Service Book</hi> from before me; others pluckt me by the right Arm,
and some by the right Leg, and in so violent a manner drew me out of the
Seat, that my right Leg was pulled down three steps the other remaining above
by reason of somewhat in the way hindring its moving, and their hasty Fury
allowing me no time to help my self. By their so spreading me I was put to
inexpressible torture, and am yet lame, and do doubt I shall continue so while
I live. Having drawn me out, they pluckt off the Surplice, and tare my Gown,
and set up their <hi>Idol</hi> in my place. This commotion began just at my reading
the stoning of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> out of the 14th of the <hi>Acts,</hi> the second Lesson for that
day being the Festival of St. <hi>Barnabas.</hi> I stayed in the <hi>Church</hi> until Mr. <hi>Cary</hi>
had ended his Sermon; but when I was come into the <hi>Church-yard,</hi> the
<hi>Constables</hi> (who it appeared were of the persons, who dealt so barbarously with
me) laid hands upon me to bring me before the <hi>Mayor</hi> for breaking the <hi>Peace,</hi>
and causing a disturbance and uproar in the <hi>Church.</hi> I told them that I would
willingly go with them, for that I thought my Reading <hi>Divine Service</hi> could be
no breach of <hi>Peace</hi> or cause of <hi>Disturbance;</hi> but was rather of opinion that their
Actions would be interpreted no less than riotous. Coming before Sir <hi>Robert Cann</hi>
then <hi>Mayor,</hi> they began a grievous complaint, That I had kept Mr. <hi>Cary</hi> out of
the <hi>Reading Desk,</hi> and had disturbed the Congregation, and had beaten them
being <hi>Constables,</hi> endeavouring to keep the <hi>Peace.</hi> When silence from their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
Falsities gave me liberty, I acquainted Sir <hi>Robert</hi> of my <hi>Coll<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tion, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction</hi>
and other <hi>Acts</hi> before related; and that I was no otherwise concerned
with any Person than by performing the Requisites of my Office according to the
injunctions of the <hi>Church,</hi> until these men interrupted and laid violent hands upon
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49426:12"/>
me. The <hi>Mayor</hi> told them, That whereas they had accused me, themselves
were the Offenders, requiring of them to appear the next morning at the <hi>Toul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zey.</hi>
Thither I came with Mr. <hi>Pleydell</hi> and such Witnesses as both saw my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
on the <hi>Saturday,</hi> and mine and the others demeanor on the <hi>Sunday;</hi> and
Mr. <hi>Cary</hi> came with his <hi>Ianizaries.</hi> There were present on the Bench the <hi>Mayor,</hi>
Sir <hi>Iohn Knight,</hi> Alderman <hi>Oliffe,</hi> Alderman <hi>Knight</hi> and others; to whom gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
an account of what had happened the preceding day, I desired the Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
might be punisht and I restored (as I ought) to possession of my <hi>Church.</hi>
Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> began to examine Mr. <hi>Pleydell</hi> by what Power he gave me Induction!
who answered, by virtue of a Mandat from the <hi>Bishop</hi> of the <hi>Diocess.</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn</hi>
desired him to shew it, that themselves and their Town Clerk reading it might
judge whether it were sufficient to enable him to do what he had done. That
Mr. <hi>Pleydell</hi> answered, That as soon as he had by an indorsement certified his Act,
he returned it me. Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> very fiercely demanded it of me; to whose demand
I replyed, That my business before them was not to examine the Legality
of the Title, but the force and violent retaking possession, and the Riot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
in a consecrated Place, upon a Person exercised only in officiating in the
<hi>Church;</hi> That Mr. <hi>Pleydell</hi> and so many other Witnesses proving my peaceable
Induction and Possession, I ought to be restored, and that Mr. <hi>Cary</hi> had his reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
at Law if Institution and Induction had been given me upon unjustifiable
grounds. Mr. <hi>Rumsey</hi> the Town Clerk squeekt it for Law, That if I refused to
shew my Title, Mr. <hi>Cary</hi> ought to be continued in Possession, So said Sir <hi>Iohn
Knight,</hi> and Alderman <hi>Iohn Knight.</hi> The <hi>Mayor</hi> and Alderman <hi>Oliffe</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
their Opinions, That my Possession being no forcible Entry, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to be taken without opposition, I ought to be reinstated in it, and
that they were no competent Judges of the validity of mine and Mr. <hi>Cary's</hi>
Titles, which must be left to a Superiour Decision. Mr. <hi>Rumsey</hi> continuing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
himself in the former Opinion, Sir <hi>Robert Canne</hi> persisted to declare his
thoughts to be as before the same, and said further to Mr. <hi>Rumsey,</hi> Mr. <hi>Town Clark,
You are by your Office to direct us what is Law, and if you misguide us, as I very
much suspect you now do, look you to it.</hi> Thus Malice, or lgnorance, or both pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing
against Justice and Reason, I was left to seek Redress where else I could
find it, none to be obtained there. But to (to make a shew of Justice) on the
<hi>Wednesday</hi> following a <hi>Iury</hi> was impannelled (every person thereof being noted
<hi>Conventiclers)</hi> to enquire of the <hi>Force;</hi> but no notice thereof was given me, nor
Mr. <hi>Pleydell,</hi> nor any other concerned with me. This <hi>Iury</hi> readily brought in
against me a Verdict of forcible Entry, and he who had twice made forcible En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
(first by putting a Boy by Ladders to go in at the <hi>Church Steeple</hi> to open the
Doors, and secondly, by pulling me violently our of the Reading Place, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
in Possession.</p>
            <p>But as to the Action in the <hi>Church</hi> I caused Mr. <hi>Cary,</hi> and as many more as I
knew engaged in it, to be cited in the <hi>Ecclesiastical Court,</hi> and prosecuted upon the
Statute of the 4th of K. <hi>Edward</hi> the 6th. This Prosecution was so managed, that
notwithstanding many arts used and delaying practises, Mr. <hi>Cary</hi> was forced to beg
an agreement. Which he did first by Mr. <hi>Horn,</hi> a Revetend Prebendary of the
Cathedral, coming to Mr. <hi>Pleydells,</hi> to entreat his intercession, whom Mr. <hi>Cary</hi>
presently followed into Mr. <hi>Pleydells</hi> House, vouchsafing (although a Thing other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
of most exalted Spirits) to desire him to interpose between us, and prevail by
a Reference to put an end to the difference. It was my hap to come thither a
little space before Mr. <hi>Horn.</hi> Mr. <hi>Pleydell</hi> telling him that I was in the House,
said withal they should have a speedy Resolve. The day before I received a
letter, acquainting me that my <hi>Lord Chancellor</hi> had received satisfactory accounts
of the injuries I sustained by the <hi>Lord Holles,</hi> and his Nonconformist Clients,
and had granted me a Presentation to a Benefice in <hi>Pembrokeshire,</hi> which was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
past the Seal. This Letter put me upon Consultation, whether it were best
for me to prefer this, or my <hi>Bristol</hi> Interest. In conclusion, my hopes of a more
peaceable life in <hi>Wales</hi> than <hi>Bristol,</hi> induced me to accept of an agreement, if such
were offered as would indifferently compensate my Charges. But before any
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49426:13"/>
thing done I judged it became me to receive my <hi>Diocesans</hi> directions; who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
my conceptions, this Treaty of accord being offered I embraced it. Not
as a Reference (which was very much urged) but if by proposals and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
on each side of the reasonableness of them any accommodation could be
wrought, I consented to a meeting in the Evening at Mr. Alderman <hi>Oleffe</hi>'s House
in order to it. The four present were alone mentioned the persons to meet; but
when I came thither I found Mr. <hi>Penwarden</hi> Rector of St. <hi>Stephens,</hi> Mr. <hi>Brent</hi> of
St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> and one Mr. <hi>Fry</hi> an ingenious Clergy-man, living in the City but not
beneficed. Between the time of my promise to meet and our meeting, Mr. <hi>Horn</hi>
had some conference with the <hi>Bishop</hi> concerning it, and brought with him a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
wherein his <hi>Lordship</hi> advised me to accept fifty pounds, which he found
Mr. <hi>Horn</hi> on Mr. <hi>Cary</hi>'s part inclined to give. It came open and had been seen
by the Company before my coming; and Mr. <hi>Horn</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cary</hi> had offered
forty five pounds. When I had read his <hi>Lordships</hi> advice, I was told what had
been proposed; to which I answered, That I should not have accepted so small
a sum as fifty pounds, if his <hi>Lordship</hi> had not thought fit that I should accept it,
I not being wont to call my <hi>Bishops</hi> judgement in question, especially his, of whose
very good affections towards me I was so well assured; but if that I were paid our
differences should be at an end. Forty five was the most they offered; but I
would abate nothing of fifty. At length Mr. <hi>Brent</hi> directing his discourse to me
in exhortations to Peace, I told him that I would refer the Cause to himself, if
he pleased by but three minutes reflection to consider it and make it his own case.
The rest of the Company perswaded Mr. <hi>Brent</hi> to undertake the decision of this
Matter, who in short time (after a second demand whether each of us would
abide his Judgement) ordered Mr. <hi>Cary</hi> to pay me the full fifty pounds. On the
other hand I was ordered the next <hi>Court day</hi> to withdraw my Suit commenced
in the <hi>Spiritual Court;</hi> secondly, to give Mr. <hi>Cary</hi> a General Release upon the
payment of the mony; thirdly, to sign, when tendred to me, such a Writing
as Counsel should advise, whereby I should be obliged, neither by my self, nor
any other persons by my procurement to molest Mr. <hi>Cary</hi> for any Act or Thing
done before the Sealing of it. I was herewith very well satisfied, and Mr. <hi>Cary</hi>
seemed so much more, giving Mr. <hi>Pleydell</hi> and Mr. <hi>Horn</hi> (not only verbally but
otherwise) great thanks for their pains taken in bringing us together, and to
Mr. <hi>Brent</hi> the like for ending the Controversie. Afterwards Mr. <hi>Cary</hi> and
I shaking hands, and all animosities laid aside, Mr. <hi>Cary</hi> desired of me
forbearance of payment of forty pounds of the fifty, for that he was not at
present furnisht with so much mony. I agreed to forbearance of thirty pounds
if he gave me Bond and Security for that sum, and paid me twenty pounds in the
mean time. At length it was concluded between us (this being on a <hi>Friday</hi>
Evening) that on <hi>Munday</hi> following he should pay me twenty pounds by two of
the Clock at the same House, and there likewise give me Security for the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thirty. This being private discourse when agreed upon, we related it to the
Company; before whom also he desired, as a kindness, my delivering to him
my Books of Accounts, and what Papers I had relating to the Parish Tithes and
Customs, which I promised. But when <hi>Munday</hi> came Mr. <hi>Pleydell</hi> and I appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at the Place, and Mr. <hi>Cary</hi> after some stay beyond the time appointed, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with his Brother <hi>Iohn Cary,</hi> I began to discourse him concerning our business,
telling him that I had performed according to Mr. <hi>Brents</hi> Order what I was on my
part to do, that is, I had in the presence of his own <hi>Proctor</hi> withdrawn the <hi>Cause,</hi>
and was ready to sign the Release and other Writing upon receit of the twenty
pounds and Security for the rest. He hereupon was no more the former Mr. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
who sued to me by his Friends, and himself for an Agreement, and seemed
as it were transported to another World upon the Composure, but began to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Security, affirming that he would never have any man engaged for him, but
if I would take his own Bond for payment within three years, that he would
give. And this was all the satisfaction I have received to this day. Sir <hi>Iohn Knight</hi>
I imagine upon good grounds out of his inveterate malice to me, disswaded him
from performance of his promise, whose counsel Mr. <hi>Cary</hi> finding himself out of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:49426:13"/>
danger by my withdrawing the Suit, did readily entertain, partly out of his own
disposition to integrity, partly in imitation of the pious Examples of the Parties,
which set up and protected him.</p>
            <p>This was done in <hi>August,</hi> but at the <hi>Michaelmas</hi> following I arrested him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Contract, by an Action taken out of that which they call there the <hi>Pye-Powder-Court.</hi>
My Attorney declaring on my behalf, a Rule being entred requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
their <hi>Plea</hi> by such a time, it was not filed or delivered in divers Courts after
the time limitted. Whereupon he being called in Court, and not appearing,
Judgement ought to have been entred on my behalf. But contrariwise there was
a juggle with the Clark of the Office (who was one of the Attureys for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant,
a thing (I suppose) scarcely justifiable) and another Atturney pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Plea</hi> to have been brought into the Office in <hi>Court</hi> time, which ought to
have been delivered, not only before that <hi>Court</hi> was called, but before three
<hi>Courts</hi> preceding that. I required my Atturneys to take no notice of their <hi>Plea,</hi>
but strictly to proceed to Judgement and Execution. But the <hi>Steward</hi> of the
<hi>Court</hi> refused to enter Judgement, and ordered a Jury to be Impanelled for the
Trial of the Cause the next Morning. I intended to have kept to the advantage
given me, resolving to prosecute the <hi>Steward</hi> in case he should continue partial;
but being perswaded that a Trial could not be my disadvantage in a Cause so
just and plain, I was prevailed with, especially hearing the Names of the <hi>Iury-men,</hi>
who in my Conscience I esteemed as honest. I confess I had also somewhat of
experiment to try upon Mr. <hi>Cary,</hi> whether he could be constant to his lately im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibed
Principles, and appear without blushing and astonishment, where such Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
as I had to produce should on Oath publish the gross turpitude of a Fact utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
inexcusable. At the Trial Mr. <hi>Horn,</hi> Mr. <hi>Pleydell,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Penwarden</hi> proved
exactly the three Considerations on which I had grounded my demand of fifty
pounds; But Mr. <hi>Brent</hi> having been very sickly some time before this Hearing
proved the three, but withall added a fourth Consideration, namely the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of my Books and Papers relating to the Parish, which as it was none of the
Considerations, but an aftermade Promise upon request, so neither was it decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for; yet it was proved that I had told Mr. <hi>Cary</hi> that I had brought them to
such a Place in <hi>Bristol,</hi> where he should receive them upon the payment of the
mony. Nevertheless Mr. <hi>Brents</hi> testifying this as a Consideration, I was Nonsuited
and the Jury discharged. Whether this Knack was really matter of Law, I do
not undertake to know; But the <hi>Iury-men</hi> and the rest of the standers by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted,
declaring that they thought it impossible that Mr. <hi>Cary</hi> should be guilty
of so manifest a piece of Knavery as was now laid open. For, alas! they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
esteemed him as some Rarity of <hi>Gods</hi> more especial Handywork, sent thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by an especial Providence. Nevertheless he altered not his Countenance,
but (as the <hi>Whore</hi> that <hi>Solomon</hi> mentions <hi>going away wiping her mouth,</hi> and saying
<hi>she had done no harm,</hi> so) he gaining by them cared not by what brand his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
were noted, and thought the shame would be worn out when the mony re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
in his Pocket, knowing withall that he had multitudes ready to blanch
his blackest deeds, especially in any thing of concern against me.</p>
            <p>If he had never desired an agreement, I had meerly as in respect to the Presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
to <hi>Poulchrohan</hi> in <hi>Pembrokeshire</hi> been a Gainer more than the mony promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
The death of the <hi>Bishop</hi> of St. <hi>Davids</hi> Dr. <hi>Lucy,</hi> and the late <hi>Archbishop</hi>
Dr. <hi>Sbelden</hi> soon after occasioning unfortunate and chargeable journeys and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
with the forementioned Law Charges in endeavouring to recover the fifty
pounds, caused me forty two pounds expence, besides the charge of a Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
serving the Cure, and demanding unreasonable rates (the Place and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
especially considered) besides the havock made of my Tithes in <hi>Church-war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens</hi>
disposing, and the ruine of the Parsonage House by my Predecessors Widow,
who did tear up and carry away the Boards and Timber of three Rooms entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and almost of a fourth, together with eight Doors of the House, and divers
Gates from off the Gleab Land, and other Wastes and Inconveniencies.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless at length I arrived at my Parsonage, where I met with Parisho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
who constantly frequented the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Sacraments,</hi> and among whom
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49426:14"/>
was no sort of <hi>Dissenter,</hi> nor any that seemed inclined to defraud or give me any
trouble in my Tithes or Dues. Their Conformity and peaceable Demeanour ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
gladded me: I began to overlook Fortune, and with disdain to view
her malignity, and to tell her that my prospect of a quiet life in that remote <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle</hi>
of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> was reparation for all her injuries, and strongly conceited my
self banisht out of the reach of misfortunes. But <hi>Faction,</hi> which searches the very
Abisses of <hi>Hell</hi> for Weapons to furnish its Armory, wherewith it dares attempt
upon <hi>Heaven,</hi> exercised its Faculties, and sent after me Executioners of my <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant
Tranquility.</hi> I thought that the <hi>Bristol</hi> mens Malice had satisfied it self with a
Lusty Revenge in my past losses and sufferings. But nothing is more apparent
than that <hi>Oppression</hi> suspecteth its own safety, if the <hi>Oppressed</hi> be not continually
beaten down with fresh blows and addition of weights. The frequent Commerce
between <hi>Bristol</hi> men and the Inhabitants of <hi>Milford Haven</hi> (where I dwelt) gave
them opportunity of enquiry by what Methods and Persons further mischief might
take its rage. And the first that I have heard of was in large offers of Rewards to
one Mr. <hi>Iohn Powel</hi> Town Clark of <hi>Pembroke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> (within the Liberties of which <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration</hi>
my Parsonage House standeth) tempting him to the apprehending of me
by the Town Warrants and Officers. I happened to fall into an intimacy of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
at my first coming into that Country with this Gentleman, whose near
Kinsman, and my incomparably kind Friend <hi>Nathariel Powel</hi> Esquire lived in
my Parish, at whose House I often met him, and in meeting, by degrees arrived
at the greatest Familiarity. He from time to time gave me intimation of designs
against me, and what Proposals and Answers were made. Concealing our Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
he heard the Invectives of those men (for I knew them not) whom the Party
at <hi>Bristol</hi> had employed as Factors. After two or three Congresses he began more
plainly to enquire into the nature of the Causes of Action, especially upon hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
great Rewards offered. At last he shook them off finding no material ground
for complaint, or any thing that could correspond with those motions so eager
and high in the beginning: they ran on very largely in discourses of my Debts,
and that I was Knavish, and would pay no man; but upon examination had no
Commission from any of my Creditors to demand or sue me for any sum, and
could produce nothing but trifling matters for Costs recovered in three Suits for
Tithes, wherein I could not proceed for want of mony after my ejectment out of
St. <hi>Philips.</hi> Only before parting he assured them, wherever I was concerned in
any just Debts, he was confident that I would carefully discharge them, time only
being in reason allowed in regard of my new and chargeable settlement; But that
if litigious causes of Action were framed, he would contribute his best advice and
help in my defence, rather than suffer me to be ruined by ill practises. However
they failed of Mr. <hi>Powel,</hi> they hit upon a surer instrument Mr. <hi>William Skirm,</hi> a
sort of perpetual <hi>Vndersheriff</hi> of <hi>Pembrokeshire,</hi> who by himself, Brothers, Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
or Clarks, seldom faileth of managing that Office at the rate he doth it. At
the time of these men being in that Country Mr. <hi>Thomas</hi> Brother of <hi>William Skirm</hi>
had the Name of <hi>Vndersheriff,</hi> and knew his Employment somewhat better than
his white Staff that he carried as the Signal of his Office. The <hi>Bristol Factors</hi> had
not so much Wit as Malice, but brought into <hi>Pembrokeshire</hi> Writs for Costs derect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the <hi>Sheriffs</hi> of <hi>Glocestershire</hi> and <hi>Bristol,</hi> which would no way serve the turn
there. But <hi>William Skirm</hi> knew how to gratifie them, resolving upon some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
fetches until he should be better furnisht with instructions from <hi>Bristol.</hi> This
I write as their own Confession at <hi>Caermarthen</hi> in Company of one, whom they
suspected not to know or have any acquaintance with me; And further as being
uncapable of provoking Mr. <hi>Skirm,</hi> (whom I had never seen, of whose name I
had never before heard, neither dwelt nearer to him than fourteen miles, the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
flowing betwixt) by any sort of injury that may be pretended in his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
or any relating to him.</p>
            <p>This first Project of <hi>William Skirm</hi>'s (for which the Asse his Brother as <hi>Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheriff</hi>
was a Cloak) was concerning a Bill of five pounds due to one Mr. <hi>Daniel
Lewis.</hi> This <hi>Lewis</hi> had been assigned payment in Corn according to his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
but whether by his own change of mind or being inveigled, in <hi>Iuly</hi> giveth
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:49426:14"/>
me notice that he expected payment in Mony and not in Corn. Necessity compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
me to entreat his forbearance till <hi>Michaelmas</hi> following, with which request he
departed seemingly very willing to comply. But upon the 29th day of <hi>August</hi> next
following a Daughter of <hi>Lewis</hi>'s (and servant to <hi>Essex Merrick</hi> Esquire, suspected
to be a principal Contriver with <hi>Skirm</hi>) came under pretence of discoursing me
concerning her Fathers Debt. Presently after her entry, one belonging to me came
and told me that there were Bayliffs near the House. The Door being shut,
<hi>Lewis</hi>'s Daughter whilst I was looking out at Window, was busie in opening the
Door, but was seen and prevented. The Chief Bayliff <hi>Henry David</hi> knockt at
the Door very furiously again and again, threatning to break it open, alledging
that he had power so to do, attempting the same with a wooden Bar lying near
the Dore. After these menaces he retired somewhat from the Door and made
Proclamation, (I heard the Words and divers of my Family besides hearing, saw
the postures) holding a large written Paper by the Corner. His Proclamation
was, <hi>Thomas Godwyn Clark, Rector of</hi> Poulchrohan, <hi>I require thee in the Kings Name
to come forth and surrender thy Body to me, as the Sheriffs Baily, upon pain of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion.</hi>
This he did thrice, and then came again to break open the Door, I
threatning to shoot any Person that should offer to break open any Door of my
House. In this manner he spent more than two hours, I in the mean time won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
how strange and different from those of other Countrys, were the ways of
proceeding in <hi>Pembrokeshire.</hi> At length my Man Servant driving home a Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>load
of Corn, the <hi>Bayliffs</hi> ran to him and seized the Horses. After many words
passing betixt them, <hi>Henry David</hi> striving to unharness them, they thrusting the
Man side, and the Man them, said the Man, <hi>My Master hath entrusted me with the
Horses, and I will lose my life rather than part with them without my Masters Order.</hi>
This no sooner said, but he knockt down <hi>David</hi> with the But end of a Pitchfork,
and after three or four dry blows drives the Cart to the place where it was to be
unladen. <hi>David</hi> rising up again, came after him with a drawn Sword, at which
my Servant exasperated, beat him more severely than before, and by accident
struck some skin from off his Arm. Before this, during the time of his blustering
about the House, I had sent to know what his business there was, with assurance
of giving due satisfaction to the Law when I knew what it required; and to this
I had no other answer, but that I must presently open my Doors, and surrender
my Person to him. But at last, upon my Servants coming, he received what his
behaviour demanded, and so departed. In returning he with <hi>Lewis</hi>'s Wife and
Daughter (the rest were vanisht) went to my beforenamed worthy Friend
Mr. <hi>Nathaniel Powels</hi> house to entreat some Cordial Water for this fainting Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutioner
of Mr. <hi>Skirms</hi> Laws. There he told a lamentable story, how the <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff</hi>
sending him with an Execution issued forth of the County Court, <hi>Daniel
Lewis</hi> Plaintiff, I and my Servant had beaten him and rescued the Horses taken
in Execution. Mr. <hi>Iohn Powel</hi> being present read the Execution, and the Bayliff
having shewed his Wounds and Bruises went away. This Execution was taken
out, no previous Attachment or Summons (one of the two being absolutely
necessary) being served in order to a Legal Trial; neither had I heard any thing
of a Law Suit with <hi>Lewis,</hi> or in the least suspected it. Moreover, the second of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember</hi>
following I caused the <hi>Cursitors Office</hi> to be searcht whether any Writ of
<hi>Iusticies</hi> (without which the County Court could not sue for any Debt or Account
above forty shillings) had been granted in this Case; which was certified not to
be granted. But this my sawciness in examining Mr. <hi>Skirms</hi> actions, which were
wont to be justifiable by his bare Will, made him excessively cholerick, and to
my face to threaten me <hi>That he would do my business.</hi> Yet <hi>Skirm</hi> and one <hi>Richard
Owen</hi> (a Soliciter in the County Court) thinking to Palliate the foulness of the
Act, gave out that <hi>David</hi> had no Execution, but an Original Attachment to serve;
all which appeared to be false, as well upon search into the proceedings of the
Court, as Mr. <hi>Iohn Powell's</hi> sight of the Execution.</p>
            <p>But I must return to look after <hi>Henry David,</hi> who in the way home conducting
the <hi>She Setter</hi> (Mr. <hi>Lewis</hi>'s Daughter) to her Master <hi>Essex Merricks</hi> House, the
complaint was made to this Worshipful Mr. Justice, who immediately granted
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49426:15"/>
forth his Warrant for apprehending me and my Man. The next morning <hi>(Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust
30.)</hi> the Constables took and brought me before this Gentleman, and one
Mr. (<hi>Thomas</hi> I think to be his name) <hi>LLoyd</hi> of <hi>Grove,</hi> who required of me two
Sureties for the Behaviour. I replying, that being a stranger in that Country
I could not every where procure Sureties, but if they saw good to believe me, I
wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d (this being <hi>Saturday</hi> in the afternoon) certainly on <hi>Munday</hi> following bring
them Security to Answer and Traverse whatsoever Indictment on any pretence
should be brought into Court. I explained to them <hi>Henry Davids</hi> words and beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
and assured them that I was not near him, but kept my self within the House,
and that he would send me no account wherefore he came thither, and that I
had no cause (if he had told me his business) to submit to an Execution, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
I had no notice to defend my Cause. Mr. <hi>Merrick</hi> answered, <hi>We know him
to be a great Rogue,</hi> but he hath sworn against you, and you must either give
good Bail or go to Prison. I thankt them for their respects to me as a Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
in refusing me a Credit than which none is more usually given to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
Persons, especially in a matter of Complaint by so notorious a Rogue as
they bespake him; and then the Constables guarded me to the Town of <hi>Pembroke.</hi>
These Justices, and most men inhabiting the County had known this <hi>Henry David</hi>
to have been divers times accused of Rapes, indicted and convicted of making ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests
and seizures without Warrant or Cause, of arresting two Widows, and not
allowing them time to procure Bayl, but carrying them into uncooth places, and
there proposing to compound the pretended differences, and release them upon
receiving satisfaction of his Lust. For these and other enormities the Judges had
fined him, and commanded that he should no more be suffered to act as
a <hi>Bayliff.</hi> But being so much the fitter instrument for Mr. <hi>Skirm,</hi> he was not in
the least discontinued. And this is the Man, and this is the Cause, for which I
must be disgracefully lead about by Constables from place to place, my word
esteemed of no weight, and for which I had been presently carried to Prison too
if Mr. <hi>Iohn Powell</hi> had not heard of it and came to my help. This my Friend did
not only come and voluntarily engage for my appearance, but having made some
discoveries of it, openly taxt and proved Mr. <hi>Merrick</hi> to be, if not a manager,
yet one that knew the contrivance. And to say truth, his carriage in this point
only (without the suspition of things of a later date to be mentioned hereafter)
are ground enough for me to believe the same.</p>
            <p>If here in my discourse pretending to be bent against <hi>Bristol</hi> Nonconformists
and their Agents, any seem to enquire what Mr. <hi>Merrick</hi> hath to do in it, my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
is, That although he hath obtained to be in <hi>Commission for the Peace,</hi> yet is
so far from being overzealous in the Cause of the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Church,</hi> that he is (like
the late <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>) all <hi>true Protestant,</hi> and out of his jealousie of <hi>Popery</hi>
creeping in the <hi>Church,</hi> knoweth how in his forms of Justice, Rates and Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
to scandalize and discourage strict Conformity, and to wink at Conventic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Liberty. His Father was a Dependant upon that grand <hi>Rebel</hi> the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Essex,</hi>
who lead <hi>Presbyterian Villany</hi> into the Field armed, with intent at once to destroy
and make Glorious their Great Master the best and kindest of men. The same
<hi>Earl</hi> was this <hi>Gentlemans Godfather,</hi> whence the <hi>Font</hi> delivered him <hi>Essex;</hi> And
how much a Favourer of those Factious Parties he hath been, those few true Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alists
of the County, who dare speak, will inform the inquisitive. But besides,
what hath been thus bred in the Bone, he hath also an inveterate hatred to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishmen</hi>
coming to plant in that Country; witness his many provocations of the
Stout, Loyal and Discreet <hi>Coll<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mordant,</hi> who could have no rest until his Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
tired moved him to qualifie Mr. <hi>Merricks</hi> Gall by bleeding him in the Thigh;
and witness his many Consultations how to ruine Mr. <hi>Bartlet</hi> (an eminent Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
there) and others, whom he calleth the Strangers, who come thither to
eat the Country mens Bread ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of their Mouths. Add to his private dislike of
these, my Crimes of Loyalty, Conformity and a remote derivation, his great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timacy
with <hi>William Skirm;</hi> and this Qustion hath its Solution.</p>
            <p>At the Assizes for the County held at <hi>Haverfordwest,</hi> and beginning <hi>Sept.</hi> the 1st
I appeared, where I met with one Mr. <hi>William Meare,</hi> who taking me aside, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:49426:15"/>
to know what was the Cause of the Clamour about <hi>Henry David</hi> I related
all to him as before; <hi>but</hi> (saith he) <hi>'tis said and affirmed that it will be sworn by</hi>
Daniel Lewis'<hi>s Daughter, that you threatned to shoot him; truly</hi> (I replied) <hi>Sir,
I called unto the Person, who threatned to break up my House, forbiding him, and
assuring him, That if he attempted it, I would shoot him. And would you have done
it?</hi> saith Mr. <hi>Mear; Indeed I would if I could.</hi> (I answered) <hi>I would not have
killed him, but if he had done any such thing, without satisfying me by what Warrant
he did it, I would have put some Peper in his Shins.</hi> He smiled and went away;
and (as I learnt afterward) was <hi>Foreman</hi> of the <hi>Grand Iury,</hi> before whom a Bill
of Indictment being brought, and <hi>Henry David</hi> swearing <hi>That after divers times
threatning to shoot him, at length I and my Man had wounded and beaten him;</hi> the
Jurymen (as five of them together told me the same day) out of a deep sense of
<hi>Davids</hi> many wicked Actions and vile course of life, did all refuse to find the
Bill except Mr. <hi>Meare,</hi> who told them, That although their reasons for rejecting
the Bill were otherwise good, yet now they were to be laid aside, for that he
himself heard me say <hi>I would have shot him if I could.</hi> This his alledging part
of truth prevailed with the rest to find the Bill.</p>
            <p>This Mr. <hi>Meare</hi> is also in <hi>Commission for the Peace;</hi> but his ways of keeping the
<hi>Peace</hi> are very uneasie to many men, particularly to Mr. <hi>Thomas LLoyd</hi> (a meek
tempered Gentleman) Rector of the Parish wherein Mr. <hi>Meare</hi> lives. But I
need say no more of him; for there is scarce any Gentleman or Clergyman in
the County but doth either fear or hate his Company. Mr. <hi>Merricks</hi> prejudices
proceed from an old Leaven of Religion, Party and Extraction; But this Mans
either out of a delight in trampling down and walking over ruines, or a desire
of augmenting his private fortunes by any of those <hi>means</hi> which himself terms
<hi>honest.</hi> The Scheme of his Religion is not yet finisht, and it's feared is a Task
too difficult to be compleated before his death. He is a man of such impartiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that when they lye in his way he spares not Neighbours more than Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
nor Strangers than Neighbours, but upon displeasure they must all alike feel
his Correction.</p>
            <p>Besides this Indictment, by <hi>Skirms</hi> advise <hi>David</hi> also sued me in an <hi>Action</hi> of
<hi>Battery</hi> and <hi>Assault;</hi> and I resolved to stand the Traverse of the one and Trial
of the other; but was disappointed by being arrested in <hi>Bristol,</hi> and forced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
my self up into the <hi>Kings Bench Prison.</hi> Nevertheless I took due course
for defence, but where Mr. <hi>Skirm</hi> is concerned due courses seldom take place.</p>
            <p>But while I was at the <hi>Assizes,</hi> having occasion to go into the Shop of one
Mr. <hi>Hents</hi> an <hi>Apothecary</hi> (who knew not me nor I him) as I sate in it some time,
I saw a man holding up his Arm in a string to pass to and fro through the Shop.
Hearing him make some complaints to the <hi>Apothecary,</hi> and the <hi>Apothecary</hi> to call
<hi>Henry David,</hi> I enquired of him what he was, and what was the matter with
him. He answered, it is <hi>Henry David</hi> the Bayliff whom the Minister of <hi>Poul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chrohan</hi>
had grievously beaten and wounded. I desired to speak with him, and
coming to me cringing and scraping with abundance of respect, upon request he
related to me the story of his adventure, but with a mixture of notorious fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoods,
especially of my laying hands upon him. When he had ended I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
of him whether he knew me. He answered, <hi>No, if it please your Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi>
(I desire to be pardoned in regard 'twas his very expression) <hi>I never saw
your Worship before in my life.</hi> Being twice more desired to recollect himself, he
still affirmed that he neither knew me nor had ever seen me, but believed my
Worship was one of the Reverend Prebendaries of St. <hi>Davids</hi> Cathedral. This was
again and again repeated before the <hi>Apothecary,</hi> his Wife, his <hi>Wives Mother,</hi> and
the Servant <hi>Maid.</hi> At length I discovered who I was, saying to the four standers
by, <hi>Is not this a Prime Rascal to swear against a man, whom he never knew nor saw?
I am</hi> Thomas Godwyn <hi>Rector of Poulchrohan.</hi> Upon which words, without a
word retort, he shufled away. At the same <hi>Assizes</hi> Mrs. <hi>Wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iams,</hi> Wife to the
<hi>Vicar</hi> of <hi>Rosemarket</hi> in <hi>Pembrokeshire,</hi> made Oath before Sir <hi>Francis Manley,</hi> Chief
Justice of that Circuit that this <hi>Henry David</hi> came and brake open her House after
nine of the Clock in the Evening, requiring submission to his leud Offers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:49426:16"/>
swearing he would lye with her before he went out of the Huose, and after using
violence with entreaty, she chanced to thrust him down backward over a Stool,
and escaping out of the House, was compelled to lye hid in the standing Corn
without Clothes for the space of three hours, he in the mean time searching the
House, and round about the House, swearing as before, and at his departure with
horrid execrations vowing he would have her another time although now he
missed. This poor Gentleman Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> being imprisoned for many years
arrears of <hi>Tenths</hi> due before he became Incumbent, and the House standing solitary
encouraged this Villain to this impudent attempt. And who now can doubt but
that the eminent worth of <hi>Henry David</hi> was Mr. <hi>Merricks,</hi> Mr. <hi>Meares</hi> and
Mr. <hi>Skirms</hi> Excitement to a generous vindication of his injuries, and the wounds
given him by one, whom he never saw nor knew?</p>
            <p>By this denial of his knowledge of me, and the Witnesses of his behaviour
at my House, I thought my self sufficiently fortified for defence. But being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> somewhat longer than I conjectured, by the exorbitant
demands of <hi>Coling</hi> the <hi>Marshall,</hi> and my want of mony, I could not recover
home before the Trial, but the Cause was lost for want of defence, and twenty
five pound odd shillings Execution taken out against me. And although I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
not home soon enough for a Trial, I timed my removal from the <hi>Bench</hi>
to another <hi>Prison,</hi> and on <hi>Michaelmas</hi> Day, immediately before Evening Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
I was arrested by one Mr. <hi>William Morgan,</hi> that year <hi>Vndersheriff,</hi> or rather
Mr. <hi>Skirms</hi> Deputy. I often desired to know for what I was arrested, but was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied,
only was told I should know soon enough, and so forthwith was carried
to the <hi>Haven</hi> side to pass over for <hi>Haverford-West,</hi> where the County Prison was.
But at the <hi>Haven</hi> brinks <hi>Morgan</hi> surrendred me to three of his Bayliffs after he
had, sitting upon a Bank, written this <hi>Warrant.</hi>
            </p>
            <floatingText type="letter">

                  <p>By Virtue of a <hi>Capias</hi> to me directed out of the <hi>Great Sessions</hi>
for the County of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> these are to require you to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
the Body of <hi>Thomas Godwyn Clerk,</hi> and him in
safe Custody to keep and deliver to the <hi>Goaler</hi> of the County
Prison at <hi>Haverford-West,</hi> until he shall be thence legally
discharged.</p>

               </body>
            </floatingText>
            <p>So that I was again to be apprended, who was before arrested, no Plaintiff
named, no Cause of Action mentioned. The <hi>Bayliffs</hi> who were my Guardians
told me that I was taken in execution at <hi>Henry Davids</hi> Suit, and that the <hi>Sheriff</hi>
would be with me on the Morrow; on the third day <hi>Morgan</hi> comes to me, I
having been kept at the <hi>Goalers</hi> House in the mean time. Then upon demand
he told me as the <hi>Bayliffs</hi> before, and ordered me to be put into the Prison.
Within an hour and half afterward I was committed to a Room, the delicacies
whereof I intending to recite, do at first take leave to raise the Readers Exp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
The entrance was well fenced with Locks and Chains, the Room well
Boarded, and the Windows well Barred, but had never been Glazed. Bed or
Bedsted there was none, neither Fire, nor Chair, nor Stool, or any kind of Seat
except a Plank with three Legs, and that of an odious House of Office, from
which was no conveyance but into the Room beneath, which having not been
cleansed above eight years before, stunk beyond any thing to be named. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49426:16"/>
whether there was no other Room, the Goaler answered me, <hi>yes,</hi> but
that that was appointed for me as the best. Asking further what I must lye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
he pointed, <hi>There's the Bed,</hi> which was an heap of Dust mixt with some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that only shewed it had been Straw, and (as it appeared) had been the
recumbency of some poor Wretches my Predecessors in Adversity. I required
him to procure me some fresh Straw, he told me that he could not, but that
the Bed was good enough, and that many an Honest Man had lain there without
grudging. I offered to give a Shilling for two Peny worth, and pay the Carrier
besides; He told me I must be contented until <hi>Munday</hi> (this being on <hi>Saturday</hi>
evening) and then I should have some. No perswasions could prevail to the
contrary; So I was forced to walk all night, excepting that when excessive wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riness
overtook me, I sate on the low Tripod, and with my Back against the
Stone Wall never Plaistered fell asleep, till awakened again with the violence of
the cold I arose to walking; and so by turns I passed the nights and one day. I
hoped to have prevailed with my tender-hearred Governour on <hi>Sunday</hi> morning
to furnish my Chamber; but in vain. When eating time required that exerceise,
the loathsomeness of the Place made the thoughts of Meat loathsome also; but
necessity compelling I bespake it of an Inkeepers Wife dwelling opposite to the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
but when brought the Goaler would not attend to open the Door, but it
must be thrust in at an hole in the Door, through which a Trencher or Plate
could not be delivered. However on <hi>Munday</hi> I was prosperous, and tumbled in
much clean Straw, and on <hi>Tuesday</hi> I had Bedcloathes sent; (but the Keeper would
not open the Door to receive them till two days after.) In time also I mitigated
the ill sents by snuffing up the wind blowing in at the holes called Windows, and
by smelling to the Iron Bars in them.</p>
            <p>In this condition I was the most part of three weeks. Some few times I got
out by the Priviledge of Treating with my incomparable Adversary. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
under Execution, I saw no hopes of deliverance but by composition. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I procured some Friends to motion it and bring him to me. Not to the
Prison, for his Nose would not brook it, but I was sent for twice to an Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house.
In discourse the first time he seemed inclined to take ten pounds, but
made no positive agreement. But at his second coming complained that Mr. <hi>Skirm</hi>
and his Master <hi>Margan</hi> the <hi>Sheriff</hi> (as he called him) had heard of his being up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
agreement with me, and threatned to turn him out of his Office if he agreed
with me a peny beneath the full Execution. At the first hearing I imagined
this to be a device to squeeze me harder, but I found the contrary, that he was
willing to discharge me for ten pounds, but dared not, unless any way might be
found whereby he might do it as if ignorant of the Law. This I said he had
done already (as I judged) by calling me, being in Execution at his Suit, out
of the liberties of the Prison, and even in another <hi>County; Haverford-West</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a <hi>Town</hi> and <hi>County</hi> of it self. This I knew to be so in <hi>England,</hi> but knew
not what was right in <hi>Wales,</hi> but I was confirmed that it was a Legal Discharge for
the <hi>Plaintiff, Sheriff</hi> or <hi>Coaler</hi> to call or take a Prisoner charged in Execution out
of the Liberties of the Prison, to which he was Legally Committed, and that
for the same he could not Legally be retaken or recommanded to Prison. This ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
I had from <hi>William Philips</hi> of <hi>Haithock</hi> Esq<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a <hi>Iustice of the Quorum,</hi> and a very
eminent Counsellor in that County, first by word of mouth to a friend of mine, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
under his hand. In fine, I was invited to the Eating of a Leg of Pork and a Goose
on <hi>Sunday</hi> the 17th of <hi>October,</hi> and in the morning the <hi>Goaler</hi> came to acquaint
me, that <hi>Henry David</hi> desired to speak with me, that there was a good Dinner
provided, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I delayed until I had Witnesses, which being at last five in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
to my liking, the <hi>Goaler</hi> renewing his request, I went with him. After Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
being very liberal in expences at the <hi>Goalers</hi> House, I was permitted to stay
out all night (resolving nevertheless not to return to the Prison without force)
and all the next day until four of the Clock, when I espied an Horse brought
for me, and set in the Place which I appointed, and so rode home. But the
next day in the evening Mr. <hi>Morgan</hi> with fourteen others came to enquire for me;
but not finding me pretended to retire, but went to <hi>Pembroke,</hi> leaving his <hi>Imps</hi> in
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:49426:17"/>
convenient Places to besiege me, and returned on the morrow with the <hi>Power
of the County,</hi> forty six or fifty in number. For being at <hi>Pembroke</hi> he informed
the <hi>Mayor</hi> and <hi>Burgesses</hi> of the Town that I had broken the Prison and escaped,
and Mr. <hi>Essex Merrick</hi> (allway forward in my concerns) as wisest Burger and
ablest Lawyer, acquainted the Corporation that they ought to assist the Sheriff,
and might justifie the breaking up any House where they knew me to be, and
take me. But I am advised (and it seemeth reasonable) that the <hi>Sheriff, Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dersheriff</hi>
or <hi>Goaler</hi> ought to have sworn before the Mayor that I brake the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
which none could, and the <hi>Vndersheriff</hi> going in to view the Prison before
he set forward from <hi>Haverford</hi> with his Company, himself said to the <hi>Goaler</hi>
(who probably told him so) <hi>I see no sign of any place or thing broken;</hi> this in the
the hearing of divers Witnesses (whom it occasion served) I can produce. But
without much consultation the <hi>Mayor (Matthew Bowen</hi> by name, a Person actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in Arms for several years against <hi>King Charles</hi> the first) commanded the
Townsmen to follow him with what Armes they had ready. So they came with
Musquets, Pistols, Swords, Pikes and Bills; and (I must confess) I resolved up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
defence and rather to dye in the midst of a Lawless Rabble, then without any
just Cause or Lawful Grounds to surrender my self to Execution, my death seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
inevitable if I should be carried back to that Prison, whence the very Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff
could not release me without the Consent of a bitterly engaged enemy. The
first Aggressors and Enterers must certainly have fallen, had not I been told that
the <hi>Mayor</hi> of <hi>Pembroke</hi> was at the Door desiring to speak with me. I opened
not the Door, but discourst as we stood, I within and he without. He told me
his Name and Character, and I knew his voyce. He desired me to cease threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
(I having before affirmed that I would kill the first Breakers up and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trers
of my House) and to deliver my self to the <hi>Sheriff.</hi> On the other hand I
required him as the <hi>Kings Lieutenant and Iustice of the Peace</hi> to see the <hi>Peace</hi> kept,
telling him, that before his appearance, I thought my self bound to preserve my
self in my own House as well as I could, but now left my self to him for Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
whom I should thank for doing his duty, and question for the breach of it.
But this wrought nothing; <hi>Morgan</hi> with his own hands, and others using Iron
Barrs and Sledges brake down the Door, took me and carried me to <hi>Pembroke</hi>
that night in the midst of that <hi>Black Guard.</hi> Being brought into my Chamber
there (notwithstanding so many <hi>Bayliffs</hi> and others commanded to attend as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
some dangerous Malefactor) my Arms were bound behind me with Cords
till bedtime. Then <hi>Morgan</hi> came to see me put into my Bed, where I was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to Iye on my Back, and my Arms being extended to be bound, and each
Arm bound to a Post at the Beds Head. My right Arm being somewhat lame,
I desired that they would take what course they pleased to secure a Person so
suspicious as they seemed to think me, and make the knot as fast as they pleased,
but not to tye it so straitly upon that Arm because infirm. <hi>Is that Arm Lame</hi>
(said <hi>Morgan) then, Goaler, bind it the harder,</hi> which he did, and in that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
and condition I lay all that night, my Arm asking some part of the time,
but ceasing after midnight (being then benummed) and in my Chamber a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen
of the <hi>Vndersheriffs</hi> Beardogs smoaking trash Tobacco, and playing at Tables
all night. In the morning when I was unbound, my right Arm hung down by
my Side as dead; I could not move Finger or Arm. But my Arms were imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
again bound behind me in order to my Journey to Pri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>on, and I desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that if I must be thus dealt with, I might be nevertheless so bound, as that
my Riding Coat might cover the Cords; <hi>Morgan</hi> answered, <hi>You shall have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that you desire.</hi> A quarter of an hour after <hi>Morgan</hi> calls, <hi>What is not that
fellow yet gone? Tye him to an Horse Tayl, and drag him along.</hi> During the time
of the riotous disturbance, of my being in the way to <hi>Pembroke</hi> and in the Town
I gave no disrespective or angry word to <hi>Morgan</hi> or <hi>Bowen</hi> (who had a grand
Copper Nose, which might receive the <hi>Solemn League and Covenant</hi> into its Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses)
but spent my time as merrily as if a Comedy were acting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> taking only
the liberty to make some joco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e Remarques upon the <hi>Vndersteriffs</hi> knowledge of
his Office, and Mr. <hi>Bowens</hi> doing of Justice. Nothing otherwise until the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:49426:17"/>
but when I saw my arm in that plight, I confess I could not contain my self,
but cryed <hi>This Horrid Dog the Vndersheriff hath undone me; I have lost the use of
my Writing hand.</hi> Away they led me, and I complaining for want of a Horse,
the Goaler answered that there was an Horse provided for me the last night,
but that my jeering the <hi>Sheriff</hi> had caused him to contradict it; for he saith
(quoth the Goaler) that <hi>seeing you are so merry, he will take down your mirth.</hi> I
went along, but a Servant of one Mr. <hi>William Holcomb</hi> (Son in Law to Mr. <hi>Meare</hi>)
pretended to lead me by my left Arm pinching me all the way that he went. At
something more than three miles end I fainted through want of sleep, weariness
and so many gross abuses, and not much using walking. Then was I set on
Horseback, and after a little time recovering, began merrily to reflect upon the
great state I rode in, to have so worthy a Gentleman as Mr. Goaler to lead my
Horse. This affronted the honest man, and he knowing the Saddle would turn
round, being too big, for the Horse being very small, had a present revenge in his
thoughts; for he lead the Horse out of the way up and down banks, till the Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
turning cast me down. This was done twice, and I attribute it much to <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Providence</hi> that I escaped with little harm, seeing my Arms bound rendred
me helpless. My Leader and Guides were very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>portive at my Falls, and their
lifting me up again, saying, that they must laugh as well as I. As I passed thus
along in Sta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e we met many Persons of Quality in a Company going to a Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
who exprest their indignation of such usage of a Clergyman, Mr. <hi>William
Bowen</hi> of <hi>Haverford</hi> particularly affirming that he could not brook the sight, but
would cut the Cords, wherewith I was bound. I thanked and entreated him to
forbear in regard the Persons, in whose Custody I was, were ill men, that valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
neither Credit nor Conscience, but would Swear any thing, and might do him
a great injury, but that his intended kindness could not be very beneficial to me,
and thus perswaded him to ride forward, hoping that afterward he might do
something for me more eminently beneficial. I was also led forward, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
<hi>Haverford</hi> was brought through a considerable part of the Town unto the
Prison, multitudes gazing and admiringly enquiring whether I had spoken Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
or what was the matter? Being conveighed into my Old Lodgings my Arms
were freed from their Bonds, but my Legs were put into Irons; not such as or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Malefactors for Burglary or the like are wont to be obliged to, with which
they can make a shift to walk, but an Iron on each Leg, through both which an
heavy Bolt was thrust and fastned with a Riveted Key. It was such that it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
me not to put one foot an inch before the other, neither to lye down or
rise without the help of two men, the one holding my shoulders the other my
feet. These two men were Prisoners but had some liberty before, but were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
with me for affirming to the <hi>Vndersheriff</hi> that I had not broken Prison, and
other truths concerning my being called out of the Prison. The coldness of these
Irons in two days put me into a Fever, and my Feet and Legs exceedingly swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
each day more and more, so that at four days end those encompassing my
Legs could scarce be discerned. The sixth day I laboured under a general indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
and having not before complained, I then said to my two Friends, <hi>Two
days more wearing these things will inevitably kill me.</hi> Whereupon they made an
out-cry, and one of them <hi>(Samuel Roberts)</hi> procured a Messenger to call to me one
Mr. <hi>Thomas Lloyd,</hi> a very friendly Person, and frequent visiter of me. He came as he
had been wont to the Door (for the Goaler would not trouble himself to let any
in unto me, unless such as happened to be there when it was his pleasure to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
himself) and being informed of my condition, acquainted others with it, who
came to the Goaler advising him to take off the Irons, for the wearing of them
would certainly soon dispatch me out of this life, which happening, he, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
and as many as were concerned in putting them on, would certainly be
hanged. The fear of a Rope brought him to compliance; but when he had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivited
the Key of the Bolt, the Irons which encompassed my Legs could not be
taken off without much pain and bruising me. Nevertheless when it was done
I was revived, and three days after a violent distemper seised me, not to my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury,
but salutiferous by the Strength of Nature; and in a fortnight I was indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:49426:18"/>
(through <hi>Gods</hi> great blessing) well recovered. But then (just at the Fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nights
end) came Mr. Goaler, telling me that I must again put on my cold Irons,
that he had taken them off without the <hi>Sheriffs</hi> knowledge, and had been sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
checkt for so doing, and commanded to put them on again. He had brought
with him one <hi>Thomas Morgan</hi> (the Undersheriffs Kinsman) and two more to
compell me in case of resistance. I and my two fellow Prisoners demanded for
what reason this was offered? Whether I had not behaved my self quietly in
word and deed? He answered, That he could say nothing to the contrary, but
it was the <hi>Sheriffs</hi> pleasure and he must obey it. I refused to receive them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
as well as I could; but they were too hard for me, and threw me down;
and <hi>Morgan</hi> beat my head against a rough stone, (which was set at my Beds
feet, to keep the <hi>Welch Feathers</hi> of my <hi>Bed</hi> within bounds) and brake it in five
places. The noise drew many Spectators, and the fame of the cruel usage of the
strange <hi>Minister</hi> that was in Prison flew swiftly about the <hi>Town,</hi> and fortuned to
meet Mr. <hi>Robert Chambers Collector</hi> of the <hi>Custom-House,</hi> and Mr. <hi>William Bowen</hi>
before named and certain others, who sought the <hi>Vndersheriff,</hi> and with severe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces
obliged him to promise himself to see me forthwith delivered from my
Irons, moreover assuring him that an account must be given for what I had sustain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the cause of so base a Person, his harsh dealing not only exceeding what was
imposed upon any Prisoners for just debts and far greater sums, but even the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity
used to the worst of Criminals committed in their memory, naming parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
<hi>William Philips</hi> the Bayliff, who was at the taking me upon <hi>Michaelmas</hi>
day. I was committed to them between four and five of the Clock in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon;
and about eleven at night the Chain Chimes at the Prison Door going,
gave us matter of wonder, what the matter was. And the sight of <hi>Morgan,</hi> the
Goaler and three more coming in made the Wonder the greater. He began (but
somewhat smoothly) to blame my former Escape and Biting jests used towards
him, which were the cause of the hardships I had endured; I only nodded my Head
saying, <hi>Well enough, what next? If you will</hi> (said he) <hi>promise me not to break Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
but to be quiet and orderly your Irons shall be taken off. As you know</hi> (I replied)
<hi>what occasion you have to ask such a question, so I will promise nothing else then</hi> (as I did
before) <hi>to be gone as soon as lawfully I can, and not otherwise.</hi> He answered,
<hi>You did not go away lawfully, for although</hi> Henry David <hi>and the Goaler might call
you out of the Prison, and you go away thinking your self discharged, yet I had in
my hands a</hi> Capias ad satisfaciendum <hi>against you for the</hi> Kings <hi>First Fruits. This is</hi>
(I said) <hi>the first time I have heard it; but the Goaler had no Warrant from you
to detain me upon this Cause. No,</hi> (he answered) <hi>it was sufficient in my hands.
And was it warrant enough for you to swear</hi> (fro then I heard so, though since told
to the contrary) <hi>that I brake Prison, for you riotously to break open my House, to
bind and Iron me as you have done? Well Sir,</hi> (said <hi>Morgan) I hope you will be an
orderly Prisoner. Goaler, take off the Irons.</hi> So once more my Legs were free from
Cuffs. <hi>But,</hi> Mr. <hi>Vndersheriff</hi> (said I) <hi>you must take care to send some body to cure my
Head,</hi> shewing him and the Company where it was broken. He answered,
that <hi>they were rude abusive fellows in so doing, he did not allow them so to do;</hi> and
then rose up and departed. Not long after <hi>Morgan</hi> was acquitted of his employ,
and <hi>Willam Skirm</hi> succeeded, not by a Deputy but himself. And to him (I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
in that joyous Place) about the end of <hi>Ianuary</hi> came a Writ of <hi>Habeas
Corpus</hi> to remove me up to the <hi>Kings Bench.</hi> Upon the 28th of <hi>Ianuary</hi> in the
Evening <hi>Skirm</hi> gave me notice to provide for my Journey against <hi>Tuesday</hi> morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the then 31st of <hi>Ianuary.</hi> I sent home for Boots, a Riding Coat, and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
for my Journey to be brought to me on the <hi>Munday;</hi> but <hi>Skirm</hi> with an
unaccountable malice (unless my Death was his Project) horst me early the <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi>
morning, that my Journey might be the more remarkable upon the day of
my Admired <hi>Sovereigns Martyrdom,</hi> in order to my execution. My Journey was
(the way that my Keepers brought me) two hundred and threescore measured
miles at least. I had no more on my Legs than one pair of single Stockins, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
any covering more then what I usually wore within the House, nor any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
my servants journey to me with that supply constantly on <hi>Sundays</hi> being stopt
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:49426:18"/>
by my appointment for <hi>Munday.</hi> Thus I rode the first days journey to <hi>Caermar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,</hi>
where (having met with a Friend who lent me twenty shillings) I purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
a <hi>Freize Coat</hi> and <hi>Boots of the same.</hi> The Taylor sitting up all night to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch,
had not finisht them by the time my Keepers were ready to mount me.
They urged me to be gone, swearing they would not slay; but I being in a Friends
House refused to travel farther without Cloaths. Neither was the stay which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the controversie above half an hour. But I should first have related their
carriage towards me at my going to Bed. When they had seen me lain down,
the Keepers (one being <hi>Iohn</hi> the Brother of <hi>William Skirm</hi>) took away my <hi>Cloathes,</hi>
and even my <hi>Shoos, Stockins</hi> and <hi>Hat</hi> and lockt me into the Chamber. The same
they did at every Inn, at which I lodged on the Road, the journey being seven
days. At <hi>Caermarthen</hi> I had a Fire in my Chamber, commanding it as known
in the House; but every night following, being unacquainted on the Road, in
which I never before travelled, these <hi>Dowty Gentlemen</hi> permitting me to sit by the
fire in their Chamber during their pleasure; when they thought it Bed-time, I
was taken by the shoulders and thrust into a Cold Room, and then stript and
lockt in, no respect had to the weather, (which was extremity of Snow every day
but the first) not to my pickled condition, riding on a low Horse through ways
so deep, that my feet did frequently, even for miles together hang in the dirt and
water, I being tired with holding them up to avoid it. Upon <hi>Sunday</hi> the fifth
of <hi>February</hi> between four and five of the Clock in the afternnon I was conducted
to the <hi>Three Cups Inn</hi> in <hi>Holborn</hi> and there detained until the <hi>Saturday</hi> following,
no perswasion prevailing with them to bring me into Court or before a Judge,
not any reason but their pleasure shewn. There my usage was of the fame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but worse; for they each night compelled me to go to Bed before seven of
the Clock (stript and lockt up as before) that they might take the opportunity
of loose Rambles, and then lying late in Bed in the morning by reason of the
Evenings Debauchery, I must lye still, let what importunities soever require my
rising. <hi>Skirm,</hi> when I demanded the reason of such dealing, would swear they
would not leave the Company of those Brave Wenches, whose Company they
enjoyed the last night, for to humour a pitiful <hi>Parson.</hi> Seeing they did not (as
they term it) turn me over on <hi>Munday,</hi> upon <hi>Teusday</hi> I wrote Letters to three
Friends to come to me, but being about to Seal them, <hi>Skirm</hi> demanded the sight
of them, which being denied him, he took away the Candle, and Pen and Ink
to hinder my Sealing and Subscribing them, telling me that I should not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to send any where any Letter of which he had not first the Reading. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
found I any opportunity of Writing until <hi>Thursday,</hi> when my <hi>Bayliffs</hi> bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
me to the Tap-house Fire fell to Cards, and a Coachman (sometime before
a Servant to the <hi>Right Reverend</hi> the now <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Chichester</hi> coming in and
knowing me, conveighed to me Pen, Ink and Paper, and while the two
<hi>Honest Men</hi> were busie, I wrote a Letter to my <hi>Brother,</hi> which the Coachman de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered.
The day following at Even my <hi>Brother</hi> came, whom they lockt into a
Chamber with me, promising to return at our call, which we said would be
within one quarter of an hour; but when we called, the Chamberlain came to
the door and told us that <hi>Skirm</hi> and <hi>Smith</hi> were gone abroad with the Key. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
some stay in a vain expectation of their return, I forced open the Door, and
my Brother departing, I went down and sate by a fire until their coming. But
then <hi>Skirm</hi> was filled with great wrath, and with Dammees and other Execrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
askt <hi>how I dared to open the Door?</hi> and <hi>would I never leave those tricks of break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Prison?</hi> with other such Language mixt with Threatnings. But the next day
I was brought into <hi>Court</hi> and turned over a Prisoner to the <hi>Kings Bench Prison.</hi>
The pretence for taking away my Cloaths at night was, that they feared I would
make an escape. Whether that was a legal way of securing me, I refer to better
Judgements. But that they could not fear any such thing after my coming to
<hi>London,</hi> is manifest by these reasons. On <hi>Sunday,</hi> the last day of our Journey <hi>Smith</hi>
exchanged Horses with me, I being not able any longer to ride the Jade on which
they mounted me. <hi>Skirm</hi> staying behind divers times talking with Travellers,
and <hi>Smith</hi> also sometimes, I rode before and missing them waited their comin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> up.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:49426:19"/>
They also knew that I very well understood the Road (leading from <hi>Oxford</hi>)
which we travelled that day, and that I as well understood that they knew it
not; in all which respects my escape (had I been inclined to it) would have been
without difficulty. Likewise at the Inn in <hi>Holborn</hi> (as I shewed them after three
nights lodging there upon discourse of their misbehaviour) an escape was easie;
For the Window having a large folding Casement, and the Chamber being but one
pair of Stairs high, I could have let my self down by the Sheets tied one to another,
and covered my self with a Blanket until I had come to the House of an Aquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
of whom I had many in the Neighbourhood and in <hi>Grayes Inn.</hi> When
they lockt me into my Chamber (as they did often) in the day time, when a
rambling humour possest them, I might (as well as when I did it for my Brother)
have opened the Door and escapt without any ones observation. None of the
House saw my Brother or me come down, or him departing; which was a full
conviction that I might have given them the slip, if I pleased. So that the pretence
was utterly groundless; but mischievous men as they delight in ill doing, so would
they nevertheless be esteemed righteous and inoffensive; the repute is grateful, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
nothing more disliketh them than deserving it. But to look somewhat
back upon the penalties inflicted on me for my pretended Breach of the Prison;
(then which nothing is more notoriously known to be false) had it been real, the
vileness of the Prison and Cause under which I laboured, and the odious nastiness
and condition of the Place considered, might in the esteem of men but indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
addicted to humanity, have excused the Act and mitigated the Rigor,
especially towards a <hi>Clergyman.</hi> But, alas, this was my fault, (as I too much fear) this
tied the <hi>Bonds</hi> and revetted the <hi>Irons,</hi> this led me through all the dances of Ignominy.
Again, had I not been assured by learned Counsel confirming what experience
had taught me, that the Goalers and Plaintiffs calling me out of the Prison was
a sufficient Discharge from the Execution, can any man believe that I would pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
and directly go Home and continue at my own House, and not rather have
gone out of the way until I had made a Composition? Any man of common un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
would have avoided errors, which must have been of such unlucky con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence.</p>
            <p>All the time of my Confinement in the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> and before in the Country,
I was rated to the Poor beyond any Person in the Parish, notwithstanding all that
I had in the Parish was seized in Execution (for just Debts indeed but illegally ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken)
and my Person in Durance at the same time under very hard Circumstances.
And both then and since I have been compelled to produce in the <hi>Feild</hi> two <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet
Arms</hi> for the <hi>Malitia</hi> of the <hi>County;</hi> whereas the utmost Farm of my <hi>Parsonage</hi>
paid to my <hi>Predecessor</hi> was fifty seven pounds yearly Rent, the Reparation of the
Chancel and a large Parsonage House, First Fruits and Tenths to the <hi>King,</hi> Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
at Visitations and other payments being all payable out of those fifty seven
pounds. Nor is any Incumbent in the County, whose benefice is worth twenty
or thirty pounds more than mine, charged with more than one <hi>Foot Arms.</hi> Yet
without respect to Imprisonment, Seizures in Execution of my Goods, the annual
Charge of the <hi>Rectory,</hi> and the smallness of the value, Distresses have been divers
times levied (particularly in <hi>Iune</hi> last one of five pounds) for fines laid upon me
for non Appearance. All which things were done by Instigation of Mr. <hi>Essex
Merrick,</hi> (as I am well informed) and Distresses taken upon any ones Cattle, which
were upon the Ground, although it was sufficiently known, that I had nothing
left to be seized.</p>
            <p>Being freed from my Imprisonment in the <hi>Bench</hi> and returning home in <hi>April</hi> 83.
the loss of my Worthy Parishioner and Friend Mr. <hi>Nathaniel Powel</hi> (though be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
known, yet then) became to me more sensibly an affliction, especially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
his Death was shortly followed by his Eldest <hi>Daughters</hi> (having left no <hi>Son</hi>)
marriage with the before mentioned Mr. <hi>Lloyd</hi> of <hi>Grove</hi> his <hi>Son,</hi> a <hi>Gentleman</hi> who
with an affected and artificial (but easily discerned) smoothness laboureth to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
whatsoever can be imagined to be couch'd in an ill natured, malitious and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous
Bosome. Being allied to and intimate with <hi>William Skirm,</hi> and daily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant
with Mr. <hi>Merick,</hi> his inclinations cannot be supposed to receive disincou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:49426:19"/>
from them. But before my coming down, or any acquaintance with
him, he began to shew what I must expect of him for the future; but above all
with a most unmanly Disingenuity practised dissention between me and a very
near Friend. Nevertheless at my first acquaintance I refrained from making that
ground of variance, which was either matter of suspition, or at most only such
noted Injuries, as were but the slips of an unguarded Tongue, and a raw
Judgement, which I might charitably think to be imposed upon. And although
in making up certain accounts between us I found some foul practises, yet those I
interpreted to proceed from the ill information of Servants, who had no other
way of creeping into a Masters Favour, but at the passages of an abused Ear. And
so hoping (after I had ascertained the truth of my accounts) by yeilding and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
from my Right at the beginning to purchase a lasting good Neighbourhood,
he obtained in a manner his own desires. But to me (and will be ever to those
who treasure up hopes in vessels made of ill-seasoned Timber) these consessions
were alway unfortunate. Although I had been often wont to say, that <hi>Good Men
would not offer their Minister less than his Right,</hi> and that <hi>Bad Men are so far from
being won by his connivance that by it they become daily worse and worse;</hi> yet I foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
transgressed those bounds, within the compass of which my Observation had
prescribed me walks. My <hi>Tithes</hi> of <hi>Hey, Wooll</hi> and other sorts of <hi>Privy Tithes</hi> he
set out in what measure he pleased, not allowing me or my Servants to see whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there were a fair Division. My <hi>Tithe Corn</hi> was, some manifestly discovered
to be falsly set out; some devoured with Swine and other Cattle after Tithing. He,
his Wife and Servants seeing the Waste without driving, or commanding the
Cattle to be driven away; othersome was clean devoured after Reaping before
Binding, and (forsooth) because many Loads of Corn were so eaten, I must
have the Straw, which was left, set out for <hi>Tithes.</hi> Divers in those Parts have an
ill sort of Husbandry permitting such waste, and accounting that no damage,
that is sustained by their own Cattle. This received opinion that their loss would
be small, but mine thereby total, encouraged him to this malitious Project. His
Servants frequently entred my House without knocking at the Door, even after
Prohibition, and threw into it Tithes, which had been rejected as unduly set forth
in respect to both their quality and quantity. Neither was Mr. <hi>Lloyd</hi> contented
to be vexatious alone, but encouraged the rest of my Parishoners to the like, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
two only imitated him, the rest approving the reasonableness of mine or
my Servants seeing my Dues paid in Wait and Measure, as their nature required.
But to conclude my Discourse of this Gentleman, in <hi>October</hi> last three of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
bringing Tithe <hi>Wooll</hi> in such manner as is before mentioned, the Sheep ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been shorn a fortnight before, I denied to receive it. The Servants were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
rude in behaviour and language, in which I since understand them to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
by their Masters instructions, hoping to provoke me to Passion, Of which
notwithstanding they failed, yet something said by me was managed to some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of Revenge, although short of expectation. Their undecent words and
gestures extorted from this question; <hi>Do you thus speak and act by your Masters Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der?</hi>
To them answering, <hi>Yes,</hi> I replied, <hi>then your Master is a Knave and a Cox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb.</hi>
Mr. <hi>Merrick</hi> and Mr. <hi>Lloyd</hi> consulting how to punish so great an Enormity,
concluded it required security for the <hi>Good Behavior,</hi> and appearance at the next
<hi>Quarter Sessions</hi> to answer to an <hi>Indictment.</hi> Hereupon Mr. <hi>Merrick</hi> issued forth a
very strict Warrant against me, and I being apprehended before eight of the Clock
in the morning, was carried about from place to place, and detained in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stables
custody until past nine at night before I could be discharged. But there
was a farther design than thus barely to render me a ridiculous Subject of the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars
Chat, which had taken effect, had not the <hi>Chief Constable</hi> after his apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
me received information, that upon my arrival at <hi>Pembroke</hi> the Undersheriff
was ready to arrest me; which he honestly and kindly avoided bringing me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
another <hi>Iustice</hi> (as soon as I had gotten security) and not before Mr. <hi>Merrick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How justifiable Mr. <hi>Merrick</hi>'s Warrant was, and the following dedainer of my
Person I undertake not to determine, but think what was done to be so unusual,
that in all the travels of his Brains to furnish his empty Rooms, he never met
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:49426:20"/>
with a President for it. Mr. <hi>Lloyd</hi> was no way by Birth or Office raised so high
as to be in danger of suffering diminution by so slight a Character; nor doth his
ingenious virtue exempt him (if there were such danger) from severer sufferings in
most mens in those Parts (who know him) daily discourses. If I exceed the
Rules of Modesty, Mr. <hi>Merrick</hi> (whom I believe to know it) will justifie my
forced assertion, That Mr. <hi>Lloyd</hi> is inferiour to any Apology he can pretend to
make for himself as injured, if either his Birth, Education, or (what most signa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liseth
a Gentleman) Honesty be respected. And my further Appeal to Mr. <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi>
enquireth, <hi>What</hi> would have become of himself some time since, if
words of an higher nature and consequence uttered by him against his Superiors at
a vast distance had been taken into strict examination? But for taking notice of
such things he thinketh me fit to be whipt; only my hopes of being received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Protection sufficient to supersede his and the unmerciful sentences of others, do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
the fear, and move me confidently to cast my self down an humble <hi>Petitioner;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That</hi> the Hands of the Sons of Violence may at last be restrained from afflicting
a poor Clergyman, who sincerely delighteth in the Peace of the Church, and perfectly
despiseth himself except in those things, which he stedfastly believeth to conduce to its
Promotion.</p>
            <p>IN this Relation is seen an unwearied Spirit of Malignity pursuing me; for what
just Causes, (God and my Conscience bear me witness) I know not. No
man living can more than my self heartily desire the repose of a quiet life; and that
(however stumbling occasions and Rocks of offence were still thrown in my way)
I have alway studied to tread the safest and most certain measures thereof, is my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible
Comfort. I challenge the whole World to make discovery of any Act,
whereby I endeavoured to discompose another, either malitiously or idlely. The
too too many errors of my life I will not palliate by any excuse; yet am so far
from taking pleasure in doing an Injury, that in the presence of my allknowing
<hi>Redeemer</hi> I do affirm that I have alway more lamented the condition of those, by
whom I suffered, than my sufferings, and could willingly again undergo them,
if <hi>God</hi> would be pleased to accept my toleration for their indemnity. That I
would not by undecent submissions to her enemies labour to purchase <hi>Peace</hi> is no
argument of any turbulent motion in my affections, neither ought it to tend to
my Condemnation.</p>
            <p>But whereas some, to whom my Case hath been delivered, have demanded,
and others will probably demand, how it hath happened that in a numerous Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox
Clergy my self only should be oppressed with these weights? My answer
cannot be expected to be much more certain, than to an enquiry, How one Vessel
hath been shattered by a Storm in that Road, where many Fleets have before
safly sailed? The account whereof, because Providence hath not, I dare not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to give. But if a strong supposition possess any, that my ill doing hath oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned
dissatisfactions and enraged men to a revenge of received injuries, I
can purge my self no otherwise than by my asseverations in the preceeding Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph,
and a request of reflection upon past times, whether men much better than
the highest Charity can presume me to be, have not singly fallen by the Arts of
malitious Confederates. And furthermore, as the cruelties of the two <hi>Vndersheriffs</hi>
of <hi>Pembrokeshire</hi> surmounted the others by many degrees, so were they least
known, it being impossible for me any way to exasperate them, whom I
had never seen or heard of before I fell into their griping Tallons. But my Case
is not single; For Mr. <hi>Thomson</hi> hath in <hi>Bristol</hi> met with the same <hi>Swearing Dammee
Party,</hi> who at first by hurling at me <hi>holy Dirt</hi> and <hi>consecrated Subornations and
Perjuries,</hi> weakned my hopes of reaping for my <hi>Master</hi> a plentiful <hi>Harvest</hi> by the
exercise of my <hi>Function. God</hi> be thanked that their open Acts of Malice and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence
are dwindled into the corner whirperings of Envy, and that they gall
themselves whilst able only sneakingly to traduce him.</p>
            <p>Neither can I forbear (which is my excessive greif) to affirm, That the <hi>Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox
Clergy</hi> are not so numerous as many believe, the number of them (I reckon
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:49426:20"/>
none <hi>Orthodox,</hi> who is not duly and strictly <hi>Conformable</hi>) is far inferiour to that
of Trimmers and Half Sized Men. But some few years since such was the pauci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of them on Publick Occasions of Clergymens meeting, and so scorned were
they being scattered among the full Tribes, who were contented with any Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
which was Golden, that they could not assist but only pity one another. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actness
of <hi>Conformity</hi> doth not only stir up the gall of Nonconformists barely, but
more dangerously and immoderately moveth to expressions of discontentment the
tongues of those men, whose aim is to be thought moderate by neglecting their
<hi>Duty</hi> and <hi>Superiors,</hi> and paying an unreasonably obsequious Deference to their <hi>Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours.</hi>
When Dr. <hi>Ironsides</hi> Bishop of <hi>Bristol</hi> required of his Clergy stricter Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
of the <hi>Rubrick</hi> and <hi>Canon</hi> (particularly, that Children in health should be
baptized at the <hi>Font,</hi> and that the Parents of the Sick should be held to an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement
of bringing them into the <hi>Church</hi> with <hi>Godfathers, &amp;c.</hi> in case of recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
and also that Thansgiving for Women after Childbirth should be publickly
given in the <hi>Church,</hi> and at the <hi>Altar</hi>) when these and some other things were
commanded, the humour of the People and matter of interest was most in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
by the plurality of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> and those few who obeyed, were even derided
by their Brethren, who also came into their Parishes to Baptize the Children and
give Thanks for the Wives of the proud Opposers of Discipline, and by these
practises sowed and somented contention. It's almost incredible what Invectives
and ill Reports are daily scattered to worthy Mr. <hi>Thomsons</hi> prejudice by <hi>Clergymen</hi>
in and near <hi>Bristol;</hi> and all this occasioned by his very regular Conformity. The
same Pride which hinders their imitation of what is so highly commendable, doth
also give them troublesom thoughts, that singular Piety accuseth them of culpable
Remissness.</p>
            <p>I humbly request a candid interpretation of the foregoing words, there being
no design, by comparison or otherwise to put a fair Character upon my self. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in my own vindication from suffering as an ill Doer, I have made use of other
Names and Instances to shew Conformity to be ground sufficient for the indirect
Practises of my Adversaries. And as no affectation of singularity, nor any other
motives, but a perfect sense of Duty hath hitherto obliged me to give them this
Cause, so my hopes are that I shall not whilst living cease from it. Moreover as
my Delight in Conformity is purely without outward respects; as I pray and hope
that no desires of worldly Felicity will be able to baffle my Constancy and Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
if it please <hi>God</hi> that they are to be further exercised; so I declare my wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingness
(if <hi>God</hi> permit) to serve Him and my <hi>Prince</hi> in Peace. Which to obtain
by other probable means than this Manifestation, is beyond the reach of my Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
That nothing is here written out of an unchristian seeking Revenge, is
my solemn Declaration before <hi>God, Angsel</hi> and <hi>Men,</hi> my earnest wishes of <hi>mine
eye seeing its desire upon mine enemies,</hi> being their <hi>humility</hi> and <hi>amendment.</hi> That
their Punishment, while they continue obstinate, is in some measure conducing to
the <hi>Churches</hi> welfare is my firm opinion. But to inflict it my self, their power,
numbers and riches considered, is so far beyond my ability, that I cannot in any
measure promise to secure my self from new additions of violence. But <hi>that we may
lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty,</hi> according to my bounden
Duty, I humbly and heartily beseech the <hi>ever-blessed Fountain of all Goodness</hi> to
encompass with the Pledges of his Love <hi>our most Gracious Soveraign,</hi> His <hi>Royal Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
with all that are related to them, and those, who being in <hi>Subordinate Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities,</hi>
do either direct us in the way of <hi>Religion,</hi> or guard it for our safe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
to <hi>Glory.</hi> Amen.</p>
