         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

and prophaned by diverſe diſorderly people, in carrying and putting to
ſale diverſe victuals and other things: Yet in regard of the inevitable neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of milke for many Infants, ſicke, aged, and many medicines, as well on the
Lords day as in the weeke dayes, without which they cannot ſubſiſt; by
reaſon whereof, the ſale of milke on that day cannot be avoided. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the Milkewomen in the City of <hi>London,</hi> and places adjacent, have moſt earneſtly petitioned,
That Order might be taken aſwell about the ſale of Milke on the ſaid Dayes, that they might
nevertheleſſe injoy the Ordinances of God, and ſanctifie the Sabbath in obedience to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of God, and the pious Lawes of the Kingdome in that behalfe made. As alſo to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the great abuſe and fraud which is uſed by divers ſingle perſons uſing the ſaid calling, give
great prices for their milke to the Milke-maſters, (thoſe of the ſaid calling (which have Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
to maintaine, and many Pariſh, and Church duties to pay) not being able to give the like)
and to make up their money againe in retailing their milke, doe uſually deceive the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
wealth, in ſelling by falſe meaſures, and vending flatten milke for new: It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Ordered, That all and every perſon uſing the ſaid calling of Milke-ſelling, and which
are Houſe keepers within the City of <hi>London</hi> and places adjacent, may repaire to the houſes of
their Cuſtomers, and ſerve them only in the morning of every Lords day with Milke, they not
exceeding the houres of eight of the clocke (in the Summer,) and nine of the clocke (in the
Winter time) of the ſame mornings, for the ſale and ſerving thereof at the furtheſt; And that
no ſuch retaylers of Milke, ſhall preſume to cry or ſell any milke during the reſidue of the ſaid
dayes, nor in the evening of the ſame. And it is further Ordered, That no Milkemaſters
within the City of <hi>London,</hi> and places adjacent, ſhall ſell the Milke (which their Kine doth
yeeld in the evening of the Sabbath dayes) to any of their retailing Cuſtomers whatſoever;
And that the ſame evenings milke (from time to time) of every Sabbath day, ſhall remaine and
be unto the reſpective Milkemaſters (Owners thereof) unto their owne Accompts, as their
owne proper goods and Chattels, without (any way) charging the ſame, either to, or upon
their (then) retailing Cuſtomer; Or molleſting, ſuing or troubling them or any of them, for
any loſſe or dammage that ſhall or may ariſe or grow thereby. And laſtly, for the preventing
of the inhancing of the prices of Milke, and the great deceite which is daily uſed as foreſaid,
by many idle and extravagant ſingle perſons in retailing of Milke. It is ordered, that no milke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter
whatſoever at any time or times hereafter, ſhall utter, vend, or ſell their milke to any
retailing ſingle perſon or perſons whatſoever: And if any perſon or perſons ſhall be found

of his Majeſties Iuſtices of the Peace, to the end they may receive ſuch puniſhment as to
