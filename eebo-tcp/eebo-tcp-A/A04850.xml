            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

it was some rare and vnusuall thing.</p>
            <p>My message this day is something out of

am sure, <hi>Hosanna,</hi> and <hi>Benedictus,</hi> will be the
summe of it,) besides a presence not ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
of the heads and corners of the people,
and a face of Solemnitie, such as reserueth it
selfe onely for festiuals. I thinke there is
none so vnsensible, that is not moued here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at,

            <p>The very exhibition of these dumbe

is the office of <hi>Ecce</hi> here.</p>
            <p>Those who come to these sacred assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,

<hi>ad augendam turbam,</hi>

               </gap>. Away,
away prophane persons; but such as shall
lend their eares, and bend their intentions,
<hi>and lay vp in their hearts,</hi> with <hi>Marie,</hi> that they
may <hi>bring forth of their treasuries</hi> for their vse,
with the Scribe; these, and none others it
inuiteth, and pulleth after it, as with the
cords and cables of the holy Ghost, as that
chaine that was tied to the tongue of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curie,</hi>
and fastned to the eares of the people,
drew his Auditors. <hi>Behold.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And (me thinketh,) it is somewhat like
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:6918:4"/>
the King that vttered it; for the King is no
more then another man, <hi>mole,</hi> in bulke of
body; <hi>virtute,</hi> in power, he is more. We say,
that a King hath long hands, he may sit in
<hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and reach to the ends of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;
as the body of the Sunne is in his
sphaere alone, but his beames vpon the
earth: and the blaze of a Comet is much far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
extended then the starre it selfe goeth:
so, though the body of <hi>Ecce,</hi> be but in the
frontispice, and at the threshold of my text,
yet doth the hand, the beames, the blaze, the
vertue, and strength of it go into euery part.
For, whether you consider his sicknesse,
which he styleth <hi>bitternesse;</hi> and the time of
that sicknesse, <hi>in peace,</hi> when he least looked
for it; or, whether his recouery, <hi>Eruisti ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam
meam,</hi> and the motiue to that recouery,
<hi>in loue to my soule,</hi> perhaps when he least de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued
it; or, whether the cause of that sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
<hi>Sinnes,</hi> and the full remission of those
sinnes, <hi>Proiecisti posttergum,</hi> when he did not
so much as craue it; <hi>Ecce,</hi> imparteth it selfe
to them all alike.</p>
            <p>I fell vpon the mention of a King. I will
set one <hi>Ecce</hi> more vpon the person from
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:6918:4"/>
whom this speech came: It was the speech
of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> the King: a great and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
King, both at home and abroad; a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
and religious King, which is the <hi>pure
gold</hi> in the Crowne of a King, the rest is but
drosse; a King of the holy land, so was not
<hi>Merodach Baladan</hi> in the head of the next
Chapter, for he was the King of Babylon. It
will be the more gratefull for the authors
sake.</p>
            <p>Said I, a speech? it is more: <hi>Scriptura He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiae
Regis,</hi> the 9. verse, the writing of <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi>
the King: the labor, not of his tongue,
but of his pen; he did not <hi>fundere,</hi> but <hi>fingere,</hi>
poure it forth at aduentures, but frame it
vpon aduice. I put a great difference betwixt
speech, and writing. Speech hath wings,
<hi>volat &amp; auolat,</hi> it flieth and dieth; so doth
not writing: you must seeke for a word, <hi>in
aure,</hi> in the eare of him that receiued it,
where it hath but slender footing; or <hi>in aëre,</hi>
in the aire, where it perisheth with the sound.
If you will seeke for a writing, you shall
find it <hi>in aere,</hi> or <hi>in marmore,</hi> in plates of brasse,
or in tables of stone, where it may be a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument
to after ages: It suruiueth the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:6918:5"/>
and doth good to the liuing when the
author is gone. In this sence it is true, <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunt
ex mortuis,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 16.</note> they arise from the dead, by
whom the succeeding posterity is instructed
and bettered; so sayd he of his writings, <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterorum
negotium ago,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Senec.</note> I prouide for the times
to come.</p>
            <p>Yet there is more: for it is the writing of a
King, I say not before his death, (from which
he was newly deliuered, as in a <hi>parable of the
resurrection, Heb. 11.)</hi> but instantly vpon that
time, wherein he was neare to dying: and
then are the words of a man most gratefull,
<q>
                  <hi>vt esse Phoebi dulcius humen solet, iam iam ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentis,</hi>
               </q>
as the light of the Sun, most pleasant
about his going downe. But that which is
most of all; it is written with the point of a
diamond, to remaine for eternitie, and is a
part of the euidences and muniments of the
Church, layd vp amongst her sacred Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords,
for a memoriall of his thankfulnesse,
offered, and consecrated to God vpon that
deliuerance.<note place="margin">Plin. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Beati, quibus, deorum munere, da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum

are they, whom God hath enabled, either
to do things worthy to be written, or to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:6918:5"/>
write things worthy to be read: <hi>Hezekiah</hi>
did both.</p>
            <p>This is a part of his writing; the compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
whereof is of sundry and contrary
parts: To giue you a summary view of all
the materials therein, and their natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence:</p>
            <p>First, you haue <hi>Peace,</hi> that leadeth to all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
the rest; but <hi>Peace</hi> had an ill neighbour that
troubled it, <hi>Sinne,</hi> in the hindmost part of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
my Text. Sinne bringeth forth <hi>bitternesse:</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
and not onely so, but <hi>bitternesse</hi> added to <hi>bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternesse.</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bitternesse</hi> thus accumulated, must needs
haue brought to the <hi>pit,</hi> and the <hi>pit,</hi> in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
end, would haue turned to <hi>corruption,</hi> or <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption.</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
Thus farre goeth the blacke line of
my text, the shadow of sorrow and death.</p>
            <p>But then cometh the other Hemisphaere
of comfort and light; wherein you haue,
first, the <hi>loue and good pleasure</hi> of God: second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
               <hi>Redemption from the pit of corruption,</hi> as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
touching the body: thirdly, <hi>Remission of sins,</hi> as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
concerning the soule. So it is not here as in
the 68. Psalme, where the singers go before,
and the minstrels follow after, &amp;c. here, the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:6918:6"/>
mourners go first, like the captiues in their
ancient Triumphs; <hi>sinne,</hi> and <hi>sicknesse,</hi> and the
<hi>pit,</hi> and <hi>corruption;</hi> then come the minstrels
and singers, I meane the mercies of God, as
in a triumphant chariot, curing both the
body from <hi>sicknesse,</hi> and the soule from <hi>sins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The three parts and roomes of my text
wherein this whole matter is lodged and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,<note place="margin">Diuision.</note>
are as clearely distinguished, as the
three tabernacles of <hi>Peter, Matth.</hi> 17.</p>
            <p>

            <p>The kind of this sicknesse is not mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
till the 21 verse, there it is called <hi>vlcus,</hi>
a botch; it is thought to haue bene a plague-sore,
I dispute it not, I am sure it was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
neere; I will but <hi>drinke of the brooke</hi> in
my way, and giue you a short note. Wee
haue knowne by <hi>bitter, bitter</hi> experience,
what a plague is; but God tooke a <hi>plaister of
figges,</hi> of his sweete mercies in Christ, well-nigh
fifteene yeares sithence; and applied
to the botch, and healed the sores of this
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:6918:7"/>
land: in the vertue and strength whereof,
we haue walked to this present day: and we
for the figges of his mercies haue returned
him the thistles of our sinnes, the clusters of
<hi>Sodome,</hi> and the wine of Dragons; and yet,
<hi>Ecce in pace,</hi> we heale our hurts with sweet
words, crying, <hi>peace, peace, all is well,</hi> and so
shall be; <hi>To morrow shall be as this day, and
much</hi> better, and this yeare as the last, and
freer.</p>
            <p>Deceiue not your selues: you haue a great
and populous Citie, sowne with the <hi>seede of
man,</hi> as the Prophet speaketh; I may say,
with the seed, rather the weed, of building.
I say not, that your Citie may go out at your
gates; surely, it may go out at your Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbes;
the hemme of your garment is more
then the garment it selfe: the lop, and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
of the tree, more then the stemme can
beare, and threatneth the ruine of the whole
body. To speake plainely, the regions are
white and drie to the haruest; there is matter

            <p>Whatsoeuer were the <hi>species,</hi> manifest it is
what the qualitie of the sicknesse was, <hi>bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;</hi>
what the quantitie, <hi>bitternesse, bitternesse;</hi>

the Prophet cried out,<note place="margin">Ier. 4.</note> 
               <hi>My bellie, My bellie;</hi> the

and sitting, or lying is physicke to

               <hi>Quotidianus

Our daily decay in nature, what is it else, but
a lengthning of death? I will say briefly, <hi>tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plici
morbo laboramus, principio, medio, &amp; fine;</hi>
We are sicke of a threefold sicknesse, our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
midst, and ending: As Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:6918:8"/>
told the <hi>Manichees,</hi> of their idle and

natiuity, wofull life, dreadfull death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Morbi, citatio ad mortem;</hi> sicknesse is a sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
to death: he that is least sicke, may,
and in the end must die. Death hath euer her
arrow in her bow, though in the prime ages
of the world she was sometimes nine hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
yeares before she sped, yet now she hit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
quickly; and when God saith, shoote,
she shooteth; and so long as God saith, spare,
she spareth. For what is thy life? <hi>Breue suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium,</hi>
a short panting. Canst thou measure
the blast of winde? (said the Angell to <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dras;)</hi>
canst thou measure (say I) the blast
of thine owne winde? the breath within thy
nostrels? <hi>spiras, exspiras,</hi> now thou art brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
anon thy breath is gone. It dealeth
with the arke of thy body, as the doue with
the Arke of <hi>Noah,</hi> which goeth forth, and
commeth in, and goeth forth, and neuer

            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:6918:9"/>
But, he that is sicke of a sicknesse indeed,
a sicknesse that is <hi>mali moris,</hi> as the Physitians
speake, such as this sicknesse of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was,
<hi>bitternesse, bitternesse,</hi> hath but a short recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to make to the houre of his dying. For
it fareth with the bodie of man, as with a
vessell of wine in a frugall house; being kept
for our selues, and our friends which drinke
moderately, it is long in drawing; but, if
<hi>sponges,</hi>

as are <hi>mightie to drinke,</hi> and <hi>strong</hi> to <hi>poure</hi> in,
they will spend that in a day, which would
haue serued a long time. So may the thread
of my life be long in spinning, to the fortieth,
or fiftieth yeare thereof; it may be, <hi>ad termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num
constitutum, Iob</hi> 14. vnto mine old age,
(for that is the bounder of nature, and, <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledictus

which had not else bene done in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

            <p>Now, but in a word consider the person
that is sicke;<note place="margin">Mihi amar</note> it is <hi>Hezekiah the King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If any person in the earth be capable of
that style,<note place="margin">Dan. 3.</note> 
               <hi>Viue in aeternum,</hi> liue for euer, it is a
King. What wanteth a King, of all the
beasts of the field, or fowles of the aire, or
fishes of the sea, what either nature can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foord,
or Art condite, to the diet of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
comfort of his heart, refreshing of his
spirits? It seemeth, by a phrase vsed by the
holy Ghost, that a King wanteth nothing.
<hi>Nabal feasteth like a King, 1. Sam. 25. Araunah
offereth to Dauid like a King, 2. Sam. 24. the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians
reigne like Kings, 1. Cor.</hi> 4. and yet is
<hi>Hezekiah the King sick vsque ad mortem,</hi> vers. 1.
euen vnto death, that is, <hi>bitterly, bitterly:</hi> death
had stretched forth her hand against him, as
<hi>Ieroboam</hi> against the Prophet, to haue smitten
him, 1. <hi>Reg.</hi> 13. but that the Lord withered it.
What is the reason? <hi>Sum quidem &amp; ego morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis

am also a mortall man.</p>
            <p>There is no difference in nature betwixt a

exitu aequamur;</hi> we differ in condition,
agree in dissolution. When <hi>Diogenes</hi> was po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
amongst dead mens bones, <hi>Alexander</hi>
asked him what he did there? he answered,
<hi>I seeke the bones of Philip thy father,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ossa patris tui Philippi regis Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. quaero.</note> 
               <hi>King of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon,</hi>
but cannot find them. I may well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
the words of the Psalme to them, <hi>Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
Domine legislatorem super eos,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 9.</note> 
               <hi>sciant se esse
homines;</hi> Set thou ô Lord, a Law-giuer, or
Ruler ouer them, that they may know they
are but men. They giue lawes to the earth;
and death to them, and her law is an euen &amp;
equall law, to King and people all alike.</p>
            <p>It is a probleme worthy the inquiring;<note place="margin">Homo est animal ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionale, mortal.</note> sith
other creatures are subiect to death no lesse
then man, why <hi>Mortale</hi> is placed in the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
of man alone. It is a parallell to this,
(and one answer may serue to both) which
the Prophet hath, <hi>Psalme 82. I haue said you
are gods, but ye shall die like men.</hi> Why like men
rather then other creatures? I will not giue
that eminent and conspicuous reason, that
when beasts die, by reason that their soules
arise from the matter of their flesh, they die,
and die thorowly;<note place="margin">Moriuntur permoriun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</note> so is it not with man, but
first he dieth, and endeth not there, but after
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:6918:10"/>
death, <hi>Iudgement, Hebrewes</hi> 9.</p>
            <p>I should rather say, that beasts, for the more
part, liue out their time determinate by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
til nature be annihilated, vnlesse viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
and casuality come betweene: the Elephant
liueth longer then the Hart, the Hart then
the Lion, the Lion then the Horse, the Horse
then the Dog; all to their full age, vnlesse
they be forced out of life: but man dieth in
his infancie, and oftener in this then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
age; no sooner saluteth the light of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
but he biddeth farewell to it; and that
which is more, death entreth the very secrets
of nature, the vault of the wombe, and with
her Lynces eyes findeth out the wayes which
the Eagle and Kite neuer found out, and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth

<hi>Let not your gods,</hi> your Idols of greatnesse, and

that should be a thorne in his eyes, and a

            <p>There was danger enough in the former

that is, as the <hi>Apostle</hi> calleth it, <hi>Act. 8. fel ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritudinis,</hi>
the very gall of <hi>bitternesse:</hi> which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth
a disease, <hi>pessimi generis,</hi> of the worst

the axe laid to the roote, to hew downe life

            </p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Atermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no.</note> from the tearme, or, extent: for
it is not the life infested, annoyed, disquieted
alone; but lifted, and <hi>heaued</hi> at, to be throwne
into the <hi>pit: Eruisti è fouea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. Abattri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buto.</note> from the <hi>attribute</hi> of that pit, for it is
not <hi>fouea refugij,</hi> or <hi>refrigerij;</hi> a pit of repose or

comfort, such as <hi>Elias</hi> went into, and <hi>Dauid,</hi>
&amp; the <hi>Prophets</hi> that <hi>Obadiah</hi> hid, &amp; the <hi>Saints</hi>
that the world was not worthy of, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11.
but <hi>fouea corruptionis, consumptionis, putredinis,</hi>
a <hi>pit</hi> of <hi>corruption, consumption,</hi> and <hi>rottennesse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Take it altogether in the masse and
lumpe, and see what it is, (besides the kind
of the sicknesse, which is not here mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.)
First, it is <hi>bitter:</hi> secondly, <hi>bitternesse</hi> it
selfe: thirdly, <hi>bitternes,</hi> put to <hi>bitternes;</hi> fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
against life; fiftly, to <hi>thrust it downe</hi> to the
<hi>pit:</hi> sixtly, the <hi>pit</hi> of <hi>corruption:</hi> this being his
case, and then, to be pulled out of the <hi>teeth of
death,</hi> as <hi>Dauid pulled his lambe</hi> and his <hi>kid out
of the mouth of the Lyon and Beare,</hi> was the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
mercy of God, worthy another <hi>Ecce,</hi>
as at the first I declared.</p>
            <p>Is it not mercy, (I aske,) to be saued from
<hi>death? Death,</hi> whensoeuer it shall come vnto
vs, and howsoeuer qualified, the grimnesse
of her visage disguised, yet will it be feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
enough. It is <hi>dissolutio naturae,</hi> the dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of nature, and the <hi>dissociation</hi> of body
and soule, ancient friends, and of long ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance:

When <hi>Vzza</hi> was smitten dead for putting
his hand to the <hi>Arke, 2. Sam. 6. Dauid</hi> was
(angrie, shall I say?) troubled, grieued at it,
and called the name of the place, <hi>rupturam

body and soule are sundred, there is <hi>ruptura,</hi>
and cannot be without commotion, &amp; pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
<hi>Si nulla esset mortis amaritudo, non tanta

is, one, for a thousand, and in stead of all the
rest: <hi>Quoniam volens misericordiam est, Mich.</hi> 7.
Because mercie pleaseth him.<note place="margin">Dilexisti, Desiderasti, Coniunxisti Cinxisti, Complexus es.</note> So in my text,
<hi>placuit tibi, &amp;c.</hi> God so desired, and knit, and

and tooke pleasure and liking to the
life of the King, that death could not hurt
him:<note place="margin">Operuisti.</note> The very varietie of reading may stand
for a rich Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mentarie: but neither tongues,
nor pennes, of men, nor Angels can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
the riches of grace, when God is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to shew mercy vpon vs. The sweetnesse
of nature brought forth <hi>beneplacitum</hi> in
him: pleasure, brought forth loue; Loue,
desire; desire, Vnion; Vnion, embracing:
embracing girdeth close, like a girdle about
the reines; and couereth and keepeth from
hurt, that, that is beloued: <hi>In amore haec insunt
omnia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before I forsake this part,<note place="margin">Animam eruisti.</note> I must note vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you two things. First, that in death there
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> is no danger to the Soule, no more then was
to the soule of <hi>Hezekiah:</hi> for <hi>anima,</hi> in my
text, is not the substance, or essentiall part,
(as principally it signifieth,) but an act and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:6918:16"/>
effect of that soule, to weet, that life, which it
brought to the bodie in dowre, and portion
when she married with it: and when she de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parteth
from her bodie, she resumeth, and
carrieth away with her that portion againe.
So that, the <hi>Soule</hi> it selfe, is no way subiect to
the pit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Occidisti &amp; possedisti?</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Reg. 21.</note> said <hi>Elias</hi> to <hi>Ahab.</hi> So
saith God vnto death, Hast thou slaine, and
gotten possession too? but of what? the <hi>flesh</hi>
onely, not the soule: and that <hi>flesh</hi> shall lie as
a surfet in the stomacke of death: and as
the drunkard, <hi>regurgitat bilem suam,</hi> so shall
death cast it vp againe <hi>Mors</hi> is <hi>Morsus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Senec.</note> death
is but biting not a consuming, and vtter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring;
as he that biteth, taketh some, and
leaueth some, so death getteth a morsell of
flesh, as the Kite taketh garbidge from the
dunghill, and the dogge offall from the
shambles; but the soule, it medleth not with.
I cannot therfore better compare the graue,
then to the hony combe, wherein is both
hony and waxe. The hony of the soule is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
out, the waxe of the flesh remaineth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde,
till the resurrection of iust men.</p>
            <p>But as touching the <hi>flesh,</hi> the life whereof <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:6918:17"/>
is properly aimed at, here is her lot, her end,
<hi>fouea corruptionis,</hi> the pit of corruption. The
Riuers haste to the Seas, Stars to the West,
Man to the pit:<note place="margin">Iob 30.</note> it is <hi>domus constituta omni vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenti,</hi>
the house appointed to euery liuing

the house of perpetuitie, till Christs second

<hi>Iob, cap.</hi> 17. He is sure of nothing but his
graue. It were a worthy Epitaph, to be set
vpon the monument of euery man, <hi>I haue
nothing but a graue:</hi> or if you wil truly reade it,
<hi>Sepulcra, mea sunt,</hi> Graues, are mine. What
need more then one? Yes, A <hi>Graue</hi> for his
bodie, A <hi>Graue</hi> for his vanities, A <hi>Graue</hi> for
his riches, A <hi>Graue</hi> for his hopes: all is buried
with him. He that shall say, I haue houses,
and lands, and vineyards, and fields, and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,
deceiueth himselfe, and the truth is not
in him; he hath nothing certaine but his
graue. When <hi>Lazarus</hi> was raised out of his

I shall say the lesse now. But <hi>Sinne,</hi> the
sicknesse of the soule, is the reall and radicall
cause of all bodily sicknesse. I alledge but
one storie, from the 1. <hi>Reg.</hi> 17. The widow
of <hi>Zareptha</hi> cometh to <hi>Elias,</hi> (her sonne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
then dead) and saith vnto him: <hi>What
haue I to do with thee, thou man of God? art thou
come vnto me to call my sinnes to remembrance?</hi>
She was an excellent woman, and her praise
is in the Gospell: when she had <hi>but a little
meale,</hi> &amp; <hi>a little oyle in a cruise, and was gathering
two stickes,</hi> to make a widowes fire, <hi>and to
dresse for her sonne and her, that they might eate
and die;</hi> yet vpon the bidding of the Prophet,
<hi>bring vnto me,</hi> and <hi>first</hi> vnto me, such was her
faith, that she did it: yet she imputeth the
sicknesse and death of her child, to her <hi>sins.
Vespasian</hi> was of another minde; being sicke,
and out of hope to liue, he threw the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
aside, and spread his hands vnto
heauen, and complained of his gods, <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merenti
sibi vitam eripi,</hi> that he deserued not
to die; had neuer committed any thing
in his whole life, whereof he repented, but
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:6918:19"/>
one; he had so much the more cause to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
him.</p>
            <p>I hope, when <hi>Hezekiah</hi> prayeth at the third
verse, <hi>O Lord, I beseech thee, remember how I
haue walked before thee in truth, and with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect

desire, and endeuour so to do, then any
perfection; and that he had no meaning, to
thinke that he had no sinne; for it plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
in his owne speech, by the reason he
giueth, that he thought <hi>sinne</hi> to be the cause
of his sicknesse. <hi>Eruisti, quia proiecisti,</hi> first he
remitteth his <hi>sinnes;</hi> (which was the course
of our Sauiour in the Gospell) and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeueth

craue the remission of his sinnes? In his

of it: You haue heard of <hi>his truth</hi> and <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse,</hi>
and <hi>perfect heart,</hi> no mention of
sinne: and all his petition, and moane, and
teares that he spent, was for his life alone.
God granteth him that, <hi>&amp; aliquid ampliùs,</hi>
and somewhat more, <hi>&amp; aliquid melius,</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
better; for admit he had died, yet had
his case bene good enough; <hi>Mori non timeo,

hence, it will be as mill-stones vnto it, to
plunge it into the bottomlesse pit of eternall
destruction: therefore besides, and before
the cure of his sicknesse, he pardoneth his
sinnes.</p>
            <p>Wherein he dealeth with <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> as he
did with <hi>Moses, Num.</hi> 17. when he bad him
bring twelue <hi>rods</hi> for the twelue <hi>Tribes,</hi> and
lay them in the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> before the <hi>testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie;</hi>
and the <hi>rod</hi> for that <hi>Tribe</hi> which the Lord
would chuse, should <hi>bud.</hi> When <hi>Moses</hi> came
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:6918:20"/>
to reuiew the <hi>rods,</hi> the <hi>rod</hi> of <hi>Aaron</hi> had not
onely <hi>budded,</hi> that is, chipt, or broken the
rinde; but the <hi>buds</hi> were swolne, and fully
brought forth, and after <hi>buds, blossomes</hi> and
<hi>flowers,</hi> and after these, ripe <hi>Almonds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So befell it <hi>Hezekiah;</hi> so shall it all the elect
of God, who know no more what to aske,
then <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did; he thought of no more,
but the <hi>bud</hi> of his bodily health; but he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
him withall, the ripest, and sweetest
fruit of all others, forgiuenesse of his sinnes:
and (me thinketh) he fulfilleth all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of that former storie; for, let the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
of sinne, be <hi>germen,</hi> the bud; and the
pardon of all his sinnes, be <hi>gemma,</hi> the knot
or swelling bud;<note place="margin">Peccata omnia post tergum proiecisti.</note> and the leauing them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
his backe, <hi>flos,</hi> the blossome; but the
<hi>casting</hi> them behinde his backe, as if he were
angry that they prest before his face, is <hi>amyg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dala,</hi>
the fruit, more then all the rest. He that
will purge the body, leaueth no dregs of the
sicknesse, for feare of relapse: so is the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
of God, a <hi>plenary</hi> pardon of <hi>all</hi> his sins:
and whereas before they were vnder those
pure eyes that cannot behold wickednesse,
now they are set <hi>behinde his backe,</hi> that he may
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:6918:20"/>
not behold them: and not onely set, or left,
(for then, <hi>Clamabunt post nos;</hi> they will follow
God againe) but <hi>throwne,</hi> as stones from a
sling, and, with violence offered to his iustice,
banished in such sort, as that they may neuer
returne againe: so speaketh he (in effect) <hi>Psal.

not be said hereafter, he had bene the child
of an ignoble parent; whatsoeuer his other
sinnes were, wherewith he confessed he was
fraught as the vilest caytiffe vpon earth, yet
