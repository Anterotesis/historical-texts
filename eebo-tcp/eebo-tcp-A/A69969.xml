            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The <hi>odium</hi> and offences which ſome mens ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour or remiſſneſs in Church &amp; State had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted upon my Government, I reſolved to have expiated by ſuch Laws, &amp; regulations for the future, as might not only rectifie what was amiſſe in practiſe, but ſupply what was defective in the conſtitution: No man having a greater zeal to ſee Religion ſetled in Unity, and Order, than My ſelfe; whom it moſt concernes both in piety, and policy; as knowing that no flames of civill diſſentions are more dangerous then thoſe which make Religious pretenſions the grounds of Factions.</p>
               <p>I reſolved to reform, what I ſhould by free and full advice in Parliament be convinced to be amiſſe, and to grant whatever My Reaſon &amp; Conſcience told me was fit to be deſired; I wiſh I had kept my ſelfe within thoſe bounds, and not ſuffered My own Iudgement to have been over-born in ſome things, more by others Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities, then their Arguments; My confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence had leſſe betrayed My ſelf, and My King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes to thoſe advantages which ſome men ſought for, who wanted nothing but power and occaſion to do miſchiefe.</p>
               <p>But our ſinnes being ripe, there was no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting of Gods Iuſtice, from reaping that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in our Calamities, which we robb'd him of in our Proſperity.</p>
               <p>For thou (O Lord) haſt made us ſee, that Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of future Reforming do not alwaies ſatisfie
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:38600:6"/>
thy Juſtice, nor prevent thy vengeance for former miſcarriages.</p>
               <p>Our ſins have over laid our hopes, Thou haſt taught us to depend on thy mercies to forgive, not on our purpoſe to amend. When thou haſt vindicated thy glory by thy Iudgement, and haſt ſhewed us how unſafe it is to offend thee upon preſumptions after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to pleaſe thee; Then I trust thy mercies wil reſtore thoſe bleſsings to us, which we have ſo much abuſed, as to force thee to deprive us of them.</p>
               <p>For want of timely repentance of our ſins, thou givest us cauſe to repent of thoſe Remedies we too late apply.</p>
               <p>Yet I do not Repent of my calling this laſt Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, becauſe [O Lord,] I did it with an upright intention to Thy glory, and My Peoples good.</p>
               <p>The miſeries which have enſued upon Me and My Kingdomes, are the juſt effects of thy displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure upon us; and may be yet (through thy mercy) preparatives of us to future bleſſings, and better hearts to enioy them.</p>
               <p>O Lord, though thou haſt deprived us of many former comſorts; yet grant Me and my People the benefit of our afflictions, and thy chaſtiſements, that thy rod as well as thy Staffe may comfort us: Then ſhall we dare to account them the ſtrokes not of an Enemy but, a Father, when thou giveſt us thoſe humble affections, that meaſure of patience in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, which becoms thy Children; I ſhall have no cauſe to repent the miſeries this Parliament hath occaſioned, when by them thou hast brought

               <p>Thy Grace is infinitely better with our ſufferings then our peace could be with our ſins. <hi>O</hi> thou Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign goodneſs and wiſdom who over-ruleſt all our Counſels, over rules alſo all our hearts, that the worſe things we ſuffer by thy iuſtice, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I Looked upon my Lord of <hi>Strafford,</hi> as a Gentleman, whoſe great abilities might make a Prince rather afraid, then aſhamed to employ him in the greateſt affaires of State.</p>
               <p>For, thoſe were prone to create in him great confidence of undertakings, and this was like e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to betray him to great errours, and many
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:38600:7"/>
Enemies; whereof he could not but contract good ſtore, while moving in ſo high a ſpheare, and with ſo vigorous a luſtre, he muſt need, [as the ſun] raiſe many envious exhalations, which condenſed by a popular Odium, were capable to caſt a cloud upon the brighteſt merit and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity.</p>
               <p>Though I cannot in my judgement approve all he did, driven (it may be) by the neceſſities of times, and the Temper of that people, more then led by his own diſpoſition to any height and rigour of actions, yet I could never be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of any ſuch criminouſneſſe in him, as willingly to expoſe his life to the ſtroak of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and malice of his Enemies.</p>
               <p>I never met with more unhappy conjuncture of affaires, then in the buſineſſe of that unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Earl: when between My own unſatisfied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in Conſcience, and a neceſſity (as ſome told me) of ſatisfying the importunities of ſome people, I was perſwaded by thoſe, that I think wiſhed me well, to chuſe rather what was ſafe, then what ſeemed juſt; preferring the outward peace of My Kingdoms with men, before that inward exactneſſe of Conſcience before God.</p>
               <p>And indeed, I am ſo farre from excuſing or denying that complyance on my part (for ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary conſent it was not) to his deſtruction, whom in my judgement I thought not, by any clear Law, gilty of death; That I never bare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny touch of Conſcience with greater regret:
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:38600:7"/>
which, as a ſign of my repentance, I have often with ſorrow confeſſed both to God and men, as an act of ſo ſinfull frailty, that it diſcovered more a feare of Man, than of God, whoſe name and place on Earth no man is worthy to bear, who will avoid inconveniences of State, by acts of ſo high injuſtice, as no publique conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence can expiate or compenſate.</p>
               <p>I ſee it a bad exchange to wound a mans own Conſcience, thereby to ſalve State ſores; to calme the ſtormes of popular diſcontents, by ſtirring up a tempeſt in a mans own boſome.</p>
               <p>Nor hath Gods juſtice failed in the event and ſad conſequences, to ſhew the world the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy of that Maxime, <hi>Better one man periſh (though uniuſtly) then the people be diſpleaſed, or deſtroyed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For, In all likelyhood I could never have ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with My People greater calamities (yet with greater comfort) had I vindicated <hi>Strafford s</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, at leaſt by denying to ſigne that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive Bill, according to that juſtice, which my Conſcience ſuggeſted, to me, then I have done ſince I gratified ſome mens unthankfull importunities with ſo cruell a favour. And <hi>I</hi> have obſerved, that thoſe, who counſelled me to ſign that Bill, have been ſo farre from receiving the rewards of ſuch ingratiatings with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that no men have bin haraſſed and cruſhed more than they: He only hath bin leaſt vexed by them, who counſelled me not to conſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:38600:8"/>
the vote of my owne Conſcience, I hope God hath forgiven me and them the ſinfull raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of that buſines.</p>
               <p>To which being in my Soul ſo fully conſcious, thoſe judgments God hath pleaſed to ſend upon me, are ſo much the more welcome, as a meanes (I hope) which his mercy hath ſanctified ſo to me, as to make me repent of that unjuſt act, (for ſo it was to me) and for the future to teach me, That the beſt rule of policy is to prefer the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Iuſtice before all enjoyments, and the peace of my conſcience before the preſervation of my Kingdoms.</p>

               <p>Nor were the Crimes objected againſt him ſo clear, as after a long and fair hearing, to give convincing ſatisfaction to the major part of both Houſes; eſpecially that of the Lords, of whom ſcarce a third part were preſent, when the Bill paſſed that Houſe: And for the Houſe

               <p>And that after Act vacating the authority of the precedent, for future imitation, ſufficiently tells the world, that ſome remorſe touched even his moſt implacable Enemies, as knowing he had very hard meaſure, and ſuch as they would be very loath ſhould be repeated to themſelves.</p>
               <p>This tenderneſſe and regret I find in my ſoul, for having had any hand [and that very unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly God knows] in ſhedding one mans bloud unjuſtly (though under the colour and formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Juſtice, and pretences of avoiding pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like miſchiefs:) which may, I hope, be ſome e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence before God and Man, to all poſterity, that I am far from bearing juſtly the vaſt load and guilt of all that bloud which hath been ſhed in this unhappy War: which ſome men will needs charge on Me, to caſe their own ſoules, who am, and ever ſhall be more afraid to take

               <p>But thou, O God of infinite mercies, forgive me that act of ſinfull complyance, which hath greater aggravations upon Me, then any Man.

               <p>MY going to the Houſe of Commons to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand juſtice upon the 5. Members, was an act, which my enemies loaded with all the oblo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies and exaſperations they could.</p>
               <p>It filled indifferent men with great jealouſies and fears; yea; and many of my freinds reſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it as a motion riſing rather from Paſſion than Reaſon, and not guided with ſuch diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:38600:10"/>
as the touchines of thoſe times required. But theſe men knew not the faſt motives, and preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant grounds, with which <hi>I</hi> thought my ſelf ſo furniſhed, that they needed nothing to ſuch evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as I could have produced againſt thoſe I charged, ſave only a free &amp; legall Triall, which was all I deſired.</p>
               <p>Nor had <hi>I</hi> any temptation of diſpleaſure or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge againſt thoſe mens perſons, further then I had diſcovered thoſe [as <hi>I</hi> thought] unlawful correſpondencies they had uſed, &amp; engagements they had made to embroyle my Kingdomes; of all which I miſſed but little to have produced writings under ſome mens owne hands, who were the chief contrivers of the following inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations.</p>
               <p>Providence would not have it ſo, yet I wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not ſuch probabilities as were ſufficient to raiſe jealouſies in any Kings heart, who is not wholly ſtupid and neglective of the publick peace, which to preſerve by calling in queſtion halfe a dozen men, in a fair and legall way, (which God knows was all my deſign) could have amounted to no worſe effect, had it ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, then either to do me and my Kingdome right, in caſe they had bin found guilty; or elſe to have clear'd their innocency, and removed my ſuſpitions; which, as they were not raiſed out of any malice, ſo neither were they in Reaſon to be ſmothered.</p>
               <p>What flames of diſcontent this ſpark (though
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:38600:10"/>
I ſought by all ſpeedy and poſſible means to quench it) ſoon kindled, all the world is witnes: The aſperſion which ſome men caſt upon that action, as if I had deſigned by force to aſſault the Houſe of Commons, and invade their privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, is ſo falſe, that as God beſt knows, I had no ſuch intent; ſo none that attended Me could juſtly gather from any thing I then ſaid, or did, the leaſt intimation of any ſuch thoughts.</p>
               <p>That I went attended with ſome Gentlemen as it was no unwonted thing for the Majeſty and ſafety of a King ſo to be attended, eſpecially in diſcontented times, ſo were my followers at that time ſhort of my ordinary guard, and no way proportionable to hazard a tumultuary conflict. Nor were they more ſcared at my comming, then I was unaſſured of not having ſome affronts caſt upon me, if I had none with me to preſerve a reverence to me; For ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny people had, [at that time] learned to think thoſe hard thoughts, which they have ſince a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly vented againſt Me, both by words and deeds.</p>
               <p>The ſumme of that buſineſſe was this.</p>
               <p>Thoſe men and their adherents were then looked upon by the afrighted vulgar as greater Protectors of their Lawes and Liberties, then my ſelf, and ſo worthier of their protection. I leave them to God, and their own Conſciences, who, if guilty of evill machinations; no preſent impunity, or popular vindications of them will

be <hi>ſubter fuge</hi> ſufficient to reſcue them from thoſe exact Tribunalls.</p>
               <p>To which, in the obſtructions of juſtice among men, we muſt religiouſly appeale, as being an argument to us Chriſtians of that after un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable judgement, which ſhall rejudge, what among men is but corruptly decided, or not at all.</p>
               <p>I endeavoured to have prevented, if God had ſeen fit, thoſe future commotions, which I fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw, would in all likelyhood follow ſome mens activity [if not reſtrained] and ſo now hath don to the undoing of many thouſands, the more is the pitty.</p>
               <p>But to over-awe the freedom of the Houſes, or to weaken their juſt Authority by any vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent impreſſions upon them, was not at all my deſign: I thought I had ſo much juſtice and reaſon on my ſide, as ſhould not have needed ſo rough aſſiſtance: and I was reſolved rather to bear the repulſe with patience, then to uſe ſuch hazardous extremities.</p>
               <p>But thou O Lord art my witneſſe in heaven, and in my Heart: if I have purpoſed anie violence or oppreſſion againſt the innocent, or if there were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie ſuch wickedneſse in my thoughts.</p>

As it is one of the moſt convincing Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that there is a God, while his power ſets bounds to the raging of the Seas, ſo 'tis no leſſe, that he reſtraines the madneſſe of the people. Nor doth any thing portend more Gods diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure againſt a Nation, then when he ſuffers the confluence and clamours of the vulgar, to paſſe all boundaries of Lawes, and reverence to Authority.</p>
               <p>VVhich thoſe Tumults did to ſo high degrees of inſolence, that they ſpared not to invade the Honour and Freedome of the two Houſes, menacing, reproaching, ſhaking, yea and aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſome Members of both Houſes, as they fancyed, or diſliked them; nor did they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare moſt rude and unſeemly deportments both in contemptuous words and actions, to my ſelfe and my Court.</p>
               <p>Nor was this a ſhort fit or two of ſhaking, as an Ague, but a quotidian feaver, always encreaſing to higher inflamations, impatient of any miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, reſtraint, or remiſſion.</p>
               <p>Firſt, they muſt be a guard againſt thoſe fears which ſome men ſcared themſelves and others withall, when indeed nothing was more to be feared and leſſe to be uſed by wiſe men, then thoſe tumultuary confluxes of meane and rude people, who are taught firſt to petition, then to protect, then to dictate, at laſt to command and overawe the Parliament.</p>
               <p>All obſtructions in Parliament [that is, all

freedome of differing in Votes, and debating matters with reaſon and candour) muſt be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away with theſe Tumults: By theſe muſt the Houſes be purged, and all rotten Members (as they pleaſe to count them) caſt out; By theſe the obſtinacy of men reſolved to diſcharg their Conſciences, muſt be ſubdued; by theſe all factious, ſeditious, and ſchiſmaticall propoſalls againſt Government Eccleſiaſticall or Civill, muſt be backed and abetted, till they prevailed.</p>
               <p>Generally, who ever had moſt mind to bring forth confuſion and ruine upon Church and State, uſed the midwifery of thoſe Tumults: whoſe riot and impatience was ſuch, that they would not ſtay the ripening &amp; ſeaſon of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells or fair production of Acts, in the order, gravity, and deliberateneſſe befitting a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but ripped up with barbarous cruelty, &amp; forcibly cut out abortive Votes, ſuch as their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viters and incouragers moſt fancyed.</p>
               <p>Yea, ſo enormous and deteſtable were their outrages, that no ſober man could be without an infinite ſhame and ſorrow to ſee them ſo to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated, and connived at by ſome, countenanced, encouraged and applauded by others.</p>
               <p>What good man had not rather want any thing he moſt deſired for the publique good, then ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it by ſuch an unlawfull and irreligious means?

I conceived this Parliament would ſind work with convenient Receſſes for the firſt 3. yeares; But I did not imagine that ſome Men would thereby have occaſioned more work then they found to do, by undoing ſo much as they found well don to their hands.</p>
               <p>Such is ſome mens activity, that they will needs make worke rather then want it; &amp; chuſe to be doing amiſſe, rather then doe nothing.</p>
               <p>When that firſt Act ſeemed too ſcanty to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy ſome mens fears, and compaſſe publick af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs; I was perſwaded to grant that BILL of Sitting during the pleaſure of the Houſes, which amounted, in ſome mens ſenſe, to as much as the perpetuating of this Parliament. By this Act of higheſt confidence, I hoped for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to ſhut out, and lock the door upon all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent jealouſies, and future miſtakes. I confeſſe I did not thereby intend to ſhut My ſelfe out of doores, as ſome men have now requited Me.</p>
               <p>True, it was an Act unparallel'd by any of My Predeceſſors; yet cannot in reaſon admit of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny worſe interpretation then this, of an extream confidence I had, That my Subjects would not make ill uſe of an Act, by which I declared ſo much to truſt them, as to deny my ſelf in ſo high a point of my Prerogative.</p>
               <p>For, good Subjects will never think it juſt or fit that my condition ſhould be worſe by my bettering theirs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nor indeed would it have been ſo in the events, if ſome men had known as well
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:38600:16"/>
with moderation to uſe, as with earneſtnes to defire advantages of doing good or evill.</p>
               <p>A continuall Parliament (I thought) would but keep the commonweal in tune, by preſerving Laws in their due execution and vigour; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in my Intereſt lyes more then any mans, ſince by thoſe Laws, My Rights as a King, would be preſerved no leſſe then My Subjects, which is al I deſired. More then the Law gives Me I would not have, and leſſe the meaneſt Subject ſhould not.</p>
               <p>Some (as I have heard) gave it out, that I ſoon repented Me of ſetling that act; &amp; many would needs perſwade Me, I had cauſe ſo to do; But I could not eaſily nor ſudenly ſuſpect ſuch ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude in Men of Honour. That the more I gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them, the leſſe I ſhould have and enjoy with them. I ſtill counted my Selfe undiminiſhed by my largeſt Conceſſions, if by them I might gain and confirme the love of my people.</p>
               <p>Of which, I do not yet deſpair, but that God will ſtill bleſſe me with increaſe of it, when men ſhall have more leiſure, and leſſe prejudice; that ſo with unpaſſionate repreſentations they may reflect upon thoſe (as <hi>I</hi> think) not more Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then freindly Contributions, which <hi>I</hi> granted toward the perpetuating of their happines; who are now only miſerable in this, That ſome mens ambition will not give them leave to enioy what <hi>I</hi> intended for their good.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:38600:17"/>
Nor do I doubt, but that in Gods due time, the Loyall and cleared affections of My people, will ſtrive to returne ſuch retributions of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and love to Mee, or my poſterity, as may fully compenſate both the acts of my confidence and my ſufferings for them; which (God knowes) have been neither few, nor ſmall, nor ſhort; occaſioned chiefly by a perſwaſion I had, that I could not grant too much, or diſtruſt too little, to men, that being profeſſedly My Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, pretended ſingular piety, and religious ſtrictneſſe.</p>
               <p>The Injury of all Injuries, is, That which ſome men will needs load me withall; as if I were a wilfull and reſolved Occaſioner of My owne, and My Subjects miſeries, while (as they confidently, but (God knowes) falſly divulge) I repini<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Sure it had argued a very ſhort ſight of things, and extreme fatuity of minde in Me, ſo farre to binde My owne hands at their requeſt, If I had ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meant to have uſed a Sword againſt them. God knowes, though I had then a ſenſe of inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; yet not ſuch as to think them worth vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicating by a Warre: I was not then compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, as ſince, to injure my ſelfe by their not u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing favours, with the ſame candour wherewith they were conferred. The Tumults indeed threatned to abuſe all Acts of Grace, and turne

them into wantonneſſe; but I thought at length their owne feares, whoſe black arts firſt raiſed up thoſe turbulent Spirits, would force them to conjure them down againe.</p>
               <p>Nor if I had juſtly reſented any indignities put upon Me, or others; was I then in any capacity to have taken juſt revenge in an Hoſtile and Warlike way, upon thoſe whom I knew ſo wel fortified in the love of the meaner ſort of the people, that I could not have given my enemies greater and more deſired advantages againſt Me, then by ſo unprincely inconſtancy, to have aſſaulted them with Armes, thereby to ſcatter them, whom but lately I had ſolemly ſetled by an Act of Parliament.</p>
               <p>God knows, I longed for nothing more then that My ſelfe, and My Subjects might quietly enjoy the fruits of my many condeſcendings.</p>
               <p>It had been a Courſe full of ſin, as well as of Hazard, and Diſhonour, for me to go about the cutting up of that by the Sword, which I had ſo lately planted, ſo much (as I thought) to my Subjects content, and Mine owne too, in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability: if ſome men had not feared where no feare was, whoſe ſecurity conſiſted in ſcaring o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>I thank God, I knew ſo well the ſincerity and uprightneſſe of My owne heart, in paſſing that great Bill, which exceeded the very thoughts of former times; That although I may ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Concluding, that without a miracle, Monarchy it ſelf, together with Me, could not but be daſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in peices by ſuch a precipitious fall as they intended, whom God in mercy forgive, and make them ſee at length, That as many King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes as the Devill ſhewed our Saviour, and the glory of them) if they could be at once en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed by them] are not worth the gaining, by wayes of ſinfull ingratitude and diſhonour, which hazards a Soule worth more worlds, then this hath Kingdoms.</p>
               <p>But God hath hitherto preſerved Me, &amp; made Me to ſee, That it is no ſtrange thing for men, left to their own paſſions, either to do much e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill themſelvs, or abuſe the over-much goodneſs of others, whereof an ungratefull ſurfet is the moſt deſperate and incurable diſeaſe,</p>

               <p>For 'tis among the wicked Maximes of bold

               <p>Nor is it ſtrange that they who imployed them at firſt in ſo high a ſervice, and ſo ſucceſſefull to them, ſhould not find mercy enough to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give Him, who had ſo much premerited of them For, Apoſtacy unto Loyalty ſome men account the moſt unpardonable ſinne.</p>

               <p>That which makes me more pity him is, that after he begun to have ſome inclinations to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a repentance for his ſinne, and reparations of his duty to Me, He ſhould be ſo unhappy as to fall into the hands of their Juſtice, and not my Mercy, who could as willingly have forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him, as he could have asked that favour of Me.

               <p>Poor Gentleman, he is now become a noteable monument of unproſperous diſloyalty, teaching the world by ſo ſad and unfortunate a ſpectacle, that the rude carriage of a Subject towards his Soveraigne carries alwayes its own vengeance, as an unſeparable ſhadow with it, and thoſe oft prove the moſt fatall, and implacable Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners of it, who were the firſt imployers in the ſervice.</p>

Thou haſt pleaded my cauſe, even before the ſons of men, and taken the matter into thine own hands; that men may know it was thy work, and ſee that thou, Lord, haſt done it.</p>
               <p>I do not, I dare not ſay, ſo let mine enemies periſh O Lord! yea Lord, rather give them repentance, pardon, and impunity, if it be thy bleſſed will.</p>
               <p>Let not thy iuſtice prevent the obiects and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of my mercy: yea, let them live and amend who have moſt offended me in ſo high a nature: that I may have thoſe to forgive, who beare moſt propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in their offences to thoſe treſpaſſes againſt thy Maieſty, which I hope thy mercy hath forgiven me.</p>
               <p>Lord lay not their ſins (who yet live) to their charge for condemnation, but to their conſciences for amendment: Let the lightning of this Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbolt, which hath been ſo ſevere a puniſhment to one, be a torrour to all.</p>
               <p>Diſcover to them their ſinne, who know not they have done amiſſe: and ſcare them from their ſinne, that ſin of malicious wickedneſſe.</p>
               <p>That, preventing thy Iudgements by their true repentance, they may eſcape the ſtrokes of thine eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall vengeance.</p>

               <p>But ſome men knew, I was like to bring the ſame judgement and conſtancy, which I carry with me, which would never fit their deſignes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo while they invited me to come, and grei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly complain'd of my abſence, yet they could not but be pleaſed with it: eſpecially when they had found out that plaſible and popular pretext of raiſing an Army to fetch in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents: when all that while they never puniſhed the greateſt and moſt intolerable Delinquency of the Tumults, and their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citers, which drave my ſelfe, and ſo many of both Houſes from their places, by moſt bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous indignities, which yet in all reaſon and Honour, they were as loath to have deſerted
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:38600:32"/>
as thoſe others were willing they ſhould, that ſo they might have occaſion to perſecute them with the Injuries of an Army, for not ſuffering more tamely the Injuries of the Tumults.</p>
               <p>That this is the true ſtate, and firſt drift and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne in raiſing an Army againſt Me, is by the ſequell ſo evident, that all other pretences va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh. For when they declared by Propoſitions, or Treaties, what they would have to appeaſe them; there was nothing of conſequence offered to Me, or demanded of Me, as any originall dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in any point of Law, or order of Juſtice. But among other leſſer Innovations, this chiefly was urged, The Abolition of Epiſcopall, and the Eſtabliſhment of Presbyterian Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>All other things at any time propounded were either impertinent as to any ground of a War, or eaſily granted by Me, and only to make up a number, or elſe they were meerly conſequenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and acceſſary, after the Warre was by them unjuſtly began.</p>
               <p>I cannot hinder other mens thoughts, whom the noiſe and ſhew of piety, and heat for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation and Religion, might eaſily ſo fill with prejudice, that all equality and clearneſſe of judgement might be obſtructed. But this was, and is, as to my beſt obſervation, the true ſtate of affaires betweene us, when they firſt raiſed an Army, with this deſigne, either to ſtop My mouth, or to force My conſent: and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:38600:32"/>
in this truth, as to My conſcience, (who was (God knowes) as far from meditating a VVar, as I was in the eye of the world from having any preparation for one) I find that comfort, that in the midſt of all the unfortunate ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes of this VVar, on My ſide, I do not think My Innocencie any whit prejudiced or darkned; Nor am I without that integrity, and Peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, as with humble confidence to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe My Prayer to Him.</p>
               <p>For Thou, O Lord, ſeeſt clearly through all the cloudings of humane affaires; Thou Judgeſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out preiudice: Thy Omniſcience eternally guids thy unerrable Iudgement.</p>
               <p>O my God, the proud are riſen againſt me, and the aſſemblies of violent men have ſought after my ſoule, and have not ſet Thee before their eyes.</p>
               <p>Conſider my Enemies, O Lord, for they are many, &amp; they hate me with deadly hatred, without a cauſe.</p>
               <p>For Thou knoweſt, I had no paſſion, deſigne or preparation to embroyle My Kingdoms in a Civill War; whereto I had leaſt temptation; as knowing I muſt adventure more then any, and could gaine leaſt of any by it.</p>
               <p>Thou O Lord, art my witneſſe how oft I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored, and ſtudied to divert the neceſſity thereof, wherein I cannot well be thought ſo prodigally thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty of my Subiects blood, as to venture my own life, which I have bin oft compelled to do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:38600:33"/>
O Lord; I need much of thy grace, with patience to bear the many afflictions thou haſt ſuffered ſome men to bring upon me; but much more to bear the uniust reproaches of thoſe, who not content that I ſuffer moſt by warre, will needs perſwade the world that I have raiſed firſt, or given juſt cauſe to raiſe it.</p>
               <p>The confidence of ſome mens falſe tougues is ſuch, that they would make me almost ſuspect my own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency yea, I could be content (at leaſt by my ſilence) to take upon me ſo great a guilt before men, If by that I might allay the malice of my Enemies, &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme My People from this miſerable Warre; ſince thou O Lord knoweſt my Innocency in this thing. Thou wilt find out bloudy &amp; deceitfull men; many of whom have not lived out half their dayes, in which they promiſed themſelvs the enioyment of the fruits of their violent and wicked Councells.</p>
               <p>Save, O Lord thy ſervant, as hitherto thou haſt; and in thy due time ſcatter the people that delight in War.</p>
               <p>Ariſe O Lord, lift up thy ſelfe, becauſe of the rage of mine Enemyes, which encreaſeth more and more: Behold them that have conceived miſchief, travelled with iniquity, and brought forth fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhood.</p>
               <p>Thou knowest the chief deſigne of this Warre is, either to deſtroy my Perſon, or force My Iudgement, and to make Me renege my Conſcience and thy Truth.</p>
               <p>I am driven to croſſe Davids choice; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire

rather to fall into the hands of men, by denying them, (though their mercy be cruell) then into thy hands by ſinning againſt My Conſcience, and in that againſt thee, who art a conſuming fire; Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they deſtroy Me, then thou ſhouldeſt damne Me.</p>
               <p>Be thou ever the defence of My ſoule, who wilt ſave the upright in heart.</p>
               <p>If nothing but My bloud will ſatisfie My Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, or quench the flames of My Kingdomes, or thy temporall Iuſtice, I am content, if it be thy will, that it be ſhed by Mine owne Subiects hands.</p>
               <p>But O let the bloud of Me, though their King, yet a ſinner, be daſhed with the bloud of My Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and peace-making Redeemer, for in that thy Iuſtice, will find not only a temporary expiation, but an eternall plenary ſatisfaction; both for my ſins, and the ſins of my People; whom I beſeech thee ſtill owne for thine; and when thy wrath is appeaſed by my Death, O Remember thy great mercies toward them, and forgive them, O my Father, for they know not what they doe.</p>

               <p>No man can doubt but they prevented Me, in their purpoſes, as well as their injuries, who are ſo much before-hand in their preparations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Me, and ſurprizalls of My ſtrength. Such as are not for Them, yet dare not be for Me; ſo overaw'd is their Loyalty by the others numbers and terrours. I beleive my Innocency, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preparedneſſe to aſſert my Rights and Honour, makes Me the more guilty in their eſteem; who would not ſo eaſily have declared a war againſt Me, if I had firſt aſſaulted them.</p>
               <p>They knew my chiefeſt Arms left Me, were thoſe only, which the ancient Chriſtians were wont to uſe againſt their Perſecutors, Prayers and Tears. Theſe may ſerve a good mans turn, if not to Conquer as a Souldier, yet to Suffer as a Martyr.</p>
               <p>Their preventing of Me, and ſurprizing My Caſtles, Forts, Armes, and Navy, with the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:38600:34"/>
Militia, is ſo far beſt for Me, That it may drive me from putting any truſt in the arme of fleſh, and wholy to caſt my ſelf into the protection of the living God, who can ſave by few, or none, as well as by many.</p>
               <p>He that made the greedy Ravens to be ELYAS Caterers, and bring him foode, may alſo make their ſurprizall of outward force and defence, an opportunity to ſhew me the ſpeciall ſupport of his power and protection.</p>
               <p>I thank God I reckon not now the want of the Militia ſo much in reference to My owne prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction as My Peoples<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>Their many and ſore oppreſſions greive Me, I am above My Owne; what I want in the hands of Force and Power, I have in the wings of faith and Prayer.</p>
               <p>But this is the ſtrange method theſe Men will needs take to reſolve their riddle of making me a glorious King, by taking away my Kingly power: Thus I ſhall become a ſupport to My Freinds, and a Terrour to My Enemies, by being unable to ſuccour the one, or ſuppreſs the other. For thus have they deſigned, &amp; propoſed to Me the new-modelling of Soveraignty and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; as without any reality of power, ſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any neceſſity of ſubjection and obedience; That the Majeſty of the Kings of England might hereafter hang like Mahomets Tomb, by a mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netique Charm, between the Power and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of the two Houſes in an aiery imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Regality.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:38600:35"/>
But, I believe, the ſurfet of too much Power, which ſome men have greedily ſeiz'd on, &amp; now ſeek wholly to devour, wil ere long make the Common-wealth ſick both of it and them, ſince they cannot well digeſt it; Soveraigne Power in Subjects ſeldome agreeing with the ſtomacks of fellow Subjects.</p>
               <p>Yet I have even in this point of the conſtant <hi>Militia</hi> ſought, by ſatisfying their feares, and importunities, both to ſecure My Freinds, &amp; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercom Mine enemies, to gain the peace of al, by depriving My ſelf of a ſole power to helpe, or hurt any: yeilding the <hi>Militia</hi> (which is my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Right no leſſe than the Crowne) to be diſpoſed of; as the two Houſes ſhall thinke fit, during My time.</p>
               <p>So willing am I to bury all jealouſies of me, in them, &amp; to live above all jealouſies of them, as to My ſelf; I deſire not to be ſafer than I wiſh them &amp; My People, if I had the ſole actuall diſpoſing of the <hi>Militia,</hi> I could not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect My People, further than they protected Me, &amp; themſelvs: ſo that the uſe of the <hi>Militia</hi> is mutuall. I would but defend My ſelf ſo far, as to be able to defend My good Subjects from thoſe mens violence and fraud, who conſcious to their own evill merits and deſignes, will needs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the world, that none but Wolves are fit to be truſted with the cuſtody of the Shepheard and his Flock. Miſerable experience hath taught My Subjects, ſince Power hath beene wreſted
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:38600:35"/>
from Me, and imployed againſt Me and Them, that neither can be ſafe, if both be not in ſuch a way as the Law hath entruſted the publique ſafety and welfare.</p>
               <p>Yet even this Conſeſſion of Mine as to the exerciſe of the <hi>Militia,</hi> ſo vaſt and large, is not ſatisfactory to ſome men; which ſeeme to be Enemies not to Me onely, but to all Monarchy; and are reſolved to tranſmit to poſterity ſuch Jealouſies of the Crowne, as they ſhould never permit it to enjoy its juſt and neceſſary Rights, in point of Power; to which (at laſt) all Law is reſolved, while thereby it is beſt protected.</p>
               <p>But here Honour and Juſtice, due to My Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, forbid Me to yeild to ſuch a totall alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of that power from them, which civility and duty (no leſſe then juſtice and honour) ſhould have forbad them to have asked of Me.</p>
               <p>For, although I can be content to Eclypſe My owne beames, to ſatisfie their feares, who think they muſt needs be ſcorched or blinded, if I ſhould ſhine in the full luſture of Kingly Power, wherewith God and the Lawes have inveſted Me; yet I will never conſent to put out the Sun of Soveraignty to all Poſterity, and ſucceeding Kings; whoſe juſt recovery of their Rights, from unjuſt uſurpations and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortions, ſhall never be prejudiced or obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by any Act of Mine; which indeed would not be more injurious to ſucceeding Kings, than to My Subjects; whom I deſire
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:38600:36"/>
to leave in a condition not wholly deſperate for the future; ſo as by a Law to be ever ſubjected to thoſe many factious diſtractions, which muſt needs follow the many-headed <hi>Hydra</hi> of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: which, as it makes a ſhew to the People to have more eyes to foreſee, ſo they wil find it hath more mouths too, which muſt be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied: and (at beſt) it hath rather a monſtroſity, than any thing of perfection, beyond that of right Monarchy; where counſell may be in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as the ſenſes, but the ſupreame Power can be but in One as the Head.</p>
               <p>Happily, when men have tried the horrours and malignant influence which will certainly follow My enforced darkneſſe and Eclypſe, (occaſioned by the interpoſition and ſhaddow of that body, which as the Moon receiveth its chiefeſt light from Me) they will at length more eſteem and welcome the reſtored glory and bleſſing of the Suns light.</p>
               <p>And, if at preſent I may ſeem by My receding ſo much from the uſe of My Right in the power of the <hi>Militia,</hi> to come ſhort of the diſcharge of that truſt, to which I am ſworne for My Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples protection. I conceive thoſe men are guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the enforced perjury, (if ſo it may ſeem) who compell Me to take this new and ſtrange way of diſcharging My truſt, by ſeeming to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert it; of protecting My Subjects, by expoſing My ſelfe to danger or diſhonour, for their ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and quiet.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:38600:36"/>
VVhich, in the conflicts of Civill VVar and advantages of Power, cannot be effected but by ſome ſide yeilding; to which the greateſt love of the publique Peace, and the firmeſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of Gods protection (ariſing from a good conſcience) doth more invite Me, than can be expected from other mens fears; which ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from the injuſtice of their Actions (though never ſo ſucceſſefull) yet dare not adventure their Authors upon any other way of ſafety then that of the Sword and <hi>Militia;</hi> which yet are but weak defences againſt the ſtroaks of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine vengeance, which will overtake; or of mens owne Conſciences, which alwayes at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend injurious perpetraſions.</p>
               <p>For my ſelfe, I do not think that I can want a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing which providentiall neceſſity is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to take from Me, in order to my Peoples tranquillity and Gods glory, whoſe protection is ſufficient for me; and he is able, by his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with me, abundantly to compenſate to Me, as he did to <hi>Iob,</hi> what ever honour, power, or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty the Caldeans, the Sabeans, or the Devill himſelfe can deprive Me of.</p>
               <p>Although they take from Me all defence of Armes and <hi>Militia;</hi> all refuge by Land, of Forts, and Caſtles; all flight by Sea in My Ships, and Navie; yea, though they ſtudy to Rob me of the Hearts of my Subjects, the greateſt Treaſure &amp; beſt Ammunition of a King, yet cannot they deprive me of my own innocency, or Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy

               <p>But in all their Propoſitions I can obſerve little of theſe kinds, or to theſe ends; Nothing of any Lawes diſ-joynted, which are to be reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; of any right invaded; of any Juſtice to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obſtructed; of any compenſations to be made; of any impartiall reformation to be granted; to al, or any of which, reaſon, Religion, true Policy, or any other humane motives, might induce me.</p>
               <p>But, as to the maine matters propounded by them at any time, in which is either great no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty, or difficulty, I perceive that what were formerly look't upon as Factions in the State, and Schiſmes in the Church, and ſo, puniſhable by the Lawes, have now the confidence, by vulgar clamours, and aſſiſtance (chiefly) to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand not only Tolerations of themſelves, in their vanity, novelty, and confuſion; but alſo Abolition of the Lawes againſt them; and a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall extirpation of that Government, whoſe Rights they have a mind to invade.</p>
               <p>This, as to the maine; other Propoſitions

are (for the moſt part) but as waſte paper, in thoſe which are wrapped up, to preſent them ſomewhat more handſomely. Nor do I ſo much wonder at the variety, &amp; horrible novelty of ſome Propoſitions (therebeing nothing ſo mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous, which ſome fancies are not prone to long for.

               <p>Such Armies of Propoſitions having ſo little, in My Judgement, of reaſon, J uſtice, and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on their ſide, as they had Tumult and Faction for their riſe, muſt not go alone, but ever be backt and ſeconded, with Armies of Souldiers: Though the ſecond ſhould prevaile againſt My Perſon, yet the firſt ſhall never overcome Me, further than I ſee cauſe; for, I look not at their number and power ſo much, as I weigh their Reaſon and Juſtice.</p>
               <p>Had the two Houſes firſt ſued out their livery, and once effectually redeemed themſelves from the Wardſhip of the Tumults, (which can be no other than the Hounds that attend the cry, and hollow of thoſe Men, who hunt after Factious and private Deſignes, to the ruine of Church and State.)</p>

               <p>For, I have charity enough to think, there are wiſe men among them: and humility to think, that, as in ſome things I may want; ſo tis fit I ſhould uſe their adviſe; which is the end for which I called them to a Parliament. But yet I cannot allow their wiſdom ſuch a compleatneſſe and inerrability as to exclude My ſelf; ſince none of them hath that part to Act, that Truſt to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, nor that Eſtate and Honour to preſerve as My ſelf; without whoſe Reaſon concurrent with theirs (as the Suns influence is neceſſary in Nallatures productions) they cannot beget, or bring forth any one compleat and authoritative Act of publick wiſdom, which makes the Laws. But the unreaſonableneſſe of ſome Propoſitions not is more evident to Me, than this is, That they are not the joynt and free deſires of thoſe in their Major number, who are of right to Sit and Vote in Parliament.</p>
               <p>For, many of them ſavour very ſtrong of that old leaven of Innovations, masked vnder the name of Reformation; which, in my two laſt famous Predeceſſours daies, heaved at, and ſometime threatned both Prince and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments: But, I am ſure was never wont ſo farre to infect the whole maſſe of the Nobility

               <p>Not that I am ignorant, how the choice of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Members was carried by much faction in the Countryes; ſome thirſting after nothing more, than a paſſionate revenge of what ever diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure they had conceived againſt me, my Court, or the Clergy.</p>
               <p>But all reaſon bids me impute theſe ſudden and vaſt deſires of change to thoſe few, who ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med themſelves with the many-headed, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>handed Tumults.</p>
               <p>No leſſe doth Reaſon, Honour; and Safety both of Church and State command me, to chew ſuch morſells, before I let them down; If the ſtraitnes of my coſcience will not give me leave to ſwallow down ſuch Camels, as others do of ſacriledg, &amp; injuſtice both to God &amp; man, they have no more cauſe to quarrell withme, than for this, that my throat is not ſo wide as theirs. Yet, by Gods help, I am reſolved, That nothing of paſſion, or peeviſhneſſe, or liſt to contradict, or vanity to ſhew my negative power, ſhal have any byas upon my judgement, to make me gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie my will, by denying any thing, which my Reaſon and Conſcience commands me not.</p>

               <p>Nor doe I know any ſuch tough and malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant humours in the conſtitution of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church, which gentler applications then thoſe of an Army, might not eaſily have removed: Nor is it ſo proper to hew out religious Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations by the Sword, as to poliſh them by fair and equal diſputations among thoſe that are moſt concerned in the diferences; whom not force, but Reaſon ought to convince.</p>
               <p>But their deſigne now ſeemed rather to cut of all diſputation here, than to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a fair and equall one: For, it was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, there, that the Engliſh Clergy muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to the Scots pattern, before ever they could be heard, what they could ſay for themſelves, or againſt the others way.</p>
               <p>I could have wiſhed fairer proceedings both

for their credits, who urge things with ſuch violence; and for other mens Conſciences too, who can receive little ſatisfaction in theſe points which are maintained rather by Souldiers fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Field, than Schollars diſputing in free and learned Synods.</p>
               <p>Sure, in matters, of Religion thoſe truths gain moſt on mens Judgements and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, which are leaſt urged with ſecular vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, which weakens Truth with prejudices; and is unreaſonable to be uſed, till ſuch means of rationall conviction hath beene appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as, leaving no excuſe for ignorance, condemns mens obſtinacy to deſerved penalties.</p>
               <p>Which no charity will eaſily ſuſpect of ſo many learned and pious Church-men in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> who being alwayes bred up, and confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to the Government of Epiſcopacy, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſo ſoon renounce both their former opinion and practiſe, only becauſe that Party of the Scots wil needs, by force, aſsiſt a like Party here, either to drive all Miniſters, as ſheep into the common fold of Presbytery, or deſtroy them; at leaſt fleece them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by depriving them of the benefit of their Flocks. If the Scotch ſole Presbytery were proved to be the only inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Jeſus Chriſt, for all Churches Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet I beleive it would be hard to prove that Chriſt had given thoſe Scots, or any other of my Subjects, Commiſsion, by the ſword to ſet up in any of My Kingdomes without My Conſent.</p>

What reſpect and obedience Chriſt and his Apoſtls pai'd to the chief Governours of States, where they lived is very clear in the Goſpell; but that he, or they ever commanded to ſet up ſuch a parity of Presbyters, and in ſuch a way as thoſe <hi>Scots</hi> endeavour, I think is not very diſputable.</p>
               <p>If Presbytery in ſuch a ſupremacy be an inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Chriſt, ſure it differs from all others; and is the firſt and only point of Chriſtianity, that was to be planted and watred with ſo much Chriſtian bloud; whoſe effuſions run in a ſtream ſo contrary to that of the primitive Planters, both of Chriſtianity &amp; Epiſcopacy, which was with patient ſhedding of their own bloud, not violent drawing other mens; ſure there is too much of Man in it, to have much of Chriſt, none of whoſe inſtitutions were carried on, or begun with the Temptations of Covetouſneſſe or Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition; of both which this is vehemently ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. Yet was there never any thing upon the point, which thoſe <hi>Scots</hi> had by Army or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners to move me with, by their many So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne obteſtations, and pious threatnings, but only this; to repreſent to me the wonderfull neceſſity of ſetting up their Presbytery in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to avoid the further miſeries of a Warre; which ſome men chiefly on this deſigne at firſt had begun, and now further ingaged themſelves to continue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>But we muſt leave the ſucceſſe of all to God, who hath many waies (having firſt taken us off from the folly of our opinions, and fury of our paſſion) to teach us thoſe rules of true Reaſon, &amp; peaceable wiſdom, which is from above, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding moſt to Gods glory, &amp; his Churches good; which I think my ſelf ſo much the more bound in Conſcience to attend, with the moſt judicious Zeal and care, by how much I eſteem the church above the State, the glory of Chriſt above mine Own; &amp; the ſalvations of mens ſouls above the preſevation of their Bodies and Eſtates.</p>
               <p>Nor may any men, I think, without ſinne and preſumption, forcibly endeavour to caſt the Churches under my care and tuition, into the moulds they have fancied, and faſhioned to their deſignes, till they have firſt gained

my conſent, and reſolved both my own and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens Conſciences by the ſtrength of their reaſons.</p>
               <p>Other violent motions, which are neither Manly, Chriſtian, nor Loyall, ſhall never either ſhake or ſettle my religion; nor any mans elſe, who knowes what Religion means; and how farre it is removed from all Faction, whoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per engine is force; the arbitrator of beaſts, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Yet I was not more ſcandalized at the <hi>Scots</hi> Armies comming in againſt my will, and their forfeiture of ſo many obligations of duty, and gratitude to me; then I wondred, how thoſe here could ſo much diſtruſt Gods aſſiſtance; who ſo much pretended Gods cauſe to the People, as if they had the certainty of ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation; conſidering they were more then competently furniſhed with my Subjects Armes and Ammunition; My Navy by Sea, my Forts, Caſtls, and Cities by Land.</p>

               <p>And yet ſuch is the inconſtancy that attends all minds engaged in violent motion, that whom ſome of them one while earneſtly invite to come into their aſſiſtance, others of them ſoone after are weary of, and with nauſeating caſt them out: what one Party thought to rivet to a ſetledneſſe by the ſtrength and influence of the <hi>Scots,</hi> that the other rejects and contemnes at once, deſpiſing the Kirk Government, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But much of Gods juſtice, and mans folly will at length be diſcovered, through all the filmes and pretenſions of Religion, in which Politici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans wrap up their deſignes; In vaine do men hope to build their piety on the ruines of Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lty.

preſcription of time &amp; practiſe in all other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ſince the Apoſtles times till this laſt Century</p>
               <p>But no Antiquity muſt plead for it.

               <p>Although I am unſatisfyed with many paſſages in that covenant (ſome referring to My ſelf with very dubious &amp; dangerous limitations yet I chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fly wonder at the deſigne &amp; drift touching the Diſcipline and Government of the Church; and ſuch a manner of carying them on to new ways, by Oaths and Covenants, where it is hard for men to be engaged by no leſs, then ſwearing for, or againſt thoſe things, which are of no cleare morall neceſſity, but very diſputable, &amp; contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted among learned &amp; godly men: whereto the application of Oaths can hardly be made and enjoyned with that judgement, and certainty in ones ſelf, or that charity and candour to others of different opinion, as I think Religion requires, which never refuſes faire and equable deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berations; yea, &amp; diſſentings too, in matters only probable. The enjoyning of oaths upon people muſt needs in things doubtfull be dangerous, as in things unlawfull, damnable; and no leſſe ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous, where former religious and legall
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:38600:54"/>
Engagements bound men ſufficiently, to all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary duties. Nor can I ſee how they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile ſuch an Innovating Oath and Covenant, with that former proteſtation which was ſo late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taked, to maintain the Religion eſtabliſhed in the Church of <hi>England:</hi> ſince they count Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline ſo great a part of Religion.</p>
               <p>But ambitious minds never thinke they have laid ſnares and ginnes enough to catch and hold the Vulgar credulity: for by ſuch politique and ſeemingly-pious ſtratagems, they think to keep the populacy faſt to their Parties under the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of perjury: Whereas certainly all honeſt and wiſe men ever thought themſelvs ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bound, by former ties of Religion, Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and Laws, to God and Man.</p>
               <p>Nor can ſuch after-Contracts, deviſed and impoſed by a few Men in a declared Party, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out My Conſent, and without any like power or precedent from Gods or mans lawes, be ever thought by judicious men ſufficient either to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve or ſlacken thoſe morall &amp; eternall bounds of duty which lie upon all My Subjects conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences both to God and Me. Yet, as things now ſtand, good men ſhal leſt offend God or Me, by keeping their Covenant in honeſt &amp; lawfull ways; ſince I have the charity to think, that the chief end of the Covenat, in ſuch mens intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, was, to preſerve Religion in purity, and the kingdoms in peace: To other then ſuch ends and

               <p>Which cords and wythes will hold mens

Conſciences no longer, then force attends and twiſts them: for every man ſoone growes his owne Pope, and eaſily abſolves himſelfe of thoſe ties, which, not the commands of Gods word, or the Lawes of the Land, but only the ſubtilty and terrour of a Party caſts upon him; either ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous and vaine, when they were ſufficiently ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before; or fraudulent and injurious, if by ſuch after-ligaments they find the Impoſers really ayming to diſſolve, or ſuſpend their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, juſt, and neceſſary obligations.</p>
               <p>Indeed, ſuch illegall waies ſeldome, or never, intend the engaging men more to duties, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Parties; therefore it is not regarded how they keep their Covenants in point of piety pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, provided they adhere firmly to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Deſigne intended.</p>
               <p>I ſee the Impoſers of it are content to make their Covenant like Manna (not that it came from heaven, as this did) agreeable to every mans palate and reliſh, who will but ſwallow it: They admit any mens ſenſes of it, though di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe or contrary; with any ſalvoes, cautions, and reſervations, ſo as they croſſe not their chief Deſigne which is laid againſt the Church, and Me. It is enough if they get but the reputation of a ſeeming encreaſe to their Party; So little do men remember that God is not mocked.</p>
               <p>In ſuch latitudes of ſenſe, I believe many that love Me, and the Church well, may have taken the Covenant, who yet are not ſo fondly

               <p>I would to God, ſuch, as glory moſt in the name of <hi>Covenanters,</hi> would keepe themſelves within thoſe lawfull bounds, to which God hath called them: Surely it were the beſt way to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate the raſhneſſe of taking it: which muſt needs then appeare, when beſides the want of a full and lawfull Authority at firſt to enjoyne it, it ſhall actually be carried on beyond and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe ends which were in it ſpecified and pretended. I willingly forgive ſuch mens ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Covenant, who keep it within ſuch bounds of Piety, Law, and Loyalty, as can never hurt either the Church, My ſelfe, or the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Peace: Againſt which; no mans lawfull Calling can engage him.</p>

As for that Reformation of the Church, which the Covenant pretends, I cannot think it juſt or comely, that by the partiall advice of a few Divines, (of ſo ſoft and ſervile tempers, as diſpoſed them to ſo ſudden acting and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance, contrary to their former judgements, profeſſion and practiſe) ſuch foule ſcandalls and ſuſpitions ſhould be caſt upon the Doctrine and Government of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as was never done (that I have heard) by any that deſerved the name of <hi>Reformed Churches</hi> abroad, nor by any men of learning and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, at home: all whoſe judgments I cannot but perfer before any mens now factiouſly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged.</p>
               <p>No man can be more forward than My ſelfe to carry on all due Reformations, with mature judgement, and a good Conſcience, in what things I ſhall (after impartiall adviſe) be, by Gods Word, and right reaſon, convinced to be amiſſe, I have offered more than ever the fulleſt, freeſt, and wiſeſt Parliaments did deſire.</p>
               <p>But the ſequele of ſome mens actions makes it evident, that the main Reformation intended, is the abaſing of Epiſcopacy into Presbytery, and the robbing the Church of its Lands and Revenues: For, no men have beene more injuriouſly uſed, as to their legall Rights than the Biſhops and Church-men. Theſe, as the fatteſt Deer, muſt be deſtroyed; the other Raſcal-herd of Schiſmes, Hereſies, &amp;c. being

               <p>I thank God, as no man lay more open to the ſacrilegious temptation of uſurping the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches Lands, and Revenues, (which iſſuing chiefly from the Crowne, are held of it, and legally can revert onely to the Crowne, with My Conſent) ſo I have alwayes had ſuch a perfect abhorrence of it in My Soule, that I never found the leaſt inclination to ſuch ſacrilegious Reformings: yet no man hath a greater deſire to have Biſhops and all Church-men ſo reformed, that they may beſt deſerve and uſe, not only what the pious muniſicence of My Predeceſſours hath given to God and the Church, but all other additions of chriſtian bounty.</p>

Firſt, nothing gave Me more cauſe to ſuſpect and ſearch My owne Innocency, then when I obſerved ſo many forward to engage againſt Me, who had made great profeſſions of ſingular piety; For this gave to vulgar minds ſo bad a reflection upon Me, and My Cauſe, as if it had been impoſſible to adhere to Me, and not withall part from God; to think or ſpeak well of Me, and not to Blaſpheme Him; ſo many were perſwaded that theſe two were utterly inconſiſtent, to be at once Loyall to Me, and truly Religious toward God.</p>

               <p>Nor is it ſtrange that ſo religious Pretenſions, as were uſed againſt me, ſhould be to many wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded Men a great temptation to oppoſe Me; Eſpecially, being urged by ſuch popular Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, as think it no ſin to lie for God, and what they pleaſe to call Gods Cauſe, curſing all that will not curſe with them; looking ſo much at, and crying up the goodneſſe of the end pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, that they conſider not the lawfullneſſe of the means uſed, nor the depth of the miſchief, chiefly plotted and intended.

It was a great part of ſome mens Religion to ſcandalize Me &amp; Mine; they thought theirs could not be true, if they cried not down Mine as falſe.</p>
               <p>I thank God, I have had more triall of his grace, as to the conſtancy of My Religion in the Proteſtant Profeſſion of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> both abroad, and at home, than ever they are like to have. Nor do I know any exception, I am ſo liable to, in their opinion, as too great a fixednes in that Religion, whoſe judicious &amp; ſolid grounds, both from Scripture, and Antiquity, wil not give My Conſcience leave to approve or conſent to thoſe many dangerous and divided Innovations, which the bold Ignorance of ſome men would needs obtrud upon me, &amp; my people.</p>

               <p>Nor did My uſing the aſſiſtance of ſome Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, which were my Subjects, any way fight againſt My Religion, as ſome men would needs interpret it: eſpecially thoſe who leaſt of all men cared whom they imployed, or what they ſaid, or did, ſo they might prevaile.

ſhould not conceive, That differences of perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in matters of Religion may eaſily fall out, where there is the fameneſs of duty, Allegiance, and ſubjection.

               <p>It was, indeed, a foule and indelible ſhame, for ſuch as would be counted Proteſtants, to enforce Me, a declared Proteſtant, their Lord &amp; King, to a neceſſary uſe of Papiſts, or any other, who did but their duty to help Me to defend My ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Nor did I more than is lawfull for any King, in ſuch exigents to uſe the aid of any his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.

               <p>Indeed, it had bin a very impertinent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable ſcruple in Me, (and very pleaſing no doubt to My enemies) to have been then diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the points of different beliefs in My Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, when I was diſputed with by ſwords points<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and when I needed the help of My Subjects

as men, no leſſe then their prayers as Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>The noiſe of My Evill Councellours was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other uſefull device for thoſe, who were impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient any mens counſels but their owne, ſhould be followed in Church or State; who were ſo eager in giving Me better counſel, that they would not give Me leave to take it with free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, as a Man, or honour, as a King; making their counſels more like a drench that muſt be powred down, then a draught which might be fairly and leiſurely drank, if I liked it.</p>
               <p>I will not juſtifie beyond humane errours and frailties My ſelfe, or My Counſellours: They might be ſubject to ſome miſcariages, yet ſuch as were far more reparable by ſecond and better thoughts, than thoſe enormous extravagances, where with ſome men have now even wil dred and almoſt quite loſt both Church and State.</p>
               <p>The event of things at laſt will make it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to My Subjects, that had I followed the worſt Couucels, that My worſt Counſellours ever had the boldneſſe to offer to Me, or My ſelf any inclination to uſe; I could not ſo ſoon have brought both Church and State in three flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing Kingdomes, to ſuch a <hi>Chaos</hi> of confuſions, and Hell of miſeries, as ſome have done; out of which they cannot, or will not in the midſt of their many great advantages; redeeme either Me or My Subjects.</p>

either done or adviſed amiſſe; and this I thonght I had done, even beyond the expectation of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate men; who were ſorry to ſee me prone e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to injure My ſelf, out of a Zeal to releive my Subjects.</p>
               <p>But other mens inſatiable deſire of revenge upon Me, My Court, and My Clergy; hath wholly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiled both Church and State, of the benefit of all My, either Retractations, or Conceſſions; &amp;, withall, hath deprived all thoſe (now ſo zealous Perſecutors) both of the comfort &amp; reward of their former pretended perſecutions, wherein they ſo much gloryed among the vulgar; and which, indeed, a truly humble Chriſtian will ſo highly prize, as rather not be relieved, then be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged, ſo as to be bereaved of that Crowne of chriſtian Patience, which attends humble &amp; inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſufferers.</p>
               <p>Another artifice uſed to withdraw My Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples affections from Me, to their deſignes, was, The noiſe and oſtentation of liberty, which men are not more prone to deſire, then unapt to bear in the popular ſenſe, which is to do what every man likes beſt.</p>
               <p>If the Divineſt liberty be to will what men ſhould, &amp; to do what they ſo will, according to Reaſon; Lawes, and Religion; I envy not My ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects that Liberty, which is all I deſire to enjoy My ſelf; So far am I from the deſire of oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing theirs: Nor were thoſe Lords &amp; Gentlemen which aſſiſted Me, ſo prodigall of their liberties,

So hardly can the pride of thoſe that ſtudy Novelties, allow former times any ſhare or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of wiſdome or godlineſſe. And becauſe matter of prayer and devotion to God juſtly beares a great part in Religion, (being the Souls more immediate converſe with the divine Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty) nothing could be more plauſible to the peopl than to tel them, They ſerved God amiſſe in that point. Hence our publique Liturgy or Formes of conſtant Prayers muſt be (not amended, in what upon free and publique advice might ſeeme to ſober men inconvenient for matter or manner, to which I ſhould eaſily conſent, but) wholly ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiered and aboliſhed; and, after many popular contempts offered to the Booke, and thoſe that uſed it according to their Conſciences, and the Lawes in force, it muſt be crucified by an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, the better to pleaſe either thoſe men, who gloried in their extemporary veyn and flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency; or others, who, conſcious to their own formality in the uſe of it, thought they fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piated their ſin of not uſing it aright, by laying all the blame upon it, and a totall rejection of it as a dead letter, thereby to excuſe the deadneſs of their hearts. As for the matter contained in the book, ſober &amp; learned men have ſufficiently vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated it againſt the cavils and exceptions of thoſe, who thought it a part of piety to make what profan objections, they could againſt it, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially for Popery &amp; Superſtition; whereas no doubt, the Liturgy was exactly conformed to the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:38600:67"/>
doctrine of the Church of <hi>Engl.</hi> and this by all reformed churches is confeſſed to be moſt ſound and Orthodox. For the manner of uſing Set &amp; preſcribed Formes, there is no doubt but that wholſome words being known &amp; fitted to mens underſtandings, are ſooneſt received into their hearts, and apteſt to excite and carry along with them judicious and fervent affections.</p>
               <p>Nor doe I ſee any reaſon why Chriſtians ſhould be weary of a wel-compoſed Liturgy (as I hold this to be) more than of all other things, wherein the conſtancy abates nothing of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency and uſefulneſſe.</p>
               <p>I could never ſee any Reaſon, why any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſhould abhor, or be forbidden to uſe the ſame forms of prayer, ſince he prayes to the ſame God, believes in the ſame Saviour, profeſſeth the ſame Truths, reads the ſame Scriptures, hath the ſame duties upon him, and feels the ſame daily wants for the moſt part, both inward &amp; outward, which are common to the whole Church.</p>
               <p>Sure we may as wel before-hand know what we pray, as to whom we pray; &amp; in what words, as to whatſenſe; when we deſire the ſame things, what hinders we may not uſe the ſame words? our appetite and diſgeſtion too may be good when we uſe, as we pray for, <hi>our daily bread.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some men, I heare, are ſo impatient not to uſe in all their devotion their own invention, and gifts, that they not only diſuſe (as too many) but wholly caſt away &amp; contemn the <hi>Lords Prayer;</hi>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:38600:67"/>
whoſe great guilt is, that it is the warrant &amp; ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall pattern of all ſet Liturgies, in the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church. I ever thought that the proud o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtentation of mens abilities for invention, and the vain affectations of variety for expreſsions, in Publique Prayer, or any ſacred Adminiſtrations, merits a greater brand of ſinne, than that which they call Coldneſſe and Barrenneſſe: Nor are men in thoſe noveltyes leſſe ſubject to formall and ſuperficiall tempers (as to their hearts) than in the uſe of conſtant Formes, where not the words, but mens hearts are too blame.</p>
               <p>I make no doubt but a man may be very formal in the moſt extemporary variety; and very fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently devout in the moſt wonted expreſſions: Nor is God more a God of variety, than of conſtancy: Nor are conſtant Forms of Prayers more likely to flat, &amp; hinder the Spirit of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, &amp; devotion, than un-premeditated &amp; confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed variety to diſtract, and loſe it.</p>
               <p>Though I am not againſt a grave, modeſt, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet, &amp; humble uſe of Miniſters gifts, even in publique, the better to fit, &amp; excite their own, &amp; the Peoples affections to the preſent occaſions; yet I know no neceſſity why private and ſingle abilityes ſhould quite juſtle out, and deprive the Church of the joynt abilityes &amp; concurrent gift of many learned and godly men; ſuch as the Compoſers of the Service booke were; who may in all reaſon be thought to have more of gifts and graces enabling them to Compoſe
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:38600:68"/>
with ſerious deliberation &amp; concurrent adviſe, ſuch Forms of prayers, as may beſt fit the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches common want, inform the Hearers under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; and ſtir up that fiduciary and fervent application of their ſpirits, (wherein conſiſts the very life and ſoul of prayer, and that ſo much pretended Spirit of prayer) than any private man by his ſolitary abilities can be preſumed to have; which, what they are many times (even there, where they make a great noiſe and ſhew) the affectations, emptineſſe, impertinency, rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, confuſions, flatneſſe, levity, obſcurity, vain, and ridiculous repititions, the ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, and oft-times blaſphemous expreſſions; all theſe burthened with a moſt tedious and intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable length, do ſufficiently convince all men, but thoſe who glory in that Phariſaick way.</p>
               <p>Wherein men muſt be ſtrangely impudent, and flatterers of themſelves, not to have an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite ſhame of what they ſo do and ſay, in things of ſo ſacred a nature, before God &amp; the Church, after ſo ridiculous, &amp; indeed, profane a manner.</p>
               <p>Nor can it be expected, but that in dutyes of frequent performance, as Sacramentall admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations, and the like, which are ſtil the ſame, Miniſters muſt either come to uſe their own forms conſtantly which are not like to be ſound, or comprehenſive of the nature of the duty, as Forms of Publick compoſure; or elſe they muſt euery time affect new expreſſions when the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is the ſame; which can hardly be preſumed
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:38600:68"/>
in any mans greateſt ſufficiencyes not to want (many times) much of that compleatneſſe, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and gravity, becomming thoſe duties, which by this means are expoſed at every celebration to every Miniſters private infirmities, indiſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, errours, diſorders, &amp; defects; both for judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and expreſſion.</p>
               <p>A ſerious ſenſe of which inconvenience in the Church unavoidably following every mans ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall manner of officiating, no doubt, firſt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned the wiſdom &amp; piety of the Ancient chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, to remedy thoſe miſchiefs, by the uſe of conſtant Lyturgies of publick compoſure.</p>
               <p>The want of which I believe this Church will ſufficiently feel, when the unhappy fruits of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mens un-governed ignorance, and confident defects, ſhall be diſcovered in more errours, ſciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, diſorders, and uncharitable diſtractions in Religion, which are already but too many; the more is the pity.</p>
               <p>However, if violence muſt needs bring in, and abet thoſe innovations, (that men may not ſeem to have nothing to do) which Law, Reaſon, &amp; Religion forbids, at leaſt to be ſo obtruded, as wholy to juſtle out the publick Lyturgy.</p>
               <p>Yet nothing can excuſe that moſt unjuſt and partiall ſeverity of thoſe men, who either lately had ſubſcribed to, uſed and maintained the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice-book; or refuſing to uſe, it cryed out of the rigour of the Laws and Biſhops, which ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them not to uſe the liberty of their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, in not uſing it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:38600:69"/>
That theſe men (I ſay) ſhould ſo ſuddenly change the Lyturgie into a Directory, as if the Spirit needed help for invention, though not for expreſsions; or as if matter preſcribed did not as much ſtint and obſtruct the Spirit, as if it were cloathed in, and confined to, fit words: (So ſlight and eaſie is that Legerdemain which will ſerve to delude the vulgar.)</p>
               <p>That further, they ſhould uſe ſuch ſeverity as not to ſuffer, without penalty, any to uſe the Common-Prayer-Book publickly, although their Conſciences binde them to it, as a duty of piety to GOD, and Obedience to the Laws. Thus I ſee, no men are prone to be greater Tyrants, and more rigorus exacters upon others to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to their illegall novelties, then ſuch, whoſe pride was formerly leaſt diſpoſed to the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of lawfull Conſtitutions; and whoſe licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious humours, moſt pretended Conſcientious liberties; which freedome, with much regret, they now allow to Me, and My Chaplains, when they may have leave to ſerue Me; whoſe abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, euen in their extemporary way, come not ſhort of the other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but their modeſty and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing far exceeds the moſt of them.</p>
               <p>But this matter is of ſo popular a nature, as ſome men knew it would not bear learned and ſober debates, leaſt, being convinced by the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Reaſon, as well as Laws, they ſhoul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>One of the greateſt faults ſome men found with the Common-Prayer-book, I beleive, was this, That it taught them to pray ſo oft for Me; to which Petitions they had not Loyalty enough to ſay <hi>Amen,</hi> nor yet charity enough to forbear Reproaches, and even curſings of Me in their own forms, inſtead of praying for Me.</p>
               <p>I wiſh their Repentance may be their only puniſhment; that ſeeing the miſchiefs which the diſuſe of publique Liturgyes hath already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, they may reſtore that credit, uſe, and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to them, which by the ancient Churches were given to Set Formes of ſound and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome words.</p>
               <p>And thou, O Lord, which art the ſame God, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for ever: whoſe mercies are full of varie y; &amp; yet of conſtancy; Thou denyest us not a new &amp; freſh ſenſe of our old and dayly wants: nor deſpiſeſt renu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed affections ioyned to constant expreſſions.</p>
               <p>Let us not want the benefit of thy Churches united &amp; wel-adviſed Devotions.</p>
               <p>Let the matters of our prayers be agreeable to thy will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is alwaies the ſame; and the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency

               <p>And then we doubt not, but thy ſpirituall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections are ſuch, as thou art neither to be pleaſed with affected Novelties for matter or manner, nor offended with the pious conſtancy of our petitions in them both.</p>
               <p>Whoſe variety or conſtancy thou haſt no where either forbidden or commanded, but left them to the piety and prudence of thy Church, that both may be uſed, neither diſpiſed.</p>
               <p>Keep men in that pious moderation of their Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in matters of Religion; that their ignorance may not offend others, nor their opinion of their own abilities tempt them to deprive others of what they may lawfully and devoutly uſe, to help their infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>

Nor to be deprived of truth, unity, and order, under this fallacy, That conſtancy is the cauſe of formality.</p>
               <p>Lord keep us from formall Hypociſie in our own hearts, and then we know that praying to thee, or praiſing of thee (with <hi>David,</hi> and other holy men) in the ſame formes cannot hurt us.</p>

               <p>I muſt now in charity be thought deſirous to preſerve that Government in its right conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as a matter of Religion; wherein both My judgement is juſtly ſatisfyed, that it hath of all other the fulleſt Scripture grounds, and alſo the conſtant practiſe of all Chriſtian Churches; til of late years, the tumultuarineſſe of People, or the factiouſneſſe and pride of Presbyters, or the covetouſneſſe of ſome States and Princes, gave occaſion to ſome mens wits to invent new mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dells, aud propoſe them under ſpecious titles of <hi>Chriſts Government, Scepter, and Kindome;</hi> the better to ſerve their turns, to whom the change was beneficiall.</p>
               <p>They muſt give Me leave, having none of their temptations to invite Me to alter the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Biſhops, (that I may have a Title to their Eſtates) not to believe their pretended grounds to any new wayes: contrary to the full, and conſtant teſtimony of all Hiſtories, ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently convincing unbiaſed men; that as the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Churches were undoubtedly governed by the Apoſtls and their immediate Succeſſors firſt &amp; beſt Biſhops; ſo it cannot in reaſon or charity be ſuppoſed, that al churches in the world ſhould either be ignorant of the rule by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed,

or ſo ſoon deviate from their divine and holy patterne: That ſince the firſt Age, for 1500. years not one Example can be produced of any ſetled Church, wherein were many Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Congregations, which had not ſome Biſhop above them, under whoſe juriſdiction and government they were.</p>

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:38600:72"/>
improperly be called <hi>Biſhops,</hi> as to the overſight and care of ſingle Congregations, committed to them by the Apoſtles, or thoſe Apoſtolicall Biſhops, who (as <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus)</hi> ſucceeded them in that ordinary power, there aſſigned over larger diviſions, in which were many Presbyters</p>
               <p>The humility of thoſe firſt Biſhops avoiding the eminent title of Apoſtles, as a name in the Churches ſtile appropriated from its common notion <hi>(of a Meſſenger or one ſent)</hi> to that ſpeciall dignity which had extraordinary call, miſſion, gifts, and power immediatly from Chriſt: they contented themſelves with the ordinary titles of Biſhops and Presbyters; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till uſe, (the great Arbitrator of words, and Maſter of Language) finding reaſon to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh by a peculiar name thoſe perſons, whoſe power and office, were indeed diſtinct from, and above all other in the Church, as ſucee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Apoſtles in the ordinary and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant power of governing the Churches, (the honour of whoſe name they moderately, yet commendably declined) all Chriſtian Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches (ſubmitting to that ſpecial anthority) appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated alſo the name of <hi>Biſhop,</hi> without any ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition or reproach of arrogancy, to thoſe who were by apoſtolical propagation rightly deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded &amp; inveſted into that higheſt &amp; largeſt pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of governing even the moſt pure &amp; primitive Churches: which, without all doubt, had many ſuch holy Biſhops, after the pattern of <hi>Timothy</hi> &amp;
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:38600:72"/>
                  <hi>Titus;</hi> whoſe ſpeciall power is not more clearly ſet down in thoſe Epiſtles (the chief grounds &amp; limits of all Epiſcopall claim, as from divine Right) then are the Characters of theſe perilous times, &amp; thoſe men that make them ſuch, who, not enduring ſound doctrine, &amp; clear teſtimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of all Churches practiſe, are moſt perverſe diſputers, and proud Uſurpers, againſt true Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy: who, if they be not Traytors and Boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, yet they ſeem to be very covetous, heady, high-minded; inordinate &amp; feirce, lovers of themſelves, having much of the form, litle of the power of godlines.</p>
               <p>Who, by popular heaps of weak, light, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned Teachers, ſeeke to over-lay &amp; ſmother the pregnancy and, authority of that power of Epiſcopall government, which; beyond al equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation &amp; vulgar fallacy of names, is moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincingly ſet forth, both by Scripture, and all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Hiſtoryes of the Church.</p>
               <p>This I write rather like a Divine, than a Prince that Poſterity may ſee, (if ever theſe Papers be publick) that I had fair grounds both from ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Canons, &amp; Eccleſiaſticall examples, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on My judgment was ſtated for Epiſcopall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. Nor was it any policy of State, or obſtinacy of wil, or partiality of affection, either to the men, or their Function which fixed Me; who cannot in point of worldly reſpects be ſo conſiderable to me as to recompence the injuries and loſſes I, and My deareſt relations with My
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:38600:73"/>
Kingdomes, have ſuſtained, and hazarded, chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, at firſt, upon this quarrell.</p>
               <p>And not only in Religion, of which Scripture is the beſt rule, and the Churches Vniverſall practice the beſt commentary, but alſo in right reaſon, and the true nature of Government, it cannot be thought that an orderly Subordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on among Presbyters, or Miniſters, ſhould be any more againſt Chriſtianity, then it is in all ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular and civill Governments, where parity breeds Confuſion and Faction.</p>
               <p>I can no more believe, that ſuch order is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with true Religion, then good features are with beauty, or numbers with harmony.</p>
               <p>Nor is it likely that God, who appointed ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall orders, and a Prelacy, in the Government of his Church, among the Jewiſh Prieſts, ſhould abhor or forbid them among Chriſtian Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters; who have as much of the principles of ſchiſme and diviſion as other men; for preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and ſuppreſſing of which, the Apoſtolicall wiſdom (which was divine) after that Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were multiplied to many Congregations, and Presbyters with them, appointed this way of Government, which might beſt preſerve or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and union with Authority.</p>
               <p>So that I conceive it was not the favour of Princes, or ambition of Presbyters, but the wiſdome and piety of the Apoſtles, that firſt ſetled Biſhops in the Church; which Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity they conſtantly uſed, and injoyed in thoſe
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:38600:73"/>
times, which were pureſt for Religion, though ſharpeſt for Perſecution.</p>
               <p>Not that I am againſt the managing of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidency and authority in one man; by the joynt Counſell and conſent of many Presbyters: I have offerd to reſtore that, as a fit means to avoid thoſe Errours, Corruptions, and Partialities, which are incident to any one man; Alſo to avoyd Tyranny, which becomes no Chriſtians, leaſt of all Church-men; beſides, it will be a means to take away that burden, and <hi>odium</hi> of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, which may lie too heavy on one mans ſhoulders, as indeed I think it formerly did on the Biſhops here.</p>
               <p>Nor can I ſee what can be more agreeable both to Reaſon and Religion, then ſuch a frame of Government which is paternall, not Magiſterial; and wherein not only the neceſſity of avoyding Faction and Confuſion, Emulations and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Nor is this judgment of Mine, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Epiſcopacy, any pre-occupation of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which wil not admit any oppoſitions againſt it: it is well knowne I have endeavoured to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie my ſelf in what the chiefe Patrons for other wayes can ſay againſt this, or for theirs: And I finde they have, as ſarr leſſe of
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:38600:74"/>
Scripture grounds, and of Reaſon; ſo for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, and practiſe of the Church, or teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Hiſtories, they are wholy deſtitute, where in the whoſe ſtream runs ſo for Epiſcopacy, that there is not the leaſt rivolet for any others.</p>
               <p>As for thoſe obtruded examples of ſome late reformed Churches, (for many retain Biſhops ſtill) whom neceſſity of times and affaires rather excuſeth, then commendeth for their inconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to all Antiquity; I could never ſee any reaſon why Churches orderly reformed and governed by Biſhops ſhould be forced to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme to thoſe few, rather then to the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick example of all Ancient Churches, which needed no Reformation; and to thoſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches at this day, who, Governed by Biſhops in all the Chriſtian world, are many more then Presbyterians or Independents can pretend to be; All whom the Churches in My three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, lately Governed by Biſhops, would equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize (I think) if not exceed.</p>
               <p>Nor is it any point of wiſdom or charity, where Chriſtians differ, (as many do in ſome points) there to widen the differences, &amp; at once to give all the Chriſtian world (except a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of ſome Proteſtants) ſo great a ſcandall in point of Church-government; whom though you may convince of their Errours in ſome points of Doctrine, yet you ſhal never perſwade them, that to compleat their Reformation, they muſt neceſſarily deſert, and wholly caſt off that
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:38600:74"/>
Government, which they, and all before them have ever owned as Catholick, Primitive, and Apoſtolicall: So farre, as never Schiſmaticks, nor Hereticks, (except thoſe Aerians) have ſtrayed from the Vnity, and Conformity of the Church in that point, ever having Biſhops a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Presbyters.</p>
               <p>Beſides, the late generall approbation and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to this Government of Biſhops, by the Clergy, as well as the Laity of theſe Kindoms, is a great confirmation of My Judgement; and their inconſtancy is a great prejudice againſt their novelty; I cannot in charity ſo far doubt of their learning or integrity, as if they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood not what heretofore they did, or that they did confirme contrary to their conſciences; So that their facility and levity is never to be excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, who, before ever the point of Church-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment had any free and impartiall debate, contrary to their former Oathes and practice, againſt their obedience to the Laws in force, and againſt My conſent, have not only quite cryed down the government by Biſhops; but have approved and incouraged the violent and moſt illegall ſtripping all the Biſhops, and many other Church-men, of all their due Authority and Revenues, even to the ſelling away, &amp; utter alienation of thoſe church-lands from any Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical uſes: So great a power hath the ſtream of times, &amp; the prevalency of parties over ſome mens judgements; of whoſe ſo ſudden and ſo to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:38600:75"/>
change little reaſon can be given, beſides the <hi>Scots</hi> Army comming into <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the folly of theſe men will at laſt puniſh it ſelf, and the Deſertors of Epiſcopacy will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear the greateſt enemies to, &amp; betrayers of their own intereſt: for Presbytery is never ſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable or effectuall, as when it is joyned to, and crowned with Epiſcopacy. All Miniſters will find as great a difference in point of thriving, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the favour of the People &amp; of Princes, as Plants do betweene being watered by hand, or by the ſweet and liberal dews of Heaven.</p>
               <p>The tenuity and contempt of Clergy-men wil ſoon let them ſee, what a poor carcaſſe they are, when parted from the influence of that Head, to whoſe Supremacy they have been ſworn.</p>
               <p>A little moderation might have prevented great miſchiefs; I am firm to Primitive Epiſcopacy, not to have it extirpated, (if I can hinder it.) Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion without paſſion might eaſily reform, whatever the ruſt of times, or indulgence of laws or corruption of manners have brought upon it. It being a groſſe vulgar errour to impute to, or revenge upon the Function the faults of times, or perſons; which ſeditious &amp; popular principle, and practiſe all wiſe men abhor. For thoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular additaments &amp; ornaments of Authority, civill Honor &amp; Eſtate, which My Predeceſſors, &amp; Chriſtian Princes in al countries have annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Biſhops &amp; Church-men, I look upon them but as juſt rewards of their learning, and piety,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:38600:75"/>
who are fit to be in any degree of Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; alſo enablements to works of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and Hoſpitality, meet ſtrengthenings of their Authority in point of reſpect, and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance; which in peaceable times is hardly payed to any Governours by the meaſure of their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, ſo much as by that of their Eſtates; Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty and meanneſſe expoſing them and their Authority to the contempt of licentious minds, and manners; which perſecuting times much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained. I would have ſuch men Biſhops, as are moſt worthy of thoſe incouragements, and beſt able to uſe them: if at any time my judgement of men failed, My good intention made My errour veniall: And ſome Biſhops, I am ſure, I had, whoſe learning, gravity, and piety, no men of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny worth or forehead can deny: But of all men, I would have Church-men, eſpecially the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours to be redeemed from that vulgar neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, which (beſides an innate principle of vitious oppoſition, which is in all men againſt thoſe that ſeem to reprove, or reſtrain them) will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily follow both the Presbyterian party, which makes all Miniſters equall; and the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent inferiority, which ſets their Paſtors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the People.</p>
               <p>This for My judgment touching Epiſcopacy; wherein (God knows) I do not gratifie any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign or paſſion with the leaſt perverting of truth.</p>
               <p>And now I appeal to God above, and all the Chriſtian world, whether it be juſt for
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:38600:76"/>
Subjects, or pious for Chriſtians; by violence, &amp; infinite indignities, with ſervile reſtraints to ſeek to force Me their KING and Soveraign, as ſome men have endeavoured to do, againſt al theſe grounds of My Judgment, to conſent to their weake and divided noveltis.</p>
               <p>The greateſt Pretender of them deſires not more then I do, That the Church ſhould be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned, as Chriſt hath appointed, in true Reaſon; and in Scripture; of which I could never ſee any probable ſhew for any other wayes, who either content themſelves with the examples of ſome Churches in their infancy &amp; ſolitude, when one Presbyter might ſerve one Congregation, in a City or Country; or elſe they deny theſe moſt evident Truths, That the Apoſtles were Biſhops over thoſe Presbyters they ordained, as wel as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Churches they planted; and that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, being neceſſary for the Churches wel-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when multiplyed &amp; ſociated, muſt alſo nece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily deſcend from the Apoſtles to others, after the example of that power and ſuperiority, they had above others; which could not end with their perſons; ſince the uſe and ends of ſuch Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſtill continue.</p>
               <p>It is moſt ſure, that the pureſt Primitive and beſt Churches flouriſhed under Epiſcopacy; &amp; may ſo ſtill, if ignorance, ſuperſtition, avarice, revenge, and other diſorderly and diſloyall paſſions had not ſo blown up ſome mens minds againſt it, that what they want of Reaſons or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:38600:76"/>
Patterns, they ſupply with violence and oppreſſion, wherein ſome mens zeal for Biſhops Lands, Houſes, &amp; Revenues hath ſet them on work to eat up Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: which (however other men eſteeme) to Me is no leſſe ſin, then Sacriledge; or a robbery of God (the giver of all we have) of that portion which devout minds have thankfuly given again to him, in giving it to his Church and Prophets; through whoſe hands he graciouſly accepts even a cup of cold water, as a libation offered to him-</p>
               <p>Furthermore, as to My particular engagement above other men, by an Oath agreeable to My judgment I am ſolemnly obliged to preſerve that Government, and the Rights of the Church</p>
               <p>Were. I convinced of the unlawfulnes of the Function, as Antichriſtian, (which ſome men boldly but weakly calumniate) I could ſoon, with Judgement, break that Oath, which erroneouſly was taken by Me.</p>
               <p>But being daily by the beſt diſquiſition of truth, more confirmd in the reaſon &amp; Religion of that to which I am Sworn; how can any man that wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth not My damnation, perſwade Me at once to ſo notorious and combined ſins, of Sacriledg and Perjury? beſides the many perſonall Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices I muſt doe to many worthy men, who are as legally inveſted in the ir Eſtates, as any, who ſeek to deprive the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; and they have by no Law, been convicted of thoſe Crimes, which might forfeit their eſtates &amp; livelyhoods.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:38600:77"/>
I have oft wondred how men pretending to tendernes of Conſcience, and Reformation, can at once tell Me, that My Coronation Oath binds Me to conſent to whatſoever they ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound to me, (which they urge with ſuch vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence) though contrary to all that Rationall and Religious freedom which every man ought to preſerve; and of which they ſeem ſo tender of their own Votes; yet at the ſame time theſe men will needs perſwade Me That I muſt, and ought to diſpenſe with, and roundly break that part of My Oath, which binds me (agreeable to the beſt light of Reaſon and Religion I have) to maintain the Government, and legall Rights of the Church. 'Tis ſtrange My Oath ſhould be valid in that part, which both My ſelf, and all men in their own caſe, eſteem injurious &amp; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable, as being againſt the very natural and eſſentiall liberty of our ſouls; yet it ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valid, and to be broken in another clauſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I think my ſelf juſtly obliged, both to God &amp; Man. Yet upon this Rack chiefly have I been held ſo long, by ſome mens ambitious covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and Sacrilegious Cruelty; torturing (with Me) both Church and State, in Civill diſſentions; till I ſhall be forced to conſent, and declare that I doe approve, what (God knowes) I utterly diſlike, and in My Soul ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre as many wayes highly againſt Reaſon, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and Religion: and whereto, If I ſhould ſhamefully and diſhonourably give My con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent;
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:38600:77"/>
yet ſhould I not by ſo doing, ſatisfie the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided Intereſts and Opinions of thoſe Parties, which contend with each other, as well as both againſt Me and Epiſcopacy.</p>
               <p>Nor can My late condeſending to the <hi>Scots</hi> in point of Church-government, be rightly obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted againſt Me, as an inducement for Me, to conſent to the like in My other Kingdoms; For it ſhould be conſidered that Epiſcopacy was not ſo rooted and ſetled there, as 'tis here; nor I (in that reſpect) ſo ſtrictly bound to continue it in that Kingdom as in this; for what I think in My judgement beſt, I may not think ſo abſolutly neceſſary for all places, and at all times.</p>
               <p>If any ſhall impute My yeelding to them, as My failing and ſin, I can eaſily acknowledge it, but that is no argument to do ſo again, or much worſe; I being now more convinced in that point: nor indeed hath My yeelding to them bin ſo happy and ſucceſſefull as to incourage Me to grant the like to others.</p>
               <p>Did I ſee any thing more of Chriſt, as to Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, Juſtice, Order, Charity, and Loyalty in thoſe that pretend to other modes of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I might ſuſpect My judgement to be bia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, or fore-ſtalled with ſome prejudice &amp; won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tednes of opinion; but I have hitherto ſo much cauſe to ſuſpect the contrary in the manners of many of thoſe men, that I cannot from them gain the leaſt reputation for their new wayes of Government. Nor can I find that in any Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:38600:78"/>
Churches (whoſe paterns are ſo cryed up, and obtruded upon the Churches under My Dominion) that either Learning, or Religion, works of Piety or Charity, have ſo flouriſhed beyond what they have done in My Kingdomes (by Gods bleſſing) which might make me beleive either Presbytery or Independency have a more benigne influence upon the Church and mens hearts and lives, than Epiſcopacy in its right conſtitution.</p>
               <p>The abuſes of which, deſerve to be extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as much as the uſe retained; for I think it far better to hold to primitive &amp; uniform Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, than to comply with divided novelty.</p>
               <p>A right Epiſcopacy would at once ſatisfie all juſt deſires and intereſts of good Biſhops, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Presbyters, and ſober people; ſo as Church affairs ſhould be managed neither with tyranny, purity, nor popularity; neither Biſhops ejected, nor Presbiters deſpiſed, nor People oppreſſed.</p>
               <p>And in this integrity both of My judgment &amp; Conſcience, I hope God will preſerve Me.</p>
               <p>For Thou, O Lord, knoweſt My uprightneſse, and tenderneſſe, as thou haſt ſet me to be a Defender of the Faith, and a Protector of thy Church, ſo ſuſſer me not by any violence, to be overborn againſt My Conſcience.</p>

               <p>I Look upon the way of Treaties, as a retiring from fighting like Beaſts, to arguing like Men; whoſe ſtrength ſhould be more in their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, than in their limbs.</p>
               <p>And though I could ſeldome get opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to Treat, yet I never wanted either deſire or diſpoſition to it; having greater confidence of My Reaſon, than My Sword: I was ſo whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſolved to yeeld to the firſt, that I thought neither My ſelfe, nor others, ſhould need to uſe the ſecond, if once we rightly underſtood each other.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:38600:79"/>
Nor did I ever think it a diminution of Me, to prevent them with Expreſſes of My deſires, and even importunities to Treat: It being an office, not onely of humanity, rather to uſe Reaſon, than Force; but alſo of Chriſtianity to <hi>ſeek peace and enſue it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As I was very unwillingly compelled to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend My ſelf with Arms, ſo I very willingly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced any thing tending to peace.</p>
               <p>The events of all War by the ſword being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dubious, and of a Civill VVarre uncomfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table; the end had hardly recompencing, &amp; late repairing the miſchief of the means.</p>
               <p>Nor did any ſucceſſe I had ever, enhance with Me the price of Peace; as earneſtly deſired by Me as any man; though I was like to pay dearer for it then any man: All that I ſought to reſerve was, Mine Honour, and My Conſcience; the one I could not part with as a KING, the other as a Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>The Treaty at <hi>Uxbridge</hi> gave the faireſt hopes of an hapdy compoſure; had others applyed them ſelvs to it with the ſame moderatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as I did, I am confident the War had then ended. I was willing to condeſcend, as far as Reaſon, Honour, and Conſcience, would give Me leave; nor were the remaining difference ſo eſſential to My Peoples happines; or of ſuch conſequence as in the leaſt kind to have hindred My Subjects either ſecurity or proſperity; for they beter enjoyed both, many years, before ever thoſe demands were made,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:38600:80"/>
ſome of which, to deny, I think the greateſt Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice to My ſelf, and favour to My ſubjects.</p>
               <p>I ſee, Jealouſies are not ſo eaſily allayed, as they are raiſed: Some men are more afraid to retreat from voilent Engagements than to Engage: what is wanting in equity, muſt be made up in pertinacy. Such as had little to enjoy in Peace, or to loſe in warre, ſtudied to render the very name of Peace odious and ſuſpected.</p>
               <p>In Church affaires, where I had leaſt liberty of prudence, having ſo many ſtrict tyes of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience upon Me; yet I was willing to conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend ſo far to the ſetling of them, as might have given fair ſatisfaction to all men, whom faction, covetouſneſſe, or ſuperſtition had not engaged more, than any true zeal, charity, or love of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</p>
               <p>I was content to yeild to all that might ſeeme to advance true piety; I onely ſought to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue what was neceſſary in point of Order, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and Authority to the Churches Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and what I am perſwaded (as I have elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where ſet down My thoughts more fully) is moſt agreeable to the true principles of all Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, raiſed to its full ſtature &amp; perfection, as alſo to the primitive Apoſtolicall pattern, and the practiſe of the Univerſall Church conforme thereto. From which wholly to recede, without any probable reaſon urged or anſwered only to ſatisfie ſome mens wills and fantaſies (which yet agree not among themſelves in any point
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:38600:80"/>
but that of extirpating Epiſcopacy, fighting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me,) muſt needs argue ſuch a ſoftnes, &amp; infirmity of mind in Me, as will rather part with Gods Truth, than Mans peace, and rather loſe the Churches honour, than croſſe ſome mens Factious humours.</p>
               <p>God knows, and time wil diſcover, who were moſt too blame for the un-ſuccesfulneſs of that Treaty, and who muſt bear the guilt of after-ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamityes. I beleive, I am very excuſable both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, and all unpaſſionate men, who have ſeriouſly weighed thoſe tranſactions, wherein I endeavoured no leſſe the reſtauration of peace to my People, than the preſervation of my own Crowns to my poſterity.</p>
               <p>Some men have that height, as to interpret all fair Condeſcendings, as Arguments of feeble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and glory moſt in an unflexible ſtifneſſe, when they ſee others moſt ſupple and inclinable to them.</p>
               <p>A grand Maxime with them was alwaies to ask ſomething, which in reaſon and honour muſt be denied, that they might have ſome colour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe all that was in other things granted; ſetting Peace at as high a rate, as the worſt effects of Warre; endeavouring firſt to make Me deſtroy My ſelf by diſhonourable Conceſſions, that ſo they might have the leſſe to do.</p>
               <p>This was all which that Treaty, or any other produced, to let the world ſee, how litle I would deny, or they grant, in order to the publik peace.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:38600:81"/>
That it gave occaſion to ſome mens further reſtiveneſſe, is imputable to their own depraved tempers, not to any Conceſſions or negations of Mine: I have alwayes the content of what I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, and they the regret, and blame, for what they refuſed.</p>
               <p>The higheſt tide of ſucceſſe ſet me not above a Treaty, nor the loweſt ebbe below a Fight: Though I never thought it any ſign of true va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, to be prodigall of mens lives, rather then to be drawn to produce our own reaſons: or to ſubſcribe to other mens.</p>
               <p>That which made Me for the moſt part preſage the unſucceſſefulnes of any Treaty; was, ſome mens unwillingneſſe to Treat: which implyed ſome things were to be gained by the Sword, whoſe unreaſonablenes they were loath to have fairly ſcanned, being more proper to be acted by Souldiers; than by Councellours. I pray God forgive them that were guilty of that Treaties breaking; &amp; give them grace to make their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages gotten by the the Sword a better op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to uſe ſuch moderation, as was then wanting; that ſo though Peace were for our ſins juſtly deferred, yet at laſt it may be happily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd; what we could not get by our Treaties, we may gain by our prayers.</p>

               <p>Other times God was pleaſed to exerciſe My patience, and teach Me not to truſt in the arme of Fleſh, but in the living God.</p>

               <p>There is no doubt but perſonall and private ſins may oft times over-balance the Juſtice of Publick engagements; nor doth God account every gallant Man (in the worlds eſteeme) a fit inſtrument to aſſert in the way of War a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Cauſe; The more men are prone to arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate to their own skill, valour and ſtrength, the leſſe doth God ordinarily work by them for his owne glory.</p>

               <p>Although God ſhould not honour me ſo far, as to make me an Inſtrument of ſo good a work, yet I ſhould be glad to ſee it done.</p>
               <p>As I was well pleaſed with this Parliaments firſt intentions to reforme what the iudulgence of Times, and corruption of manners might have depraved; ſo I am ſorry to ſee, after the freedome of Parliament was by factious Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults oppreſſed, how little regard was had to the good Lawes eſtabliſhed, and the Religion ſetled<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which ought to be the firſt rule and ſtandard of reforming; with how much partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and popular compliance the paſſions, and opinions of men have been gratified, to the detriment of the publique, and the infinite ſcandall of the Reformed Religion.</p>

what ſacrilegious invaſions upon the Rights and Revenues of the Church; what contempt and oppreſſions of the Clergie; what injurious diminutions and perſecutings of me, have followed (as ſhowres do warme gleames) the talk of Reformation, all ſober men are Witneſſes, and, with my ſelfe, ſad Spectators hitherto.</p>
               <p>The great miſcarriage I think is, that popular clamours and fury, have been allowed the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Zeal, and the publique ſenſe; ſo that the ſtudy to pleaſe ſome Parties hath indeed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured all.</p>
               <p>Freedome, moderation, and impartiality are ſure the beſt tempers of reforming Councells, and endeavours: what is acted by Factions, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but offend more, than it pleaſeth.</p>
               <p>I have offered to put all differences in Church affaires and Religion to the free con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation of a Synod or Convocation rightly choſen; the reſults of whoſe Counſells as they would have included the Votes of all, ſo it's like they would have given moſt ſatisfaction to all.</p>

               <p>For I cannot think ſo many men cryed up for learning and piety, who formerly allowed the Liturgy and Government of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as to the maine, would have ſo ſuddenly agreed quite to aboliſh both of them, (the laſt of which, they knew to be of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicall inſtitution, at leaſt, as of Primitive and Univerſall practice) if they had been left to the liberty of their own ſuffrages, and if the influence of contrary Factions had not, by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret incroachments of hopes, and feares, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon them, to comply with ſo great and dangerous Innovations in the Church; without any regard to their own former judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and practice, or to the common intereſt and honour of all the Clergy, and in them of Order, Learning, and Religion againſt exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of all Ancient Churches; the Lawes in force, and my conſent; which is never to be gained againſt ſo pregnant light, as in that point ſhines on my underſtanding.</p>
               <p>For I conceive, that, where the Scripture is not ſo clear and punctuall in precepts, there the conſtant and Univerſall practice of the Church, in things not contrary to Reaſon, Faith, good Manners, or any poſitive Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, is the beſt Rule that Chriſtians can fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
               <p>I was willing to grant, or reſtore to Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery,

what with reaſon or diſcretion it can pretend to, in a conjuncture with Epiſcopacy; but for that wholly to invade the Power, and by the Sword to arrogate, and quite abrogate the Authority of that Ancient Order, I think neither juſt, as to Epiſcopacy, nor ſafe for Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery; nor yet any way convenient for this Church or State.</p>
               <p>A due reformation had eaſily followed mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Counſells; and (ſuch I believe) as would have given more content, even to the moſt of thoſe Divines, who have been led on with much Gravity and Formality, to carry on o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens deſignes: which, no doubt, many of them by this time diſcover, though they dare not but ſmother their fruſtrations, and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents.</p>
               <p>The ſpecious and popular titles, of Chriſts Government; Throne, Scepter, and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome (which certainly is not divided, nor hath two faces, as their Parties now have, at leaſt) alſo the noiſe of a through Reformation, theſe may as eaſily be fixed on new modells, as faire colours may be put to ill-favoured fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures.</p>
               <p>The breaking of Church-windowes, which Time had ſufficiently defaced; pulling downe of Croſſes, which were but civill, not Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous marks; defacing of the Monuments, and Inſcriptions of the Dead, which ſerved but to put Poſterity in mind, to thank God, for that
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:38600:88"/>
clearer light, wherein they live; The leaving of all Miniſters to their liberties, and private abilities, in the Publike ſervice of God, where no Chriſtian can tell to what he may ſay <hi>Amen;</hi> nor what adventure he may make, of ſeeming, at leaſt, to conſent to the Errours, Blaſphemies, and ridiculous Undecencies, which bold and ignorant men liſt to vent in their Prayers, Preaching, and other offices; The ſetting forth alſo of old Catechiſmes, and Confeſſions of Faith new dreſt, importing as much, as if there had been no ſound or cleare Doctrine of Faith in this Church, before ſome foure or five yeares conſultation had matured their thoughts, touching their firſt Principles of Religion.</p>
               <p>All theſe, and the like are the effects of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular, ſpecious, and deceitfull Reformations, (that they might not ſeem to have nothing to doe) and may give ſome ſhort flaſhes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to the Vulgar, (who are taken with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties, as Children with Babies, very much, but not very long) But all this amounts not to, nor can in Juſtice merit the glory of the Churches thorow Reformation; ſince they leave all things more deformed, diſorderly, and diſcontented, then when they began in point of Piety, Morality, Charity, and good Order.</p>
               <p>Nor can they eaſil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I wiſh they would, at laſt, make it their Unanimous work, to doe Gods work, and not their owne: Had Religion been firſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red (as it merited) much trouble might have been prevented.</p>
               <p>But ſome men thought, that the Government of this Church and State, fixed by ſo many Lawes, and long Cuſtomes, would not run into their new moulds, till they had firſt mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it in the fire of a Civill Warre; by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of which they reſolved, if they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, to make my ſelfe and all my Subjects fall down, and worſhip the Images they ſhould forme and ſet up: If there had been as much of Chriſts Spirit, for meekneſſe, wiſdome, and charity, in mens hearts, as there was of his Name uſed in the pretenſions, to reforme all to Chriſts Rule, it would certainly have obtained more of Gods bleſſing, and produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced more of Chriſts Glory, the Churches good, the Honour of Religion, and the Unity of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</p>
               <p>Publique Reformers had need firſt Act in private, and practice that on their owne hearts, which they purpoſe to trie on others; for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formities within, will ſoon betray the pretenders of publike Reformations, to ſuch private deſigns as muſt needs hinder the publike good.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="170" facs="tcp:38600:89"/>
I am ſure the right Methods of Reforming the Church cannot conſiſt with that of pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing the Civill State; nor can Religion be juſtly advanced by depreſſing Loyalty, which is one of the chiefeſt Ingredients, and Ornaments of true Religion; for, next to <hi>fear God,</hi> is, <hi>Honour the King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I doubt not but Chriſts Kingdome may be ſet up without pulling downe Mine; nor will any men in impartiall times appear good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, that approve not themſelves good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
               <p>Chriſts Government will confirm Mine, not overthrow it; ſince as I own mine from him, ſo I deſire to rule for his Glory, and his Churches good.</p>
               <p>Had ſome men truly intended Chriſt's Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, or knew what it meant in their hearts, they could never have been ſo ill-governed in in their words, and actions, both againſt me and one another.</p>
               <p>As good ends cannot juſtifie evill meanes, ſo nor will evill beginnings ever bring forth good concluſions; unleſſe God, by a miracle of Mercy, create Light out of Darkneſſe, order out of our confuſions, and peace out of our paſſions.</p>

               <p>It's probable ſome men will now look upon me as my owne Counſellour, and having none elſe to quarrell with under that notion, they will hereafter confine their anger to my ſelfe: Although I know they are very unwilling I ſhould enjoy the liberty of my own Thoughts, or follow the light of my owne Conſcience, which they labour to bring into an abſolute captivity to themſelves; not allowing me to think their Counſells to be other then good for me, which have ſo long maintained a Warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me.</p>

               <p>Yet muſt God be my chiefeſt Guard; and My Conſcience both My Counſellour and My Comforter: Though I put my Body into their hands, yet I ſhall reſerve my Soule to God, and my ſelfe; nor ſhall any neceſſity

compell me, to deſert mine Honour, or ſwerve from my Judgement.</p>
               <p>What they ſought to take by force, ſhall now be given them in ſuch a way of unuſuall confidence of them, as may make them aſhamed not to be really ſuch, as they ought, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed to be.</p>
               <p>God ſees it not enough to deprive me of all Military power to defend my ſelf; but to put me upon uſing their power, who ſeem to fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, yet ought in duty to defend me.</p>
               <p>So various are all humane affaires, and ſo neceſſitous may the ſtate of Princes be, that their greateſt danger may be in their ſuppoſed ſafety, and their ſafety in their ſuppoſed dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
               <p>I muſt now leave thoſe, that have adhered to me, and apply to thoſe that have oppoſed me; this method of Peace may be more proſperous, than that of Warre, both to ſtop the effuſion of bloud, and to cloſe thoſe wounds already made: and in it I am no leſſe ſolicitous for My Friends ſafety, than mine owne; chuſing to venture my ſelfe upon further hazards, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then expoſe their reſolute Loyalty to all extremities.</p>
               <p>It is ſome skill in play to know when a game is loſt; better fairly to give over, than to conteſt in vaine.</p>
               <p>I muſt now ſtudy to re-inforce my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and fortifie my mind with Reaſon and

Religion; that I may not ſeem to offer up my Soules liberty, or make my Conſcience their Captive; who ought at firſt to have uſed argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, not Armes, to have perſwaded my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to their new demands.</p>
               <p>I thank God, no ſucceſſe darkens or diſguiſes Truth to me; and I ſhall no leſſe conforme my words to my inward dictates now, than if they had been as the words of a KING ought to be among loyall Subjects, <hi>full of power.</hi>

               <p>Reaſon is the divineſt power. I ſhall never think my ſelfe weakned while I may make full and free uſe of that.

me, their Spirits cannot ſo harmoniouſly accord with mine, or mine with theirs, either in Prayer, or other holy duties, as is meet, and moſt comfortable, whoſe golden Rule, and bond of Perfection conſiſts in that of mutuall Love and Charity.</p>
               <p>Some remedies are worſe then the diſeaſe, and ſome Comforters more miſerable then miſery it ſelfe; when, like <hi>Jobs</hi> friends, they ſeek not to fortifie ones mind with patience; but perſwade a man, by betraying his own Innocency, to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair of Gods mercy; and, by juſtifying their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, to ſtrengthen the hands, and harden the hearts of inſolent Enemies.</p>
               <p>I am ſo much a friend to all Church-men, that have any thing in them beſeeming that ſacred Function, that I have hazarded My owne Intereſts, chiefly upon Conſcience and Conſtancy to maintaine their Rights; whom the more I looked upon as Orphans, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſacrilegious eyes of many cruell and rapacious Reformers; ſo I thought it my duty the more to appeare as a Father, and a Patron for them and the Church. Although I am ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unhandſomly requited by ſome of them; who may live to repent no leſſe for my ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, than their owne ungratefull errours, and that injurious contempt and meanneſſe, which they have brought upon their Calling and Perſons.</p>
               <p>I pity all of them, I deſpiſe none: onely I
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:38600:99"/>
thought I might have leave to make choice of ſome for my ſpeciall Attendants, who were beſt approved in my judgement, and moſt ſutable to my affection. For, I held it better to ſeem undevout, and to heare no mens pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, than to be forced, or ſeem to comply with thoſe Petitions, to which the heart cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, nor the tongue ſay <hi>Amen,</hi> without contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting a mans own underſtanding, or belying his own ſoule.</p>
               <p>In Devotions, I love neither profane bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, nor pious non-ſenſe; but ſuch an humble and judicious gravity, as ſhewes the Speaker to be at once conſiderate of Gods Majeſty, the Churches honour, and his owne Vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; both knowing what things God allows him to ask, and in what manner it becomes a Sinner to ſupplicate the divine Mercy for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and others.</p>
               <p>I am equally ſcandalized with all prayers, that ſound either imperiouſly, or rudely, and paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onately; as either wanting humility to God, or charity to men, or reſpect to the duty.</p>
               <p>I confeſſe I am better pleaſed, as with ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died and premeditated Sermons, ſo with ſuch publique Formes of Prayers, as are fitted to the Churches and every Chriſtians daily and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon neceſſities; becauſe I am by them better aſſured, what I may joyne my heart unto, than I can be of any mans extemporary ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; which as I doe not wholly exclude from
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:38600:100"/>
publique occaſions, ſo I allow its juſt liberty and uſe in private and devout retirements; where neither the ſolemnity of the duty, nor the modeſt regard to others, doe require ſo great exactneſſe as to the outward manner of performance. Though the light of underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and the fervency of affection, I hold the maine and moſt neceſſary requiſites both in conſtant, and occaſionall, ſolitary, and ſociall Devotions.</p>
               <p>So that I muſt needs ſeem to all equall minds with as much Reaſon to prefer the ſervice of my own Chaplains before that of their Miniſters, as I do the Liturgy before their Directory.</p>
               <p>In the one, I have been alwaies educated and exerciſed; In the other, I am not yet Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chized, nor acquainted; And if I were, yet ſhould I not by that, as by any certaine rule and Canon of devotion be able to follow or find out the indirect extravagances of moſt of thoſe men, who highly cry up that as a piece of rare compoſure and uſe; which is already as much deſpiſed and diſuſed by many of them, as the Common-Prayer ſometimes was by thoſe men; a great part of whoſe piety hung upon that popular pin of railing againſt, and contemning the Government, and Liturgy of this Church. But, I had rather be condemned to the woe of <hi>Vae ſoli,</hi> than to that of <hi>Vae vobis Hypocritis,</hi> by ſeeming to pray what I do not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove.</p>

It may be, I am eſteemed by my Denyers ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient of My ſelf to diſcharge My duty to God as a Prieſt, though not to Men as a Prince.</p>
               <p>Indeed, I think both Offices, Regall and Sacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotall, might will become the ſame Perſon; as anciently they were under one name, and the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited rights of primogeniture: Nor could I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low better preſidents, if I were able<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than thoſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Titles indeed of greater Honour, where rightly placed, than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of thoſe the Roman Emperours affected from the Nations they ſubdued: it being infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more glorious to convert Souls to Gods Church by the Word, than to conquer men to a ſubjection by the Sword.</p>

As I owe the Clergy the protection of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian KING, ſo I deſire to enjoy from them the benefit of their gifts and prayers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which I looke upon as more prevalent than My own, or other mens, by how much they flow from minds more enlightned, &amp; affections leſſe diſtracted, than thoſe which are uncombred with ſecular affairs, beſides, I think a greater bleſſing and acceptable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe attends thoſe duties, which are rightly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, as proper to, &amp; within the limits of that calling to which God and the Church have ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially deſigned and conſecrated ſome men: and however, as to that Spirituall Government, by which the devout Sonl is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I was always bred to more modeſt, and I think, more pious principles: the conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to My Spirituall defects makes me more prize &amp; deſire thoſe pious aſſiſtances, which holy and good Miniſters, either Biſhops or Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, may afford Me; eſpecially in theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities, to w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> God hath bin pleaſed to ſuffer ſome of my Subjects to reduce me; ſo as to leave

them nothing more, but My life to take from me, and to leave me nothing to deſire, which I thought might leſſe provoke their jealouſie and offence to deny Me, than this of having ſome means afforded Me for My Soules comfort and ſupport.</p>
               <p>To which end I made choice of men, as no way (that I know) ſcandalous, ſo every way eminent for their learning and piety, no leſſe than for their Loyalty: nor can I imagine any exceptions to be made againſt them, but only this, that they may ſeem too able and too wel affected toward me and My ſervice.</p>
               <p>But this is not the firſt ſervice (as I count it the beſt) in which they have forced Me to ſerve My ſelf, though I muſt confeſſe I bear with more greif and impatience the want of My Chaplains, than of any other My Servants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and next (if not beyond in ſome things) to the being ſequeſtred from my Wife and Children; ſince from theſe indeed more of humane and temporary affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but from thoſe more of heavenly and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall improvements may be expected.</p>
               <p>My comfort is, that, in the inforced (not neg<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lected) want of ordinary means, God is wont to afford extraordinary ſupplies of his gifts and graces.</p>
               <p>If his Spirit will teach me &amp; help My infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in prayer, reading and meditation (as I hope he will) I ſhall need no other, either Orator or Inſtructer.</p>

To Thee therefore, O my God, doe I direct my now ſolitary prayers; what I want of others help, ſupply with the more immediate aſſiſtances of thy Spirit, which alone can both enlighten My darkneſſ, and quicken My dulneſſe.</p>

               <p>VVHat part God will have Me now to act or ſuffer in this new and ſtrange ſcene of affaires, I am not much ſolicitous; ſince little practiſe will ſerve that man, who onely ſeeks to repreſent a part of honeſty and honour.</p>
               <p>This ſurprize of Me tells the world, that a KING cannot be ſo low, but He is conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; adding weight to that Party where he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares.</p>
               <p>This motion, like others of the Times, ſeemes excentrique and irregular, yet not well to be reſiſted or quieted: Better ſwim down ſuch a ſtream, than in vaine to ſtrive againſt it.</p>
               <p>Theſe are but the ſtruglings of thoſe twins, which lately one womb encloſed, the younger ſtriving to prevaile againſt the elder; what the Presbyterians have hunted after, the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents now ſeek to catch for themſelves.</p>
               <p>So impoſſible is it for lines to be drawn from
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:38600:106"/>
the center, and not to divide from each other; ſo much the wider, by how much they go far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the point of union.</p>
               <p>That the Builders of <hi>Babell</hi> ſhould from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion fall to confuſion, is no wonder; but for thoſe that pretend to build <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> to divide their Tongues and hands, is but an ill <hi>omen;</hi> and ſounds too like the fury of thoſe Zealots, whoſe inteſtine bitterneſſe and diviſions were the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt occaſion of the laſt fatall deſtruction of that City.</p>
               <p>Well may I change my Keepers and Priſon, but not my captive condition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> onely with this hope of bettering, that thoſe, who are ſo much profeſſed Patrons for the Peoples Liberties, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be utterly againſt the Liberty of their <hi>King;</hi> what they demand for their own Conſciences, they cannot in Reaſon deny to Mine.</p>
               <p>In this they ſeem more ingenuous, than the Presbyterian rigour, who, ſometimes complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of exacting their conformity to laws, are become the greateſt Exactors of other mens ſubmiſſion to their novell injunctions, before they are ſtamped with the Authotity of Lawes, which they cannot well have without my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
               <p>'Tis a great argument, that the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents think themſelves manumitted, from their Rivals ſervice, in that they carry on a buſineſſe of ſuch conſequence, as the aſſuming My Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon into the Armies cuſtody, without any
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:38600:107"/>
Commiſsion, but that of their own wil and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Such, as will thus adventure on a King, muſt not bethought over-modeſt, or timerous to carry on any deſigne they have a mind to.</p>
               <p>'Their next motion menaces, and ſcares both the two Houſes and the City: which, ſoon after acting over again that former part of tumultua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry motions (never queſtioned, puniſhed, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented) muſt now ſuffer for both; aud ſee their former ſin in the glaſſe of the preſeut terrours and diſtractions.</p>
               <p>No man is ſo blind as not to ſee herein the hand of divine Iuſtice; they, that by Tumults firſt occaſioned the raiſing of Arms, muſt now be chaſtened by their own Army for new Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults.</p>
               <p>So hardly can men be content with one ſinne, but adde ſin to ſin, till the later puniſh the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; ſuch as were content to ſee Me, and many Members of both Houſes, driven away by the firſt unſuppreſſed Tumults, are now forced to fly to an Army, to defend themſelves againſt them.</p>
               <p>But who can unfold the riddle of ſome mens juſtice? the Members of both houſes who at firſt withdrew, (as my ſelfe was forced to doe) from the rudeneſſe of the Tumults, were counted de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertors, and outed of their Places in Parliament.</p>
               <p>Such as ſtayed then, and enjoyed the benefit of the Tumults, were aſſerted for the only Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-men:
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:38600:107"/>
now the Flyers from, and Forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of their Places, carry the Parliamentary power along with them; complain highly againſt the tumults, &amp; vindicate themſelves by an Army: ſuch as remained and kept their ſtations, are loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked upon as Abbettors of tumultuary inſolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and Betrayers of the Freedom and Honour of Parliament.</p>
               <p>Thus is Power above all Rule, Order, &amp; Law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where men look more to preſent Advantages then their conſciences, and the unchangeable rules of Juſtice; while they are Judges of others, they are forced to condemn themſelves.</p>
               <p>Now the plea againſt Tumults hold good, the Authors and Abettors of them are guilty of prodigious inſolencies; when as before, they were counted as Friends and neceſſary Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants.</p>
               <p>I ſee Vengeance purſues and overtakes (as the Mice and Rats are ſaid to have done the Biſhop in <hi>Germany)</hi> them that thought to have eſcaped and fortified themſelves moſt impregnably a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, both by their multitude and compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
               <p>Whom the Laws cannot, God will puniſh, by their own crimes and hands.</p>
               <p>I cannot but obſerve this divine Juſtice, yet with ſorrow and pity; for, I alwayes wiſhed ſo well to Parliament and City, that I was ſorry to ſee them do, or ſuffer, any thing unworthy
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:38600:108"/>
ſuch great and conſiderable bodies in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
               <p>I was glad to ſee them onely ſcared and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, not broken by that ſhaking: I never had ſo ill a thought of thoſe Cities as to deſpaire of their Loyalty to Me; which miſtakes might e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſe, but I never believed malice had quite put out.</p>
               <p>I pray God the ſtorm be yet wholly paſſed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them; upon whom I look, as Chriſt did ſometime over <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> as objects of My pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and teares, with compaſſionate griefe, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing thoſe ſeverer ſcatterings which will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly befall ſuch as wantonly refuſe to be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered to their duty: fatall blindneſſe frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attending and puniſhing wilfull, ſo that men ſhall not be able at laſt to prevent their ſorrows, who would not timely repent of their ſin; nor ſhall they be ſuffered to enjoy the comforts, who ſecurely neglect the councels belonging to their peace. They will find that Brethren in ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity are not far from becomming inſolent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, there being nothing harder then to keep ill men long in one mind.</p>
               <p>Nor is it poſſible to gaine a faire period for thoſe notions which go rather in a round and circle of fanſie, than in a right line of reaſon tending to the Law, the onely center of publique conſiſtency; whither I pray God at laſt bring all ſides.</p>
               <p>Which will eaſily be done, when we ſhall
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:38600:108"/>
fully ſee how much more happy we are, to be ſubject to the known Laws, then to the various wills of any men, ſeem they never ſo plauſible at firſt.</p>
               <p>Vulgar compliance with any illegall and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant waies, like violent motions in nature, ſoon grows weary of it ſelfe, and ends in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractory ſullenneſſe: Peoples rebounds are oft in their faces, who firſt put them upon thoſe violent ſtrokes.</p>
               <p>For the Army (which is ſo far excuſable, as they act according to Souldiers principles, and intereſts, demanding Pay and Indempnity) I think it neceſſary, in order to the publike peace that they ſhould be ſatisfied, as far as is juſt; no man being more prone to conſider them then My ſelfe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But thou, O Lord, who art perfect Vnity in a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Trinity, in mercy behold thoſe, whom thy Iuſtice hath divided.</p>
               <p>Deliver me from the ſtrivings of My People, and make Me to ſee how much they need My Prayers and pity, who agreed to fight againſt Me; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>Divert, J pray thee, O Lord, thy heavy wrath iuſtly hanging over thoſe populous Cityes, whoſe plenty is prone to adde fewell to their luxury, their wealth to make them wanton, their multitudes tempting them to ſecurity, and their ſecurity expoſing them to unexpected miſeries.</p>
               <p>Give them eyes to ſee, hearts to conſider, wills to embrace, and courage to act thoſe things which belong to thy glory and the publique peace, leſt their calamity come upon them as an armed man.</p>

               <p>It is ſome kind of deceiving and leſſening the injury of my long reſtraint, when I find My lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure &amp; ſolitude have produced ſomething wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of My ſelf, and uſefull to you; That neither you, nor any other, may hereafter meaſure My Cauſe by the Succeſſe; nor My Judgement of things, by My misfortunes; which I count the greater by far, becauſe they have ſo farr lighted upon you, and ſome others, whom I have moſt cauſe to love, as well as My ſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and of whoſe unmerited ſufferings I have a greater ſenſe, then of Mine own.</p>
               <p>But this advantage of wiſdome you have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove other Princes; that you have begunne and now ſpent ſome years of diſcretion, in the
<pb facs="tcp:38600:111"/>
experience of troubles, and exerciſe of patience, wherein Piety, and all Vertues, both Morall and Politicall, are commonly better planted to a thriving (as Trees ſet in Winter) then in the warmth and ſerenity of times; or amidſt thoſe delights, which uſually attend Princes Courts in times of peace and plenty; which are prone, either to root up all plants of true Vertue and Honour; or to be contented only with ſome leaves, and withering formalities of them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reall fruits, ſuch as tend to the Publick good; for which Princes ſhould alwayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member they are borne, and by providence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned.</p>
               <p>The evidence of which different education the holy VVrit affords us in the contemplation of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Rehoboham:</hi> The one prepared, by many afflictions, for a flouriſhing Kingdome; the other unſoftned by the unparalel'd proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Solomons</hi> Court: and ſo corrupted to the great diminution, both for Peace, Honour, and Kingdome, by thoſe flatteries, which are as unſeparable from proſperous Princes, as Flies are from fruit in Summer; whom adverſity, like could weather, drives away.</p>
               <p>I had rather you ſhould be <hi>Charles Le Bon,</hi> then <hi>le Grand,</hi> good, then great; I hope God hath deſigned you to both, having ſo early put you into that exerciſe of his Graces, and Gifts beſtowed upon you, which may beſt weed out all vicious inclinations, and diſpoſe
<pb facs="tcp:38600:111"/>
you to thoſe Princely endowments, &amp; employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which will moſt gain the love, and intend the welfare of thoſe, over whom God ſhall place you.</p>
               <p>With God I would have you begin and end, who is King of Kings; the Soveraign diſpoſer of the Kingdomes of the world, who pulleſt down one, and ſetteth up another.</p>
               <p>The beſt Government, &amp; higheſt Sove raign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty you can attain to, is, to be ſubject to him, that the Scepter of his Word and Spirit may rule in your heart.</p>
               <p>The true glory of Princes conſiſts in advancing Gods glory in the maintenance of true Religion and the Churches good; Alſo in the diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of civill Power, with Juſtice and Honour to the publike Peace.</p>
               <p>Piety will make you proſperous; at leaſt it wil keep you from being miſerable; nor is he much a loſer, that looſeth all, yet ſaveth his own Soul at laſt.</p>

You have already taſted of that cup, whereof I have libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally drank; which I look upon as Gods phiſick, having that in healthfulneſſe, which it wants in pleaſure.

               <p>In this I charge you to perſevere, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming neareſt to Gods VVord for Doctrine, and to the primitive examples for Government, with ſoms little amendment, which I have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwhere expreſſed, and often offered, though in vaine. Your fixation in matters of Religion will not be more neceſſary for your ſoule, then your Kingdoms peace, when God ſhall bring you to them.</p>
               <p>For I have obſerved, that the Divell of Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion doth commonly turne himſelfe into an Angell of Reformation; and the old Serpent can pretend new Lights: When ſome mens Conſciences accuſe them for Sedition and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, they ſtop its mouth with the name and noiſe of Religion; when Piety pleads for peace and patience, they cry out Zeale.</p>
               <p>So that, unleſſe in this point You be well ſettled, you ſhall never want temptations to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy you and yours, under pretenſions of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming matters of Religion; for that ſeemes, even to worſt men, as the beſt and moſt auſpicious beginning of their worſt deſignes.</p>

VVhen you have done juſtice to God, your owne ſoule and his Church, in the profeſſion and preſervation both of truth and unity in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: the next maine hinge on which your proſperity will depend, and move, is, that of civil Juſtice, wherein the ſetled Lawes of theſe Kingdomes, to which you are rightly Heire, are the moſt excellent rules you can governe by; which by an admirable temperament give very much to Subjects induſtry, liberty, and happineſſe; and yet reſerve enough to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and prerogative of any King, who ownes his People as Subjects, not as Slaves; whoſe ſubjection, as it preſerves their property, peace, and ſafety, ſo it will never diminiſh your rights, nor their ingenuous Liberties; which conſiſts in the enjoyment of the fruits of their induſtry, and the benefit of thoſe Lawes to which themſelves have conſented.</p>
               <p>Never charge your head with ſuch a Crown, as, ſhall by its heavineſſe oppreſſe the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy the weakneſſe of whoſe parts cannot returne any things of ſtrength, honour, or ſafety, to the head, but a neceſſary debiliatation and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine.</p>

               <head>Meditations upon Death, after the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>otes of Non-Addreſſes, and His Maieſties Cloſer Jmpriſonment in <hi>Carisbrooke</hi>-Caſtle.</head>
               <p>AS I have leiſure enough, ſo I have cauſe more than enough, to meditate upon, &amp; prepare for My Death: for, I know, there are but few ſteps between the Priſons and grave of Princes.</p>
               <p>It is Gods indulgence, which gives Me the ſpace; but Mans cruelty, that gives Me the ſad occaſions for theſe thoughts.</p>
               <p>For, beſides the common burden of mortality, which lies upon Me, as a Man; I now bear the heavy load of other mens ambitions, fears, jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies, and cruell paſſions, whoſe envy or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity againſt Me makes their owne lives ſeem deadly to them, while I enjoy any part of Mine.</p>
               <p>I thank God, My proſperity made Me not wholly a Stranger to the contemplations of mortality:</p>
               <p>Thoſe are never unſeaſonable, ſince this is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes uncertain: Death being an eclipſe, which oft happineth as well in clear, as cloudy dayes.</p>
               <p>But My now long and ſharp adverſity hath ſo
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:38600:120"/>
reconciled in Me thoſe naturall Antipathies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Life and Death, which are in all men, that I thank God, the common terrours of it are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpelled; and the ſpeciall horour of it, as to My particular, much allayed: for, although my death at preſent may juſtly be repreſented to Me with all thoſe terrible aggravations, which the policy of cruel and implacable enemies can put upon it, (affaires being drawne to the very dregs of malice) yet I bleſſe God, I can look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all thoſe ſtings, as unpoyſonous, though ſharp; ſince My Redeemer hath eith er pulled them out, or given Me the Antidote of his death againſt them, which, as to the immaturity, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, ſhame ſcorn, and cruelty of it, excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded what ever I can fear.</p>
               <p>Indeed, I never did find ſo much the life of Religion, the feaſt of a good Conſcience, and the brazen wall of a judicious integrity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, as ſince I came to theſe cloſer conflicts with the thoughts of Death.</p>
               <p>I am not ſo old, as to be weary of life; nor (I hope) ſo bad, as to be either afraid to dye, or aſhamed to live: true, I am ſo afflicted, as might make Me ſometime even deſire to die; if I did not conſider, that it is the greateſt glory of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians life to dye daily, in conquering by a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faith, and patient hopes of a better life, thoſe partiall and quotidian deaths, which kills us (as it were) by peicemeales and make us o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-live our own FATES; while we are
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:38600:121"/>
deprived of health, honour, liberty, power, credit, ſafety, or eſtate; &amp; thoſe other comforts of dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt relations, which are as the life of our lives.</p>
               <p>Though, as a KING, I think My ſelfe to live in nothing temporall ſo much as in the love and good-will of My People; for which, as I have ſuffered many deaths, ſo I hope I am not in that point as yet wholly dead: notwithſtanding, My Enemies have uſed all the poyſon of falſity and violence of hoſtility to deſtroy, firſt the love and Loyalty, which is in My Subjects; and then all that content of life in Me, which from theſe I chiefly enjoyed.</p>
               <p>Indeed, they have left Me but little of life, and only the husk and ſhell (as it were) which their further malice and cruelty can take from Me; having bereaved Me of all thoſe worldly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, for which life it ſelfe ſeems deſirable to men. But, O My Soule! think not that life too long, or tedious, wherein God gives thee any op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities, if not to doe, yet to ſuffer with ſuch Chriſtian patience and magnanimity in a good Cauſe, a sare the greateſt honour of our lives, and the beſt improvement of our deaths.</p>
               <p>I know, that in point of true Chriſtian va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, it argues puſillanimity to deſire to die out of wearineſſe of life; and a want of that hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick greatneſſe of ſpirit which becomes a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian in the patient and generous ſuſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thoſe afflictions, which as ſhaddows neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily attend us, while we are in this body;
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:38600:121"/>
and which are leſſened or enlarged as the Sun of our proſperity moves higher or lower: whoſe totall abſence is beſt recompenſed with the dew of Heaven.</p>
               <p>The aſſaults of affliction may be terrible; like <hi>Sampſon's</hi> Lyon, but they yeeld much ſweetneſſe to thoſe, that dare to encounter and overcome them; who know how to overlive the witherings of their Gourds without diſcontent or peeviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, while they may yet converſe with God.</p>
               <p>That I muſt dye as a man, is certain; that I may dye a King, by the hands of My own Subjects, a violent, ſodain &amp; barbarous death; in the ſtrength of my years, in the midſt of My Kingdoms; My Friends and loving Subjects being helples Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators; My Enemies inſolent Revilers and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphers over me; living, dying, &amp; dead, is ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable in humane reaſon; that God hath taught me not to hope otherwiſe as to mans cruelty; however, I deſpair not of Gods infinite marcy.</p>
               <p>I know my life is the object of the Devils &amp; wicked mens malice; but yet under Gods ſole cuſtody and diſpoſall: Whom I do not think to flatter for longer life by ſeeming prepared to dye, but I humbly deſire to depend upon him, and to ſubmit to his will both in Life and death, in what order ſoever he is pleaſed to lay them out to me. I confeſſe it is not eaſie for me to contend with thoſe many horrors of death, wherewith God ſuffers me to be tempted; which are equally horrid, either in the ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:38600:122"/>
of a barbarous Aſſaſination; or in thoſe greater formalities, whereby my Enemies (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more ſolemnly cruell) will, it may be, ſeek to add (as thoſe did who Crucified Chriſt) the mockery of Juſtice, to the cruelty of malice: That I may be deſtroyed, as with greater pomp and artifice, ſo with les pitty, it wil be but a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary pollicy to make my death appeare as an act of Juſtice, don by Subjects upon their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne, who know that no Law of God or Man inveſts them with any power of Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture without me, much leſſe againſt me: and who, being ſworn, and bound by all that is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred before God and Man, to endeavour my preſervation, muſt pretend Juſtice to cover their perjury.</p>
               <p>It is, indeed, a ſad fate for any man to have his Enemies to be Accuſers, Parties, and Judges; but moſt deſperate, when this is acted by the inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of Subjects againſt their Soveraigne; wherein thoſe, who have had the chiefeſt hand, and are moſt guilty of contriving the publike Troubles, muſt by ſhedding my blood ſeem to waſh their owne hands of that inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent bloud whereof they are now moſt evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly guilty before God and Man; and I beleive in their own Conſciences too, while they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on unreaſonable Demands; Firſt by Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, after by Armies. Nothing makes meane ſpirits more towardly-cruel in managing their uſurped power againſt their lawfull Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:38600:122"/>
than this, the <hi>Guilt of their uniuſt Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation:</hi> notwithſtanding thoſe ſpecious and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular pretenſions of Juſtice againſt Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents applyed only to diſguize at firſt the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrouſneſſe of their deſigns, who deſpaired, indeed, of poſſeſſing the power and profits of the Vineyeard, till the heire whoſe right it is, be caſt out and ſlaine.</p>
               <p>With them my greateſt fault muſt be, that I would not either deſtroy My ſelfe with the Church and State by my Word, or not ſuffer them to do it unreſiſted by the Sword; whoſe covetous ambition no Conceſsions of Mine could ever yet either ſatisfie, or abate.</p>
               <p>Nor is likely they will ever think, that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of brambles which ſome men ſeek to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect (at once, weak, ſharp, and fruitleſſe, either to <hi>God</hi> or Man) is like to thriue till watred with the Royal bloud of thoſe, whoſe right the Kingdom is. Wel, Gods will be don, I doubt not but my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency will find him both my protectour, and my Advocate who is my only Iudge, whom I owne as King of Kings, not onely for the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency of his power and Majeſty above them; but alſo for that ſingular care and protection, which he hath over them: who knows them to be expoſed to as many dangers (being the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Patrons of Law, Juſtice, Order, &amp; Religion on earth) as there be either men or Devills; which love confuſion.</p>
               <p>Nor will he ſuffer thoſe Men long to proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:38600:123"/>
in their <hi>Babel,</hi> who build it with the bones, and cement it with the bloud of their Kings.</p>
               <p>I am confident they will find Avengers of my death amongſt themſelves: the injuries I have ſuſteined from them ſhall be firſt puniſhed by them, who agreed in nothing ſo much as in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing Me.</p>
               <p>Their impatience to bear the loud cry of My bloud, ſhall make them thinke no way better to expiate it, than by ſhedd ing theirs, who, with them, moſt thirſted after Mine.</p>
               <p>The ſad confuſions following my deſtruction, are already preſaged and confirmed to Me by thoſe I have lived to ſee ſince My troubles; in which God alone (who only could) hath many wayes pleaded my cauſe; not ſuffering them to go unpuin ſhed, whoſe confederacy in ſin was their only ſecurity; who have cauſe to fear that God wil both further divide, and by mutual ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, afterwards deſtroy them,</p>
               <p>My greateſt conqueſt of Death is from the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and love of Chriſt, who hath ſwallow'd up death in the Victory of his Reſurrection, and the glory of his Aſcention.</p>
               <p>My next comfort is, that he gives me not onely the honour to imitate his example in ſuffering for righteouſneſſe ſake, (though ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured by the fouleſt charges of Tyranny and injuſtice) but alſo, that charity, which is the nobleſt revenge upon, and victory over My
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:38600:123"/>
Deſtroyers: By which, I thank God, I can both forgive them, &amp; pray for them, that God would not impute My bloud to them further then to convince them, what need they have of Chriſts bloud to waſh their ſoules from the guilt of ſhedding Mine.</p>
               <p>At preſent, the will of My Enemies ſeems to be their only rule, their power the meaſure, and their ſucceſſe the Exactor, of what they pleaſe to call Juſtice; while they flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the fancy of their owne ſafety by my danger, and the ſecurity of their lives and deſignes by My Death: forgetting, that as the greateſt temptations to ſinne are wrapped up in ſeeming proſperities, ſo the ſevereſt venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of God are then moſt accompliſhed, when men are ſuffered to compleat their wicked pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes. I bleſſe God, I pray not ſo much, that this bitter cup of a violent death may paſſe from Me, as that of his warth may paſſe from all thoſe whoſe hands, by deſerting Me, are ſprinkled, or by acting and conſenting to My death, are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brued with My bloud.</p>
               <p>The will of <hi>God</hi> hath confined, and concluded Mine; I ſhall have the pleaſure of dying, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any pleaſure of deſired vengeance.</p>
               <p>This I think becomes a Chriſtian toward his Enemies, and a King toward his ſubjects.</p>
               <p>They cannot deprive Me of more than I am content to loſe, when God ſees fit by their hands to take it from me; whoſe mercy, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:38600:124"/>
will more then infinitely recompence what ever by mans injuſtice, he is pleaſed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive me of.</p>
               <p>The glory attending my death will farre ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe all I could enjoy, or conceive in life.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not want the heavy and envyed Crownes of this world, when my God hath mercifully Crowned and Conſummated his graces with Glory, and exchanged the ſhadows of my earthly Kingdomes among men, for the ſubſtance of that Heavenly Kingdom with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
               <p>For the cenſures of the world; I know the ſharpe and neceſſary tyranny of my Deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers will ſufficiently confute the calumnies of tyranny againſt me; I am perſwaded I am hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in the judicious love of the ableſt and beſt of my Subjects, who doe not onely pity and pray for me, but would be content even to dye with me, or for me.</p>
               <p>Theſe know how to excuſe my failings; as a man, and yet to retaine and pay their duty to me as their King; there being no religious ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity binding any Subjects by pretending to puniſh, infinitely to exceede, the faults and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of their Princes; eſpecially there, where more then ſufficient ſatisfaction hath been made to the publike; the enjoyment of which, private ambitions have hitherto fruſtrated.</p>
               <p>Others, I beleive, of ſofter tempers, and leſſe advantaged by my ruine, doe already feel ſharp
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:38600:124"/>
convictions, and ſome remorſe in their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences: where they cannot but ſee the proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their evill dealings againſt me in the meaſure of Gods retaliations upon them who cannot hope long to enjoy their owne thumbs and toes, having under pretence of paring others nails, bin ſo cruell as to cut off their chiefeſt ſtrength.</p>
               <p>The puniſhment of the more inſolent and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinat may be like that of <hi>Korah</hi> and his compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces (at once mutining againſt both Prince and Prieſt) in ſuch a method of divine juſtice, as is not ordinary; the earth of the loweſt and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt people opening upon them, and ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them up in a juſt diſdain of their ill-gotten and worſe-uſed Authority: upon whoſe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and ſtrength they cheifly depended for their building and eſtabliſhing their deſignes againſt me, the Church and State.</p>
               <p>My chiefeſt comfort in death conſiſts in My peace, which I truſt, is made with God; before whoſe exact tribunall I ſhal not fear to appear, as to the Cauſe ſo long diſputed by the ſword, between me and my cauſleſſe Enemies, where I doubt not but his righteous judgment wll con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p>I am confident the Juſtice of My Cauſe, and clearneſſe of my conſcience before God and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward my people wil carry me as much above them in Gods deciſion, as their ſucceſſes have lifted them above me in the vulgar opinion who conſider not, that many times thoſe underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings of men are lifted up to heaven in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity and applauſe of the world, whoſe riſe is from Hell, as to the injuriouſneſſe and oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the deſigne. The proſperous winds which oft fill the ſayles of Pyrates, doth not juſtifie their piracy and rapine.</p>
               <p>I look upon it with infinite more content and quiet of Soule, to have been worſted in my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced conteſtation for, and Vindication of the Laws of the Land, the freedome and honour of Parliaments; the rights of My Crown, the juſt liberty of My Subjects, and the true Chriſtian Religion in its Doctrine, Government and due encouragements, then if I had, with the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt advantages of ſucceſſe, overborn them all, as ſome men have now evidently done, whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver deſignes they at firſt pretended.</p>
               <p>The prayers and patience of my Freinds and loving Subjects will contribute much to the ſweetning of this bitter cup, which I doubt not but I ſhall more cheerefuly take and drink as from Gods hand (if it muſt be ſo) than they can
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:38600:125"/>
give it me, whoſe hands are unjuſtly and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly lifted up againſt me.</p>
               <p>And as to the laſt event, I may ſeeme to owe more to my Enemies, than my Freinds; while thoſe will put a period to the finnes and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows attending this miſerable life wherewith theſe deſire, I might ſtill contend.</p>
               <p>I ſhall be more then Conquerour through Chriſt enabling me: for whome I have hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuffered: as he is the Authour of Truth, Order, and Peace; for all which I have beene forced to contend againſt Errour, Faction and confuſion.</p>
               <p>If I muſt ſuffer a violent death with my Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; it is but mortality crowned with martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: where the debt of death, which I owe for ſinne to nature, ſhall be raiſed, as a gift of faith and patience offered to God.</p>
               <p>Which I humbly beſeech him mercifully to accept; and although Death be the wages of my owne ſinne, as from God, and the effect of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſinnes, as men, both againſt God and me; yet as I hope my owne ſinnes are ſo remitted, that they ſhall be no ingredients to imbitter the cup of my death, ſo I deſire God to pardon their ſinnes, who are moſt guilty of my deſtruction.</p>
               <p>The Trophees of my charity will be more glorious and durable over them, than their ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>managed victories over me.</p>
               <p>Though their ſin be proſperous, yet they had need to be penitent, that they may be pardoned:
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:38600:126"/>
Both which, I pray God they may obtaine: that my temporall Death unjuſtly inflicted by them, may not be revenged by Gods juſt inflicting e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall death upon them: for I look upon the temporall deſtruction of the greateſt King, as far leſſe deprecable, than the eternall damnation of the meaneſt Subject.</p>
               <p>Nor do I wiſh other, than the ſafe bringing of the ſhip to ſhore, when they have caſt me over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board; though it be very ſtrange, that Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners can find no other means to appeaſe the ſtorme, themſelves have raiſed, but by drowning their Pilot.</p>
               <p>I thank <hi>God,</hi> my Enemies cruelty cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent my preparation; whoſe malice in this I ſhall defeat, that they ſhall not have the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to have deſtroyed my Soule with my Body; of whoſe ſalvation, while ſome of them have themſelves ſeemed, and taught others to deſpaire, they have only diſcover'd this, that they do not much deſire it.</p>
               <p>VVhoſe uncharitable and cruell Reſtraints, denying me even the aſſiſtance of any of my Chaplains, hath rather enlarged, than any way obſtructed my acceſſe to the Throne of Heaven.</p>
               <p>Where thou dwelleſt, O King of Kings; who filleſt Heaven and Earth, who art the fountain of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life, in whom is no ſhadow of death.</p>
               <p>Thou O God, art both the iuſt Afflicter of Death upon ns, and the mercifull Saviour of us in it, and from it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="245" facs="tcp:38600:126"/>
Yea, it is better for us to be dead to our ſelves and live in thee, than by living in our ſelves to be deprived of thee.</p>
               <p>O make the many bitter agravations of my death as a Man, and a King, the opportunities and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of thy ſpeciall graces and comforts in my Soule, as a Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>If thou Lord wilt be with me, I ſhall neither fear nor feel any evill, though I walk through the valey of the ſhadow of death.</p>
               <p>To contend with death is the work of a weak and mortall man; to overcome it is the grace of thee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, who art the Almighty and immortal God.</p>
               <p>O My Saviour, who knoweſt what it is to dye with Me, as a Man; make Me to know what it is to paſs through death to life with thee My God.</p>
               <p>Though I dye, yet I know, that thou my Redeemer liveſt for ever: though thou ſlayeſt Me, yet thou haſt incouraged me to truſt in thee for eternal life.</p>
               <p>O withdraw not thy favour from me, which is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than life.</p>
               <p>O be not farre from me, for I know not how neer a violent and cruel death is to Me.</p>
               <p>As thy Omniſcience, O God, diſcovers; ſo thy Omnipotence can defeat the deſignes of thoſe who have, or ſhall conſpire my deſtruction.</p>
               <p>O ſhew me thy goodneſſe of thy will, through the wickedneſſe of theirs.</p>
               <p>Thou giveſt me leave as a man to pray, that this cup may paſſe from me; but thou haſt taught Me as a Chriſtian by the example of Chriſt to adde, not my will, but thine be done.</p>

Yea Lord, let our wills be one, by wholy reſolving mine into thine: let not the deſire of life in me be ſo great, as that of doing or ſuffering thy will in either life or death.</p>
               <p>As I believe thou haſt forgiven all the errors of my life, ſo I hope thou wilt ſave me from the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of my death.</p>
               <p>Make me content to leave the worlds nothing, that I may come really to enioy all in thee, who haſt made Chriſt unto me in life, gaine, and in death, advantage.</p>
               <p>Though my deſtroyers forget their duty to thee and me, yet do not thou, O Lord, forget to be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull to them.</p>
               <p>For, what profit is there in my bloud, or in their gaining my Kingdoms, if they loſe their own Souls?</p>
               <p>Such as have not only reſiſted my iuſt Power, but wholy uſurped and turned it againſt my ſelfe, though they may deſerve, yet let them not receive to themſelvs damnation.</p>
               <p>Thou madeſt thy Son a Saviou to many that Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified Him, while at once he ſuffered violently by them, and yet willingly for them.</p>
               <p>O let the voice of his hloud be heard for My murtherers, louder than the cry of mine againſt them.</p>
               <p>Prepare them for thy mercy by due convictions of their ſinne, and let them not at once deceive and damme their owne Soules by fallacio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:38600:127"/>
tempts them to uſe all extremities againſt me.</p>
               <p>O Lord, thou knoweſt I have found their mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies to me as very falſe, ſo very cruell, who preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to preſerve me, have meditated nothing but my ruine.</p>
               <p>O deal not with them as bloud-thirſty and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull men, but overcome their cruelty with thy compaſſion and my charity.</p>
               <p>And when thou makest inquiſition for My bloud, O ſprinkle their polluted, yet penitent Souls with the bloud of thy Sonne, that thy deſtroying Angell may paſſe over them.</p>
               <p>Though they think my Kingdoms on earth too little to entertaine at once both them and me, yet let the capacious Kingdome of thy infinite mercy at laſt receive both me and my enemies.</p>
               <p>When being reconciled to thee in the bloud of the ſame Redeemer, we ſhall live farre above theſe am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious deſires, which beget ſuch mortall enmities.</p>
               <p>When their hands ſhall be heavieſt, and cruelleſt upon me, O let me fall into the arms of thy tender and eternall mercies.</p>
               <p>That what is cut off of my life in this miſerable moment: may be repaiedin thy ever, bleſſed eternity.</p>
               <p>Lord, let thy Servant depart in peace, for my eyes have ſeen thy ſalvation.</p>
