            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An Extract of A LETTER From <hi>York,</hi> dated <date>the 31. of <hi>Decemb.</hi> 1659.</date> concerning The Lord FAIRFAX'S Raiſing that County in Arms againſt Illegal Taxes and Free-quarter, and for the Freedom of Parliament, as it was in the Year, 1648.</head>
            <p>HAving done with our particular concernments, give me leave to acquaint you in brief with mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters more publick, and perhaps very ſtrange unto you: The Gentry of this County are univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally up under the Conduct of the Lord <hi>Fairfax,</hi> ſuch a riſing on a ſudden hath not been known. That which firſt occaſioned it, is Free-quarter, and the Tax that hath been lately impoſed upon this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by military Power, to which the Gentry of theſe parts are unwilling to ſtoop, being loath to receive Law from the Sword, having drawn their Swords to maintain the Laws of the Land, which declares, that no Tax be impoſed upon the People, but by Conſent in Parliament, and the Gentry in theſe parts ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain to be by Conſent in <hi>a Full Parliament.</hi> The manner of their Riſing was in three Diviſions; the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> for the Weſt-Riding of the County had his Rendevouze at <hi>Leeds,</hi> where multitudes of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple reſort unto him both Horſe and Foot. And the Trade of Cloathing being dead, by reaſon of the Warres with <hi>Spain,</hi> makes thoſe Parts riſe in abundance, to do any thing for the having of a <hi>Free Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> which (they think) will procure the opening of Trade again. There is come unto the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi>'s Aſſiſtance alſo three Troops of Horſe of Collonel <hi>Lilburn</hi>'s Regiment, under the Command of Major <hi>Smithſon,</hi> Captain <hi>Strangwayes</hi> and Captain <hi>Wilkinſon.</hi> The Forces in the North-Riding are raiſed by Collonel <hi>Hugh Bethel</hi> (with one eye) and Sir <hi>Francis Boynton:</hi> And the Forces in the Eaſt-Riding are raiſed by Sir <hi>Henry Cholmely,</hi> and other Gentlemen in that Riding. Theſe two laſt Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons at a Rendevouze yeſterday had fifteen hundred Horſe compleatly armed; And this day, or upon Munday, do meet the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> at the General Rendevouze. I have endeavoured to underſtand the Bottom of this Buſineſs, and do perceive they intend to declare upon theſe Heads following,</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>For the Reſtoring of this Parliament to the Due Freedome which it enjoyed in the Year, 1648. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was Garbled by the Army.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>That the Souldiers of the Army may have their Arrears paid, and that for the future military Forces may be put into ſuch hands as may be of Publick Intereſt, and likely to ſubmit to Civil Authority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>To remove the preſent Illegall Aſſeſſement now in Leavying upon the County; and</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. <hi>To prevent the Quakers Anabaptiſts,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>from meeting at their Rendevouze, who did intend as we are informed to joyn with the Lord</hi> Lamberts <hi>Forces on the third day of</hi> January. The Lord <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> is upon a ſpeedy March Southward from <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> (where he hath left ten Companies of Foot, and two Troopes of Horſe to ſecure it) (and the report goes that Generall <hi>Monk</hi> will March after him, but we have not the Certainty of it) the Lord <hi>Lambert</hi> horſes many of his Foot, we expect them at <hi>Witherby</hi> the ſecond of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary,</hi> and various are the Opinions what he will do. Some think he will not truſt to Indemnity from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, ſhould it be granted unto him, and therefore it is conceived, that ſince the <hi>Quakers,</hi> &amp;c. do prepare for a Conjunction with him, that he will declare for <hi>Liberty of Conſcience;</hi> and by the help of the Garriſon of <hi>Hull,</hi> Arme and Array thoſe men, in hopes of which the Papiſts do not a little rejoyce. But others think, that he will hold thoſe people too narrow an Intereſt to build ſo great an undertaking upon, having <hi>Monk</hi> behind him, the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> on the Flank, and the Southern Army if reall, againſt him in the Front, and therefore that he will rather Declare to joyn with the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> for the Reſtitution of the Members in 1648. and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther receive Indemnity from them, then from the Preſent Parliament; one of thoſe two in all likelyhood he will be conſtrained to do, if he do not ſubmit, unleſs he intend to Go by to haſten up to <hi>London,</hi> whereas, we now hear, he expecteth to find the Army as plyable to his deſign as when he left them.</p>
