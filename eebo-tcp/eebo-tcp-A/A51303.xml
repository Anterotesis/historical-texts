            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>To the Right Honourable, <hi>John</hi> Lord <hi>Robarts,</hi> Baron of <hi>Truro,</hi> Lord Privy Seal, Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and one of his Majestie's most Honourable Privy COUNCIL.</head>
                  <opener>
                     <salute>My Lord,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>WHat things single are usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally thought sufficient to determine ones choice of a Patron to any publick Writing, whether it be private Obligation from particular Favours, or the Desire of leaving to Posterity a just and honourable Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony to the Parts and Vertues of some excellent Person, or the design
<pb facs="tcp:94112:3"/>
of obtaining the Patronage and countenance of such a Person, to what we adventure to make publick, as is able by his Learning, Judgement and publick Repute to protect it from Injury; all these do so hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily conspire in your Lordship, that I should have thought it an Omission unpardonable if I had not taken this opportunity of paying your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship this due respect, and of doing that right to the Truth I here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse as to put it under the wings of so fit and able a Patron.</p>
                  <p>Which still ought to be done with the greater alacrity, there being that Providentiall Coincidence of things, that I should have a Book ready in the Presse at that very time that our Gracious Sovereign did think good to conferre upon your
<pb facs="tcp:94112:3"/>
Lordship that great Honour and Trust of being Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland.</hi> Which conjuncture of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances could not but excite me with greater readinesse to make your Lordship this congratulatory Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent upon your new Honour. Which all good Christians that know the inflexible uprightnesse of your spirit, and cordiall adherence to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolick Faith and just Interest of Reformed Christendome, cannot but congratulate.</p>
                  <p>For this it is indeed, My Lord, that has begot in me a more special esteem of your Lordship, that in this instable and uncertain Age you have with that steadinesse of minde and clearnesse of Judgement stuck to the Truth and Purity of the Protestant Religion, as discerning the vast dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
<pb facs="tcp:94112:4"/>
betwixt it and Popery, which yet too many now-adays, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are <hi>removed too great a distance</hi> from <hi>all</hi> Religion, or else because their <hi>sight is extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dim</hi> in matters of this nature, <hi>can</hi> not, or <hi>will</hi> not, discern. But this is spoke with a more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar regard to the second part of this small Volume I present your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship withall.</p>
                  <p>But the first also has its speciall sutablenesse to the Circumstances your Lordship is placed in. For by how much more power any one is intrusted with by any Protestant Prince, by so much the more he is concerned to understand how sacred a Province he undertakes, and how expresly that Religion and Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is owned in the Holy Prophecies
<pb facs="tcp:94112:4"/>
                     <hi>Christ</hi> has delivered to his Church, above and against the barbarous and idolatrous Tyrannie of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Which things are set out with that plainnesse, evidence and easiness in this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of the Epistles to the Seven Churches that I hope no impartial Reader can fail of being made ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding sensible of the Sacrednesse of the Protestant Religion and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest by the perusall thereof. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, that there are some notable Hints in these Oracles for the more happy and secure management of the Affairs of Reformed Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
                  <p>I shall onely name that passage to the <hi>Sardian</hi> Church, <hi>Remember how thou hast received, and heard, and hold fast,</hi> &amp;c. The Verse runs
<pb facs="tcp:94112:5"/>
out into a dreadfull Commination of heavy Judgements to the Angel of the Church of <hi>Sardis</hi> for his loose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and slipperinesse in those points of Apostolick Doctrine which the Reformers had recovered into the knowledge of so great a part of the world. And amongst the things that they had <hi>heard,</hi> that voice of the Angel, <hi>Apoc. 18. Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins,</hi> &amp;c. was not the least articulate. Whereby the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was openly decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be that <hi>Babylong the Great, the Mother of Fornications and the Abominations of the Earth;</hi> as also the Pope with his Clergie to be that notorious Antichrist.</p>
                  <p>This the <hi>Sardian</hi> Church had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from their Evangelicall
<pb facs="tcp:94112:5"/>
Predecessours. And it had been their everlasting establishment ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to have for got it, never to have let it die, or smothered it. But what mischief the halting betwixt two Opinions is apt to doe, and the not taking notice how sacred a thing the Protestant Religion is in the sight of God, and how rejectane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous that of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> I believe neither your Lordship nor any one else that has his eyes opened either into History or the Affairs of the world can be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of, or, if he be a good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, make the observation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out regrett and sorrow.</p>
                  <p>But the Prospect of what is to come is more pleasing and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable; which is the state of the Church of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> into
<pb facs="tcp:94112:6"/>
which the <hi>Sardian</hi> Church, that is to say, Reformed Christendome or the Protestant Churches, are to passe, as being the next succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Intervall. Which therefore cannot but be a Note of main im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance for all Reformed States and Kingdomes to stear their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs by, namely, to bend their course thitherward whither they are pointed to by the Finger of God himself in his Holy Oracles. For they sail as it were with winde and tide whose carriage of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs approaches the nearest to the purpose of Divine Fate. Which is lively pourtray'd all along in this stupendious Book of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies written by S. <hi>John.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The most pleasing and enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishing part whereof is that which
<pb facs="tcp:94112:6"/>
is typify'd or prefigured by the Church of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> the Church of <hi>Brotherly love.</hi> Which is the next Scene Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence has designed to introduce. And which all those do most grosly oppose who for difference in matters not revealed in holy Scripture, nor necessary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, think they have pretense e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough with all unchristian keen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and bitternesse of spirit to reproach and inveigh one against another, to nourish the highest Animosities, and to watch all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of persecuting, rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and trampling one another into the Dirt.</p>
                  <p>As this is extremely unchristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an in it self, so is it also diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trically opposite to that Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:94112:7"/>
that God intends to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce into his Church as the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Blessing he has in store for her, and is as it were knocking at the door to enter, if the lovd noise of hot and quarrelsome Brawls about matters of smaller moment (as indeed all things are exceeding small, unlesse of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolicall Institution, if they stand in competition with that Royal Law of Love,) did not drown the voice thereof, that it cannot so easily be heard.</p>
                  <p>But assuredly, my Lord, the letting this <hi>Philadelphian</hi> Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation in, or the approaching as near unto it as we can, will prove the most effectuall healing and consolidating the Interest of Reformed Christendome, as well
<pb facs="tcp:94112:7"/>
in the whole as in the parts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as we can desire or expect. Which therefore I humbly conceive, that all persons the more Power they are intrusted with in any of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Dominions, are the more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to consider by how much more they are obliged to endeavour to promote the Interest of their Prince and Countrey whose Affairs they administer. And therefore the right understanding of the Vision of the Seven Churches so mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly giving this aim for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperous steering of Affairs, I thought this my <hi>Exposition of the said Churches</hi> no unsutable Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in these Circumstances to be made unto your Lordship. Of the Usefulnesse whereof I having spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken more particularly in my Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,
<pb facs="tcp:94112:8"/>
I leave the whole to your Lordship's judicious and favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable perusall, and wishing you all good Successe in the great Charge his Majesty has intrusted you with, I cease to give you any farther trouble then in subscribing my self,</p>

And therefore thou maist be sure I did not deem the <hi>Propheticall Exposition</hi> of these Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Epistles to the Seven Churches in <hi>Asia</hi> to be such, but rather that there was no such Exposition that belonged unto them, and therefore rested in the <hi>Literal</hi> sense, and an usefull <hi>Moral</hi> Application of them as they might sute any particular Church in any Age of the world placed in like Circumstances with any of these Seven Churches. And these things methought were so obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that it would have been a need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse labour to have attempted any thing in so facil a matter, where others have done sufficiently well before.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But having sent the above-said <hi>Dialogues</hi> to a Gentleman in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, to whom they were not unaccep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, as being curious of Subjects of this nature; after his civil acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgements for my sending him the Book, and some pertinent Reflexions on the main matter, at last he falls up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this business of the <hi>Seven Churches
<pb facs="tcp:94112:9"/>
in these words:</hi> I find not, <hi>saith he,</hi> any late Writer apply the Seven Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches mystically, Revel. 2. and 3. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; Mr. <hi>BRIGHTMAN</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving failed in his Application. But I suppose the farther enquiry into that point may be worth your pains. I shall now onely hint, that the Seven Churches may represent the State of the whole visible Church from <hi>Christ</hi>'s time to the Day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: <hi>viz. Ephesus,</hi> till <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 110; <hi>Smyrna,</hi> till 306; <hi>Pergamus,</hi> declining towards Popery, till the <hi>WALDENSIAN</hi> Separation, about <hi>Anno</hi> 1160; <hi>Thyatira,</hi> emerging from Popery, till the Pacification at <hi>Passaw</hi> in <hi>Germany</hi> 1552. and King <hi>ED<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WARD</hi> the Sixth's Reformation in <hi>England; Sardis,</hi> the state of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Christendome, (the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God,) since whole Nations fell from <hi>Rome,</hi> and untill <hi>Rome</hi> shall be totally subdued; <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> when Truth, Peace and Holinesse shall universally prevail, and the name of the <hi>New Jerusalem</hi> shall be

written upon the Church, as is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly promised Chap. 3. 12. Interims too august for such a poor Church as that was literally taken. And this may be a Key for all the rest. And lastly, <hi>Laodicea,</hi> when towards the end of the Thousand years <hi>Satan</hi> shall be again let loose a little space, and <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> shall trouble the Church, then luke-warm as in the days of <hi>Noah.

                     <hi>And this, Reader, was the Occasion of my undertaking, and the advantage I had for the more easily performing this Task of expounding these</hi> Seven Epistles <hi>to the</hi> Seven Churches. <hi>For the</hi> Intervalls <hi>here suggested, though they are most-what different from what up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on due deliberation with my self I thought fittest to pitch upon, yet it is manifest that they could not but give aim toward a more speedy hitting the intended Mark, and a more quick dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch of this</hi> Exposition <hi>which I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent thee with.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:94112:10"/>
                     <hi>Indeed, upon my endeavouring to frame out the same, and my searching into Commentatours, I found that</hi> P. Galatinus <hi>interprets these Seven Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of seven</hi> Intervalls <hi>of the Church from the beginning to the end thereof. This</hi> Cornelius à Lapide <hi>notes, but not a word of the</hi> Limits <hi>of these</hi> Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valls. <hi>And since my compleating this</hi> Exposition, <hi>a learned Friend of mine shew'd me a passage in Mr.</hi> Mede, <hi>Lib.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 10. <hi>where he argues for a</hi> mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call <hi>sense of these Seven Churches, and seems to insinuate that they should</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetically sample unto us a seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold successive Temper and Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the whole visible Church, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the severall Ages thereof, answering to the Pattern of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Churches here, and that <hi>à prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipio ad finem,</hi> and takes notice of the fitly placing of PHILADEL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PHIA partly about the time the Beast is falling, and partly after his Destruction, <hi>accordingly as we had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready set down in our</hi> Exposition. <hi>But the bounds of these</hi> successive Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valls
<pb facs="tcp:94112:11"/>
he has not attempted to define. That Advantage therefore I had onely from the party I above mentioned, as well as the first Invitation to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take this present Design.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But now as to the <hi>Solidity</hi> of the <hi>Performance,</hi> although I must confess the clearnesse of the matter appeared so great to me at last, as that it infinitely exceeded my first expectations of it, and proved satisfactory to my self beyond what I thought possible; yet I will not here pre-ingage thy judgement or belief, but freely remit thee to the <hi>Exposition</hi> it self, the <hi>Preparations</hi> to it in the first and second Chapters, and the brief <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capitulation</hi> of the strength of it in the last. Onely, that thou maist have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to stumble at, I will endeavour to prevent thee in some Exceptions, the greatest I am aware of, and yet in my own judgement not considerable.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. As first, I would not have thee, according to the manner of some, let thy minde dwell upon any thing that may seem less strong alone. As that <hi>Chap. 2. Sect. 11.</hi> where I intimate,
<pb facs="tcp:94112:11"/>
that because, in the <note n="*" place="margin">Apoc. 1. 20.</note> interpreting the Seven golden Candlesticks, they are not apply'd <hi>nominatim</hi> to the seven parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Churches in <hi>Asia</hi> that are said to be writ to, it is an Invitation to the thinking of a more released sense, and that some other seven Churches in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kinde of meaning (as well as they, if not rather then they,) may be aimed at; this ought to be no prejudice to the other Arguments in the same Chapter that are so cogent, but rather those other to afford strength to this, which is added as an easy Probability, not a convictive Demonstration, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is not considerable but in conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with the rest, as is intimated in the very place. And I will onely adde here, That if there were no other sense then the <hi>Literal</hi> to be look'd after, that in all likelihood, for sureness to keep men from Errour, and from doing wrong to any Church by a false Interpretation, the Spirit of God would have expresly said, that the seven Candlesticks were the seven Churches of <hi>Asia</hi> that were there writ to, and that the seven Stars
<pb facs="tcp:94112:12"/>
were the seven Bishops of those very Churches.</p>
                  <p>I must confess, in my own judgement, I think there is some such thing hinted at as I have declared, which made me not omit it. But I am also as sensible that it can signifie little to those that are averse, and are given to cavill, who are prone to dwell on what seems weak, that they may ease their minds of what is more strong and stringent. Which is a fault that is punishment e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to him that commits it, he usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally losing Truth by thus indulging to his own ill humour.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. I know not whether thou mayst mistake me also in the Allusion I mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Ephesus</hi> to <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p n="6">6. Thirdly, It may haply be objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted against our interpreting the Ten days of Affliction predicted to the Church in <hi>Smyrna,</hi> of the Ten famous Persecutions, that some reckon more then ten, adding an eleventh under <hi>Constantius</hi> the <hi>Arian,</hi> a twelfth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Julian</hi> the <hi>Apostate,</hi> and a thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth under the <hi>Arian</hi> Emperour <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lens.</hi> But <hi>Prophecy</hi> being an <hi>antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patorie History,</hi> it is sufficient that it speak according to the usual lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of Historians, whose reports run up on these Ten so famously and distinctly taken notice of. And there are no more then ten in the <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall</hi> we set for the Church of <hi>Smyrna.</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:94112:13"/>
After which conspicuously comes in the Scene of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> Christianity ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving got the conquest over the old perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting Paganism. And <hi>Julian</hi> reigned not two years, and his Attempts were most-what of another kinde, and none considerable so as to break this number. Besides that it happened in an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall notoriously of another nature and denomination, and therefore is not to be taken notice of, it bearing no propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at all to the contrary Affairs of that Period.</p>
                  <p>Indeed the <hi>Arrian</hi> Persecutions are very considerable, but they are of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nature from these Ten. The Church being <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> became <hi>proud,</hi> as well as <hi>exalted</hi> out of the dust, and <hi>contentious,</hi> as well as <hi>proud,</hi> according to that of the wise man, <hi>Prov. 13. 10. Onely by pride cometh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, but with the well-advised is wisedome. Christ</hi> was therefore faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in his promise to the Church in <hi>Smyrna,</hi> and procured them the <hi>Crown of life,</hi> and Safety from the Pagan Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty and Persecution. But that the
<pb facs="tcp:94112:13"/>
Church afterwards in <hi>Pergamus</hi> fell out amongst themselves, was their own fault, none of his, that taught them expresly, That <hi>by this shall all men know ye are my Disciples, if ye love</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">John 13, 35.</note> 
                     <hi>one another.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. Fourthly, It may perhaps seem hard to thee, that I interpret the eating of things offered to Idols of communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in <note place="margin">Apoc. 2. 14, 20.</note> their Idolatrous Masse. For how can that consecrated Bread be said to be offered to an Idol?</p>
                  <p>It is true, he that they pretend to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it to is no Idol, but the true God. But by their Idolatrous practices, communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating Divine Worship to what is not God, they debase the nature of the true God so far, as that they seem to lose the true Notion of him, and in stead of him to worship an Idol of their own brain.</p>
                  <p>For the true God is not so mean a Being that any others can partake in his Worship. And therefore, according to the cutting and searching strain of the Prophetick style, those that mingle Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry
<pb facs="tcp:94112:14"/>
with the Worship of the true God are represented as having no true Knowledge of him; and therefore what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever religious Worship they doe, they being devoid of the knowledge of the true God, they must necessarily be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to doe it to some Idol. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to which sense is that of <hi>Amos, O ye house of Israel, have ye offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <note place="margin">Chap. 5. 25.</note> to me victimes and sacrifices by the space of forty years in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse? yea, ye took up the taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle of Moloch,</hi> &amp;c. Where the true God, by reason of their Idolatry in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping other Objects, denies they at any time worshipped him, though questionless they thought they did offer Victimes and Sacrifices unto him. This is express and direct to the Scruple propounded.</p>
                  <p>But in our <hi>Exposition</hi> it is onely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuated, that there is a Propheticall <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rism,</hi> or a <hi>Synecdoche,</hi> whereby Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry in the general is signify'd by that particular <hi>species</hi> thereof, <hi>the eating things offered unto Idols.</hi> Which is used here with the greater fitness and elegan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, because that the Idolatry is committed
<pb facs="tcp:94112:14"/>
in that part of their Religion that is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in the eating of what is conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated. And if we do but consider that the Lord's Supper is a Feast upon a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, according to that of S. <hi>Paul, Christ our Passeover is sacrificed for <note place="margin">1 Cor. 5. 7.</note> us; therefore let us keep the Feast,</hi> (which Notion is made out with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant evidence by a late learned and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious <note place="margin">See Dr. <hi>Cudworth</hi>'s Discourse of the Lord's Supper.</note> Writer on that Subject,) we once supposing the eating of this Sacrifice con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taminated with Idolatry, what can be a more natural and apposite reproach to it, then to parallel it to the Feasts upon the Pagan <hi>Idolothyta,</hi> the eating of things offered unto Idols? Wherefore there is not the least harshnesse imaginable in this Interpretation.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Fifthly, That it may be no preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to thy judgement touching the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of <hi>Antipas,</hi> and its signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying as much as <hi>one against the Pope,</hi> because that learned and reverend Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positour Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> has styled it a wanton and vain phancy in Mr. <hi>Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> who presumed so to interpret it, thou art to consider, that this Censure
<pb facs="tcp:94112:15"/>
of that Passage was not so much built upon any weakness in the Passage it self, as that it was found in a <hi>farrago</hi> of Conceits that were not so well mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged as to support and countenance one another. And therefore for the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Mr. <hi>Brightman</hi>'s Exposition of these Seven Epistles being not so convictive, that judicious Doctour was the more bold to speak so slightly of this passage thereof. Which if it had been accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with other parts of his Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of these Epistles that had had the like unexceptionablenesse, it would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have been found fault with by so judicious a Writer, as indeed there is no reason it should.</p>

So that so plain a Passage would have stood out very coursly and harshly above the rest of that smooth and delicate Contexture of these Visions, and occasioned a too<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>early intelligence of the meaning of these Prophecies. Besides that <hi>Antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pas</hi> is no proper name of any man, and that the very literal Story requires it should be <hi>Antipas.</hi> Wherefore the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication both for sense and for sound in this word <hi>Antipas</hi> is as exquisite as, considering the nature of the <hi>Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyptick</hi> style, it either could or ought to have been.

                  <p n="9">9. Nor needest thou scruple at my applying that Passage of the Martyr <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipas</hi> to the <hi>Albigenses</hi> and <hi>Walden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:94112:16"/>
that were slain in the field, as if they were not rightly termed Martyrs. For he that can save his Life by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing the Truth, and yet parts with it, (though it be in the field,) is right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deemed a Martyr. Which was the case of these men. And that is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for this purpose which Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> takes notice of, That when <hi>Simon,</hi> Earl of <hi>Monfort,</hi> had routed them, and made a great slaughter of them, and that the Bishop of <hi>Tolouse</hi> there present took thereupon the opportunity of exhorting them to return to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church, they seeing so plainly that the wrath of God was kindled against them for their Separation from the Church; they answered in plain terms, that they were the people of God over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by the Beast, <hi>(Apoc. 13. 7.)</hi> and knowing this to be their fate, yet would not flinch from the Truth: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Army returning upon them, they had all their throats cut in the field. Whence it is manifest that they were <hi>Martyrs</hi> properly so called, according to our Definition thereof: As there were
<pb facs="tcp:94112:16"/>
also severall <hi>Antipas</hi>'s in this <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall</hi> that suffered Martyrdome in that way that thou canst not except against, that is to say, such as were merely pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive, and made no resistence. Some of them are named by Mr. <hi>Brightman,</hi> who if he had done as well on the other five Churches as he has on this of <hi>Pergamus</hi> and that of <hi>Thyatira,</hi> his Exposition of the Seven Churches had been conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. And lastly, to arm thee against the authority of the above-named Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable person touching the reason of the name of <hi>Thyatira,</hi> as if it were as much as <hi>Thygatira,</hi> a <hi>young Daughter;</hi> for which he perstringes Mr. <hi>Brightman,</hi> condemning the Conceit for a mere groundless Phancy; I say, it is not evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that he so much reprehends him for the Notation of the word, as for the application of it to such a sense as he there expresses: which is much different from that sense we have proposed, and far more dilute.</p>

13. And certainly our <hi>Exposition</hi> of these seven Epistles to the seven Churches has an equal <hi>Usefulnesse</hi> with any other Exposition of the <hi>Apocalyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi> Visions, and the more considerable, in that it is a more compendious compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of the main drift of them all.</p>
                  <p>First then, it serves for the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our faith in the particular Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence and Watchfulnesse of <hi>Christ</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his Church, it being so manifest from this <hi>Exposition</hi> with what care and steddiness he hath carried on things hitherto in the first five <hi>Intervalls,</hi> and that they have been no otherwise then He himself has predicted in these Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall Epistles.</p>
                  <p>But then again, in the second place, here is an ample and timely Testimony in the behalf of the Protestants, I mean such as have declared against and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken the Communion of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> from the time of the <hi>Waldenses</hi> to the first Reformers usually so called; the <hi>Waldenses</hi> being acknowledged the <hi>faithfull Martyrs</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and those other that lived within the <hi>Intervall</hi> of
<pb facs="tcp:94112:22"/>
the Church in <hi>Thyatira</hi> carrying away no lesse <hi>Encomium,</hi> as being thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed in the Epistle to that Church; <hi>I know thy works, and charity, and service, and faith, and thy patience, <note place="margin">Apoc. 2. 19.</note> and thy works, and the last to be more then the first.</hi> So that they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved themselves more and more, even till they broke out at last into a Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Reformation. And shall not our first Reformers then be thought worthy of having the Vision of the Rising of the Witnesses applied to them, who have so <note place="margin">Apoc. 11. 11, 12.</note> ample a testimony from <hi>Christ</hi> himself, whom the Father has constituted the Judge of the whole World? And shall not they rightly be said to have ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into Heaven in a <hi>Politicall</hi> sense, to whom was made good that Promise to the Church in <hi>Thyatira, To him <note place="margin">Apoc. 2. 26.</note> that overcomes will I give power over the Nations,</hi> &amp;c? This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of the Church in <hi>Thyatira</hi> does farther ratifie what we have <note n="*" place="margin">Synops. Prophet. Book <hi>2.</hi> C. <hi>22.</hi> sect. <hi>12.</hi>
                     </note> elsewhere delivered touching the Rising of the <hi>Witnesses,</hi> that the Completion of that <hi>Prophecy</hi> was in that wonderfull Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
<pb facs="tcp:94112:23"/>
God unexpectedly brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout by <hi>Luther</hi> and others.</p>
                  <p>Whence it will follow, that the sound of the sixth Trumpet is over, and that the Forty two months, the One thousand two hundred and sixty days, or the Time and Times and Half a time, are expired as to the fulfilling of Prophecy; and consequently, that it is in vain for any to compute any Futurities upon the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posall of their Expiration to come; and that those that doe so will finde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves confuted by the unsutablenesse of Events, and thereby expose the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of interpreting Prophecies to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and scorn, and weaken mens be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief even of those Expositions that are true, and give great advantage to the common Adversary.</p>
                  <p>But as it is most true in it self, so it is most for the Interest of Reformed Christendome, to take notice, that the Protestant Reformation is the fulfilling of the Vision of the Rising of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, and of their Ascending into Heaven; that men may have that va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue for the Reformation that is due
<pb facs="tcp:94112:23"/>
thereto, (it having thereby so plain a Ratification from Divine Testimony of the rightfulnesse thereof against the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannies and Idolatries of the Church of <hi>Rome,)</hi> and that both Magistrate and People may every-where be the better so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered together upon this consideration, and that all Sects that keep the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation may have the better esteem for one another, and not vilifie and hate one another in such sort as usually they do, but be in a readinesse for Christian Unity and Love. For it is this Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of Spirit that must give <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ</hi> that most deadly Blow that is to come, and not a flaming Sword out of the mouth of the Rider of the white Horse literally understood, or large streams of fire spouted out of Heaven upon him, or any such miraculous as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence, as some ignorantly expect at the finishing of the <hi>1260</hi> days. Which groundlesse Supposition is fit for nothing but to engender vain Heats and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous Conceits, to which no answer will be given but Shame and Frustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:94112:24"/>
But the plain Truth understood as it is, naturally tends to the begetting in all Reformed Christendome a mutuall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem of one another, and the suppressing that vain Presumption in Parties, as if they were the sole people that the Vision of the Witnesses belonged to, and so ought to expect marvellous things for themselves conjoined with the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or suppression of all the rest that are not of their own Party. Which fond, or rather unchristian, Conceits are quite expunged by the true and faithfull Interpretation I have pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished to the world of the Rising of the Witnesses; which puts them in a way rather of duly prizing one another, and of jointly endeavouring in the spirit of Sobriety to advance the common Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest of whole Reformed Christendome, then for any one Party so vainly to presume of themselves above all the rest.</p>
                  <p>And finally, this groundlesse expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of any such wonderfull events upon the expiration of the <hi>1260</hi> days being thus wiped away, that time as to any fulfilling of Prophecies being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
<pb facs="tcp:94112:24"/>
expired, and no set time being defined for the future, but onely the order of things in the Vision of the Vials, it is left for the Protestants to compute the approach of the final Ruine of Antichrist and the blessed <hi>Millennium</hi> according to their own progresse in the Mysterie of real Regeneration and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensable Duties of Christianity. By how much more holy, by how much more harmlesse, by how much more humble, by how much more Heavenly-affected they finde one another, by how much more discreet, by how much more faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and obedient to the publick Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, by how much more kinde and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to one another, and by how much more seriously affected for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing the publick good and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring the common welfare of all mankind, (which will introduce the <hi>Philadelphian</hi> Intervall,) by so much more near they may reckon the approach of the downfall of Antichrist, and the glorious Reign of <hi>Christ</hi> in his Saints at the happy <hi>Millennium.</hi> But what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Indications there be besides these
<pb facs="tcp:94112:25"/>
in the Visions of the Prophets, whereby we may compute the nearnesse of those Times, I must ingenuously confesse I know not. But this was a sudden Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursion. We will return again into the way.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. But thirdly, In that it is said, <hi>Notwithstanding, I have a few things <note place="margin">Apoc. 2. 20.</note> against thee, because thou sufferest that Woman Jezebel, which calleth her self a Prophetesse, to teach and seduce my servants to commit For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, and to eat things sacrificed unto Idols,</hi> &amp;c. this is a perfect clearing of the <hi>Protestant Reformers</hi> from that hainous Crime of <hi>Schism</hi> that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> so magiste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially lays to their charge, it plainly implying that their Separation from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was not onely no Fault, but a Vertue, and an indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable point of Obedience to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>Christ,</hi> and that it had been Disobedience and Rebellion against <hi>Christ</hi> not to have separated, and therefore was impossible to be any Schism. Which is a thing worthy
<pb facs="tcp:94112:25"/>
of our notice and consideration.</p>
                  <p>As is also this, (contrary to the opinion of some, otherwise learned,) That to depart from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> upon the <hi>very account of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry</hi> is not <hi>Schism before God,</hi> but onely in the sight of men, and those, it is to be feared, of none of the purest minds, but rather such as have a greater sense of the carnal Interest of the Church then of the Glory of God, and the purity of his Worship. For <hi>Christ,</hi> who is <hi>God blessed for ever,</hi> does here blame the Church in <hi>Thyatira,</hi> that she suffers the Woman <hi>Jezebel</hi> any longer, and does not cast her off, (as the Eunuchs cast her out of the window in the Type,) and that for this very cause, because she is a <hi>Teacher of Idolatry,</hi> and <hi>an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bettour and Countenancer of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Fornication;</hi> as is manifest in the Text. So that <hi>before God,</hi> or in the <hi>sight of God,</hi> both the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> stands guilty of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and also the Protestants leaving her Communion upon <hi>that account</hi> are
<pb facs="tcp:94112:26"/>
acquitted from any the least taint or suspicion of Schism. And that the Spirit of God does but witnesse with our spirits in the truth of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, if thou hast not lost the free use of thy Reason, that brief <hi>Treatise of Idolatry</hi> added to this present <hi>Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition</hi> will, I hope, abundantly satisfie thee: which therefore I have adjoined as a sutable Appendage thereunto.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. Fourthly, In that Reformed Christendom (especially after their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missnesse in Life and Manners, and Contentionsnesse about Trifles,) is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented (under the Type of the Church in <hi>Sardis)</hi> to be in such an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Condition, though emerged out of the grossnesse of the Popish Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, (for there is no farther complaint of either the Doctrine of <hi>Balaam</hi> or of <hi>Jezebel</hi> here,) this should teach us to be humble, and not over-fierce and confident in our Opinions and Doctrines, but meekly to bear one with another, and be ready to be instructed by one another for the clearing up the Truth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:94112:26"/>
But in the mean time things being no better then they are, sith they are no worse then they were predicted, we are hence to learn, that it is our Duty never to suffer our mindes to relapse towards the Flesh-pots of <hi>AE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> or think we had as good goe back again to <hi>Rome,</hi> as to be no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then we are. For this <hi>Sardian</hi> state is like the wandring in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse betwixt <hi>AEgypt</hi> and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised Land, which is the <hi>Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phian</hi> state, into which there is no entrance till after the seven Vials, that is, till the last of them be poured out, or at least a-pouring. As it is said in the fifteenth of the <hi>Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypse; And the Temple was filled with smoak from the glory of God, and from his power; and no man was able to enter into the Temple till the seven plagues of the seven Angels were fulfilled.</hi> Where <hi>no man,</hi> according to the <hi>Apocalyptick</hi> style, signifies, that that company of men that were to enter into, and make up, that state of the Church which
<pb facs="tcp:94112:27"/>
is here styled <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>the living Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God,</hi> would not appear in that eminent condition till after the Vials, the last either current or complete. Which agrees admirably with that pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage in the Epistle to <hi>Philadelphia, Him that overcometh will I make a <note place="margin">Apoc. 3. 12.</note> Pillar in the Temple of my God.</hi> So that these <hi>Philadelphians</hi> shall not onely enter into the Temple after the smoak of the Vials, but <hi>never goe out of it again,</hi> according to the sense we have explained it in.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore because we are in a kinde of Wildernesse-condition, we ought with Faith and Meeknesse and Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to abide till God shall bring us into that good Land, and not to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur against him, and reproach his Providence, who hath thought fit to carry on things with such leisure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly steps, nor peevishly and falsly to say that we had as good return to <hi>Rome</hi> again, and that it is a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion whether the Reformation has done more good or hurt. For such thoughts or speeches are false, injudicious,
<pb facs="tcp:94112:27"/>
and ingratefull Reproaches against the sacred Providence of God, whose ways these bitter, shallow and unsanctify'd spirits understand not, because the spirit of the world has blinded their eyes.</p>
                  <p>And forasmuch as there is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of Idolatry in the Epistle to this <hi>Sardian</hi> Church, nor the least hint to make any Separation, as before, all the Churches of Reformed Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and all the particular Sects and Members thereof, ought to have a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der regard how they divide from one another or break Communion for dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of Ceremony or Opinion; but holding all the indispensable Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and bearing joint Testimony a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the grosse Idolatries and wilde Enormities of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to study Peace and mutuall Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, that the Body of <hi>Reformed Christendome</hi> may be more strong and compact to stand against the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Enemie.</p>
                  <p>But above all, we are with might and main to endeavour to perfect Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse
<pb facs="tcp:94112:28"/>
in the fear of God, and to purge our selves from all pollution of flesh and spirit, that we may prevent the extremity of that Judgement which is threatned as suddenly and unexpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly to come upon the Church of <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis.</hi> And these, I think, are main <note place="margin">Apoc. 3. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>Usefulnesses</hi> discoverable in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of the Epistle to the <hi>Sardian</hi> Church.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. And fifthly, As for the Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of the Church of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> it is of main Importance for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the world good. For it is the ordinary excuse for the reigning of Impiety and Immorality in the world, that men will be men as long as the world lasts, and that things are more likely ever to grow worse and worse then better: and therefore very few there are that will either attempt the amending of their own Lives, or the encouraging others so to doe. When notwithstanding it is plain, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Propheticall sense of the Epistle to the Church of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> that there will be a time when <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:94112:28"/>
and <hi>true Holinesse</hi> will have a most glorious reign upon earth.</p>
                  <p>But those that are averse from this belief are usually averse also from believing any certitude in the Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Prophecies. They will not, forsooth, be so presumptuous as to pretend they can understand them, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially such as either chastise the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ominable Wickednesses of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, or such as promise Times transcendently better. Which is a piece of Hypocrisie much like that of <hi>Ahaz,</hi> when the Prophet bid him ask a Sign of the Lord his God; but he, good modest Hypocrite, <hi>would not ask a Sign, neither would he tempt the <note place="margin">Isa. 7. 12.</note> Lord.</hi> The meaning whereof was, that he would not amuze nor distract his thoughts, nor render himself more obnoxious by taking notice of a <hi>su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural</hi> Evidence against the <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> Sentiments and persuasions of his own <hi>carnal</hi> minde, under whose Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment he was resolved to be, and not be dissettled by the Inlets of any
<pb facs="tcp:94112:29"/>
higher Light. The application is very easie and obvious.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. And lastly, Admitting the Propheticall meaning of the Epistle to the Church of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> it is of great use for the establishing our Faith in that grand Point, <hi>That this Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restriall Scene will have an end, and that at the close of all</hi> Christ <hi>will visibly come in Judgement to reward all men according to their works;</hi> That he will judge both the quick and the dead according to the Orthodox sense of the Apostolick Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
                  <p>To all which we may adde, that as the Expositions of these Seven E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles to the Seven Churches in <hi>Asia</hi> are in a manner as convincing as any other Visions in the whole <hi>Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypse,</hi> so they are far more easie, and reach the main Design in a lesse compasse of words, and have not that operosenesse of <hi>Synchronisms</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily hanging on them as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have for the clearing of the sense; but are onely seven Intervalls
<pb facs="tcp:94112:29"/>
manifestly succeeding one another, whose Bounds so far as things are past are easily determinable. And we know that the Intervall of <hi>Sardis</hi> ends where that of <hi>Philadelphia</hi> begins, and <hi>Laodicea</hi> is the close of all. Which <hi>Facility</hi> and <hi>Comprehensible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi> must needs improve the <hi>Useful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi> of these <hi>Expositions</hi> very consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably.</p>
                  <p>And there wanting nothing but the Significations of the <hi>Names</hi> to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for the easie Applicability of the Events to each Intervall, I will, for the satisfaction of the Reader, brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly furnish them that have no skill in the original Languages with the sense and meaning of the <hi>Names</hi> of all the Seven Churches aforehand.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. <hi>Ephesus</hi> therefore, with an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion to the Greek word <hi>Ephesis,</hi> signifies <hi>Desire,</hi> the first moving Principle that drives on an Activity for the attaining the main Scope we aim at. But with an Allusion to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesis,</hi> it signisies <hi>Remissnesse,</hi> for which this Church of <hi>Ephesus</hi> is <note place="margin">Apoc. 2. 4.</note>
                     <pb facs="tcp:94112:30"/>
blamed: or else, alluding again to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesis,</hi> it signifies the <hi>starting or letting loose the Racers at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Race.</hi> Which agrees very fitly with this <hi>Ephesine</hi> Intervall, which is the beginning of the Church, and of the whole course of Providence concerning the same to the end of the world.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Smyrna</hi> signifies <hi>Myrrh,</hi> intimating the bitter Affliction of the Primitive Church under the Ten Pagan Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pergamus</hi> signifies <hi>Sublimity</hi> or <hi>Exaltation,</hi> intimating the raising of the Church out of her former dejected and afflicted condition under the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid Persecutions into a glorious Triumph over Paganism; as it fell out upon the Conquest of <hi>Constantine</hi> the great. It signifies also, or prefigures, the enormous <hi>Haughtinesse</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in that Intervall.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thyatira,</hi> in Allusion to <hi>Thygatira</hi> a <hi>Daughter,</hi> intimates the more-then-ordinary <hi>Womanishness</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in that Intervall: But in
<pb facs="tcp:94112:30"/>
Allusion to <hi>Thyateria, Altars of Incense or sweet Odours,</hi> it signifies the more-then-ordinary frequentness of burning the <hi>blessed Protestant Martyrs</hi> with fire and faggot in this Period. Which Cruelty though it was abominable in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of that bloudy and barbarous Church that committed it; yet the suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of those holy Martyrs in this manner out of Fidelity to <hi>Christ</hi> and his Truth was a Sacrifice of sweet O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours to him, and very gratefully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sardis,</hi> in Allusion to <hi>Sarda</hi> or <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pis Sardius,</hi> (the same that <hi>Carna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina,)</hi> signifies the <hi>imperfect</hi> and <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> Condition of that Intervall of the Reformed Church that is called <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> which signifies <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> in general, and particularly a more <hi>special love to them of the true Houshold of Faith,</hi> intimates the <hi>Reign of the Spirit,</hi> which is the <hi>Spirit of Love. For God is <note place="margin">1 John 4. 16.</note> Love, and he that abideth in Love abideth in God, and God in him.</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:94112:31"/>
This is that illustrious Reign of <hi>Christ</hi> in his <hi>Millenniall</hi> Empire of Love, when the Christian life shall take place, and <hi>Opinions</hi> and <hi>Persecutions</hi> shall be done away.</p>
                  <p>And lastly, <hi>Laodicea</hi> signifies a <hi>popular Politicall</hi> or <hi>externally-Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Righteousnesse,</hi> the outward form of the former <hi>Philadelphian</hi> state, but, as in old age, the spirit much decay'd, though the outward figure of the body much-what the same. It sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies also the <hi>arraigning</hi> and <hi>judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the people,</hi> that is, the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the world, when <hi>Christ</hi> shall come to judge both the quick and the dead; because this is to be performed at the close of this <hi>Laodicean</hi> Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. The significancy of the <hi>Names</hi> of these Seven Churches reckoned al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in such an order, as that seven <hi>Intervalls</hi> of the Church, from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to the end of all, answer ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly in the Affairs of the Church both to these <hi>Names</hi> in this <hi>order</hi> they are reckoned, and to the <hi>Conditions</hi> of
<pb facs="tcp:94112:31"/>
the Seven Churches as they are order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly described in the Seven Epistles to them, is a plain Demonstration to them that are not extremely refracto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, (especially if you adde the Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty that there must be a <hi>Propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi> meaning of these Epistles, as is made good in the first and second Chapters of the ensuing Book,) I say, it is a plain Demonstration, that our <hi>Exposition</hi> is <hi>true,</hi> as well as so <hi>ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie</hi> and <hi>comprehensible,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of an <hi>universal Usefulnesse</hi> as well to the <hi>Illiterate</hi> as the <hi>Learned.</hi> Which I hope, Reader, will be a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Excuse for the Authour, that he has either invited thee to the pains of reading, or given himself the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of compiling, this present Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise.

                           <hi>A Preparation toward the</hi> Mysticall <hi>or</hi> Propheticall <hi>Interpretation of the</hi> Seven Epistles <hi>to the</hi> Seven Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches <hi>of</hi> Asia.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E shall first premise, That as those two fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Prophecies of the <hi>Seven Seals,</hi> and of the <hi>opened Book,</hi> reach from the beginning to the end of the Church; so this of the <hi>Seven Churches</hi> reaches also from the beginning of the Church to the end of all. Which
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:94112:34"/>
seems congruous both from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Vision it self, and from the following Examples of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies of the <hi>Seven Seals</hi> and the <hi>opened Book.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We shall premise in the second place, That as it is conspicuous that four of the names of these seven Churches are directly significant of some State and Condition they are in, <hi>viz. Smyrna, Pergamus, Philadelphia</hi> and <hi>Laodicea;</hi> so it is exceeding cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible that the other three names may allude to some thing that may set out their Nature and Condition also, <hi>viz. Ephesus, Thyatira</hi> and <hi>Sardis;</hi> as we shall take more express notice in the process of our Exposition.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, which might as well (if not better) have been noted at first, This more <hi>mysticall</hi> sense, which we are now a-rendring of the Seven Churches, doth not at all clash with the <hi>Literal</hi> sense of the same, nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that usefull Applicability of them for the Reproof or Praise of any Churches particular in any time or
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:94112:34"/>
Age of the Christian world, that are for the like things obnoxious or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable. But the distinct Providence of God, and his watchfulness and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight of the Affairs of his Church, may haply be more illustrated and display'd by this <hi>mystical</hi> way of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position then by that <hi>Literal</hi> or <hi>Moral.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. We will therefore distinguish the whole Duration of the Church of <hi>Christ,</hi> (especially so far forth as it is within the limits of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, which also the other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies in the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> seem chiefly to regard) into Seven Intervalls, and will suppose the first Intervall to end where the second begins, <hi>viz.</hi> in the tenth year of <hi>Nero,</hi> or <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 63.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Which Period therefore of the <hi>Ephesine</hi> Church ending so early, even about thirty years before St. <hi>John's</hi> writing the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> agrees excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently well with that passage Ch. 1. v. 18, 19. where, after <hi>Christ</hi>'s de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring himself <hi>the first</hi> and <hi>the last;</hi> (as before in the same Chapter he is called He that <hi>was,</hi> and <hi>is,</hi> and <hi>is to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94112:35"/>
come)</hi> and his mentioning his own Death and Resurrection, and how that he will be alive to the end of the world to carry on the Affairs of his Church; he presently inferrs, <hi>Write</hi> therefore <hi>what things thou hast seen, what things are,</hi> and <hi>what things shall be hereafter,</hi> (which he expresly and immediately calls the <hi>Mystery</hi> of the seven Stars and the seven golden Candlesticks, <hi>ver.</hi> 20. which is worth the noting.) What things thou <hi>hast seen already,</hi> in the times of thy life past, namely, the state of the <hi>Ephesine</hi> Church: what things <hi>are now present,</hi> viz. the <hi>Smyrnian</hi> state of the Church in which thou <hi>art,</hi> and tastest of the bitterness of it in this thy Exile here in <hi>Patmos</hi> (for the Ten Persecutions were then already begun, and <hi>John</hi> was in the Second of them:) and what things <hi>shall be hereafter,</hi> namely, to the end of the world, in the residue of the period of the <hi>Smyrnian</hi> Church, and in the periods of the Remainder of the Seven Churches succeeding. And questionless the Vision of the

Rider of the <note n="*" place="margin"> Apoc. 6. <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>

                        </note>  
                        <hi>white Horse</hi> respects what <hi>was then past,</hi> namely, <hi>Christ's</hi> first Warfare upon his conquest of Death, and his being mounted into his glorify'd Body; who after from on high sent down Succours to his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles and Disciples, and assisted and and managed that illustrious Battel in the beginning of the Apostolick Times so successfully and gloriously, that infinite numbers of men were brought under the obedience of the Gospel, even within the space of the <hi>Ephesine</hi> Period.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. So that there can be no scruple of the Church of <hi>Ephesus</hi> represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a State of the Church past; but onely that it seems improper to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect an Epistle to a Church then out of being. But this can be no argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with them that hold the Seven Churches to be seven successive Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the Church to the worlds end. For make the <hi>Exitus</hi> of the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesine</hi> Church reach beyond S. <hi>John's</hi> time, suppose to <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 100, or thereabout; the rest of the <hi>Epistles</hi>
                        <pb n="6" facs="tcp:94112:36"/>
will be writ to Churches not yet in being, and some many hundreds, nay thousands of years ere they shall be: which yet they must not count ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The briefest account therefore of this matter is this, That the Spirit of God seems to drive on two main designs in the Vision of these Seven Churches at once. The one, most effectually to animate and encourage the Church to doe well, to stick to Truth and Holiness through all the Trials and Calamities of this present life; as also to deterre them from all kind of Sin and wickedness of what nature soever, whether Apostasie from the Faith, Idolatry, Sensuality, or what-ever Remissness in Manners: For which design this Epistolar way is exceeding accommodate, it bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the form of personally speaking to people, and so the more forcibly makes them take notice, in a manner whether they will or no, of what is said unto them. The other design, and that so laid as not to foregoe the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94112:36"/>
former advantage, is to instruct the Church in the Providence of God and his Foresight, to shew how all things lie bare before his eyes in such order and succession as they are in time to come to pass. In the <hi>Literal</hi> sense of these Epistles to the Seven Churches, that former design is plainly pursued and attained, understanding them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to these Seven Churches in <hi>Asia</hi> then in being; and in a very great measure in the <hi>Moral</hi> sense. These Epistles, I say, being so appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to any part of the Catholick Church in any Age thereof, placed in the same or like circumstances of Condition with these <hi>Asiatick</hi> Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, this Epistolar way will have a considerable efficacy and influence upon them, for either Animation or Reproof.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. But now the great Question is, Why the <hi>Prophetical</hi> design discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in the <hi>mystical</hi> Interpretation should have been couched in this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistolar way, especially the Epistle to <hi>Ephesus,</hi> being writ after the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sine</hi>
                        <pb n="8" facs="tcp:94112:37"/>
Period was expired. To which I answer, that this <hi>Propheticall</hi> design was not intended for the <hi>Ephesine</hi> Church in this <hi>mysticall</hi> sense, but for future Ages; and therefore, it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in onely to make up the entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the whole Succession of the Church in its several distinct states from the beginning to the end of all. But this <hi>Epistolar</hi> way is still retained in this <hi>mysticall</hi> sense, for the same usefulnesse it had in the <hi>Literal</hi> to the Seven Churches in <hi>Asia</hi> then really in being. For so soon as any of these Letters by this <hi>mysticall</hi> sense is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood to be directed to any suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive part of the Church, as now, for example, (as will appear anon) the Epistle to the Church of <hi>Sardis</hi> is directed to the Protestant Church or Reformed Christendome, this Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of the Church ought to be as much concerned, as that particular Church of <hi>Sardis</hi> was in <hi>Asia mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And this intention of the Holy Ghost being once understood, it will
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:94112:37"/>
be of the like usefulness to the <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphian</hi> Church especially, and also to the <hi>Laodicean.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Wherefore the Objections were but small, considering the Usefulness of this Epistolar way, though there were no other sense of these seven E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles and the seven Churches but the <hi>mysticall.</hi> For as in an entire Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, where the beginning is touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing something past or present, all goes under the Title of <hi>Propheticall,</hi> though that part that respects things past is but <hi>Historicall</hi> Representati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: so in this entire Epistolar Vision, though the first part be Epistolar, yet it is but <hi>Historicall Representation,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting times and persons past (as if they were present to be writ to) and that for uniformity sake in the form of an Epistle, as what is past in Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story under the form of <hi>Propheticall</hi> Vision, as the Rider of the <hi>white Horse,</hi> which is the first in the Vision of the Seals; though the Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation was of what was partly past, and partly present. But what is to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94112:38"/>
come is the proper object of all Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion Propheticall.</p>
                     <p>But now besides all this, in the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral</hi> sense there being then a Church in <hi>Ephesus</hi> when that Epistle was wrote to it, and in a <hi>Moral</hi> sense it being applicable to any Church that does <hi>Ephesize</hi> in any part of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and at any time; the Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in my judgment has melted into less then nothing. And therefore, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding this exception, we will not stick to place the end of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval of the <hi>Ephesine</hi> Succession in the tenth of <hi>Nero</hi>'s Reign, and in the year of <hi>Christ</hi> 63.</p>
                     <p>Till then let the Church of <hi>Christ</hi> be represented under the Title of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesus;</hi> from that time, till about three hundred and odd years after <hi>Christ,</hi> under the name of <hi>Smyrna:</hi> from thence, to the latter end of the Persecution of the <hi>Albigenses</hi> and <hi>Waldenses,</hi> let her be the Church dwelling in <hi>Pergamus:</hi> from that time, till whole Nations fell off from the Pope, let the same Church bear
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:94112:38"/>
the name of <hi>Thyatira:</hi> from that time Protestantisme became the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of Nations, till the last Vial, let this Church bear the Title of the Church in <hi>Sardis:</hi> from that time till the fourth Thunder, let it wear the name of <hi>Philadelphia:</hi>

                     <argument>
                        <p>A farther Preparation out of the first Chapter of the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by this <hi>Propheticall</hi> meaning of the Vision of the Seven Churches is more clearly assured.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>BUT in the mean time, for the greater assurance of this <hi>Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall</hi> or <hi>Mysticall</hi> sense, we will first make some farther Remarks upon the first Chapter of the <hi>Apocalypso.</hi> Where we will make onely this one modest Supposition; that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God sets down nothing imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodically nor in vain, or at least no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing vainly immethodicall. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore upon the very first Verse, which bears the Title of the whole Book; <hi>The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew unto</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Apoc. 1. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>his servants things which must shortly come to pass,</hi> that is, things to come to pass; some shortly, and other some in succession of time, as all Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:94112:39"/>
agree; I cannot but note this, That if the Spirit of God do but <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicere Titulum,</hi> (as most certainly he will) he will set down no entire Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, as this of the Seven Churches is, but they must in the main be of things to come to pass, not of things present merely, and not hid, but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to the eyes of men, as the State of the Churches here mentioned was to the world at that time. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore something farther must be meant by them then can be contained in the <hi>Literal</hi> sense; which is not of things <hi>to come,</hi> as the Title requires, but onely of things present, or some Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises or Threatnings that do not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly amount to the nature of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical prediction, no more then the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> to which they are annexed.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the word of this Prophecy, for</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Verse 3.</note> 
                        <hi>the time is at hand.</hi> This again plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shews that this Book is all of it, I mean all the entire Visions thereof, a Book of Prophecies; which, as I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated before, mere Promises and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:94112:40"/>
Threatnings cannot make it no more then they do those Laws of <hi>Moses</hi> to which they are adjoyned. And though the several States of the Seven Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches may be applicable to several states of particular Churches of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Ages in Christendome l yet it cannot properly be in this <hi>Literal</hi> sense by way of Prediction, but of Example of Vertue or Vice, of pious or impious Actions, which repeatedly happen in all History. Whence if there be no more in it then thus, these Epistles to the Seven Churches can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be deemed any Prophecy, and therefore are heterogeneous to the Scope and Title of the Book.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. But upon the so expresly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <note place="margin">Verse 4.</note> this a <hi>Book of Prophecies</hi> for <hi>John</hi> to salute the <hi>Seven Churches</hi> in <hi>Asia</hi> with this Salutation, <hi>Grace be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, and peace, from him which is, and which was, and which is to come;</hi> methinks it does even forcibly drive a man to conceive that the Vision of the Seven Churches which he so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately falls upon, is a Prophecy,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:94112:40"/>
according to the title immediately mentioned in the foregoing Verse. Besides that the description of the party in whose name he salutes them, <hi>which is, and which was, and which is to come,</hi> does very naturally insinuate that he is treating of what reaches from the beginning of the Church to the latest Ages thereof. Which he insists more upon in the seventh Verse; (after he has spoken of the person of <hi>Christ) Behold, he cometh</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Verse 7.</note> 
                        <hi>with the clouds,</hi> (this reaches the last Period of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> when God will judge all people,) <hi>and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him; and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him,</hi> (for the Earth shall then be burnt up with the works thereof:) <hi>Even so, Amen.</hi> This will certainly come to pass about the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Thunder, (in that dark hollow Dungeon, where there shall be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth,) let the sons of Infidelity or Unbelief conceit what they will to the contrary. Wherefore the minde
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:94112:41"/>
and scope of the spirit of Prophecy seems here to be carried out even to the utmost Ages of the world.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. According as he declares in the next Verse, <hi>I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Verse 8.</note> 
                        <hi>Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.</hi> That Wisedome and Power that reaches from one end to another mightily and sweetly orders all things. This methinks strongly insinuates that the Vision of the <hi>Seven Churches</hi> (as well as the Vision of the <hi>Seven Seals</hi> and of the <hi>opened Book)</hi> reaches from the beginning of the Church to the end of all things. Which consideration is so repeated to us, that certainly it must not stand for nought, but is to give infallible aim at a higher mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Seven Churches then we are at first aware of. For the sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary of the Vision, before he descends to the particular Churches, begins and ends with this, v. 11. and 18. <hi>I am the First and the Last, and have the keyes of Hell and of Death.</hi> Which
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:94112:41"/>
undoubtedly respects the execution of the final Sentence under the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Thunder.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. But there is first this <hi>not able</hi> to be observed in the Tenth verse: <hi>I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Verse 10.</note> 
                        <hi>heard behind me a great voice as of a Trumpet.</hi> This pompous entrance with the sound of the Trumpet into this Vision of the <hi>Seven Churches,</hi> and the glorious appearance of the Son of man walking in the midst of the seven golden Candlesticks with se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Stars in his right hand, comes up so near to that splendid Preamble to the Vision of the <hi>Seven Seals,</hi> that any sagacious man cannot but suspect that both the Visions be of like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and importance, and not of such private concern as merely to respect those Seven Churches in <hi>Asia.</hi> For at the beginning of both these Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons there is the glorious appearance of <hi>Christ</hi> in the midst of the Church: in the first, standing or walking in the midst of the seven golden Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlesticks; in the latter, sitting in the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:94112:42"/>
midst of the four Beasts and four and twenty Elders: and both these Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ambles to the future Visions ushered in with the sound of the Trumpet. Wherefore the Pomp being equal, the concern of each Vision in all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood is equal. Nor can it be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that the Pomp before the Vision of the seven Churches was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed as a fair Frontispice to the whole Book of Prophecies, because at least as splendid a Frontispice is again erected before the Vision of the <hi>Seven Seals.</hi> Wherefore that former was entirely intended for the Visions of the Seven Churches, and therefore portends some mighty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Mysterie therein, and such as the present Affairs of those seven particular Churches in <hi>Asia</hi> could not reach nor exhaust. But we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. <hi>Saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last: and what thou</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Verse 11.</note> 
                        <hi>seest write in a book, and send it unto the seven Churches which be in Asia.</hi> Here again, immediately before his
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:94112:42"/>

But the holy Catholick Church endures from the beginning to the end of all. Upon which therefore I cannot doubt but the Spirit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy had his eye at this time, and in the Mystery understood by the seven Churches in <hi>Asia</hi> the holy Catholick Church divided into seven successive Intervalls, according to the opinion of <hi>Petrus Galatinus.</hi> For indeed in all reason, (if there was not some grand Mysterie underneath,) why should onely seven Churches in <hi>Asia</hi> be writ to, when there were others, many others, either there, or at least in other parts of the Empire, in all likelihood as notorious for either the Faults, the Vertues, or the Sufferings that are noted in these?</p>
                     <p n="7">7. You'll say haply, that <hi>Asia mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi> was the special Diocese as it were of S. <hi>John.</hi> But they that answer thus forget that <hi>John</hi> was merely passive

in these Visions, and wrote no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then he was moved by the Holy Ghost, which is no respecter of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. Besides that there were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly other Churches in <hi>Asia</hi> besides these seven. Why therefore just Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? and why these? But that <hi>seven</hi> signifies <hi>Universality,</hi> is obvious in the Prophetick style. Therefore to the seven Churches in <hi>Asia</hi> is as much as to all the Churches in <hi>Asia.</hi> But it's much that all the Churches in <hi>Asia minor</hi> should be thus carefully salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Holy Ghost, and the rest of the Churches in the Christian world be taken no notice of: As if it were according to the Proverb, that kissing goes by favour; whenas yet it is expresly said in the Scripture, that God is <hi>no respecter of persons,</hi> as I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated before.</p>

                     <p>But besides, though I do not love to play with words more then needs must, I think it not hard to finde out an Allusive signification apposite e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in the name of <hi>Asia</hi> to the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall sense intended.

but the Spirit of God would not in this Book of Prophecies, where all things are so comprehensive and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestick, salute onely seven particular Churches of all the Churches of the World, and that with such pompous Circumstances; nor when he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun so magnificently a Book of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies, and so expresly intitled it so, that he would immediately after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, as if he had forgot what he was about, bring in a large Vision consisting of seven parts, wherein there is nothing at all Propheticall, but onely the Reproof or Praises, the Comminations or Promises to a few particular Churches.

But that the Frontispice, as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called it, to this Vision of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Churches, which was the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Character of our blessed Saviour, is made use of by piece-meal for an entrance into the parts of this Vision, as it is in them all; I cannot but take notice how fitly it answers to the Vision of the <hi>Seals,</hi> where the parts of the Frontispice are also made use of to usher in four of the Seals; for the four Beasts one after another (and that with apposite significancy, as here,) at the opening of the four first Seals are introduced uttering this voice, <hi>Come and see.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there being the like contrivance <note place="margin">Apoc. 6.</note> in both Visions, it is a shrewd inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation that they are Visions of like importance, that is, very reachingly and comprehensively Propheticall; as I endeavoured to evince out of the first Chapter.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. And how accommodate that part of the Character of our blessed Saviour is to this part of the Vision that concerns the <hi>Ephesine</hi> Church, is

                        </gap> so that this <hi>Ephesine</hi> Church may have its name from its first intense Love and its after Remission thereof, by this double Allusion. But as the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion to <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> is more perfect then that to <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, so questionless this first Intervall of the Church was more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for their sincere and real Love to <hi>Christ,</hi> then for their Remissnesse therein. Which serves something for the countenancing of the term of this Intervall.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Because thou hast left thy first love:</hi> that is to say, because thou hast
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:94112:51"/>
ceased to be so fervent in spirit as at the first. Which first Love, being according to the measure of <hi>Christ</hi>'s own Prescript, was certainly such as made the <hi>Ephesine</hi> Church love <hi>Christ</hi> more then Father, or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or Wife, or Children, or any worldly Interest whatsoever, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly as he requires. But towards the end of the Intervall of this first Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of the Church this Love and Courage it seems began to abate, and too many began to <hi>Gnosticize,</hi> as it is called, in that point, and think it a small thing to deny the Faith in the time of Persecution, even those that yet professed themselves of the Church, and were Believers. That this was within the Intervall of the <hi>Ephesine</hi> Church (in our sense) se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Reproofs and Exhortations in the Epistles of the Apostles do plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evince. See Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>'s Notes on this Church, which fully reach our design. And the Epistles of <hi>Paul,</hi> and the first of <hi>Peter,</hi> and that to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> were all writ within
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:94112:52"/>
that Intervall we have set for the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesine</hi> Church, and their Faults com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted before. Which Defaults this Vision rebukes and threatens them for, by way of instruction for future Ages, as it is in the following Verse.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. <hi>Remember therefore from whence</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Verse 5.</note> 
                        <hi>thou art fallen, and repent, and doe the first works.</hi> He bids them return to their first Love, which was more strong then death. And it was fit to give this command and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Church, because of greater Trials to come in her <hi>Smyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Condition. For before the Ten Persecutions Martyrdome was more rare.</p>

                        <hi>Or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy Candlestick out of his place, except thou repent.</hi> That is, by an <hi>Hypallage,</hi> I will remove thee from thy Candlestick: which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is directed more especially to the Bishops or Pastours of the Church at that time, as threatning them for falling into such a remiss de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Love themselves, or suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:94112:52"/>
their Charges so to fall. For <hi>the seven Candlesticks are the seven Churches,</hi> Ch. 1. v. 20. and the <hi>seven Stars are the Angels of the seven Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi> that is to say, the Bishops and Pastours of the Church. Wherefore this Commination to them may by an <hi>Hypallage</hi> signifie their being remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the Church by some Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or other, that is, as many of them as were thus carelesse and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse. But to any Members of the Church the removing of the Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick from them may be their amissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Church-membership; as <hi>eripere alicui,</hi> or <hi>adimere alicui Civita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem,</hi> is to make him cease to be a Citizen any longer. Which sense is also competible to the Bishops or Pastours; <hi>Christ</hi> may cut them off <hi>in foro Divino</hi> from being any longer Members of his Church, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently from Salvation. But there is yet another sense which pleaseth me best of all, in which <hi>Victorinus, Andreas, Lyranus</hi> and <hi>Alcazar</hi> do all agree, who interpret the removing
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:94112:53"/>
of the Candlestick out of its place, of the commination of some Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion or Storm that should over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take this Church; not that this Church should be carried quite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, but moved or agitated as in a Storm or Earthquake. This they understand of the <hi>Ephesine</hi> Church in <hi>Asia</hi> literally: which is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that the Interpretation seemed very easie and genuine unto them. And it is as easily applicable to our Mysticall sense. But I would raise the Storm a little higher, and make it sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the storm of that dreadfull Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution that was to befall the Church in the <hi>Smyrnian</hi> Intervall thereof. For it is look'd upon still as the Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church from the beginning to the end, though distinguished into these several Intervalls. And it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable, <hi>that there is in every Epistle to the respective Church some Prediction to be fulfilled in the Intervall of the following Church.</hi> Which I thought fit here to note at once, and shall particularly, as we proceed, take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:94112:53"/>
thereof in their proper places. The sense therefore seems to be this; That unless the Church in this <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sine</hi> Intervall would be raised to an higher pitch of Zeal, and Love, and Activity for the propagating of his Kingdome, <hi>Christ</hi> would excite their Courage, and exercise it with such hot Persecutions <hi>(sanguis Martyrum semen Ecclesiae)</hi> as would be more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual for the bringing to pass his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign. And it sell out accordingly in the Ten Persecutions within the <hi>Smyrni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Period of the Church.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. <hi>But this thou hast, that thou ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test</hi>

                        <hi>the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.</hi> The Church by this time had grown so soft and remisse, that there was not that zealous painful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse as heretofore in several of them, nor that resolved Courage in suffering all things for <hi>Christ</hi>'s sake: yet they were not grown so corrupt and beastly as to be given up to the impurity of the <hi>Nicolaitans,</hi> which in after-times some exercised from a mistake of an indiscreet act of one

                        <hi>Nicolas</hi> a Deacon in these very times of the Apostles. And from him were these beastly fellows called <hi>Nicolai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans.</hi> But little or nothing of this Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity appeared within the Period of this <hi>Ephesine</hi> Church, which yet the Spirit of God foresaw would become detestably frequent and notorious in such Wretches as, though they called themselves Christians, the Apostolick Church would not own. This is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the <hi>Ephesine</hi> Church for their comfort and credit, that they are free from <hi>Nicolaitism:</hi> and that they may adde to their Purity invincible Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and Fortitude, he adds,</p>

                        <hi>To him that overcometh will I give</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>But we had almost forgot the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of the seventh Verse: <hi>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the Churches.</hi> Which being a common <hi>Epiphonema</hi> to all these seven Epistles, repeated in them from the first to the last, certainly must bear no small importance with it. Two things therefore I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive driven at by the affixing this <hi>Epiphonema</hi> to each Epistle. The one, to give us notice, that though there be a Literal sense of these Epistles, yet that they are every one of them also a Parable; which is intimated from this repeated form of speech which <hi>Christ</hi> in his life-time usually added at the end of Parables, <hi>He that has ears to hear, let him hear.</hi> Besides that the very sense of the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piphonema</hi> implies so much; which is, He that has an understanding to reach the depth of the meaning of these Epistles, let him reach it. For
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:94112:55"/>
it is not within the reach of every man's wit to find out the drift of them. The other thing driven at is, to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate to us that there is a meaning lodged under these seven Paraboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Epistles of <hi>exceeding great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> and concernment to the Church. From whence I would inferre, that that Interpretation of them that is of the greatest consequence is the most likely to prove true.

And I tell you it for a pledge unto you of the same Happinesse, if you lay down your lives (as the Times will shortly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it) for me and for my Gospel.

and therefore he will not lie with his tongue; and whose Faith is so strong in me, and hopes so firm of a better life, that he can, if the cause of my Gospel so require, willingly part with this for the Love of me and for the Interest of my Kingdome.

This is according to that <hi>Apoc.</hi> 21. 4. <hi>And there shall be no more death;</hi> that is, there shall be no more Persecution and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling for Conscience sake: Which was the sad case of this <hi>Smyrnian</hi> Church
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:94112:59"/>
under the Pagan Cruelty in an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent manner. Wherefore when they had wone their Freedome, it was a Crown of Life to them, by the Law of Contraries. That this is the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine sense will farther appear from what follows.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. <hi>He that hath an ear to hear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Verse 11.</note> 
                        <hi>the Churches.</hi> This being an usual <hi>Epiphonema</hi> to Parables plainly inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, that what hitherto has been said is a parabolicall Prophecy. And the nature of a Prophecy is, to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell such things as are to be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted here on earth. And therefore where the Promise is not Divine, or concerning the state after this life, the <hi>Epiphonema</hi> follows: as is very conspicuous in the Promise to the Church of <hi>Thyatira,</hi> which is the first example of the <hi>Epiphonema</hi> coming last of all; which is a sign that the whole Epistle there is Propheticall: Verse 26. <hi>And he that overcometh and keepeth my words unto the end, to him will I give power over the Nations,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:94112:60"/>
Which therefore concerns the stage of this Earth. And therefore this Promise here of the Crown of Life before the <hi>Epiphonema,</hi> I would inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret of a Reward in this life on this earth, according as I have expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the passage. But now that which follows this <hi>Epiphonema</hi> is a Promise of another sort, <hi>viz. He that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh shall not be hurt of the second death:</hi> for it is the securing of a blessed Immortality after this life; and seems farther to correspond with that passage in the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> Ch. 20. v. 6. <hi>Blessed and holy is he that has part in the first Resurrection: on such the second death hath no power.</hi> Wherefore though not according to the inference of rigid Syllogism, yet according to those nice and delicate hints in Propheticall Intimations, I would conclude that the promise of their Portion in the first Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is here proposed to those af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted <hi>Smyrnians,</hi> which was the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Portion of Martyrs and Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours, according to the opinion of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:94112:60"/>
the Primitive Church, as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> has learnedly and judiciously obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Which granted does hugely cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roborate this Application of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle to the Church in <hi>Smyrna</hi> to this Intervall which contains the times of all the Sufferings in a manner of the primitive Martyrs. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of a blessed Immortality had been very proper and accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date to this <hi>Smyrnian</hi> state of the Church, that were so frequently to lose their lives for profession of the Gospel: but for it to be intimated to them that these shall have their porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the first Resurrection, which is proper to Martyrs, as appears by the place above quoted, is so cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteristicall of this Intervall, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in all the primitive Martyrs suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>viz.</hi> in those Ten Persecutions, that it does marvellously confirm the truth of the Exposition of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Epistle in this Mysticall way we have gone.

From this year, I say, to the year 1242, when the Pope's Legate <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi> made an end of the <hi>Albigensian</hi> War with <hi>Trancavel</hi> Bastard of the Earl of <hi>Beziers,</hi> let this be the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall

                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Of the beginning of this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervall there can be no doubt. And for the termination of it, there are these two Considerations to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance it. The first, in that the latter of those numbers in the last of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,</hi> viz. the number 1335, does point to the beginning of the Affairs of the <hi>Waldenses</hi> and <hi>Albigenses,</hi> who are both one Sect and from one Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour, <hi>Waldo</hi> of <hi>Lyons,</hi> an holy and good man, whose Preaching, and his own and his Followers Sufferings, were about the term of that Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber whose <hi>Epoche</hi> is the Prophana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Temple by <hi>Antiochus E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piphanes.</hi> So considerable a passage of Providence is the appearing of the <hi>Waldenses</hi> in those times betwixt the year of <hi>Christ</hi> 1160 and 1170. For they were condemned for Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks by Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> in the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terane</hi> Council in the year 1162, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which you may be sure Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions would immediately follow. And Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> with great judgement will
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:94112:62"/>
have this latter Number in <hi>Daniel</hi> to <note place="margin">Dan. 12. 12.</note> point at these Times. Nor does that expression of <hi>Daniel</hi> at all weaken his Opinion, in that he saith, <hi>Blessed is he that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days,</hi> because it is said in the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> also, <hi>Blessed are the dead that die in the Lord,</hi> that is, that die for the cause of our Lord <hi>Jesus.</hi> And of the Church of <hi>Smyrna</hi> it is said, <hi>I know thy tribulation and poverty, but thou art rich.</hi> The judgement of the Spirit of God and the judgement of carnal men are quite opposite in these things. What they call <hi>Poverty,</hi> the Spirit calls <hi>Riches;</hi> what they <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery,</hi> the Spirit <hi>Blessednesse.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Affairs of the <hi>Waldenses</hi> or <hi>Albigenses</hi> is a notable, distinct and conspicuous joint of time, even ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the judgement of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Prophecy.</p>
                     <p>But then, in the second place, I ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate the Intervall of this Church in <hi>Pergamus,</hi> not in the beginning, but the conclusion, of these <hi>Waldensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
                        <pb n="59" facs="tcp:94112:62"/>
or <hi>Albigensian</hi> Affairs, because they being all in a manner one, and so plainly concluded in the year I have mentioned, their Sufferings may the more punctually answer to the Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of that one Martyr <hi>Antipas,</hi> who is here said to be slain in <hi>Pergamus.</hi> But the Concinnity of these things we shall better understand after we have descanted upon the name <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. That by <hi>Pergamus</hi> is intimated a state of Exaltation or Sublimity, I intimated before. <hi>Sublimia omnia dicta Asiaticis</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        <hi>notat Hesychius, Suidas, &amp; Servius,</hi> saith <hi>Grotius</hi> upon <hi>Apoc.</hi> 1. 11. whence he would have the Church in <hi>Pergamus</hi> to re-mind us of high and heavenly things. But this is a <hi>Moral,</hi> not a <hi>Propheticall</hi> sense. But with him howsoever I acknowledge that the signification of Sublimity is alluded to in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, but here most elegantly and seasonably in reference to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent state of the Church in <hi>Smyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> which was a state of <hi>Humiliation</hi>
                        <pb n="60" facs="tcp:94112:63"/>
and <hi>bitter</hi> Affliction. But at the very beginning of this present Intervall she so conspicuously emerging out of this low, sad, affictive state into the state of glory, peace and prosperity, what can be more significant then to salute her with the Title of the Church in <hi>Pergamus,</hi> accordingly as she is here saluted; which is a kind of Congratulation to her fresh emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency out of her late Miseries. And this sense will hold good for a time in this Intervall, namely, till tho days of her Apostasy: but then the Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church will be the Church in <hi>Pergamus</hi> still, but in another kind of meaning.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. According therefore to the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the Prophetick style, <hi>Perga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> has also another sense, such as the City <hi>Babylon</hi> and the City <hi>Tyrus,</hi> which are put for the City of <hi>Rome.</hi> But then not in such a sense as to mean the Walls or Stones of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> City, but the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and her Power and Jurisdiction. And in such a sense is <hi>Pergamus</hi> also here put
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:94112:63"/>
for <hi>Rome.</hi> So that this Epistle writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to the Church of <hi>Christ</hi> in <hi>Perga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> the truly Catholick and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolick Church, is directed to this Church dwelling under the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, or within the <hi>Roman</hi> Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che's Jurisdiction, understanding old <hi>Rome</hi> especially; as all such <hi>Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyptick</hi> Visions perstringe her most. Now that <hi>Rome</hi> in this sense is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stringed by this <hi>Pergamus,</hi> is very e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, First, in the easie Allusion of <hi>Pergamus</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi> from the significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the words. For as <hi>Pergamus</hi> signifies <hi>Sublimity,</hi> so (as <hi>Martinius</hi> notes) <hi>Rome</hi> is from the <hi>Hebrew</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <hi>exaltari.</hi> Besides that her Situation is high, and Buildings lofty, according to that of the Poet,
<q>
                           <l>Collibus è septem totum circumspicit orbem.</l>
                        </q>
And the highest of all is the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> himself, who exalts himself above all that is called God, or is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped. Is not this therefore a fit Bishop of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> that perks thus above all Kings and Emperours and
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:94112:64"/>
Princes of the earth? And our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervall of the Church of <hi>Pergamus</hi> reaches the highest times of her Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation, it taking in both <hi>Gregory</hi> the seventh, who first excommunicated the Emperour, and took upon him the power of making Emperours himself, and <hi>Alexander</hi> the third, who trode upon the neck of the Emperour <hi>Frederick;</hi> as also <hi>Caelestine</hi> the third, that crowned <hi>Henry</hi> the sixth and his Empress with his feet, and in scorn kick'd the Emperour's Crown off with his foot when he had crowned him. Certainly the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> were then the Bishops of <hi>Pergamus</hi> with a witnesse. Nor after this Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall could they ever hold their Crests so high. <hi>Boniface</hi> the eighth indeed was a Blusterer, and excommunicated <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>Fair</hi> of <hi>France;</hi> but he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him fool for his pains, and handled him in such sort, that, surprized at <hi>Anagnia,</hi> he was disgracefully mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on a poor Jade, and so carried pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner to <hi>Rome,</hi> where Pride and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret broke his heart, and so he there
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:94112:64"/>
dy'd ingloriously. But secondly, It is said of this <hi>Pergamus,</hi> that it was the most given to Idolatry of all the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Asia,</hi> (so <hi>Andreas Cesariensis</hi> reports of it;) which is the noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Character of <hi>Rome</hi> above all Cities, and therefore elsewhere in the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> she is called the <hi>Whore</hi> of <hi>Babylon</hi> for her insatiable spiritual Fornications.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, These <hi>Pergamenians</hi> were very fierce and diligent Accusers of the Apostolick Christians, to bring them to Martyrdome, as Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> upon the place notes out of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient History. For which also <hi>Rome</hi> is taxed elsewhere in the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> who is said <hi>to be drunk with the bloud of the Saints, and with the bloud of the Martyrs of Jesus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, It is recorded of the Prefect of this City <hi>Pergamus,</hi> that he would persuade the Christians to forsake the Apostolick Faith, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to Heathenism, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, because the elder Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion was the more precious and to
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:94112:65"/>
be preferred: As <hi>Antiquity</hi> is the great Pretense of the Papal Church. That Prefect said of Christianity, that it was but <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>that it began but the other day:</hi> And so you may be sure the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> said of the Religion of the <hi>Waldenses</hi> and <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bigenses.</hi> See Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> upon the place.</p>
                     <p>And lastly, That it should be the Martyr <hi>Antipas</hi> that was slain in <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamus,</hi> can any name more directly and assuredly point at the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> or the Papal Church then this? For <gap reason="foreign">

Nothing can sound more congruously or harmoniously, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever any man by way of cavill can say against it. The main Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:94112:65"/>
therefore of this present Epistle to the Church in <hi>Pergamus</hi> will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect the pure Apostolick Church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding within the Jurisdiction of the <hi>Roman,</hi> as this sense plainly implies; the <hi>Woman in the wildernesse,</hi> as the Holy Ghost elsewhere expresses it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>These things saith he that hath the sharp sword with two edges. Christ</hi> is set out thus in this Epistle to the Church in <hi>Pergamns,</hi> because this Sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God, understood and rel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished by the Divine Spirit in us, was the main Weapon whereby the Church in <hi>Pergamus</hi> defended her self from the <hi>Pergamenian</hi> Corruptions, and so kept her self pure from the false Glosses and unsound Traditions of either Superstitious men or crafty Deceivers.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>I know thy works, and where thou</hi>

                        <hi>dwellest, even where Satan's seat is; and thou holdest fast my Name, and hast not denied my Faith, even in those days wherein</hi> Antipas <hi>was my faithfull Martyr, who was slain among you, where
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:94112:66"/>
Satan dwelleth.</hi> That is to say, I know thou doest well for the main, and to thy greater commendation I consider where thou dwellest, even where the first-born of <hi>Lucifer</hi> has his throne, he that exalts himself above all that is called God or that is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped. (So <hi>Christ</hi> compares Satan to <hi>Lucifer</hi> or the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> (of whom the Prophet says, How art thou fallen, <hi>Lucifer,</hi> thou son of the Morning!) <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 18. <hi>I beheld Satan as lightning fall from Heaven.)</hi> And yet neither the awe nor glory of that Church could cause thee to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake my Name, and, in stead of being a true Christian, to become a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Antichrist, and so relinquish the pure Apostolick Faith, no not in those days that my faithfull Martyr <hi>Antipas,</hi> that is, those plain-hearted and openly-professed enemies of the <hi>Pope</hi> and his adulterate and idolatrous Religion, the <hi>Waldenses</hi> and <hi>Albigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> were so cruelly persecuted and murthered, who were slain among you who stood out and yet escaped,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:94112:66"/>
though in the very Synagogue of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, that is to say, in that Church which is a treacherous Adversary to all my true Members, and a very bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Censurer and Accuser of them for their not complying with the Laws of Wickednesse which she hath esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished, and a worse Adversary then the Pagan Dragon before, whom therefore my Church overcame in a few Ages. This Satan, I say, is a more mischievous Enemy then that red Dragon, by reason of his Cunning and Hypocrisie, and his pretenses that he is for me, when indeed he is against me, and by reason of the abuse of my Authority in pretense, against the Members of my true Church. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I cannot but take notice where thou dwellest, and how in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard thou art in a worse condition then the <hi>Smyrnian</hi> Church her self, who were onely to grapple with a professed Enemy, but thou with both a malicious Enemy, and a false and hypocritical Friend. It is therefore well done of thee that thou holdest
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:94112:67"/>
out in such hard and difficult Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. This for the sense of that Verse in general. But now particularly, why the <hi>Waldenses</hi> and <hi>Albigenses,</hi> that were persecuted in this Intervall of the Church, should be called <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipas,</hi> why <hi>Martyr,</hi> why <hi>faithfull,</hi> and why <hi>slain,</hi> rather then <hi>burnt,</hi> we shall briefly give this account. And that a Company or successive Body of men is represented in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick style under one single per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, is so trivial that I need not note it. <hi>Alcazar</hi> makes <hi>Jezebel,</hi> mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the next Epistle, to be the Church of the <hi>Jewes; Aretas,</hi> the Sect of the <hi>Nicolaitans;</hi> Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> the <hi>Gnosticks.</hi> But now that this one person should be called <hi>Antipas,</hi> there is nothing more congruous to the Doctrine of the <hi>Waldenses</hi> and <hi>Albi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genses,</hi> who boldly preached that the <hi>Pope</hi> was <hi>Antichrist,</hi> the Mass an Abomination, the Host an Idol, and Purgatory a Fable. And <hi>Waldo,</hi> the chief beginner of this Sect, was of

the same mind, denying the <hi>Pope</hi> to be the <hi>Head</hi> of the Church, or that he had any Authority over the Kings and Princes of the earth, who depend immediately upon God alone.

And Mr. <hi>Mede,</hi> out of <hi>Petrus Perioni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> in his book of this <hi>Albigensian</hi> War, intimates that near ten hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand of them were slain in battel at times, and that in <hi>France</hi> alone. Wherefore slaying with the Sword is very Characteristically spoken here in this Epistle of the faithfull Martyr <hi>Antipas;</hi> Burning as yet being in it self not so frequent, and bearing no proportion at all to this vast number slain in the Field.

But these may be cast into three sorts: such as notwithstanding this Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment still held Communion with her, and pretended they did well in so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; those that separated from her Communion; and those that not onely separated, but suffered death for so doing.

(To eat

things sacrificed to Idols is one mode of Idolatry, but by a Propheticall <hi>Diorism</hi> it signifies Idolatry in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.)

their Eucharist so, that they turn my Supper into a Feast of <hi>Idolothyta,</hi> and make the partakers thereof guilty of Idolatry or spiritual Fornication, forasmuch as they give Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship to that which is not God.

to, I am inclinable to think from those Authorities; and that the Woma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishnesse of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in this Period is perstringed.

And the Mitre of <hi>Paul</hi> the second is taken speciall notice of for the exceeding preciousnesse of the Jewels therein. And no doubt there was the like encrease of the Ecclesiastick Bravery every-where. A little before the beginning of this Intervall did <hi>Honorius</hi> the third ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point the <hi>Carmelites</hi> to goe in white, that they might look more Maiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, and decreed that they should be called the <hi>Family of the Virgin.</hi> And the <hi>Franciscans</hi> and <hi>Dominicans</hi> are notorious all along this Intervall, who had the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> for their peculiar Patronesse. And indeed within this Intervall the <hi>Roman</hi> Church ran so much in the seminine strain, that they generally professed themselves more under the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Providence of our <hi>Lady</hi> then of our <hi>Lord Jesus Christ. Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> the ninth, a little before the beginning of this present Intervall, ordained that <hi>Salve Regina,</hi> an Hymn

Therefore when the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> swarmed so with Monks and Friers, that had abjured their <hi>Virility</hi> by an irrevocable Vow of Caelibate, and went in sculking Hoods and long Coats like Women, and so became Petticoat-men at the best, was it not very congruous for the Spirit of Prophecy, by way of just reproach to this Womanishness, so to characterize the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> at this time, by calling her <hi>Thyatira,</hi> as if they had become rather the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of men then the Sons of men by this so general Effeminacy in more then those Monkish garbs which I now mention? Besides that these
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:94112:74"/>
Petticoat-men, the <hi>Dominicans</hi> espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, managed their opposition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the true Church in a right fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minine manner, not manly, as before, by meeting their enemy in the Field, but sneakingly, by Perfidiousness and Treachery, to bring them into the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition, and then cruelly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultingly in the upshot; as it is easie to understand by reading the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the <hi>Holy Inquisition,</hi> as they call it. Therefore there being all these symptoms of Feminity in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in this Intervall, it is not unreasonable to conceive that this corruption of hers is perstringed by calling her the City of <hi>Thyatira,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luding to <hi>Thygatira,</hi> which signifies not a <hi>son</hi> of <hi>Adam,</hi> but a <hi>daughter.</hi>

The <note place="margin">Apoc. 11.</note> Vineyard therefore of <hi>Naboth</hi> is that sense, and knowledge, and consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and life of the Spirit in the new birth, whereby a man discerning plainly &amp; livingly betwixt the wayes of <hi>Christ</hi> and of Antichrist, does as necessarily loath the one, as adhere to the other.</p>

                        <hi>For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of Prophecy:</hi> that is to say, the being able in such sort to witnesse that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus is the <hi>Christ,</hi> is from the spirit and life of God in us which inspireth all holy truth.

with a right Sentiment of things from the Spirit of Life, and having the confidence to speak the truth as it is in Jesus. This is all that need to be understood thereby.</p>

After which the Intervall of <hi>Phyladelphia</hi> comes in, and takes up also the second and third Thunder. Some special qualities

therefore of the Church of <hi>Sardis</hi> are to be read in this Stone <hi>Sarda,</hi> and some to her praise, others to her di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution. The virtue of this Stone is, that carried about one it makes a man chearfull and couragious, and drives away Witchcraft and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment, and expells poison right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly administred, which adumbrate some peculiar Privileges in this <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> Church. Their chearfull securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in justification by faith in <hi>Christ</hi>'s bloud, and their being rid of the poisonous idolatrous doctrines, and bewitching Enchantments of the Cup of the Whore. Here's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of <hi>Jezebel</hi> in this Church, nor any mention of the eating of things offered to Idols, nor in the two fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Epistles, which is no small ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of the truth of these Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions. Both they and she are well and sound touching these points.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But this Stone <hi>Sarda,</hi> which is also called <hi>Carnalina,</hi> and in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:94112:88"/>
seems also to insinuate something to the Derogation of the <hi>Sardian</hi> Church, as if they were <hi>flesh,</hi> and not <hi>spirit;</hi> which is the special Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church of <hi>Philadelphia.</hi> And whereas <hi>Christ</hi>'s Conquest over <hi>Edom</hi> is, by letting out or squeezing out the corrupt bloud of old <hi>Adam,</hi> this <hi>Odem</hi> or <hi>Carnalina</hi> is said to be of that virtue as to stanch bloud and stop it from running out, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore seems to be significative of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Doctrines in the <hi>Sardian</hi> Church that hinder the due and requisite Mortification of the <hi>old man,</hi> as loth to weaken him too much, and let too much of his bloud and life run out.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The meaning therefore is, that though the <hi>Sardian</hi> Church be well rid of the foul Idolatries and grosse Trumperies of the Papal Church, yet her state as yet is but <hi>carnal</hi> most<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what.

What can be more <hi>Carnaline-</hi>like then this? Besides that there are over-many that do as grosly and carnally erre touching the nature of the Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction-Body, they phansying it as terrestrially modify'd (though it be called a celestial or spiritual Body in the Scriptures,) as that Body is that

we put into the Grave, or is capable of the imbraces of the Nuptial Bed. To say nothing of other such like grosse carnal Conceits that this <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> Church has not yet expunged out of her mind.</p>
                     <p>But as mischievous a mark as any of her <hi>Carnality</hi> is her <hi>Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> and <hi>Schismaticalnesse</hi> even to mutuall <hi>Persecution,</hi> as also the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural and unchristian <hi>Wars</hi> of one part of Reformed Christendome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the other. These things rank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly savour of the Flesh, and are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely contrary to the due Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of the Spirit; which when it shall appear will bring in the Church of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> the Church of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned Love and Charity, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, according to the prediction of the Prophets, there shall not be the noise of this unchristian War any more.

not out of <hi>Babylon.</hi> Nor is it any wonder that the Ministry of the holy Angels will be so extraordinarily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised about a Church which will then have become so Angelicall, as is more fully noted in the <hi>Divine Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues.</hi>

have not endeavoured to be that Church which is <hi>without spot &amp; wrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle, or any such thing,</hi> but the <hi>Sardian</hi> tincture has too much distained them.</p>

But commonly wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men are very domineering and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocient against good men that have any blot or infirmity on them, unless they be of their own faction.</p>
                     <p>And therefore this <hi>Philadelphian</hi> Church, if any, must be the Church

2. Thus therefore it is foreseen in the series of Divine Providence, that after that glorious estate of the Church which is synchronal to the second and third Thunder (during which space and a little before the Scene of <hi>Philadelphia</hi> adorned the Stage) had well purged the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian World from all foolish opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and superstitions, and of that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed custome of persecuting one another for them, and that the truth of the Gospel had clearly shined in the simplicity thereof, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victively against all the follies and impostures of the former Ages, that the Church had no great hazard of being again cheated with them; and that they had seen all Prophecies in a manner fulfilled before their eyes, so that there could be no doubt to them, but that the <hi>Philadelphian</hi> Church was the true Church, nor be in any capacity of any change in faith or worship: after this, I say, as all things are in some sort or other va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable under the Sun, so it seems this
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:94112:104"/>
                        <hi>Philadelphian</hi> Church was at last to degenerate into this <hi>Laodicean</hi> state; and that which was before the <hi>Reign of the Spirit</hi> and the living Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of God, would now become the <hi>Church of Laodicea;</hi> which signifies a more <hi>popular or external Politicall righteousnesse,</hi> or the <hi>righteousness of the people.</hi> An external profession and performance of that Mode that was used by the <hi>Philadelphians</hi> in a living way, and with the power of the Spirit, the same will this Church of <hi>Laodicea</hi> hold on spiritlesly and lazily, with little life or zeal, and yet applaud themselves by reason of the abundance of knowledge she has, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the completion of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies, and by reason of the purity of the external Worship she still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, as if all was still well with her, and as if she wanted nothing.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. This in brief is the condition of this Church, as it is significantly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated in the very name. For <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> signifies as much as <hi>the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse of the people.</hi> And the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:94112:104"/>
are any multitude of mankind gathered into a body politick; as is manifest in that notation of <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, as if it were from <gap reason="foreign">

                        </q>
And therefore the people, being a body politick, are ruled by such and such laws, which if they observe, it is not regarded <hi>quo animo,</hi> or out of what Principle, they observe them. The new nature, Regeneration and the Spirit, are quite out of this rode. And a National or Oecumenical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, Doctrine or Worship, as they are <hi>ab extrà,</hi> are but as a <hi>political</hi> law, and the Righteousnesse therein but a <hi>Laodicean</hi> Righteousnesse, as has been abundantly inculcated already. But besides this meaning of the name <hi>Laodicea,</hi> which I doubt not but is particularly intended, there may, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the multifarious Allusive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the Propheticall style, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther notable meaning be also intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and that very appropriate to this Church.

And there is nothing more frequent in the Scripture, then the giving of names from some notable externall Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that respects the thing or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son so named.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>These things saith the Amen, the faithfull and true witnesse.

Wherefore this Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of <hi>Christ</hi> is seasonably brought in, as respecting both the completion of the Promises already performed,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:94112:105"/>
in bringing his Church to that admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable glorious condition in the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> as also the performance of that material Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise at the end of this Epistle, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eternal Life or a blessed Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality in <hi>Christ</hi>'s Heavenly Kingdome; which these <hi>Laodiceans,</hi> or degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated <hi>Philadelphians,</hi> like our modern Familists, that pretend to the <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphian</hi> Dispensation, may some of them, it's likely, be prone to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trust.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Christ</hi> is here also called the <hi>faithfull and true witnesse,</hi> because he does so impartially witnesse concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the truth of the condition of the <hi>Laodiceans,</hi> and so faithfully discover to them the danger thereof. And the declaration seeming so paradoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call to them, it was the more requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to inculcate into them his own <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>faithfulnesse,</hi> that he might gain belief of them against their own false sense and opinion of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>

This is the new Creature in thee, the Transformation of thy nature into the Image of the Heavenly <hi>Adam.</hi> This is solid and durable Riches in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and such as will go along with thee into the highest Heavens, when this Earth and the metalls therein shall melt with fire. Labour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore after such a solid Treasure as will abide those fatal flames, and will not
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:94112:109"/>
perish with thee in the general Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagration. And the Symbol of this Treasure is this purify'd Gold.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And white rayment, that thou mayst be cloathed, and that the shame of thy nakednesse do not appear.</hi> Groan then earnestly in this, O thou spiritlesse <hi>Laodicea,</hi> desiring to be cloathed upon with that spiritual house which is from Heaven; that, being so cloathed, thou mayst not be found naked. For while thou art in this earthly Tabernacle, thou oughtest to account it a burthen, and not to set up thy staff in the enjoyments of this life, because all things are peacefull and prosperous with thee. Not that I would advise thee to shorten thy days here; but that, being thus cloathed by this spiritual Vestment, Mortality might be swallowed up of life. And it is the Spirit of life and the Divine Love that worketh in thee this one great thing that thou so greatly wantest, and yet art insensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thereof.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And anoint thine eyes with eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salve,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:94112:110"/>
that thou mayst see.</hi> That is, Cleanse thy self with such a due mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of Mortification, and Purificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the inward man from all fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse of flesh and spirit, that thou mayst attain to the <hi>Divinely-moral Prudence</hi> which will enable thee to have a right judgement and discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in all things. This therefore is the <hi>Collyrion</hi> which I would advise thee to anoint thine eye-sight with, even the purgation of thy self from all the <hi>Animal Corruptions,</hi> that thou mayst perfect the <hi>inward Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi> in my fear: For the <hi>outward</hi> alone carries none to Heaven. The Ointment I prescribe will indeed smart; but without it thou wilt still continue blind, and never finde the way to everlasting Salvation.</p>

                        </gap>. Which signifies to chastise and scourge, as well as to instruct. Which therefore may seem to be the commination of some external Calamity and Affliction that <hi>Christ</hi> would bring upon the <hi>Laodiceans,</hi> if they did not repent them of their remissness; and in such a way as themselves may haply be the causes of, through their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missnesse and Luke-warmnesse. For that former <hi>Philadelphian</hi> Zeal and Activity ceasing, which that Church exercised in the behalf of the Interest of the Kingdome of God, their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies may more then ordinarily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease upon them, especially the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil being let loose, and being very active to deceive the Nations; whom they should counter-plot, by being as active to convert them to the Truth. And this may be the time wherein the Prediction of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> is to be fulfilled, who are said to be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:94112:111"/>
together to battel, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compasse the Camp of the Saints and the beloved City, which in this state is termed the Church of <hi>Laodicea;</hi> but in that Vision, the <hi>Camp of the Saints,</hi> because there were not onely many Saints amongst them of the old <hi>Philadelphian</hi> strain, but that they were still in their externall frame an <hi>holy people</hi> and an <hi>holy City,</hi> not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaned by the Gentiles, that is to say, not polluted by Heathenish Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Idolatry, and Imposture, and Cruelty; nor brought under their power and dominion that were. Which yet was once the condition of the <hi>Holy City</hi> for a time and times and half a time, or forty two months, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poc.</hi> 11. 2.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. And it is still called the <hi>beloved City</hi> also for the same reason: but not the <hi>new Jerusalem</hi> descended from Heaven, because so generally that new and Heavenly nature was lost amongst them. But this Church of <hi>Laodicea</hi> is still <hi>beloved</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> partly for her own sake, and partly
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:94112:111"/>
for her deceased Sister's sake, the lovely <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> whom she so much resembles in all her externall features, that dearest Spouse of <hi>Christ.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And therefore the Title of the <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved City</hi> agrees very well with this passage in the present Text, <hi>Whom I love, I rebuke,</hi> yea and scourge too. For these streights that the <hi>Laodice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> are to be cast into by the Siege of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> seems the most proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble way to rowze them out of their Lukewarmnesse and lazy Formality. But that things may not run the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of growing worse and worse, nor there be an infinite repetition of the vicissitude of Scenes on the Stage of this Earth, Providence will knock off at such a time as that the wicked and prophane Rabble of the world shall not again get the dominion o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his true Church, but he will put a period to the Contest by a deluge of Fire from Heaven, as it is intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in that Vision.

                        <hi>you a mystery: Ye shall not all sleep, yet ye shall all be changed; that mortality may be swallowed up of life.</hi> This is a great and stupendious Promise; but thou art to consider that it is spoken by him that is the <hi>Amen, the true and faithfull witnesse, and the beginning of the Creation of God,</hi> and therefore both will and can carry on all his design to the very end, Amen.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. <hi>He that hath an ear to hear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Verse 22.</note> 
                        <hi>the Churches.</hi> From the <hi>Epiphonema</hi> coming here last, as in all these four last Epistles, one may haply raise this Objection, as if this sense of the Promise immediately preceding it were not <hi>Politicall</hi> or <hi>Propheticall</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, but merely <hi>Theologicall,</hi> the Promise being to be performed in the other world, and therefore not the proper object of <hi>Prophecy,</hi> which concerns the affairs of the stage of this Earth: And that this there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:94112:114"/>
is against our professed Rule.</p>
                     <p>But I answer, that though the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of obtaining Heaven after this life upon the death of the body be merely a <hi>Theogicall</hi> Promise, and of a thing more spiritual and invisible, and not to be seen upon the face of this Earth; yet this promise of obtaining Heaven at the Resurrection and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Day of Judgement, it being the day of that great and visible As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sizes wherein the Souls of the Saints shall appear in glorify'd bodies, may well be ranged in the same order with the rest of the Promises imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately preceding the <hi>Epiphonemata</hi> of each Epistle, and to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished visibly in this life. For the sense of the Promise in brief is this; That as <hi>Christ,</hi> after his Sufferings, his Death and Passion, ascended vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly into Heaven, (for Heaven is said to be <hi>the throne of God</hi> in the Scripture,) and so Heaven became also <hi>Christ</hi>'s throne; so those of <hi>Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicea,</hi> who upon the Mortification of their Lusts should attain to the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:94112:114"/>
state of life in the New birth, should ascend visibly into <hi>Christ</hi>'s throne, that is, into Heaven, in the open view of them that should be left here on the Earth and in the inferiour Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of the Air, sentenced to that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting fire prepared for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and his Angels.</p>
                     <p>This is a plain and obvious sense of this Promise, and such as the placing of the <hi>Epiphonema</hi> requires, and is, in my judgement, no mean Ratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the true and Literal sense of that Article of our Faith, touching the visible Resurrection and Glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of our bodies, and their ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion into the Heavenly Regions, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst such as would whiffle away all these Truths by resolving them into a mere moral Allegorie.</p>
                     <p>Thus consonant every way are the Interpretations of these Epistles both to themselves, and to the Apostolick Truth.</p>

                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. AS in natural <hi>Hypotheses</hi> those are accounted truest that solve the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Nature the most naturally and easily, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if such as are no otherwise sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vible then upon the proposed <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis:</hi> so that meaning of Scripture, I mean especially of any considerable portion thereof, ought to be esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed truest that can solve the most Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties that may be raised concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the same, or the Contexts pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent or subsequent thereto; and if all, still the more certain; and if un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solvible otherwise, there is still the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:94112:115"/>
more assurance of undeniable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration. Now how near this <hi>Mysticall</hi> or <hi>Propheticall</hi> Exposition of these Epistles approches to the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of this case, I will leave to the Reader to judge, after he has consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Solutions of the Questions easily raised out of the Epistles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, or the precedent Chapter, and not easily answered, nor at all satisfactorily, at least most of them, but upon the <hi>Hypothesis</hi> we have gone.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. As first, If a man enquire why the Spirit of Prophecy, after he has so expresly given notice that this Book of the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> is to shew unto his servants things that are to come, and called it plainly a Book of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, <note place="margin">Apoc. 1. 1, 3.</note> should start so unexpectedly from the Title and intended subject, as to write no lesse then seven Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles to certain Churches, that have nothing considerable of <hi>Prophecy</hi> in them, before he deliver any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies properly so called, but onely Promises and Comminations; and
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:94112:116"/>
that he should doe this with as great Pomp and as high a Preamble as he does when he begins so famous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies as those of the <hi>seven Seals,</hi> and the <hi>opened Book.</hi> But according to our <hi>Hypothesis</hi> the Answer is easie; <hi>viz.</hi> That though these seven Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles to the seven Churches of <hi>Asia</hi> have a <hi>Literal</hi> sense, yet they are also a <hi>Parable</hi> or <hi>Prophecy,</hi> and of as high concern for both matter and extent of time (they reaching from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Church to the end of the world) as the Prophecy of the <hi>Seals</hi> and <hi>opened Book;</hi> and that they are ushered in with this great Pomp on purpose to give us notice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, A man would be prone to enquire why the Spirit dictates Letters unto the Churches in <hi>Asia,</hi> and not rather to the Churches in <hi>Europe, Asia</hi> and <hi>Africk.</hi> For certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Church had disspred it self in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all these Quarters of the world by that time. As if the Spirit of Truth were a respecter of persons. For these
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:94112:116"/>
are not the Letters of <hi>John,</hi> but of the Holy Ghost. But our Answer is ready at hand, That for the signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy of the word <hi>Asia</hi> to comport also with the significancy of the names of the Seven Churches, <hi>Asia</hi> alone was pitched upon. But, according to the <hi>Propheticall</hi> sense, the true Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church is writ unto under such distinct Conditions as she was to vary into unto the end of the world. So that there is no <hi>Partiality</hi> nor Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of Persons in this.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, If a man demand touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the order or precedency of these Seven Churches that are writ unto: What a plain and manifest account is there to him that compares the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles in their <hi>Propheticall</hi> sense with the Intervalls of the Church Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick lying in that order that these Churches are ranged? This is a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory reason, and worthy the Spirit that wrote these Epistles. But whether they are ranged in this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, because that a Letter-carrier going from <hi>Patmos,</hi> his first journey
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:94112:117"/>
will be to <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and then to <hi>Smyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> and so in order till he come to <hi>Laodicea;</hi> whether the <hi>holy Spirit of Prophecy</hi> regarded that in the dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of his Letters, (though <hi>Alcazar</hi> the <hi>Jesuite</hi> be for it,) I cannot but sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend my judgement, and that not without a smile. But of this <hi>Ataxie</hi> more particularly anon.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Fourthly, If it be demanded why just <hi>Seven</hi> Churches in <hi>Asia</hi> are writ to, neither more nor lesse, (especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally that in <hi>Thyatira,</hi> according to the acknowledgement of <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then not founded, but after the writing of these Epistles,) it is hard to give a satisfactory answer in the <hi>Literal</hi> sense. For to say this Book of the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> affects the number Seven, and that, because it runs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the number Seven altogether in the insuing part of the book, which is <hi>Propheticall,</hi> it therefore, for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity sake, chuses this number in writing to the Churches though <hi>lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally</hi> understood, seems but a meagre, mean and trifling account, a design
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:94112:117"/>
unworthy the Holy Spirit that dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this Book. But the using this number <hi>Seven</hi> all over is rather an intimation that the Book is <hi>Propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi> all over, and that these Epistles are also a <hi>Prophecy,</hi> accordingly as we have explained them. And taking them so, the Answer is plain and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious, <hi>viz.</hi> The number <hi>Seven</hi> is here chosen out as <hi>Symbolicall,</hi> it being the note of <hi>Universality;</hi> whence the <hi>Pythagoreans,</hi> as I above noted, call it <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore Seven (and no more then Seven) Churches are writ un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, as standing for the seven Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valls of the Church from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the end of all.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, If it be demanded why these seven Churches rather then any others, which in all likelihood may have the same Vertues and Vices that these are commended and taxed for: The reason of this is writ in the very Notation of their Names, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Name being significative of the Condition of the Church Catholick
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:94112:118"/>
in that successive Intervall of time that this or that Church so named standeth for, and in such order as they are repeated.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, If one require a Reason why <hi>Christ</hi> is described by <hi>holding the seven Stars in his right hand</hi> in the Epistles to the Churches of <hi>Ephesus</hi> and of <hi>Sardis,</hi> why the same de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription in both, or why in either: In the <hi>Literal</hi> sense it will be hard to finde any peculiar Reason; but in the <hi>Propheticall</hi> sense already decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it is obvious. For the <hi>seven Stars</hi> signifie all the Pastours, whether in present existence, or succession. And <hi>Ephesus</hi> is the beginning-state of the Church; and therefore it is both very seasonable and methodicall to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present the first Founder, Sustainer and Continuer thereof by this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem; <hi>Lo, I am with you to the end of the world.</hi> And that this again is hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at in the Epistle to the Church of <hi>Sardis,</hi> is with evident Proportion and Analogy to the Affairs of the Church there represented. For the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:94112:118"/>
Church of <hi>Sardis</hi> is as it were the beginning again or the emerging of the true Church or Kingdome of <hi>Christ</hi> out of the Power and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Antichrist.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Seventhly, Why the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> of all other Churches, should be commended for their try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing false Apostles. Why might not other Churches be attaqued by them, and also discover them, as well as the Church of <hi>Ephesus?</hi> The Solution of which Probleme is easie in this <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall</hi> sense of the Epistles, that pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the <hi>Ephesine</hi> Intervall within the Apostles times, but the rest on this side of them.</p>
                     <p>Eighthly, If any one demand why it is said to the Church of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> more then to any other Church, <hi>Be thou faithfull unto death, and I will</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Apoc. 2. 10, 11.</note> 
                        <hi>give thee the Crown of life;</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>He that overcometh shall not be hurt by the second death:</hi> In the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral</hi> sense it will be very hard to finde any peculiar Reason why this might not as well be said to the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:94112:119"/>
Church in <hi>Pergamus,</hi> where there was killing for Religion, it seems, by the mention of the Martyr <hi>Antipas.</hi> I, but there was no obtaining the Crown of life there in any peculiar sense; but the Crown of life, that is, the Imperial Crown, was given to the Sufferings of the Primitive Martyrs under the Ten Persecutions: to whom also, according to the opinion of the ancient Church, the Promise of the first Resurrection belonged. Which is here obliquely glanced at, (according to the mode of the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calyptick</hi> style, that loves to hint things by <hi>Ellipses,)</hi> in that Promise, <hi>He that overcometh shall not be hurt by</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Apoc. 20. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>the second death;</hi> implying thereby, that he shall be made <hi>partaker of the first Resurrection.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Ninthly, If any one will again ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject more particularly against the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxie</hi> of the Churches, that they are ranged neither according to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit nor congeneracy of their Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, pretending that it had been far better to have joyned the two
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:94112:119"/>
irreprehensible Churches together, <hi>Smyrna</hi> and <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> against whom there is no complaint at all; and then <hi>Ephesus, Sardis</hi> and <hi>Laodicea,</hi> against whom there is no complaint of eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things offered unto Idols; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards <hi>Pergamus</hi> and <hi>Thyatira,</hi> in which Churches alone there is: If any one, I say, contend that this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod had been more exact; truly, in the <hi>Literal</hi> sense it will be hard to frame an handsome and satisfactory answer; especially if he urge that God is the Authour of Method, as well as the God of Order. But in this <hi>Mysticall</hi> or <hi>Propheticall</hi> sense the Answer is solid and exquisite, and much-what the same that was given to the like Difficulty more generally propounded before, namely, That the Churches of <hi>Asia</hi> are named in that order the successive Intervalls of the Church Catholick were to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in, of which these <hi>Asiatick</hi> Churches are but the <hi>Symbols</hi> or <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roglyphicks.</hi> And therefore those two Intervalls of time which take in the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:94112:120"/>
Reign of the Beast and the False pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>viz.</hi> the Intervalls of the Church of <hi>Pergamus</hi> and of <hi>Thyatira,</hi> must come after <hi>Ephesus</hi> and <hi>Smyrna,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause till the expiration of those two Intervalls Idolatry had not again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entred the Apostatizing Church. And the three following Intervalls of <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis, Philadelphia</hi> and <hi>Laodicea,</hi> are the Intervalls of the true Church e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapsed out of the hands of dominee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Idolatry; and therefore we hear no more in them of things sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed unto Idols, nor of any <hi>Jeza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel.</hi> And <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> which is the most holy and the most glorious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervall of the Church that is to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear on the face of the earth, is not to be named according to her Dignity, but according to her Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession in time, toward the latter end of the world, as she is here ranged. But of this more then enough, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we had touched of it in the general before.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Tenthly, Why is <hi>Christ</hi> in his Description before the Epistle to
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:94112:120"/>
the Church in <hi>Pergamus</hi> set out by a <hi>two-edged sword,</hi> coming, suppose, <note place="margin">Apoc. 2. 12.</note> out of his mouth, (according to the Ellipticalnesse of the <hi>Apocalyptick</hi> style?) what reason in the letter can be given of that? for (especially if this Supplement be made) it cannot respect the slaying of <hi>Antipas</hi> with the sword. What peculiar thing then in this Church of <hi>Pergamus</hi> is there to require this Description? Truly no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all appears in the <hi>Letter.</hi> But in the <hi>Propheticall</hi> sense it is very proper, The <hi>Waldenses</hi> and <hi>Albigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> in this Intervall assaulting the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or at least defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves and their pure Faith, so signally by this weapon, I mean, by the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God; though them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves died so many thousands of them in the field by the sword for the Faith they thus defended.</p>
                     <p>And in the eleventh place, The Description of <hi>Christ</hi> before the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle to the Church in <hi>Thyatira, And his feet like fine brasse, (as if they bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Apoc. 2. 18.</note>
                        <pb n="176" facs="tcp:94112:121"/>
                        <hi>in a furnace;)</hi> (for that Supple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is to be understood out of his Description in the first Chapter, as before:) But now what peculiar significancy has this Description, or what congruity to any thing in the Church of <hi>Thyatira Literally</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood? surely none. But in the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall</hi> sense it is very expressive of those lower members of <hi>Christ</hi>'s bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, his Church here on earth, of their invincible Zeal, and Patience, and Sincerity of Affection, such as did abide the most fiery Trialls that could be put upon them, and made them stand at the Stake amongst bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Faggots with the flames about their ears, and never flinch for it: As has been noted in the interpretation of that Epistle. This was the state of that Intervall of the Church.</p>
                     <p>Twelfthly, In a Book that is so full of AEnigmaticall Involutions, and Coverings upon Coverings, where he calls the Churches <hi>Golden Candle-sticks,</hi> and the Bishops or Pastours <hi>Stars</hi> and <hi>Angels,</hi> even then when
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:94112:121"/>
he interprets and offers to be more plain; that the same Authour should so openly and plainly mention any one by name as he does the Martyr <hi>Antipas,</hi> if there were not some far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mysterie in it, would be a great difficulty, and hardly to be digested by the more sagacious and curious. I must confesse I have often wondred at this naming <hi>Antipas</hi> by name, till I understood a farther sense thereof, such as we have rendred in the expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of that Epistle.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. In the thirteenth place, One might well demand why <hi>Christ</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses a greater disgust against the Church of <hi>Laodicea</hi> then that of <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis.</hi> For though the former is said to be luke-warm; yet the other, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a great show of life, is notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing declared to be dead. That <hi>Christ</hi> should be more enraged against Luke warmnesse then Hypocrisy, and threaten it more deeply then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>I will spew thee out of my mouth,</hi> (which is quite to cast a thing away, never to be resumed again,) must
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:94112:122"/>
seem marvellous to the considerate. Certainly, if there were not some greater matter in it, the Spirit of <hi>Christ</hi> would not speak so severely onely to follow a Metaphor. But in the <hi>Propheticall</hi> sense the Solution is easie, that passage being predictive of the Extermination of the Church from the face of the earth at the close of the world, as I have expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it.</p>
                     <p>In the fourteenth place, It may be demanded, why so affectedly and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly in every Epistle that phrase is used, <hi>I know thy works,</hi> without any variation or omission. Which seems a thing but of small importance in the <hi>Literal</hi> sense of these Epistles: but in the <hi>Propheticall</hi> it seems on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose so repeated, to intimate an Allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in <hi>Asia</hi> to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, (as if <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> was intended on purpose to answer to <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>) that <hi>Asia</hi> may also be significant as well as the names of the Seven Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: which they all being, it is a shrewd presumption this repetition
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:94112:122"/>
was for some such design as has been declared. Whereas the <hi>Literal</hi> sense can give no account thereof.</p>
                     <p>Fifteenthly, <hi>Alcazar</hi> himself is much stumbled, that the Spirit of God should be thought to take notice of any one particular Woman in the Church of <hi>Thyatira,</hi> and so call her by the name of <hi>Jezabel,</hi> as is ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily supposed. And indeed these things are too little for the majesty of this writing of the <hi>Apocalypse.</hi> But how can we help it in the <hi>Literal</hi> sense, if we will interpret with constancy and coherency? But in the <hi>Propheticall</hi> sense there is no such incongruity. The Object is worth the Spirit's taking notice of in this kinde; this <hi>Jezabel</hi> being that painted Woman of <hi>Rome,</hi> intoxica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Kings of the earth with the Cup of her spiritual Fornications, as has been shewn upon the Text.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Sixteenthly, It seems very strange that that Promise of ruling o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Nations, and receiving the Morning-star, (which doubtlesse are
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:94112:123"/>
                        <hi>Politicall</hi> Promises,) should be made to the Church in <hi>Thyatira,</hi> more then to that in <hi>Pergamus,</hi> or <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and others. What Victories or Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on did the Church in <hi>Thyatira</hi> in <hi>Asia</hi> get over the Nations more then other Churches? This is an hard knot in the <hi>Literal</hi> sense. But in the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall</hi> it is loosned at the first sight. For the Closure of the Intervall of the Church of <hi>Thyatira</hi> brings in the time wherein whole Nations revol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Pope and his idolatrous Church, and professed the Reformed Religion, and so in these parts got the <hi>Pontifician</hi> party under them.</p>
                     <p>Seventeenthly, In the Epistle to the Church in <hi>Philadelphia</hi> there is mention made of a mighty Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is to come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth, touching which he saith, <hi>Behold, I come quickly.</hi> Why should this be said to the Church of <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia</hi> more then to any other of the Churches here specified? There are not the least footsteps of reason to be
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:94112:123"/>
found in the <hi>Literal</hi> sense. But in the <hi>Propheticall</hi> sense the thing is plain. For the Intervall of <hi>Philadelphia</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning in the last Vial, wherein that mighty and terrible Earthquake is to happen, the great Temptation, what it is, is plainly thence understood, and how in respect of this <hi>Philadelphian</hi> Church it will come quickly, she commencing but in the very same Vial that this is to happen under.</p>
                     <p>Eighteenthly, Why upon this <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia,</hi> a private <hi>Asiatick</hi> Church, should the name of <hi>the City of God, the new Jerusalem which cometh down out of Heaven from God,</hi> (the very same that is expressed <hi>Apoc.</hi> 21.) be said to be written? This title were too big and turgent for any private Church, were it not a Type or Symbol of some greater matter. But by the <hi>Propheticall</hi> interpretation this diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty is quite removed. For the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervall of the <hi>Philadelphian</hi> Church is co-incident with the times of the <hi>new Jerusalem,</hi> (mentioned at the end of the <hi>Apocalypse,)</hi> and of the Millen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:94112:124"/>
Empire of <hi>Christ</hi> upon earth.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Nineteenthly, The Curious may be prone to enquire, why the Church of <hi>Laodicea</hi> in those times should ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count her self so hugely and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily rich, increased in goods, and to have no want of any thing. And truly why this should be her estate rather then any of the Churches spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cify'd, from the <hi>Literal</hi> ground we can fetch no reason. But admitting the <hi>Propheticall</hi> sense, and that this is the last Intervall of the Church of <hi>Christ,</hi> it will naturally so come to passe: For this <hi>Laodicea</hi> will be left Heir to all the Riches of her Sister <hi>Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia,</hi> to Peace, Prosperity, Purity in Worship, abundance of natural Knowledge, universal skill in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations of the Prophecies, and what-ever good thing there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Church, saving the Life and Spirit which <hi>Philadelphia</hi> carried along with her into the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world. How easily then and naturally, or rather necessarily, does this Description of the Church of
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:94112:124"/>
                        <hi>Laodicea</hi> fall upon the last Intervall?</p>
                     <p>And, lastly, It is a Question ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely obvious to demand, Why that phrase, <hi>He that hath an ear to hear, let him hear,</hi> which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour so often is found to adde at the end of his Parables to the people, should be used here so repeatedly in every Epistle, they being no Parables, but Epistles sent to each of those Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Churches in <hi>Asia</hi> respectively: And then, why this <hi>Epiphonema</hi> is sometimes the last close of the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, sometimes not. To which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleme there is no tolerable Solution in the <hi>Literal</hi> sense of these Epistles. But supposing a <hi>Mysticall</hi> or <hi>Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall</hi> sense, there was a necessity of affixing this <hi>Epiphonema,</hi> to shew there was a farther sense intended then that of the <hi>Letter:</hi> and also, that sometimes this <hi>Epiphonema</hi> should come last of all, (as in the four last Epistles,) that the Promise to the Conquerour, <hi>to him that overcomes,</hi> might be more certainly understood to be of a proper <hi>Propheticall</hi> or <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticall</hi>
                        <pb n="184" facs="tcp:94112:125"/>
sense, not merely <hi>Theologicall, Moral</hi> or <hi>Spiritual;</hi> as has been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly declared in the Exposition.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. We might have drawn many more Questions and Solutions from the consideration of the <hi>Letter,</hi> and of this <hi>Hypothesis</hi> we go upon, to shew its solidity and fitnesse, but that we hold it needlesse, having produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced so many already: which jointly considered, with the perpetuall easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and naturalnesse of the whole Exposition of all the Epistles, and the exact Correspondency of the Names of the Churches to the Events of the successive Intervalls of the true Catholick Church which they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, one would think they should not fail fully to satisfie any unprejudiced Peruser of our Exposition of these E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles, touching the truth thereof. But I am abundantly taught by Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that both the finding out, and receiving of Divine Truths found out by others, is a special gift of God. And therefore to him alone be the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for ever and ever,</p>

                  <head>To the Reader.</head>
                  <p>Reader,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>I</hi> Suppose thou wilt expect some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing should be said of this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing Discourse also, though it needs not be much. The occasion of writing it, and the fitnesse of joyning it to the foregoing Exposition of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Churches, will discover themselves to thee in the perusing of the Treatise it self.</p>
                  <p>I must confess I have treated of this Argument elsewhere, namely, in my <note n="*" place="margin">Part 1. Book 1. Ch. 5. to the 17. Chap.</note> 
                     <hi>Mysterie of Iniquity.</hi> But it is a Subject of that great Importance, that it deserves an entire Treatise apart by it self, and that girt up in the most close and convictive method that may be: that those that are sanable or preservable from this dreadfull sin of Idolatry may finde the efficacy of our Antidote; and those whose minds it cannot alter may (however) be found without excuse. And there is this considerable here above
<pb facs="tcp:94112:129"/>
what I have done already on this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, that here is such an expresse Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication made of the Theorie to the grosse Errours in this point and foul Mispractices of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Those of ours that speak the most favourably of that Church cannot but declare them guilty of <hi>Material</hi> Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, as they call it. And questionlesse there must be something among them very like that great Sin, if there be any truth or sense in the Visions of that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Volume of the <hi>Apocalypse.</hi> For the order of things and demonstration of the Synchronisms do necessarily cast those Visions that represent the concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as Idolatrous <hi>(Chap. 13.</hi> and <hi>17.)</hi> upon the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> (as also <hi>Ch. 2. v. 14—20;)</hi> and they can belong to none else in the Propheticall scope of the Visions, Time and Place and the Order of things having so unavoidably fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them upon her. Wherefore even ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Divine suffrage they are guilty of <hi>Idolatry</hi> in one sense or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or come so nigh it, that the Spirit of God in a jealousie, to exaggerate
<pb facs="tcp:94112:129"/>
their Wantonness, speaks to them as such, to deterre them from those suspec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ways, and dangerous approches to so horrible a Crime.</p>
                  <p>And grant it were but thus, yet both in the Vision of the <note n="*" place="margin">Apoc. 2. 20.</note> Seven Churches, and in that of the <note n="*" place="margin">Apoc. 18. 4.</note> Whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> the people of God are expresly called un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to and encouraged and commissioned to forsake the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>'s Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. So that the <hi>Protestants</hi> have not the least guilt of Schism upon them for leaving her, no not upon this more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable Supposition.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But, alas! alas! this smooth <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis</hi> is but a pleasing Dream arising from the softnesse and sleepinesse of the carnal minde, and the love of those things that must passe away as a Dream or Phantasm of the night. <hi>Let God be <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 4.</note> true, and every man a liar,</hi> as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle speaks. And truly the Spirit of God would scarce speak true, if what is spoken of Idolatry so broadly and so expresly in those Visions (insomuch that they have been understood of the Heathen Idolatry even for this very
<pb facs="tcp:94112:130"/>
reason by learned and able Interpreters) should, now we are necessitated to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand them of <hi>Rome</hi> Christian in her apostatized condition, not amount to the Charge of any <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal</hi> Idolatry at all.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But the desperatenesse of their case is, that if they were not represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by these Visions as Idolatrous, that is to say, if these Visions had never been writ, or now they are writ, though they were to be understood of some others, and not of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> yet appealing to the nature of the thing, to the true Notion of Idolatry <hi>properly</hi> and <hi>formally</hi> so called, and to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged Doctrine of their Church expressed in the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> and their universal Practices abetted by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Authority, this alone is sufficient to demonstrate them to be Idolaters <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly</hi> so called. Which is the scope of this present Treatise.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Which therefore doth confirm and corroborate, and place beyond all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, the Orthodox Protestant In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations of those Visions that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
<pb facs="tcp:94112:130"/>
the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> which in this last Age have been made so clear, and every way so natural and congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that this one thing granted of their Idolatry, there cannot be the least scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the truth and congruity of the rest of the Applications.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. And I cannot but adore the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse of Divine Providence, that has furnished his Church with these Oracles to be the Guide of the Faithfull in these latter Ages, which are as it were the dregs of those times which the Spirit of Prophecy has set no good character up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; wherein there is such an Inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Wickednesse and Prophanenesse, that there is scarce any Faith to be found upon earth. But that Church which has deluded the world with so many Ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons could never forge those Prophecies that are so punctually true, and so cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly set out all her grosse Miscarria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and as expresly foretell her Ruine, unlesse she will humble her self, and pluck in her horns, lay aside her bold boasts of Infallibility, and be content to be taught to cast away her Idols, and be
<pb facs="tcp:94112:131"/>
cured of her Dropsie and unnatural thirst after the bloud of the Saints and the bloud of the Martyrs of <hi>Jesus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. Nor can I on the other side suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently admire the stupidity of some of our own, and their grosse ingratitude to Divine Providence, that have so slight a regard to a Book of that mighty weight and moment as the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> is, and think it such a subject, as that any good Wit must needs mis-place his time if he meddle with it: which is more then a Pagan irreverence to so holy and so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Oracles. The <hi>Romans</hi> of old had another esteem for the Verses of the <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylls: Nihil enim ità custodiebant neque sanctum neque sacrum quem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>admodum Sibyllina Oracula,</hi> as <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nysius Halicarnasseus</hi> testifies. And it was an high honour to be the Keepers, much more the right Expounders, of them. But that which God of his mercy offers to all, such is either the idlenesse, frivolousness or profaneness of the spirits of men, that it is scarce accepted of any.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. The truth is, most men are loath to be <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, to be <hi>messengers of
<pb facs="tcp:94112:131"/>
ill news</hi> to the greatest, that is to say, to the corruptest, part of Christendome; but rather affect the glory and security of being accounted of so humane, of so sweet and ingratiating a temper, as that they can surmize well of all mens Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions; and so think to conciliate to themselves the fame of either civil and good Natures, or of highly-raised and released Wits, (though it be indeed but a spice of the old abhorred <hi>Gnosticism,)</hi> that can comply with any Religion, and make a fair tolerable sense of all.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. But these are such high strains of pretense to Wit or Knowledge and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility as I must confess I could never yet arrive to, nor I hope ever shall: though I am not in the mean time so stupid in my way, as to think I can write thus freely without offence. And yet on the contrary, I can deem my self no more uncivil then I do him that wrings his friend by the nose to fetch him out of a Swound.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. I am not insensible how harsh this charge of Idolatry against the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will sound in some ears, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially it being seconded with that other

of Murther, and that the most cruel and barbarous imaginable, and finally so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely rewarded with an impossibility of Salvation to any now, so long as they continue in Communion with that Church.

                  <p n="11">11. I doubt not but many will be prone to cry out, This is a very rude
<pb facs="tcp:94112:132"/>
piece of Uncharitablenesse to all <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists.</hi> But I say, it were a most <hi>perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> kinde of Civility, even to them them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, (to say nothing of the Injury to our Church and Countrey,) to declare otherwise. But if this be the main Odium that sticks upon so true and usefull a Conclusion, that it is so far estranged from the spirit of Charity, hear but this brief Parable, Reader, and then I will leave it to thy self to judge, and conclude.</p>
                  <p>There was a certain Knight bravely mounted, as it might seem, and in goodly equippage, in bright armour, a rich scarf about his shoulders, and a large plume of feathers in his Helmet, who was bound for the <hi>Castle of Health,</hi> seated on an high Hill, not unlike to the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micilium Salutis</hi> in <hi>Cebes</hi> his Table, which therefore he easily kept in his eye. But the way he was in being something stony and rough, and leading not so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly as he thought to the desired Castle, he diverted out of the way, and descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into a green Plain; but not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whether it was all passable to the Castle, called to some Loyterers there
<pb facs="tcp:94112:133"/>
in the field, to enquire of them; who came right willingly to the Knight, scra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping many legs to him, and desiring him to tell his demands.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. There was an old Shepherd likewise not far off, who, by that time this idle people had got to the Knight, had come down to him also. Friends, said he, to those men he called, Is the way passable and safe through this green Plain to yonder Castle? pointing to the <hi>Castle of Health</hi> with his Warder. Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry safe, may it please your Worship, said they; and, shrugging their shoulders, and scraping many legs, asked a Largesse of the Knight, pretending they had been at common work not far off. Whereupon the Knight put his hand into his pocket, and gave them liberally. But are there no Bogs, said he, nor Lakes betwixt this and the Castle? Some small inconsidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sloughs it may be, said they; but you will meet with the <hi>Holy Society of the Wipers</hi> every-where, who will be ready to wipe you as clean as a Clock before you come at the Castle. And being so excellently well mounted as we see you
<pb facs="tcp:94112:133"/>
are, namely, upon that famous Steed renowned over all the world, the infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible-footed <hi>Aplanedo,</hi> so good an Horse as that he never stumbles, your Worship need fear no disaster at all: Besides, the Beast, God blesse him, has a Nose like any Hound, and by a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous sagacity, without any Reason or humane Literature, with an un-er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring certainty he can smell out the right way, and so secure you from all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. To say nothing how excellent he is at the swimming any water, and how he can tread the very air, he is so high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metall'd and light-footed. <hi>Onely be sure to keep fast in the Saddle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And then, Sir Knight, said the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, if the wind blow fair, the plumes in your Helmet may help to support you both; but if not, some Angel from Heaven may take you by the Crest of your Helmet, as he did the Prophet <hi>Habakuk</hi> by the hair of his head, when he carried him through the air from <hi>Judea</hi> into <hi>Babylon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="13">13. The Knight looking back, (for he was not aware of the Shepherd at
<pb facs="tcp:94112:134"/>
this time,) What con<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> man is this, said he, that talks this phanciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? May it please your Worship, he is a Shepherd, said they, and has a Flock on yonder little Hill hard by; but he is one of the most self-conceited old fools that ever your Worship met with in all your days: he thinks that all skill and knowledge lies within the compasse of his baldpate and wrinkled fore-head, though few or none are of the same opinions with himself. Sir Knight, said the Shepherd, I pretend to no skill nor knowledge but what is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly within mine own ken; but what I know, I love to speak freely. And I tell you, Sir Knight, unlesse you be stark staring mad you will never follow these mens counsels, nor venture over this Moor to that Castle: for you will be swallowed up horse and man into a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thomlesse Lake of ill-sented mire, for all the nice nostrills of <hi>Aplanedo.</hi> You was in a more hopefull way before, though something rough; but it is so streight before you come at the Castle, that you could never have got through, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
<pb facs="tcp:94112:134"/>
you had left <hi>Aplanedo</hi> behind you. He's an old cholerick Dotard, said those other fellows; <hi>be but sure to keep the Saddle,</hi> and we dare warrant your Worship, (our lives for yours) that <hi>Aplanedo</hi> will carry you safe through all dangers.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore upon the renewall of the high conceit the Knight had before of his Steed, and those confident Anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his mercenary Counsellers, he set on in a direct line toward the Castle over this Moor; the Shepherd looking after him to see the event. But the Knight had not rid two or three bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shots from the place, but the Shepherd saw them suddenly sink horse and man into the ground, so that they were both buried alive in the mire.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. Whereupon fetching a deep sigh after so Tragicall a spectacle, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with a sad heart and slow pace towards his Sheep on the top of the Hill, drailing his Sheephook behinde him, as they do their Spears at the Funeral of a Souldier: whom his Dog followed with a like soft pace, hanging down his head,
<pb facs="tcp:94112:135"/>
and letting his tail flag, as if he had a minde to conform to both the sorrows and postures of his Master. But those other false Companions had somewhat before this got to a lone Alehouse not far off, to spend the Knight's Largesse merrily with a bonny young Hostesse, and in plenty of good Ale and Cakes to celebrate his Funerall.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. Now, Reader, I dare appeal to thy judgement which of these parties, the old free-spoken Shepherd, or those mercenary Flatterers, had the greater share of Charity; and to determine with thy self in what a sad condition those of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are, who, having the opportunity of being better instructed, as the Knight had, are yet led away captive by such cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Deceivers. Which is the main State of the Controversie. <hi>If I had not come and spoken unto them, they <note place="margin">John 15. 22.</note> had not had sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin,</hi> saith our blessed Saviour, in the Gospel. The rest of the Riddle, Reader, I leave to thine own unravelling, and bid thee Farewell.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. I.</head>
                     <argument>
                        <p>What is <hi>Idolatry</hi> according to Divine Declaration.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. THere are two ways in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of discovering what is or ought to be held to be Idolatry amongst Christians; the one, Divine Declaration, the other, clear &amp; perspicuous Reason: Which though they may haply reach the one no farther then the other, that is to say, that whatsoever may be concluded to be Idolatry by Divine Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the same may also by unprejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:94112:136"/>
Reason, and <hi>vice vers'd;</hi> yet their joint concurrence of Testimony is a greater assurance to us of the truth; and two cords twisted together are stronger then either single. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we will make use of both, and begin with Divine Declaration first.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The first Conclusion therefore shall be, That as in civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments it is the Right of the Supreme power to define and declare what shall be or be held to be Treason, and punishable as such: so it is most manifestly the Right of God <hi>Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> who is also infinitely <hi>good</hi> and <hi>wise,</hi> to define and declare to his people what shall be or be held to be Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, which is a kind of Treason a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God, or <hi>crimen laesae majestatis Divinae.</hi> And what is thus declared Idolatry by God is to be held by us to be such, though the Ludicrous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and Fugitivenesse of our wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton Reason might otherwise find out many starting-holes and fine preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to excuse this thing or that action from so foul an Imputation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="3" facs="tcp:94112:136"/>
But as in civil affairs the declaring such and such things to be Treason does in a Politicall sense make them so <hi>ipso facto:</hi> so God's declaring such and such things to be Idolatry, they do to us <hi>ipso facto</hi> become Idolatry thereby: though to an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary apprehension, perhaps, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this would have seemed Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, nor that Idolatry, without these antecedent Declarations. But where the Law-giver is <hi>infallible,</hi> there is all the reason in the world we should submit not onely to his Power, but to his Judgement in the Definitions of things, and rest sure that that is Idolatry which he has thought fit to declare so to be.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The second Conclusion; That what is declared Idolatry by God to the <hi>Jews</hi> ought to be acknowledged Idolatry by us Christians. The ground of this Conclusion is fixed in the nature of the Christian Religion. For <hi>Christianity</hi> being a far more spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Religion then that of <hi>Judaism,</hi> and therefore abhorring from all Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94112:137"/>
there cannot be the least Relaxation to the most rancid of all Superstitions, Idolatry it self. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whatsoever was accounted Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry amongst the <hi>Jews,</hi> and so defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by a Divine Law, must be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned much more such under Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, there being not the least pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence for any Relaxation.</p>
                     <p>Besides, there was nothing under the <hi>Jews</hi> (or can by any people be) rightly deemed Idolatry, but it is carefully enough cautioned against and plainly forbid in the first and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Commandments of the Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue. But the whole Decalogue is Moral, and so declared by God, in that it is said to be writ by his own <note place="margin">Exod. 31. 18.</note> finger on the Tables of stone, (which are Symbols of the permanent sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of our Souls, on which all the general Precepts of Morality are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven as innate Notions of our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.) And therefore it is hereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated that the Precepts of the Decalogue are just and fitting, not onely <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, but <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, not onely by
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94112:137"/>
an externall Law, but engraffed in our very Nature and Reason; and that the root and ground of them will easily be fetch'd from thence.</p>
                     <p>To which you may adde, That it were a very immethodicall and hete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogeneous Botch, unworthy of the Wisedome of God and of his Servant <hi>Moses,</hi> whenas all the rest of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calogue is Moral, to phansy one or two of the Commandments of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nature. This is so rash and gross a Reproach to the Divine Wisedome as truly, in my judgement, seems un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excusable.</p>
                     <p>But besides this, The Morality of the Decalogue is also acknowledged by the Church, it making part of their Liturgie every-where, and we begging an ability of obeying the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Commandment as well as the rest: and <hi>Christ</hi> also referrs to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calogue <note place="margin">Mark 10. 18, 19.</note> for eternall life.</p>
                     <p>And lastly, It seems as it were sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled from all the rest of <hi>Moses</hi> Laws, as a lasting and permanent Law to the Church of God, (whence it is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94112:138"/>
into our very Catechisms,) ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be abolished, or rather vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously to be kept in force, for the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Commandment's sake particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, that it might strongly bear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst those Invitations to Idolatry that may seem to offer themselves in the nature of our Religion, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim the Church from it when they were fallen into it, as well as it was to keep back the <hi>Jews</hi> from joyning in Worship with their Idolatrous neighbors round about them. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all manner of Idolatry being cautioned against by the Moral De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calogue given to the <hi>Jews,</hi> there are no kinds thereof that ought to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained or allow'd of by any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The third Conclusion; That what-ever was Idolatry in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, the same is Idolatry in us, if we commit it. The reason of which Assertion is this, Because the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then had not so express a Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from God against all manner of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry as the <hi>Jews</hi> and Christians
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94112:138"/>
have: and therefore where-ever they are guilty of Idolatry, the <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Christian,</hi> if they doe the like things, are much more.</p>
                     <p>The fourth Conclusion; The Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry of the Pagans consisted in this, <hi>viz.</hi> in that they either took some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be the supreme God that was not, and worshipped it for such; or else worshipped the supreme God in an Image; or gave religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, that is to say, erected Altars, Temples and Images, offered Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, made Vows to, and invoked, such as they themselves knew not to be the supreme God, but either the Souls of men departed, or other <hi>Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> or else particular Appearances or Powers of Nature.</p>
                     <p>The fifth; That both Divine Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration and the common Consent of Christendome do avouch to us, that all the aforesaid Pagan Modes of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry practised by them were in those Pagans practices of Idolatry. And therefore, by the third Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, they must be much more
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:94112:139"/>
so in either the <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Christian.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. The sixth; That giving religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Worship, that is to say, erecting Temples, building Altars, Invoking, making Vows, and the like, to what is not the supreme God, though not as to him, but as to some inferiour helpfull Being, is manifest Idolatry. This is plain out of the precedent Conclusion; and may be farther con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed from this Consideration, That Idolatry was very rare amongst the Nations, especially the <hi>Romans,</hi> if this Mode of Idolatry be not truly I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry. And scarce any thing will be found Idolatry amongst them, but taking that to be the supreme God which is not, and worshipping it for such. But if any Being on this side the supreme God may be worshipped with religious Worship void of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, all things may, though some more non-sensically and ridiculously then others. Wherefore to use any of the abovesaid Modes of Worship to what is inferiour to the supreme Being, though not as to the supreme
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:94112:139"/>
Being, must be Idolatry; or else the <hi>Roman</hi> Paganism it self is very rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if at all, chargeable therewith, they having a Notion accurate e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of the supreme God, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct enough from their other Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; so that unlesse they chance to worship him in an Image, they will seldome be found Idolaters, or rather never, according to the opinion of some, who say, none that have the knowledge of the one true God can be capable of Idolatry.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The seventh; That to sacrifice, burn Incense, or make any religious Obeisance or Incurvation to an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage in any wise, as to an Object of this Worship, is Idolatry by Divine Declaration. This is manifest out of the second Conclusion and the first, as may appear at first sight. For it is plainly declared in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Precept of the Decalogue touching Images, <hi>Thou shalt not bow to them, nor worship them:</hi> Of which undoubtedly the sense is, They shall not be in any wise the Object of that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94112:140"/>
Worship which thou performest in a religious way, whether by Bowing down to them, or by what other way soever. For the second Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment certainly is a Declaration of the mind of God touching religious Worship, let the Ceremonies be what they will.</p>
                     <p>The eighth; That to erect Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, Altars, Images, or to burn In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense, to Saints or Angels, to invoke them, or make Vows to them, and the like, is plain Idolatry. This is apparent chiefly out of the third, fourth, fifth and sixth Conclusions of this Chapter. For the Pagans <hi>Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> exquisitely answer to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians Saints and Angels in this point; saving that this spiritual Fornication is a Rape upon our Saints and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, but simple Fornication in the Heathen with their impure <hi>Daemons.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ninth; Religious Incurvation towards a Crucifix, or the Host, or any Image, as to an Object, and not a mere unconsidered accidental Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance, is Idolatry. This is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:94112:140"/>
out of the seventh and eighth Conclusions. But the Worship of <hi>Latria</hi> exhibited to the Host upon the opinion of Transubstantiation is Idolatry by the third and fourth.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Conclusion the tenth; To use on set purpose in religious Worship any Figure or Image onely <hi>circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantially,</hi> not <hi>objectively,</hi> but so as to bow towards it, or to be upon a man's knees before it with Eyes and Hands devoutly lifted up towards it, but with an intention of making it in no sense any Object of this religious Worship, yet if this were in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try where men usually and professed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do, it were notwithstanding for all this intention a grosse piece of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry.</p>
                     <p>But if the whole Countrey should conspire to make this more plausible sense of those Incurvations and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures; admit we might hope it were not Idolatry, yet it would be certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a most impious and wicked Mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God, and eluding his minde in the second Commandment, (that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94112:141"/>
implies the forbidding any Worship or Incurvation toward Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in a way of Religion,) and a crime as scandalous and near to Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry as the going into bed to another man's Wife, with chast pretensions, would be to grosse Adultery.</p>
                     <p>Nay, indeed, it is very questionable, if he knowingly and deliberately put himself into these postures before an Image, whether the Image will not be the Object of those Postures and Incurvations whether he will or no. Or rather it seems plain, beyond all questioning, that it will be so. For there is a corporeall Action significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of Honour and Respect corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>really (though not mentally) direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted towards and received by the Image, and this at the choice of the Religionist, which intitles him to the fact.</p>
                     <p>But we need not labour much touching this last Conclusion, the two former abundantly convincing the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> of multifari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Idolatries, if they will stand
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:94112:141"/>
to Divine Definitions, or the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations of Holy Scripture touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Point.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>What is <hi>Idolatry</hi> according to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of clear and free Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. WE will now try how ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious the <hi>Romanists</hi> are out of the plain Definitions and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations of free and clear Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. In which Method let us set down for</p>
                     <p>The first Conclusion, That Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is a kinde of Injustice against God. That this is true, may appear from that Definition of Religion in <hi>Tully,</hi> who defines it <hi>Justitiam adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sùs Deum.</hi> Which is not the sense of <hi>Tully</hi> onely, but the very voice of Reason and Nature. And therefore Idolatry being one kinde of Irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Impiety, it must needs include
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:94112:142"/>
in it a kind of Injustice against God.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The second Conclusion; That Idolatry is a very sore and grievous Disease of the Soul, vilely debasing her and sinking her into <hi>Sensuality</hi> and <hi>Materiality,</hi> keeping her at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from the true sense and right knowledge of God, and leaving her more liable to bodily Lusts: That the natural tendency of Idolatry is this, and yet the Souls of men, in this Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed state, are naturally prone to so mischievous a Disease, as both Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and daily Experience do abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly witnesse. See the Mischiefs of Idolatry in my <hi>Mystery of Iniquity,</hi> Part 1. Lib. 1. Ch. 16.</p>
                     <p>Nor can it infringe the truth of this Conclusion, that a man, retaining still the true Notion of God accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his Divine Attributes, may, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to a sense of his own, bow down toward a corporeall Object of worship. For he must retain it by force against such a Practice as would and does naturally debauch the users of it. And besides, if he had really the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:94112:142"/>
Life of God in him as well as the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him, he would feel such Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons grate against his heart, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive how they would invade and attempt the abating and extinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the more true and pure sense of God and of his Worship, and seduce the Soul to externall Vanity.</p>
                     <p>But suppose a man or two could keep their minds from sinking down from a right Notion of the Deity; yet they are as guilty of Idolatry, if they give religious Worship to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreall Objects, as he is of Adultery and Fornication that yet uses them so cautiously as neither to impair his bodily Health, nor besott his natural Parts thereby. And therefore, though there may be some few such, yet the Laws against Fornication and Adultery ought notwithstanding to be very sacred to every one, even to those discreeter Transgressours of them, and ever to be obeyed by them, because the Observation of them is of such infinite importance to the Publick.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="16" facs="tcp:94112:143"/>
And what we have said of the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God is analogically true of honouring of the Saints, who are best honoured by the remembrance and imitation of their Vertues, not by scraping Legs to or clinging about their Images, which are no more like them then an Apple is to an Oister.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The third Conclusion; That those high expressions of the Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie of God and his severe Displeasure against Idolatry are very becoming the nature of the thing, and his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal care of the Souls of men. This appears from the foregoing Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions. For both the Prerogatives and Rights of the Divine Majesty himself are concerned, and also the Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Nobilitation and Salvation of the Souls of men. This we discover by Reason, and our Reason is again more strongly ratify'd by Divine Suffrage.</p>
                     <p>The fourth; That Idolatry, though it be so hainous a Sin, yet where it is committed most in good earnest does necessarily involve in it Ignorance or
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:94112:143"/>
Mistake, in the Act of Worship or in the Object; they either taking the Object to be God when it is not, or to have some Attribute of God when it has not, or to enjoy some Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative of God which yet it does not, or else the Worship not to be Divine when it is; or, lastly, they mistake in the Application of the Worship, thinking they do not apply Divine Worship to an Object when they do.</p>
                     <p>The fifth; That to be mistaken in the Object of Worship, or in the Kind of Worship, or in the Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, cannot excuse any-thing from being downright Idolatry; forasmuch as none are in good earnest Idolaters without some of these Mistakes.</p>
                     <p>The sixth; That the peculiar Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour or Worship which is given to God is given to him not so much as his Honour and Worship, as his Due and Right: insomuch that he that does not give it to God, or communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates it to another, does an injury to the Divine Majesty. This is plain,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:94112:144"/>
and consonant to what was said on the first Conclusion, That Religion is a kinde of Justice towards God. And indeed if Divine Honour was not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to God as his Due and Right, it were no Honour at all, but rather a Benevolence.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The seventh; The Right of that peculiar Honour or Worship we doe to God is grounded either in the nature of his incommunicable Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, or in his Excellencies so far as we know incommunicated to any Creature, or, lastly, in Divine De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration or Prescription of the ways or Modes of thus or thus worshipping him, which himself has some-time set down.</p>
                     <p>The eighth; That any Actions, Gestures or Words directed to any Creature as to an Object, which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally imply or signifie either the incommunicable or incommunicated Eminencies of God, is the giving that Worship that is the Right and Due of God alone to that Creature, and that Injury against the Divine
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:94112:144"/>
Majesty which is termed Idolatry. The evidence of this Conclusion may appear from hence, because there is no other way of Application of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Worship then by directing such significant Actions, Gestures, or Words, toward such a Being as to an Object.</p>
                     <p>The ninth; That the using any of those Actions or Gestures, or doing any of those things that the true and supreme God did chuse and chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge in the setting out the Mode of his own Worship, towards or in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to any Creature as to an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, this also is that Injury against God which we term Idolatry.</p>
                     <p>The Reason is this, Because such a mode of Worship does thus manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear to be the peculiar Right of God, which none can transferr to another but God himself. Wherefore this Right having not been commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated by him to any other, when-e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver such a kind of Worship is used, it must be used to him, and to none else.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="20" facs="tcp:94112:145"/>
Nor can his dereliction of any such Mode of being worshipped warrant the use of it to any Creature after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, because no Creature can be God in those circumstances as he thought fit to institute such a Worship for himself in: For no Creature can be God at all, and therefore never capable of any of those Modes of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worship which God ever at any time instituted for himself. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, if this dereliction and disuse of any Mode of Worship might make it competible to a Creature, then might we sacrifice Beeves and Sheep (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides other Services of the Temple) to any Saint or <hi>Daemon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. The tenth; An omnipercipient Omnipresence, which does hear and see what-ever is said or transacted in the World, whether considered in the whole, or as distributed into <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restriall, celestiall,</hi> and <hi>supercelestiall,</hi> not onely all these Omnipercipien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies but any one of them is a certain Excellency in God, and, for ought we know, incommunicated to any Creature.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="21" facs="tcp:94112:145"/>
The eleventh; That this Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presence or Omnipercipience <hi>terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striall</hi> is one main ground of that reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Worship due to God which we call Invocation. This is plain, that upon this very ground that God hears and sees (though himself be invisible) what-ever is said or done upon earth, he has the honour of being invoked any-where or every-where, and of having Temples built to him; because he that is omnipresent cannot be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent from his Temple, but is alway there to be invoked.</p>
                     <p>The twelfth; That if Omnipre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence or Omnipercipience, at least <hi>terrestriall,</hi> (if not <hi>celestiall,)</hi> be not communicated to Saints and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels by God, the Invocation of either is palpable Idolatry. This is manifest from the eighth Conclusion. For In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation implies an incommunicated Excellency in the Saints or Angels, and so communicates that Right to them that appertains onely to God, and is that Injury against God that is called Idolatry.</p>
                     <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                        <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:94112:146"/>
                     <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                        <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:94112:146"/>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="22" facs="tcp:94112:147"/>
So that it is a vain Evasion that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends that we honour God the more in making him so good to the Saints and Angels, as to bestow this Excellency on them; whenas yet his Wisedome has not thought fit so to doe. For we are so far from honoring him hereby, that we injure him in giving his Right to another; and we dishonour him in presuming he had done wiselier or better in doing what he has not done. Whenas indeed, if he were so lavish in imparting his proper Excellencies to Creatures as some would make us believe he is, to palliate their own I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatries, it were the next way to make men forget all Applications to God, and to cast him out of their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, and take up with the more particular Patronages of Saints and Angels.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The thirteenth; That our thinking such a Saint or Angel can hear us where-ever we invoke him, is no excuse for our Invocation of him, nor saves us from Idolatry, since all Idolatry committed in good
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:94112:147"/>
earnest implies some Mistake, as has been noted in the fourth Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
                     <p>The fourteenth; That all the Modes or ways of the Communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Omnipercipiency to Saints or Angels are either very incredible, if not impossible, or extremely ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous as to any excuse for their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation. For the usual Residence of Saints and Angels being <hi>in sede Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torum,</hi> as the <hi>Roman</hi> Church holds, and that place on the <hi>Coelum Empy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reum</hi> above all the Stars, That the Angels and Saints should upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Exaltednesse of their natures see and hear from thence what is done or said from one side of the Earth to the other, is extremely incredible, if not impossible; yea, sufficiently incredible, or rather im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, though they had their abode on this side of the Moon.</p>
                     <p>And that they should see all things and transactions, hear all Prayers and Orations, <hi>in Speculo Divinitatis,</hi> is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like incredible; a thing which the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:94112:148"/>
Humanity of <hi>Christ</hi> himself, though hypostatically united to the Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, did not pretend to. But that God should either in this <hi>Speculum</hi> or any otherwise advertise them that such a one prays to them that they would pray to him for that party, is it not at first sight above all measure ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous?</p>
                     <p>And alike ridiculous it is to pray to Saint or Angel, as if they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and heard our Prayers, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they are absent, and cannot tell that we did pray, unlesse by some In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligencers. This Devotion is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper and unnatural act, and shews that we doe that to an invisible Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which is onely proper to be done to the invisible God; and that therefore it is Idolatry, as giving that right of Worship to others which is onely congruous to him.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The fifteenth; That though there were communicated by God to Saints and Angels at least a <hi>terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striall</hi> Omnipercipiency, yet if he have not communicated the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:94112:148"/>
thereof to us, as most certainly he has not, the Invocation of them is notwithstanding a very presumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous invasion of the indubitable Rights of God, and the intrenching upon his Prerogatives, and therefore as to the internall Act no lesse then the Sin of Idolatry.</p>
                     <p>The Reasons of this Conclusion are, First, That God concealing from us the knowledge of the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of this Excellency, does natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally thereby intimate that he would not have them invoked, but reserves the Honour of our Invocation of an invisible Power unto himself onely.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That whatsoever is not of saith is sin: and therefore the ground of Invocation of Saints or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels being at least dubitable, their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation is sin; and it being about the Rights of God in his Worship, what can it be better esteemed then Idolatry?</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, This Principle of feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or groundlesly coneeiting, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Revelation from God, that
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:94112:149"/>
any Creatures are capable of such Honours as are God's indubitable Right and Prerogative, is the Forge and Shop, the Palliation and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tense, for infinite sorts and odly-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cogitated varieties of Idolatrous Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: and therefore so presumptuous and so abominable a Principle, which is the Mother and Nurse of such infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite ways of Idolatry and Injustice against God, even according to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Reason ought to be declared against as Idolatrous; and, conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, all the practices thereupon are also to be declared Idolatry, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they spring from a Principle ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up which is such a fundamental piece of Idolatry and Injustice against God, and exposes him to all manner of Idolatrous Injuries.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, To dare to doe an act we know not whether it may be Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry or no, and this needlesly, our Conscience not at all compelling us thereto, this is to dare to commit Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry; and the daring to commit Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, and so to doe defiance to the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:94112:149"/>
Majesty of God, what is it less then to be an Idolater? For according to his inward man and the main Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the action he is so: As he is morally a Murtherer that, doubting or not knowing but that it is his own Friend, by luck killed his intended Enemy: For the sense is, that rather then not be revenged of his Enemy, he will not stick to kill his dearest Friend.</p>
                     <p>And finally, This Idolatry is the more discernible and aggravable in the Invocation of Saints or Angels, their Omnipercipiency being so extremely incredible, if not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible or ridiculous, upon any ground, as appears by the foregoing Conclusion.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. The sixteenth; That the ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of a symbolicall Presence with Incurvations thitherward, the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crating of Temples and Altars, the making of Oblations, the burning of Incense, and the like, were declared by the supreme God, the God of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> the manner of Worship due to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:94112:150"/>
him, and therefore, without his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession, this Mode of Worship is not to be given to any else; as appears by Conclusion the ninth.</p>
                     <p>The seventeenth; That the Pagans worshipping their <hi>Daemons,</hi> though not as the supreme God, by symboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Presences, Temples, Altars, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, and the like, become <hi>ipso fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> Idolaters. This is manifest from the ninth, the fifteenth, and the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Conclusion.</p>
                     <p>The eighteenth; Though it were admitted that there is communicated to Saints and Angels at least a <hi>terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striall</hi> Omnipercipiency, and that we had the knowledge of this Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, and so might speak to them in a civil way, though unseen; yet to invoke them in such Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as at an Altar and in a Temple de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to them, or at their symbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall presence, this were palpable Idolatry. The truth is manifest agian from the ninth and sixteenth Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. The nineteenth; Incurvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:94112:150"/>
in way of Religion towards any open or bare symbolicall Presence, be it what-ever Figure or Image, as to an Object, is flat Idolatry: in the Worship of Saints, Angels and <hi>Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> double Idolatry; in the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of the true God, single. The reason hereof is resolved partly into the ninth and sixteenth Conclusions, and partly into the nature of Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Worship. For externall Worship is not any otherwise to be conceived to be apply'd to a symbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall Presence, but by being directed towards it as towards an Object. Wherefore if religious Incurvation be directed towards any Figure or Image as to an Object, this Figure or Image necessarily receives this reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Incurvation, and partakes with God (if the Image be to him,) in it; which is manifest Idolatry. For the direction of our Intention here is but a Jesuiticall Juggle. And therefore I will set down for Conclusion</p>
                     <p>The twentieth, That religious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curvation toward a bare symbolicall
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:94112:151"/>
Presence, wittingly and conscienci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously directed thither, though with a mental reserve, that they intend to use it merely as a Circumstance of Worship, is notwithstanding real I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry.</p>
                     <p>The Reason is, because an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Action toward such a thing as is look'd upon as receptive of such an Action, (and has frequently received it,) if it be thus or thus directed, will naturally conciliate the notions or respects of Action and Object be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt these two, whether we intend it or no. And it is as ridiculous to pretend that their motions or actions toward or about such a symbolicall Presence are not directed to it or conversant about it as an Object, as it were for an Archer to contend that the Butt he shoots at is not the Scope or Object, but a Circumstance, of his Shooting; and he that embraces his Friend, that his Friend is not an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, but a Circumstance, of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing. Which are Conceits quite out of the rode of all Logick. See
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:94112:151"/>
the last Conclusion of the foregoing Chapter.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. The twenty-first; That the Adoration of any Object which we, out of mistake, conceive to be the true God made visible by hypostatical union therewith, is manifest Idolatry. The Reason is, because Mistake does not excuse from Idolatry, by Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion the fourth and the fifth. And in this Supposition we misse of one part of the Object, and the onely part that single is capable of Divine Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. For God to be disunited from this adored Object is in this case all one as to be absent: For God is not considered nor intended in this act of Adoration but as united with this visible Object. Which respect of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on if it fail, that consideration or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention also fails, and the Worship falls upon a mere Creature.</p>
                     <p>In brief, If out of mistake I salute some lively Statue or dead body for such or such a living man, though this Man or his Soul were present, and saw and heard the Salutation, yet I
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:94112:152"/>
play the fool, and make my self ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, and am conceived not to have saluted him I would: So if I doe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration to any Object, suppose the Sun or some Magicall Statue, for the true Deity visible, whenas neither of them are so, I play the Idolater, and make my self impious, and have mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of the due Object of my Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. The twenty-second; That the Adoration of the Host upon the presumption that it is transubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the living Body of <hi>Christ</hi> is rank Idolatry. This appears from the precedent Conclusion. To which you may adde, that the <hi>Romanists,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Transubstantiation the true ground of their Adoration of the Host, do themselves imply, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it were so their Adoration there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of would be Idolatry. But that it is not so, and that their Ground is false, any body may be as well assured of as he can of any thing in the world: and no lesse assured that they are I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolaters according to their own Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:94112:152"/>
and Implication, as <hi>Costerus</hi> indeed does most emphatically and expresly acknowledge it, if they be mistaken in their Doctrine of <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation;</hi> as we shall hear anon.</p>
                     <p>The twenty-third Conclusion; That Adoration given to the Host by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants or any else that hold not Transubstantiation is manifest Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. The Reason is to be fetch'd from the nineteenth and twentieth Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions. For it is religious Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion towards a bare corporeall Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bol of the Divine Presence, and, to make the Action more aggravable, towards a Symbol that has Imagery upon it, and that of the person that is pretended to be worshipped there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. What can be Idolatry if this be not?</p>
                     <p>The twenty-fourth; That the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of Saints and Angels, though attended with these considerations, that both that Excellency we sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose in them, and which makes them capable of that Honour, is deemed finite, and also (be it as great as it
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:94112:153"/>
will) wholly derived to them from God, yet it cannot for all this be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused from grosse Idolatry. This is clear from the seventh, eighth, tenth, and so on till the sixteenth Conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For though this Excellency be supposed finite, yet if it be so great as that it is no-where to be found but in God, it is his Right onely to have such Honours as suppose it. And though it be deemed or conceived to be derived from God, yet if it be not, we give an uncommunicate Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency to the Creature, and rob God of his Right and Honour. And, last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, though this Excellency were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, but yet the Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it unreveal'd to us, it were a treasonable Presumption against the Majesty of God, thus of our own head to divulge such things as may violate the peculiar Rights of his Godhead, and (for ought we know) fill the world with infinite bold ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of the grossest Idolatry: and therefore all our practices upon this Principle must be Idolatrous, and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:94112:153"/>
Treasonable against the Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty. Consider well the fifteenth Conclusion.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. The last Conclusion; That this pretended Consideration, that where <hi>Christ</hi> is corporeally present, Divine Worship is not done to his Humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but to his Divinity, and that therefore, though the Bread should not prove transubstantiated, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worship will still be done to the same Object as before, <hi>viz.</hi> to the Divinity, which is every-where, and therefore in the Bread; this will not excuse the Adoration of the Host from palpable Idolatry.</p>
                     <p>For first, That part of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tense that supposes Divine Worship in no sense due or to be done to <hi>Christ</hi>'s Humanity is false. For it is no greater presumption to say, that in some sense Divine Worship is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable to the Humanity of <hi>Christ,</hi> then, that the Divinity is communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated thereto. In such sense then as the Divinity is communicated to the Humanity, which are one by hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staticall
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:94112:154"/>
Union, may Divine Worship also be communicated to it; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as an acknowledgement that the Divinity with all its adorable Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes is hypostatically, vitally and transplendently residing in this Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity of <hi>Christ.</hi> Which is a kinde of Divine Worship of <hi>Christ</hi>'s Humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and peculiar to him alone, and due to him, I mean, to his Humanity, though it be not God essentially, but onely hypostatically united with him that is; and does as naturally partake of Religious or Divine Worship in our Addresses to the Divinity, as the body of an eminently-vertuous, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and wise man does of that great Reverence and civil Honour done to him for those Excellencies that are more immediately lodged in his Soul.</p>
                     <p>Which Honour indistinctly passes upon the whole man: And as the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bodily Presence of this vertuous person receives the civil Honour, so in an easie Analogy doth the Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of <hi>Christ</hi> receive the Divine; but both as partial Objects of what
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:94112:154"/>
they do receive, and with significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the state of the whole case, <hi>viz.</hi> that they are united, the one with the Divinity, the other with so vertuous a Soul. Hence they both become due Objects of that entire externall Worship done towards them, to the one civil, to the other Divine.</p>
                     <p>And therefore, in the second place, it is plain, that there is not one and the same due Object capable of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Worship in either Supposition, as well in that which supposes the Bread transubstantiated, as in that which supposes it not transubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. For in the former it is the true and living corporeall Presence of <hi>Christ,</hi> whose whole <hi>Suppositum</hi> is, as has been declared, capable of Divine Honour; but in the latter there is onely, at the most, but his symboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Presence, whose Adoration is I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry, by the nineteenth, twentieth and twenty-first Conclusions.</p>
                     <p>And lastly, The pretending that though the Bread be not transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated, yet the Divinity of <hi>Christ</hi> is
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:94112:155"/>
there, and so we do not misse of the due Object of our Worship; this is so laxe an Excuse, that it will plead for the warrantableness of the <hi>Laplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> worshipping their Red cloth, or the <hi>Americans</hi> the Devil, let them but pretend they worship God in them. For God is also in that Red cloth and in the Devil in that Notion that he is said to be every-where. Nay, there is not any Object in which the ancient Pagans were mistaken, in taking the Divine Attributes to be lodged there, whether Sun, Heaven, or any other Creature, but by this Sophistry the worshipping thereof may be excused from Idolatry. For the Divine Attributes, as God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, are every-where.</p>
                     <p>To direct our Adoration toward a supernatural and unimitable Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>splendency of the Divine Presence, or to any visible corporeall nature that is hypostatically united with the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, most assuredly is not that sunk and sottish, that dull and dotardly sin of Idolatry. For, as touching this
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:94112:155"/>
latter, to what-ever the Divinity is hypostatically united, or (to avoid all cavill about terms) so specially and mysteriously communicated as it is to <hi>Christ,</hi> the Right of Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship is proportionably communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted therewith, as I have already in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated. And as for the former, That through which the Divine Transplendency appears is no more the Object of our Adoration, then the diaphanous Air is through which the visible Humanity of <hi>Christ</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears when he is worshipped.</p>
                     <p>But the Eucharistick Bread being neither hypostatically united with the Divinity, nor being the <hi>Medium</hi> through which any such supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Transplendency of the Divine Presence appears to us, Adoration directed toward it cannot fail of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing palpable Idolatry. For the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charistick Bread will receive this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration as the Object thereof, by Conclusion the nineteenth and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth. But the Adoration or any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worship of an Object in which
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:94112:156"/>
the Divine Attributes do not perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally reside, (in such a sense as is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated in those words of S. <hi>John, And</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Joh. 1. 14.</note> 
                        <hi>the Word was made flesh,)</hi> but onely locally, as I may so speak, this, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to sound reason and the sense of the Christian Church, must be downright Idolatry.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. This confident Injunction of grosse Idolatry, as it is certainly such, is built upon their confidence of the truth of their Doctrine of Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation. For the Chapter of the Adoration of the Host succeeds that of Transubstantiation, as a natural, or rather necessary, Inference there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from. <hi>Nullus itaque dubitandi locus relinquitur,</hi> &amp;c. That is to say, The Doctrine of Transubstantiation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing established, there is no Scruple left touching the Adoration of the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:94112:157"/>
Host, or giving Divine Worship to the Sacrament (or <hi>Christ,</hi> as it is there called,) when it is carried about, and exposed publickly in Prócessions to the view of the people.</p>
                     <p>But the Doctrine of Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation being false, it must needs fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that the giving of Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship to the Host is as grosse a piece of Idolatry as ever was committed by any of the Heathens. For then their Divine Worship, even their <hi>Cultus Latriae,</hi> which is onely due to the onely-true God, is exhibited to a mere Creature, and that a very sorry one too; and therefore must be gross Idolatry, by the twenty-first and twenty-second Conclusions of the second Chapter.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. But now, that their Doctrine of Transubstantiation is false, after we have proposed it in the very words of the Council, we shall evince by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable Demonstration. <hi>Per conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crationem</hi>

Which is such a contradictious Figment, that there is nothing so repugnant to the Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the humane Soul.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. For thus the Body of <hi>Christ</hi> will be in God knows how many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand places at once, and how many thousand miles distant one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Whenas <hi>Amphitruo</hi> rightly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postulates with his Servant <hi>Sosia,</hi> and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:94112:158"/>
rates him for a Mad-man or Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stour, that he would go about to make him believe that he was at home, though but a little way off, while yet he was with him at that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from home. <hi>Quo id (ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lúm!) pacto potest fieri nunc utî tu hîc sis, &amp; domi?</hi> And a little before, in the same Colloquie with his Servant, <hi>Nemo unquam homo vidit,</hi> saith he, <hi>nec potest fieri, tempore uno homo idem duo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus locis ut simul sit.</hi> Wherein <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phitruo</hi> speaks but according to the common sense and apprehension of all men, even of the meanest Idiots.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. But now let us examine it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Principles of the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and of all their Arts and Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>Physicks, Metaphysicks, Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi> and <hi>Logick.</hi> It is a Principle in <hi>Physicks,</hi> That that internall space that a Body occupies at one time is equal to the Body that occupies it. Now let us suppose one and the same body oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupy two such internall places or spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces at once; This Body is therefore equal to those two spaces, which are
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:94112:158"/>
double to one single space; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the body is double to that body in one single space, and therefore one and the same body double to it self. Which is an enormous Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                     <p>Again, in <hi>Metaphysicks;</hi> The Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of <hi>Christ</hi> is acknowledged one, and that as much as any one body else in the world. Now the Metaphysicall Notion of <hi>one</hi> is, to be <hi>indivisum à se,</hi> (both <hi>quo ad partes</hi> and <hi>quo ad totum,)</hi> as well as <hi>divisum à quolibet alio.</hi> But the Body of <hi>Christ</hi> being both in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and, without any continuance of that body, here upon Earth also, the whole body is divided from the whole body, and therefore is entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly both <hi>unum</hi> and <hi>multa:</hi> which is a perfect Contradiction.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Thirdly, in <hi>Mathematicks;</hi> The Council saying that in the separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the parts of the <hi>Species,</hi> (that which bears the outward show of Bread or Wine,) that from this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision there is a parting of the whole, divided into so many entire Bodies
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:94112:159"/>
of <hi>Christ,</hi> the Body of <hi>Christ</hi> being always at the same time equal to it self, it follows, that a part of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision is equal to the whole, against that common Notion in <hi>Euclide,</hi> That the Whole is bigger then the Part.</p>
                     <p>And, lastly, in <hi>Logick</hi> it is a Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ime, That the Parts agree indeed with the Whole, but disagree one with another. But in the abovesaid Division of the Host or Sacrament the Parts do so well agree, that they are entirely the very same individuall thing. And whereas any Division, whether <hi>Logicall</hi> or <hi>Physicall,</hi> is the Division of some one into many; this is but the Division of one into one and itself, like him that for bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity sake divided his Text into one Part.</p>
                     <p>To all which you may adde, that, unlesse we will admit of two <hi>Sosia's</hi> and two <hi>Amphitruo's</hi> in that sense that the mirth is made with it in <hi>Plautus</hi> his Comedy, neither the Bread nor the Wine can be transubstantiated into the intire Body of <hi>Christ.</hi> For this
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:94112:159"/>
implies that the same thing is, and is not, at the same time. For that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual thing that can be, and is to be made of any thing, is not. Now the individual Body of <hi>Christ</hi> is to be made of the Wafer consecrated, for it is turned into his individual Body. But his individual Body was before this Consecration. Wherefore it was, and it was not, at the same time. Which is against that fundamental Principle in <hi>Logick</hi> and <hi>Metaphysicks,</hi> That both parts of a Contradiction cannot be true; or, That the same thing cannot both be, and not be, at once.</p>
                     <p>Thus fully and intirely contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious and repugnant to all Sense and Reason, to all indubitable Principles of all Art and Science, is this Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Transubstantiation; and therefore most certainly false. Reade the ten first Conclusions of the brief Discourse of <hi>the true Grounds of Faith,</hi> added to the <hi>Divine Dialogues.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. And from Scripture it has not the least support. All is, <hi>Hoc est cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus

And so all the Body of <hi>Christ,</hi> Flesh, Bones, Mouth, Teeth, Hair, Head, Heels, Thighs, Arms, Shoulders, Belly, Back, and all, went through his Mouth into his Stomach; and thus all were in his Stomach, though all his Body intirely, his Stomach exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted, was still without it. Which let any one judge whether it be more likely, then that this saying of <hi>Christ, This is my Body,</hi> is to be understood figuratively; the using the Verb sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantive in this sense being not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usual in Scripture; as in, <hi>I am the Vine; The seven lean Kine are the</hi>

                     <p>And for the trusting of the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church herein that makes it self so sacrosanct &amp; infallible, the Pride, Worldliness, Policy &amp; mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifarious Impostures of that Church, so often and so shamelesly repeated and practised, must needs make their Authority seem nothing in a Point that is so much for their own Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, especially set against the unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable Principles of common Sense and Reason, and of all the Arts and Sciences God has illuminated the Mind of man withall. Consider the twelfth Conclusion of the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named Treatise, together with the other ten before cited.

8. From whence it will unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly follow, and themselves cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it, that they are most grosse and palpable Idolaters, and consequently most barbarous Murtherers, in killing the innocent Servants of God for not submitting to the same Idolatries with themselves. <hi>Costerus</hi> the <hi>Jesuite</hi> speaks expresly to this Point, (and consonantly, I think, to the Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions of the Council;) <hi>viz.</hi> That if their Church be mistaken in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Transubstantiation, they <hi>ipso facto</hi> stand guilty of such a piece of Idolatry as never was before seen or known of in the world.</p>
                     <p>For the errours of those, <hi>saith he,</hi> were more tolerable who worship some <note place="margin">

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:94112:161"/>
for so many hundred years, if the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Transubstantiation be not true.</p>
                     <p>What can be a more full and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse acknowledgement of the gross Idolatry of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> then this, if Transubstantiation prove an Errour? Then which notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding there is nothing in the world more certain to all the Faculties of a man; as is manifest out of what has been here said. And therefore the <hi>Romanists</hi> must be grosse Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, from the second, third, fourth, seventh and ninth Conclusions of the first Chapter, and from the fourth, fifth, eighth, ninth, twenty-first, twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-second and twenty-fifth of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Chapter. All these Conclusions will give evidence against them, that they are very notorious Idolaters.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. And therefore this being so high and so palpable a strain of Idolatry in them touching the Eucharist, or the eating the Body and drinking the Bloud of <hi>Christ,</hi> wherein <hi>Christ</hi> is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered by the Priest as an Oblation, and the People feed upon him as in a
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:94112:162"/>
Feast upon a Sacrifice, which is not done without Divine Adoration done to the Host, according to the precept of their Church; This does hugely confirm our sense of the eating of things offered unto Idols in the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles to the Churches in <hi>Pergamus</hi> and in <hi>Thyatira,</hi> this worshipping of the Host being so expresly acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Pope and his Clergy, and in that high sense of <hi>Cultus Latriae,</hi> which is due to God alone. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is very choicely and judicious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perstringed by the Spirit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy above any other Modes of their Idolatry, it being such a grosse and confessed <hi>Specimen</hi> thereof, and such as there is no Evasion for or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse.

                     <argument>
                        <p>The grosse Idolatry of the <hi>Romanists</hi> in the Invocation of the Saints, even according to the allowance of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized practice of that Church.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. BUT we will fall also upon those Modes of Idolatry wherein the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> may seem less bold; though indeed this one, that is so grosse, is so often and so universally repeated every-where in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, that by this alone, though we should take notice of nothing farther, Idolatry may seem quite to have overspred her like a noisome Leprosy. But, how-ever, we shall proceed; and first to their <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of Saints.</hi> Touching which the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> declares this Doctrine expresly: <hi>Sanctos utique unà cum</hi> Christo <hi>regnantes Orationes</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Concil. Trident. <hi>Sess.</hi> 9.</note> 
                        <hi>suas pro hominibus offerre, bonúmque atque utile esse suppliciter eos invocare;
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:94112:163"/>
&amp; ob beneficia impetranda à Deo per Filium ejus</hi> Jesum Christum, <hi>ad eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum orationes, operam auxiliúmque confugere.</hi> Where Invocation of Saints is plainly allow'd and recommended: and besides their praying for us, or offering up our Prayers to God, it is plainly imply'd that there are other Aids and Succours they can afford, if they be supplicated, that is, invoked with most humble and prostrate De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion. And the pretending that this is all but the way of procuring those good things we want from God, the first Fountain, and that through his Son <hi>Christ;</hi> that makes the Saints the more exactly like the Pagans <hi>Dii me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dioxumi,</hi> and the <hi>Daemons</hi> that nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated the affairs of men with the highest Deity.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. I say then that, though they went no farther then thus, even this is down-right Idolatry which the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> thus openly owns, (and consequently the whole Church of <hi>Rome,)</hi> as appears from the third, fourth, fifth, sixth and eighth Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:94112:163"/>
of the first Chapter; as also by the fifth, seventh, eighth, tenth, eleventh, twelfth, thirteenth, four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth, fifteenth and twenty-fourth of the second. But if we examine those Prayers that are put up to the Saints, their Invocation is still the more unexcusable.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Wherefore looking to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Practice of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> authorized by the Popes themselves, the Invocation of a Saint does not consist in a mere <hi>Ora pro nobis,</hi> as people are too forward to phansy that the state of the Question, (though the mere invoking of them to pray for us would be Idolatry, as is already proved:) but, which is insinuated in the Council it self, there are other more particular Aids and Succours that they implore of them, and some such as it is proper for none but God or <hi>Christ</hi> to give: Such as Protection from the Devil, Divine Graces, and the Joys of Paradise. But as the things they ask of the Saints are too big for them to be the Disposers of;
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:94112:164"/>
so the Compellations, of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> especially, are above the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of any Creature. Whence this Invocation of Saints will appear a most grosse and palpable Mode of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry in that Church. As I shall make manifest out of the following Examples, taken out of such pieces of Devotion as are not mutter'd in the corners of their Closets, but are publickly read or sung with <hi>Stento<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> Voices in their very Churches. I will onely give the Reader a tast of this kinde of their Idolatry; for it were infinite to produce all we might.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. And first, to begin with the smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler Saints, (as indeed they are all to be reckoned in comparison of the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Virgin, to whom therefore they give that Worship which they call <hi>Hyperdulia,</hi> as they give <hi>Dulia</hi> to the rest of the Saints, and <hi>Latria</hi> to God alone, and to <hi>Christ</hi> as being God:) That Prayer to S. <hi>Cosmas</hi> and S. <hi>Dami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> is plainly a Petition to them to keep us from all Diseases, as well of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:94112:164"/>
Soul as of Body, that we may attain to the life of the Spirit, and live in Grace here, and be made partakers of Heaven hereafter.

But that to S. <hi>Nicolas</hi> is against the Assaults of the Devil:

Virgin. They beg of S. <hi>Agnes</hi> the greatest Grace that God is able to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part to the Soul of man, that is to say, to serve God in perfect Love. And this Gift this one poor single She-Saint is solicited to bestow on all men.

That Devotion put up to S. <hi>Brigitt</hi> is, that she would play the skilfull Pilot, and lead us through all the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pests and hazzards of this World so safely, that at last, by her good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, we may attain to everlasting Life. The Rhyme runs thus:

Verses there are not passing two or three that are an entreating of the Saint to pray for us, but to aid and succour us in such a way as the Story of the Saint and the Allusion to her Name most naturally leads the phancy of the Devotionist to think sutable for her: As if she were the giver of Courage, of Patience, and of Purity of minde, and was to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and support us in the very Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of death by her presence, Which Petition is very frequent to other Saints also.

But some Instances I will produce, and those such as are publick and authentick, as I intimated at first. In the <hi>Rosarie</hi> of the blessed Virgin she is saluted thus:

A very excellent Prayer, if it had been directed to a due Object. But such things are asked as are in the power of none but of <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> himself, as he is God, to give.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. For the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> is here made no lesse then a Saviour and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of all spiritual Graces; as she is also a giver of eternall Life in what follows in Prose. <hi>Peccatorum causo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrix, infirmorum curatrix, erranti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um revocatrix, justorum confirmatrix, desolatorum spes &amp; auxiliatrix, atque mea promptissima adjutrix, tibi, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina gloriosa, commendo bodie &amp; quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidie Animam meam; ut me in custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diam tuam commendatum ab omnibus malis &amp; sraudibus Diaboli custodias, atque in hora mortis constanter mihi assistas, ac Animam ad aeterna gaudia perducas.</hi> Here is the commending of the Soul of the Devotionist into the Protection of the Virgin, that he

may be kept from all Evil, and from the Frauds of the Devil, and that she would assist at the hour of death to convey his Soul to the eternall Joys of Heaven.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Like that at the end of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie; Cor meum illumina, fulgens Stel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la Maris, Et ab hostis machina semper tuearis. O gloriosa Virgo</hi> Maria, <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Regis aeterni, Libera nos ab omni malo, &amp; à poenis Inferni.</hi> Which is a Petition for Illumination of heart, for Security from the Devil and from eternall Death: which is onely the Privilege of the Son of God, the eternall Wisedome of the Father, to grant, who is said also to <hi>have the Keys</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Apoc. 1. 18.</note>

                     <p n="4">4. But the thing which is very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable, and which I mainly drive at, is this, That the <hi>Roman</hi> Church toward the latter end, before the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation broke out, had run so mad after the Patronage of the Virgin, that they had almost forgot the Son of God, and spent all their Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on her, whom they do at least
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:94112:169"/>
equallize to <hi>Christ,</hi> and so really make her, as well as some love to call her, the <hi>Daughter of God,</hi> in as high a sense as <hi>Christ</hi> is his <hi>Son:</hi> as will farther ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the process of our Quotations. As in that Prayer to the blessed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin that follows in <hi>Chemnitius: Te, mater illuminationis cordis mei, te, nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix salutis meae mentis, te obsecrant quantum possunt cuncta praecordia mea.

                     <p n="5">5. As she is again most expresly in
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:94112:169"/>
that Prayer to her in her Feast of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitation:</p>

                     <p>In which Invocation the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> is plainly called the Saviour of the World, and pray'd unto for spiritual Illumination of the Soul, and for the purgation thereof from the filth both of Sin and Guilt: whereby she is plainly equallized to the <hi>Son of God,</hi> and made as it were a <hi>She-Christ,</hi> or <hi>Daughter of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this sense also are those Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers put up to her in her Feast of the Conception and of the Annunciati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: But it were infinite to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce all.

                           <hi>More Forms of Invocation of the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Virgin out of the</hi> Mary-Psalter, <hi>so called, extremely Idolatrous and Blasphemous.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. WE will now onely note some passages in the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-Psalter,</hi> as it is called, wherein how much at that time the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had thrust themselves under the Protection and Patronage of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, and made her the Daughter of God, in stead of approving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves faithfull touching the Rights and Prerogatives of the Son and his Worship, will be most notoriously evident. I will begin with the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth Psalm: <hi>In te, Domina, speravi; non confundar in aeternum. In grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am tuam suscipe me; inclina ad me
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:94112:170"/>
aurem tuam, &amp; in moerore meolaetifica me. Tu es fortitudo mea &amp; refugium meum, consolatio mea &amp; protectio mea: ad te clamavi cùm tribularetur cor meum, &amp; exaudîsti de vertice collium aeternorum. In manus tuas, Domina, commendo spiritum meum, meam to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam vitam, diem ultimum.</hi> This is that whole Psalm to the Virgin: jusr in such a form and with such a repose of spirit as <hi>David</hi> prays in to God himself.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But we will content our selves with transcribing onely some select pieces. As Psalm 71. <hi>Resperge, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina, cor meum dulcedine tuâ. Fac me oblivisci miserias hujus vitae: Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscentias aeternas excita in anima mea, &amp; de gaudio Paradiss inebria men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem meam.</hi> And again, Psalm 104. <hi>Salus sempiterna in manu tua est, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina; qui te dignè honoraverint sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipient illam. Clementia tua non defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciet à seculis aeternis, &amp; misericordia tua à generatione in generationem.</hi> And Psalm 117. <hi>Dispositione tuâ mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus perseverat, quem tu, Domina, cum
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:94112:171"/>
Deo fundâsti ab initio. Tuus totus ego sum, Domina; salvum me fac, quoniam desiderabiles sunt laudes tuae in tempore peregrinationis meae.</hi> No man can say more to, or expect more from, the eternall God himself.</p>
                     <p>Whence they make the eternall Godhead as hypostatically united with the Virgin as with <hi>Christ</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and carry themselves to her as if she were as properly the <hi>Daughter of God</hi> as he <hi>the Son.</hi> For else how could she be said to have everlasting Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in her power, and to have laid the Foundations of the world from the beginning with the eternall Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. There are also other passages in this Psalter whereby they make the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> a <hi>She-Christ,</hi> the <hi>Daughter of God,</hi> as he is the <hi>Son of God;</hi> and that is by the applying of the very Phrases spoken of him in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, unto her. As in Psalm 2. <hi>Venite ad eam omnes qui laboratis &amp; tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lati estis, &amp; refrigerium &amp; solatium dabit animabus vestris.</hi> And Psalm 81.
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:94112:171"/>
                        <hi>Terge foeditatem me am, Domina, quae semper rutilas puritate. Fons vitae, influe in os meum, ex quo viventes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quae profluunt &amp; emanant. Omnes si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tientes venite ad illam, &amp; de fonte suo gratanter vos potabit.</hi> This is the gift of the Spirit, belonging onely to <hi>Christ</hi> to give to them that believe on him. And he is also said to be the <note place="margin">John 7. 37, 38. Matth. 11. 28.</note> 
                        <hi>ease</hi> and <hi>rest</hi> of all them that are <hi>weary and heavy laden.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And again, Psalm 46. <hi>Omnes gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, plaudite manibus, psallite in jubilo Virgini gloriosae. Quoniam ipsa est por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta vitae, janua salutis, &amp; via nostrae reconciliationis, spes poenitentium, so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamen lugentium, pax beata cordium atque salus.</hi> This is attributed to the Virgin, whenas it is <hi>Christ</hi> alone that is the way of Salvation and Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation with God.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. This is a foul and tedious Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and therefore to make an end at length, let us consider the Blasphemy of the 41. Psalm. <hi>Quemadmodum desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derat cervus ad fontes aquarum, ità ad amorem tuum anhelat anima mea, Virgo
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:94112:172"/>
sancta. Quia tu es genitrix vitae meae, &amp; altrix reparationis carnis meae: Quia tu lactatrix Salvationis animae meae, initium &amp; finis totius salutis meae.</hi> Here is that attributed to the Virgin which is said of <hi>Christ,</hi> that he is the Authour and Finisher of our Faith and Salvation. Nay, the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Generation of our life and flesh, as well as our Salvation, is here ascribed to the Virgin. Which can have no sense or truth, unless she were <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, <hi>God-woman,</hi> in that sense that <hi>Christ</hi> is <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, <hi>God-man,</hi> and, as I said, were as properly the <hi>Daughter of God</hi> as he is the <hi>Son of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. As she is expresly called in her Litanie, <hi>Filia Dei,</hi> the <hi>Daughter of God.</hi> Which, considering what high Titles they give her both in that Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanie and elsewhere, as, <hi>Illuminatrix cordium, Fons misericordiae, Flumen sapientiae, Mater Dei, Regina coeli, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina mundi, Domina coeli &amp; terrae,</hi> would be but a dwindling Title, (it belonging to all women that are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,)
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:94112:172"/>
if there was not some such raised and sublime sense of it as I have intimated.</p>
                     <p>And therefore their Addresses to her being as if she were, as I said, a <hi>She-Christ,</hi> and the <hi>Daughter of God</hi> in as high a sense at least as <hi>Christ</hi> is the <hi>Son of God,</hi> and she being called the Daughter of God in the <hi>Litania Mariae,</hi> in her Litanie or publick Supplication to her, it is plain, that in that Intervall of the Church where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this most conspicuously and notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously happened, the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> by reason also of the abundance of their Devotions then to the Virgin, might be said to be rather the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippers of the <hi>Daughter of God</hi> then of <hi>the Son of God.</hi> And that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Spirit of Prophecy foresee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these times, whenas for such a space he called <hi>Rome Pergamus,</hi> this succeeding Scene coming on, he might very well change the title of <hi>Perga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> into that of <hi>Thyatira,</hi> with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risorious Allusion to the occasion of the name of that City, from the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:94112:173"/>
news of a Daughter being born to <hi>Nicanor.</hi> As if God Almighty had the like occasion of changing the name of <hi>Pergamus</hi> into <hi>Thyatira,</hi> from the <hi>Romanists</hi> turning the Virgin <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> into the <hi>Daughter of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. For a stop to which Insolency <hi>Christ</hi> seems on purpose in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle to the Church in <hi>Thyatira</hi> to resume to himself the Title of the <hi>Son</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Apoc. 2. 18.</note> 
                        <hi>of God,</hi> notwithstanding that he is called the <hi>Son of man</hi> in the Vision in <note place="margin">Apoc. 1. 13.</note> the foregoing Chapter, out of which he ever draws a description of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self for an Entrance before each E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle to the Churches. Which, in my judgement, is a thing specially well worth the marking; and that this making the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> the <hi>Daughter of God</hi> in this Intervall, might alone be a sufficient occasion of changing the name of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> from <hi>Pergamus</hi> to <hi>Thyatira.</hi> But other things that are apposite are also comprehended by a Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall <hi>Henopoeïa.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. But this is an Overplus to our
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:94112:173"/>
present purpose, which was mainly to discover the grosse Idolatry of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in the Invocation of their Saints, and especially of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Mary;</hi> and how both the Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> is Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous in this Point, and much more the Practice of the Church counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced by publick Authority.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. For this <hi>Mary-Psalter</hi> it self, that has the most enormous and blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Forms of Idolatrous Invocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any, is not the private Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of some single, obscure, super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious Monk, but bears the Title of that Seraphick Doctour S. <hi>Bonaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> once Cardinal of <hi>Rome:</hi> Which is no small publick countenance thereto. And that nothing might be wanting to the grace and furtherance of so devotionall a piece of Idolatry, there was instituted a peculiar Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, entitled the <hi>Fraternity of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny-Psalter,</hi> confirmed afterward by <hi>Sixtus</hi> the fourth, many Indulgences being added <hi>Anno</hi> 1470. And <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi> the eighth added to these Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:94112:174"/>
plenarie Remission <hi>à poena &amp; culpa</hi> once in their life, and once <hi>in articulo mortis,</hi> to as many as entred into that Fraternity.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. And in such case stands the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> at this very day, that is to say, she is still <hi>Thyatira,</hi> noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious for her Idolatrous Worship of the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> But the Intervall of the true Church in <hi>Thyatira</hi> ceased upon the Reformation, when we cast off the Pope, or suffered <hi>Jezebel</hi> to delude the Servants of God no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, nor to debauch them with Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Modes of Worship. But this is onely by the bye.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time it is abundantly manifest, that the Invocation of Saints in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is not onely the praying to them that they would pray to God for us, but the asking Aids of them, and such frequently as are in the power of none but of God, and of <hi>Christ</hi> as he is God, for to give; and therefore is still the grosser Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry.</p>

To which I answer, That thus much as the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared touching Images is plain and open Idolatry by the seventh Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of the first Chapter, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly against the Commandment of God, who forbids us to make any graven Image to bow down to or worship. But the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> says, Yes, ye may make graven I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages of the Saints, and set them up in their Temples, and give them their due Honour and Worship; nay, ye
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:94112:175"/>
ought to doe so; and instances in the very act of Bowing or Kneeling and prostrating our selves before them. This Definition of the Council is so palpably against the Commandment of God, that they are fain to leave the second Commandment out of the Decalogue, that the people may not discern how grosly they goe against the express Precepts of God in their so frequent practices of Idolatry. See the first, ninth and tenth Conclusions of the first Chapter; as also the third, fourth, fifth, eighteenth, nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth and twentieth of the second.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Nor can all their Tricks and Tergiversations and subtil Elusions serve their turn. For undoubtedly the Decalogue was writ to the easie capacity of the people, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their hearts and consciences are the best Interpreters. Not the foolish Evasions and Subterfuges of perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Sophisters, who, to the betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of weak Souls to Idolatry and Damnation, and for the opening their Purses, would make them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:94112:176"/>
that the Council of <hi>Trent</hi>'s en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning of Images in Churches, and the honouring them or worshipping them and bowing down before them, can consist with God's forbidding to make any graven Image, and to bow down to it and worship it. So that I say, the Council <hi>it self</hi> does appoint flat Idolatry to the Christian world to be practised. And it being so mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous a thing, I pray you now let us consider the Reasons why they do so.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The first is, Because the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour done to the Image is referr'd to the Prototype. But I answer, that this Reference is either in virtue of that Similitude the Images have with those persons they represent, which the words of the Council seem to imply, at least touching the Saints, <hi>quorum illae similitudinem gerunt;</hi> as when we praise a Picture of such or such a person, that it is a very come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and lovely Picture, this praise naturally has a reference to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son whose Picture it is, in virtue of the similitude betwixt the Picture and the Party.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="81" facs="tcp:94112:176"/>
Or else this Reference, without any regard to personal Similitude, is from the Direction of the Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Devotionist, that he intends upon the seeing and bowing, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, to the Image of <hi>Christ,</hi> the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Virgin, or any Saint, to take this occasion to worship <hi>Christ,</hi> the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Virgin or the Saint thereby, the Image being but at large a symboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Presence of them, it being not regarded whether the Symbol or I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage have any personal Similitude with the party it represents or no.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. But now as for the former it is evident, that it is infinitely uncertain whether any Image of <hi>Christ,</hi> the blessed Virgin, or of this or that Saint, be like the carnal figure of these persons while they were alive upon earth, or no. Nay, it is in a manner certain to the contrary, none of these holy Souls being given to such follies as to have their Pictures drawn while they were alive. See my <note n="*" place="margin">Part 1. Book 1. chap. 14.</note> 
                        <hi>Mysterie of Iniquity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But being it is extremely impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:94112:177"/>
but an Image should be like some or other, that are either now alive, or have lived on the earth since the beginning of the world, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this first supposition, this Honour or religious Worship inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to <hi>Christ,</hi> the blessed Virgin, or any other Saint, will not onely misse them, but certainly fall on some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther who, in stead of being Saints, haply are or have been very vile and wicked persons.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. But besides, no Saints are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped before they be in Heaven, nor indeed are properly Saints till then; and the Glories in their Pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that are about their Heads shew plainly that they intend to represent the Saints in their present condition of Glory in Heaven. Whence it is plain that the Images are nothing like them they are made for. For how can these Images of brasse or stone or wood, or any other mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials, bear the Image of a separate Soul, which all the Saints are for the present? And what likenesse can
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:94112:177"/>
there be betwixt the glorious body of <hi>Christ</hi> Heavenly and spiritual, and an Image of any terrestriall matter? No more then betwixt a piece of Dirt or Soot and the Sun or bright Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning-star.</p>
                     <p>And, which is most of all to be considered, what terrestriall Image can possibly represent him that is truly <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>God-man,</hi> and is not the Object of our Adoration but as he is this Divine <hi>Complexum</hi> as well of the <hi>Divinity</hi> as the <hi>Humanity?</hi> But what Statuarie can carve out the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figies of the Deity? So that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tense of this Reference of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to the Prototype in this first sense thereof is very weak and vain. Nor, though there were this natural Reference, would it follow that we are to honour them this way, it being so plainly forbid, and there being better ways then this, <hi>viz.</hi> the commemorating and imitating their Vertues.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. And for that second sense, it is indeed disinvolved of those former
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:94112:178"/>
Difficulties; but greater here occurr. For as touching our Saviour <hi>Christ,</hi> forasmuch as his pretended Image is but his symbolicall Presence, the doing of Divine Worship towards it is again plain Idolatry, as appears by that Example of the <hi>Israelites,</hi> who worshipped the golden Calf in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to <hi>Jehovah,</hi> as appears plainly <note place="margin">Exod. 32. 4, 5.</note> in the Story. And for the blessed Virgin and the rest of the Saints, that Incurvation toward their symbolicall Presences is flat Idolatry, is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest from the eighth, ninth and tenth Conclusions of the first Chapter, and the fifth, nineteenth and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth of the second of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise.</p>
                     <p>And indeed thus to make the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Saints so called onely their symbolicall Presences, and so to worship them before these Images, is an attributing Divine Honour to them. For this naturally does de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that they have at least a terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striall Omnipresency, which no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible Power which we know has
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:94112:178"/>
but onely God. But to make a low Obeisance to an absent person God knows how many <hi>millions</hi> of miles off, is still a more forced and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous thing. And therefore the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luting of the Saints thus at their sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolicall Presences or Images, and in the mean time acknowledging them to be <hi>in sede Beatorum,</hi> (which they do, and must do, unlesse they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude them Heaven,) is to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge one Soul to fill Heaven and Earth with its presence, which is that vast Privilege of God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty onely; and therefore this Worship to them is gross Idolatry, as suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing such a Perfection in them as is no-where but in God.</p>
                     <p>Besides what was intimated before, that let this Reference be what it will, there being an Incurvation or Prostration before Images, whether they be mere Symbols or exact Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations, it must be <hi>ipso facto</hi> I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry by the seventh Conclusion of the first Chapter. From whence it follows, that the Saints are not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:94112:179"/>
by this worshipping of their Images, but hideously reproched, it supposing them to be pleased and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify'd with that which is an abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to the Lord, and a grofs trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression of his express Commands. It implies, I say, that they are ambitious, vain-glorious and rebellious against God. And therefore they that the most vehemently oppose this way of honouring of them by Images and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation are the most true and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Honourers of them, they so zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously vindicating them from the great Reproches these others cast upon them. So far are they from being guilty herein of any Rudenesse or Clownishnesse against the Saints of God.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>The Doctrine of the second Council of</hi> Nice <hi>touching the Worship of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, (to which the Council of</hi> Trent <hi>refers,) that it is grosly Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous also.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. BUT now as for the other Reason of these <hi>Tridentine</hi> Fathers, whereby they would support their Determination in this Point, <hi>viz.</hi> the Authority of the second Council of <hi>Nice</hi> held about the year 780, (to omit, that long before this time the Church had become asymmetral, which yet is a very substantial Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration) I shall onely return this brief answer. The God of <hi>Israel,</hi> which is the Father of our Lord <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> has given this expresse com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to his Church for ever, <hi>Thou shalt not make to thy self any graven I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, thou shalt not bow down to it, nor worship it.</hi> But the second Council of <hi>Nice</hi> says, Thou mayst and shalt bow
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:94112:180"/>
down to the Image of <hi>Christ,</hi> of the blessed Virgin, and of the rest of the Saints. Now whether it be fit to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and obey God, or men, judge ye: I might adde farther, men so silly and frivolous in the defense of their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, so false and fabulous in the Allegation of their Authorities and the recitall of miraculous Stories, as <hi>Chemnitius</hi> has proved at large in his <hi>Examen</hi> of the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. I will give an Instance or two. <hi>No man lighteth a candle, and putteth it</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 15.</note> 
                        <hi>under a bushell;</hi> therefore the Images of the Saints are to be placed on the Altars, and Wax-candles lighted up before them, in due honour to them. Again, <hi>Psalm</hi> 16. <hi>But to the Saints that are on the Earth:</hi> But the Saints are in Heaven, say they, therefore their Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges ought to be on the Earth, &amp;c. As for the Miracles done by Images, as their Speaking, the Healing of the sick, the Revenging of the wrong done to them, the Distilling of rorid drops of balsame to heal the wounded, sick or lame, their Recovering water into a
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:94112:180"/>
dry Well, and the like, it were too tedious to recite these Figments.</p>
                     <p>But that of the Image of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, to whom her <hi>Devotionist</hi> spake when he took leave of her, and was to take a long Journey, intreating her to look to her Candle, which he had lighted up for her, till his return, I cannot conceal. For the Story says, the same Candle was burning six months after, at the return of her <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voto.</hi> An example of the most mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Prolonger that ever I met withall before in all my days. Such an Image of the Virgin would save poor Students a great deal in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense of Candles, if the thing were but lawfull and feasible.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. From these small hints a man may easily discover of what Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity this second Council of <hi>Nice</hi> ought to be, though they had not conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded so point-blank against the Word of God. But because that Clause in this Paragraph of the Council I have recited, <hi>Id quod Conciliorum, praeser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim verò secundae Nicaenae Synodi,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:94112:181"/>
may as well aim at the determination of what these Fathers <hi>mean</hi> by that <hi>debitus honor &amp; reverentia</hi> which they declare to be due to the Images of <hi>Christ</hi> and the Saints, as <hi>confirm</hi> their <hi>own Conclusion</hi> by the Authority of that <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, we will take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice also what a kinde of Honour and Reverence to Images the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council did declare for, and in short it is this;</p>
                     <p>That they are to be worshipped and adored and to be honoured with Wax-candles, and by the smoaking of Incense or Perfumes, and the like. Which smells rankly enough in all conscience of Idolatry, as <hi>Grotius</hi> himself upon the Decalogue cannot but acknowledge. But this is not all. The Invocation of Saints, their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation and propitiating God for us for adoring their Images, healing of Diseases, and other Aids and Helps, besides <hi>Ora pro nobis,</hi> are manifestly involved in the Worship of these Images, according to that <hi>Nicene</hi> Council.</p>
                     <p n="4">
                        <pb n="91" facs="tcp:94112:181"/>
4. And truly, according to the Collections of <hi>Photius</hi> in <hi>Justellus,</hi> one would think that they meant the <hi>Cultus Latriae</hi> to the Image of <hi>Christ,</hi> they using the word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, as if that Worship which was done to the Image passed through to <hi>Christ</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, which would not be sutable to him, if it were not Divine Worship. And where that word is not used, yet the sense makes hugely for it. As in this Paragraph touching the second Council of <hi>Nice</hi> according to <hi>Photius;</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</p>
                     <p>This seventh Synod, saith he, (that
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:94112:182"/>
is to say, the second of <hi>Nice) with joint suffrages hath established and ratify'd the worshipping of the Image of</hi> Christ, <hi>for the honour and reverence of him that is expressed by it; this Worship and Honour being done in such manner as when we approach the holy Symbols or Types of our most holy and Divine Worship:</hi> (for the word is <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.) <hi>For we do not stop at them, nor restrain our Worship and Devotion to them, nor are we divided toward heterogeneous and different Scopes or Objects; but by that Service and Worship of them that appears divided are we carried up devoutly and undividedly unto the one and indivisible Deity.</hi> Whereby it is plainly declared, that that very Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship which passes to the Deity is done towards the Image of <hi>Christ</hi> first or jointly, as being one and the same un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided Worship in truth and reality; as also that this Worship is that Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship which is called <hi>Latria,</hi> and is due to the highest God onely.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. But that religious Worship is done to the Images of all the Saints
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:94112:182"/>
seems imply'd in what comes after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, where it is said, that this second Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> (which <hi>Photius</hi> calls <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. That this Council <hi>has not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly established and appointed that the Image of</hi> Christ <hi>should be honoured and worshipped, but the holy Images of the Virgin</hi> Mary <hi>and of all the Saints, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the excellency and venerability of their Prototypes. For even by these are we carried up into a certain uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and conjunctive vision, and thereby are vouchsafed that divine and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural conjunction or contact with the highest of all desirables,</hi> that is, God himself.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Can any thing more inflame the Souls of men with that mysticall lust after Idols then the Doctrines of this
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:94112:183"/>
                        <hi>Nicene</hi> Synod? For as for the Image of <hi>Christ,</hi> the same Devotion and Worship is done to that which is done to God himself. And for the Images of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> and the rest of the Saints, though that Worship is allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them onely that is proportionable to their Prototypes, yet they are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped such a way as that thereby, while we adhere to their Images or Statues, we are declared to be made fit for and to be vouchsafed a tactual Union with God himself. What <hi>Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum</hi> more effectual to raise up that <hi>Idolomania,</hi> that being mad and love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick after Images and Idols, then this? What can inrage their Affections more towards Idolatry, then to phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie that while they worship Idols, and cling about dead Statues, that very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual act (and therefore it cannot be too intense) is that wherewith they are united to, and lie in the very Embraces of, the ever-living and true God?</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The sense of the Synod is, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the representation of <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi>
                        <pb n="95" facs="tcp:94112:183"/>
that we worship and unite our selves with God as well in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping the Images of the Virgin and of other Saints, as in the worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of the Image of <hi>Christ.</hi> So that all is <hi>religious</hi> Worship, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently grosse Idolatry, it being done to Stocks and Stones and such like senslesse Objects. For the drift of all Idolatry is, when it is questioned, and craftily defended, that through the Worship of <hi>Daemons</hi> and Images they reach at the Worship of, and the joyning their Devotion to, the first and highest Godhead. Wherefore the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> declaring with the second Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> that is to say, the blinde leading the blinde, they have both fallen into this dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Pit of Idolatry.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>The meaning of the Doctrine of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Trent</hi> touching the Worship of Images more determinately illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated from the general Practice of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church and Suffrage of their Popes, whereby it is deprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be still more coursly and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganically Idolatrous.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. BUT it may be it may give more satisfaction to some, to know what is the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>'s own sense of this <hi>Honor debitus</hi> she declares ought to be done to the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of <hi>Christ</hi> and the Saints. Putting off a man's Hat, and lying prostrate before them, the Council does not stick to instance in by the bye. But because the Council calls this neither <hi>Dulia,</hi> nor <hi>Hyperdulia,</hi> nor <hi>Latria,</hi> some will, it may be, be ready to shuffle it off with the interpretation of but a <hi>civil</hi> Complement to these Images or their Prototypes.</p>

                        <pb n="97" facs="tcp:94112:184"/>
But since the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> has declared nothing farther, what can be a more certain Interpreter of their meaning then the continued Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of their Church, and the sense of such Doctours as have been even sainted for their Eminency, as <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Aquinas</hi> and <hi>Bonaventure,</hi> who both of them have declared that the Image of <hi>Christ</hi> is to be worshipped with the Worship of <hi>Latria,</hi> the same that <hi>Christ</hi> is worshipped with?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And <hi>Azorius</hi> the <hi>Jesuite</hi> affirms that it is the constant Opinion of the Theologers, (their own, he means, you may be sure,) that the Image is to be honoured and worshipped with the same Honour and Worship that he is whose Image it is. Which is not unlike that in the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, in the foregoing Citation. But that they are all capable of religious Worship, the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> it self (as well as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and others, if not all the Theologers of that Church,) does plainly acknowledge, in that it deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:94112:185"/>
for their Invocation, which is competible to no invisible Power but the Godhead it self. Wherefore it is manifest that their Images are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped with <hi>religious</hi> Worship also.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. But we shall make still the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er judgement thereof, if we consider the Consecration of these Images which the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> declares are to be worshipped. For the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration and Worshipping of them makes them perfectly as the Idol-Gods of the Heathen, as <hi>Octavius</hi> jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly speaks of the Heathen Gods, that is, their Idols, in <hi>Minucius Felix: Ecce funditur, fabricatur, scalpitur; non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum Deus est.

And if this will doe it, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>'s Images will prove as good Idol-Gods as any of them all.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Chemnitius</hi> recites some forms of Consecration: I will cull out one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:94112:185"/>
those of the Images of the blessed Virgin and of S. <hi>John.</hi> That of the Virgin is this: <hi>Sanctify, O God, this Image of the blessed Virgin, that it may aid and keep safe thy faithfull people; that Thundrings and Lightnings, if they grow too terrible and dangerous, may be quickly expelled thereby; and that the Inundations of Rain, the Commotions of civil War, and Devastations by Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, may be suppressed by the presence thereof.</hi> Which is most effectual to make all men come and hurcle under the protection of the Virgin's Image in such dangers, as under the Wings of the great <hi>Jehovah.</hi> This is hugely like the consecrated Telesms of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans.</p>
                     <p>But let us hear the form of the Consecration of the Image of S. <hi>John</hi> also: <hi>Grant, O God, that all those that behold this Image with Reverence, and pray before it, may be heard in whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Streights they are. Let this Image be the holy Expulsion of Devils, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliating the presence and assistence of Angels, the protection of the faithfull;
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:94112:186"/>
and that the Intercession of this Saint may be very powerfull and effectuall in this place.</hi> What a mighty Charm is this to make the Souls of the feeble to hang about these Images as if their Presence were the Divine Protection it self?</p>
                     <p n="5">5. These <hi>Chemnitius</hi> recites out of the <hi>Pontificall</hi> he perused. But the <hi>Rituale Romanum,</hi> published first by the command of <hi>Paulus Quintus,</hi> and again authorized by Pope <hi>Urban</hi> the eighth, will doe our businesse suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, they being both since the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Trent;</hi> and therefore by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of these Popes we may know what that <hi>debitus Honor</hi> is which the <hi>Tridentine</hi> Fathers mention as that which ought to be done to the Images of <hi>Christ,</hi> the blessed Virgin, or any other Saint. For the Consecration of their Images runs thus:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Grant, O God, that whosoever before this Image shall diligently and humbly upon his knees worship and honour thy onely-begotten Son, or the blessed Virgin,</hi> (according as the Image is that is
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:94112:186"/>
a-consecrating, <hi>or this glorious Apostle, or Martyr, or Confessor, or Virgin, that he may obtain by his or her Merits and Intercession Grace in this present life, and eternall Glory hereafter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So that the Virgin and other Saints are fellow-distributers of Grace and Glory with <hi>Christ</hi> himself to their Supplicants before their Images, and that upon their own Merits, and for this Service done to them in kneeling and pouring out their Prayers before their Statues or symbolicall Presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. What greater Blasphemy and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry can be imagined? <hi>Ornatur, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secratur, oratur, tunc postremò fit Deus:</hi> that is to say, The Image is pray'd before, but the <hi>Daemon</hi> pray'd unto. There is no more in Paganism it self. And yet by the Pope's own Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion this is the <hi>debitus Honor</hi> that is owing to the Images of the Saints. Consider the latter end of the last Conclusion of the first Chapter, and the forms of Invocation in the fourth and fifth, as also the eighteenth Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of the second Chapter.</p>
                     <p n="6">

6. This is all plain and expresse ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Authority of their Church. And that, besides their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oration and Praying before th<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>se I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, (which, considering the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures of the Supplicant and the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, is as much praying to them as the Heathens will acknowledge done to theirs,) there are also Wax-can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles burning before them, and the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Incense or perfuming them, Feasts likewise, Temples and Altars to the same Saints, and the carrying them in Procession, (which was the guize of ancient Paganism,) is so well known, that I need not quote any Authours. And that this is the practice of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church jointly and coherent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with their Worship of Images, is manifest to all the world; and that therefore it is as arrant Idolatry as Paganism it self, and consequently real Idolatry by the third Conclusion of the first Chapter. And lastly, it is to be noted that the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> naming the <hi>debitus Honor</hi> of Images, and not excepting these in known
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:94112:187"/>
practice then amongst them, must of all reason be conceived to mean these very Circumstances, as Paganicall as they are, of the Worshipping of them.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. And the rather, because they do pretend to rectify some Miscarriages in the business of Images, as any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull or dishonest Gain by them, all lascivious Dresses of the Images, all Drunkenness and disorderly Riot at their Feasts, and the like. Which methinks is done with as grave cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on against Idolatry, as if they had decreed that all the Whores in <hi>Rome</hi> should forbear to goe in so garish ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell, that they should be sure to wear clean linen, to be favourable to poor younger Brothers in the price of a night's Lodging, that they keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves wholsome and clean from the Pox, and the like; which were not the putting down, but the establishing, of Whores and Whoredome in the Papacy. And so are these Cautions touching Images. <hi>Exceptio firmat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulam in non exceptis.</hi> Wherefore these Circumstances of Idolatry be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:94112:188"/>
not named by the <hi>Tridentine</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in their Exception, they are thereby ratify'd. Which yet are so like the old Pagan Idolatry, that <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dovicus Vives,</hi> one of their own Church, could not abstain from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing, <hi>non posse aliquid discrimen o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendi, nisi quòd nomina tantùm &amp; ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulos mutaverint;</hi> That onely the Names and Objects were changed, not the Modes, of the ancient Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry of the Heathen.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. If the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> would have really and in good earnest recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd their Church in the point of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, they should have followed the Example of that skilfull and famous Physician Dr. <hi>Butler,</hi> they should have imitated his Prescript touching the safe eating of a Pear, <hi>viz.</hi> That we should first pare it very carefully, and then be sure to cut out or scoup out all the Coar of it, and after that fill the hollow with Salt, and when this is done, cast it forthwith into the Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell. This is the safest way of dealing with those things that have any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsick
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:94112:188"/>
Poison or Danger in them. See those most wholesome and judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Homilies of our Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> against the Perill of Idolatry.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. And thus much shall serve for the setting out the Idolatry of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> so far as it seems to be allow'd by the Church it self. But for those more grosse Extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, which, though they have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nived at, yet they would be loath to own upon publick Authority, I will neither weary my self nor my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by meddling with them. Such as the making the Images to sweat, their Eyes to move, the making them to smile, or lour and look sad, to feel heavy or light, or the like. Which does necessarily tend to the engaging of the people to believe and have <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance in the very Images themselves, as those Consecrations also imply which I cited out of <hi>Chemnitius,</hi> and which that Rhyme seems to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which they say to that Face of <hi>Christ</hi> which they call the <hi>Veronica.</hi> Which Rhyme runs thus:
<q>
                           <l>
                              <pb n="106" facs="tcp:94112:189"/>
Nos perduc ad patriam, felix ô Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gura,</l>
                           <l>Ad videndam Faciem quae est <hi>Christi</hi> pura.</l>
                           <l>Nos ab omni macula purga Vitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</l>
                           <l>Et tandem consortio junge Beato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</l>
                        </q>
And with such like blinde Devotion do they likewise speak to the Crosse:
<q>
                           <l>O Crux, spes unica,</l>
                           <l>Hoc Passionis tempore</l>
                           <l>Auge piis Justitiam,</l>
                           <l>Reisque dona Veniam.</l>
                        </q>
This must sound very wildly and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagantly to any sensible ear. And yet the invoking any Saint before his Image for Aid and Succour, (the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage bearing the name and represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Saint,) with Eyes and Hands lift up to it, is as arrant talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a senslesse Stock or a Stone as this, and as gross a piece of <note n="*" place="margin">See Ch. 1.

                           <hi>Severall important Consectaries from this clear Discovery of the gross Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry of the Church of</hi> Rome; <hi>with an hearty and vehement Exhortation to all men, that have any serious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to their Salvation, to beware how they be drawn into the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of that Church.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. THus have we abundantly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> stands guilty of gross Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try according to the Concessions and Definitions of their own Council of <hi>Trent;</hi> that is to say, though we charge them with no more then with what the Council it self doth own, touching the Adoration of the Host, the Invocation of Saints, and the Worshipping of Images. But we must not forget, in the mean time, that the Crime grows still more course and palpable looking upon the particular forms of their Invocation of the Saints,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:94112:190"/>
and the Circumstances of their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping their Images, and yet rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd by the Popes, and corroborated by the uncontrolled practice of their whole Church: Which therefore must in all reason be the Interpreter of the minde of the Council. So that there is no evasion left for them, but that they are guilty of as gross and palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Idolatry as ever was committed by the sons of men, no lesse grosse then <hi>Roman</hi> Paganism it self.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. From whence, in the next place, it necessarily follows, that they are the most barbarous Murtherers of the Servants of God that ever appeared on the face of the Earth. For indeed if they had had Truth on their side so far, as that the things they required at the hands of the Dissenters had been lawfull, (though not at all neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary;) yet considering the expresse voice of Scripture, which must be so exceeding effectual to raise consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encious Scruples, and indeed to fix a man in the contrary Opinions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the irrefragable Votes of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:94112:190"/>
Sense and Reason, and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of all Arts and Sciences that can pretend any usefulnesse to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in any of its Theoreticall Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitions; I say, when it is so easie from hence, if not necessary, for some men to be born into a contrary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciencious Persuasion, it had undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly even in this case been notorious Murther in the <hi>Pontifician</hi> Party, to have killed men for dissenting from the Doctrine and Practice of their Church.</p>
                     <p>But now the Murtherers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves being in so palpable an Errour, and requiring of the Dissenters to profess Blasphemies and commit gross Idolatries with them, which is open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to rebell against <hi>God</hi> under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tense of obeying <hi>Holy Church,</hi> as they love to be called, they murthering so many hundred thousands of them for this Fidelity to their Maker, and their indispensable Obedience to the Lord <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> this is Murther of a double dye, and not to be parallel'd by all the barbarous Persecutions un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:94112:191"/>
the red Dragon, the Pagan Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours themselves.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. From which two main Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations it follows in the third place, that, considering the fit and easie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity of the names of the Seven Churches and of the Events of the seven Intervalls (denoted by them) to the Prefigurations in the Visions, there can be no doubt but that by <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam</hi> mentioned in the Epistle to the Church in <hi>Pergamus,</hi> wherein <hi>Antipas,</hi> that is, the Opposers of the Pope, are murthered, the Papal Hierarchy is understood; as it is also by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetesse <hi>Jezebel</hi> in the Epistle to the Church in <hi>Thyatira,</hi> who was also a Murtheresse of the Prophets of God, and both of them expresly Patrons of Idolatry, as is manifest in the very Text.</p>
                     <p>Nor is it at all wonderfull that <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam</hi> and <hi>Jezebel,</hi> the one a man, the other a woman, should signifie the same thing. For the false Prophet and the Whore of <hi>Babylon</hi> in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Visions of the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> signifie
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:94112:191"/>
both one and the same thing, <hi>viz.</hi> The Hierarchy of <hi>Rome,</hi> from the Pope to the rest of their Ecclesiastick Body.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. And what I have said of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of those Seven Churches, the same I say of all those Expositions of the thirteenth and seventeenth Chapters of the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> and that of the little Horn in <hi>Daniel;</hi> namely, The words of the Prophecies being so naturally applicable to the Affairs of that Church, besides the demonstration of Synchronism, that the weight of those two foregoing Conclusions being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thereto, there cannot be the least doubt or scruple left, but that those Interpretations are true; and that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is that Body of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist,</hi> that <hi>Mother of Fornications and Abominations of the Earth,</hi> that is, of multifarious Modes of grosse Idolatries, or that scarlet Whore on the seven Hills, that is also <hi>drunk with the bloud of the Saints, and with the bloud of the Martyrs of Jesus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. And that therefore, in the fourth place, in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> the Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:94112:192"/>
exceeding the Antidote, there can be no reason that Salvation should be hoped for there. It is a sad and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Truth, but being a Truth, and of such huge moment, it is by no means to be concealed. What God may doe in his more hidden ways of Providence, he alone knows. And therefore we cannot say that every Idolatrous Heathen must perish eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally: But to speak no farther then we have commission, and according to the easy tenour of the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, we must pronounce, though with great sadnesse of heart, that we have no warrant therefrom to think or declare any of the <hi>Popish</hi> Religion, so long as they continue so, to be in the state of Salvation; and especially, since that voice of the Angel which sounded in the Intervall of <hi>Thyatira,</hi> saying expresly, <hi>Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and receive not of her plagues;</hi> and the Apostle in his first Epistle to the <hi>Corinthians, Be not deceived, neither</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Chap. 6. 9.</note> 
                        <hi>Fornicatours, nor Idolaters, nor Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers,</hi>
                        <pb n="113" facs="tcp:94112:192"/>
&amp;c. <hi>shall inherit the Kingdome of God.</hi> And those of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are bound to continue Idolaters as long as they live, or else to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce their Church; and therefore they are bound to be damned by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, unless they could live in it for ever. For he that dies in such a capital sin as Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try without Repentance, nay, in a blinde, obstinate perseverance in it, how can he escape eternal Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
                     <p n="6">6. But though we had kept our selves to the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> the thing is clear in that Book alone, ch. 22. ver. 14, 15. where all Idolaters are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly excluded from the Tree of Life: <hi>Blessed are they that doe his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,</hi> (and one of them, though expunged by <hi>Rome,</hi> is, <hi>Thou shalt not worship any graven Image,) that they may have right to the tree of life,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For without are dogs, and Sorcerers, and Whoremongers, and Murtherers, and Idolaters, and whoso loveth and maketh a Lie.</hi> All these are excluded
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:94112:193"/>
the Heavenly <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and from eating the Tree of Life. Of which who eateth not is most assuredly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in eternall death. As it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the foregoing Chapter, that <hi>Murtherers, and Whoremongers, and</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Apoc. 21. 8.</note> 
                        <hi>Sorcerers, and Idolaters, and all Liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone; which is the second Death.</hi> What sentence can be more expresse then this?</p>
                     <p n="7">7. But besides this Divine sentence against them, they are also <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, they are self-condemned, or at least give sentence against themselves, while they so freely pronounce that no Idolaters are to be saved; which they frequently doe, to save their own Church from the reproach of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry. For, because some Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants have declared for the Possibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Salvation in the <hi>Romish</hi> Church, they farther improve the favour to the quitting themselves of the <hi>guilt,</hi> from others hopefull presages that by an hearty implicit Repentance of all their sins (even of those that are the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:94112:193"/>
proper Crimes of that Church,) they may, through God's mercy in <hi>Christ,</hi> be delivered from the <hi>punishment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This piece of Charity in some of our Party they turn to the fencing off all imputation of Idolatry from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, arguing thus; That no Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters can be saved: But those in the <hi>Romish</hi> Church may be saved, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to those Protestants opinion: Therefore those in the <hi>Romish</hi> Church are no Idolaters.</p>
                     <p>But most assuredly while they thus abuse the Charity of <hi>some,</hi> even by their own Proposition they must bring the sentence of Condemnation <hi>from all the rest</hi> upon their own heads, as they have herein <hi>given it against themselves,</hi> in saying that all Idolaters are damned, or that no Idolater can be saved. For it is demonstrated as clear as the Noon-light, in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Discourse, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are Idolaters.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. And in that of those of our Church that say they may be saved upon a sincere and hearty implicit Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:94112:194"/>
of all their sins, (wherein they include the Idolatries and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Miscarriages which they know not themselves guilty of, by reason of the blinde Mis-instructions of their Church,) no more is given them by this then thus, <hi>viz.</hi> That they are sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by disowning of and dismembring themselves from the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, as much as it is in their power so to doe, and by bitterly repenting them that they were ever of that Church as such, and by being so minded, that if they did know what a corrupt Church it is, they would forthwith separate from it. So that in effect those of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church that some of ours con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit may be saved, are no otherwise saved, if at all, then by an implicit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing Communion with it, which <hi>in Foro Divino</hi> must goe for an actual and formal Separation from it.</p>
                     <p>In which Position if there were any Truth, it will reach the honest-min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Pagans as well; but it can shelter neither, unless in such Circumstances, that they had not the opportunity to
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:94112:194"/>
learn the Truth, which since the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and especially this last Age, by the mercy of God, is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly revealed to the world. So that all men, especially those that live in Protestant Nations or Kingdoms, are without all excuse; and therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come obnoxious to God's eternall wrath and Damnation, if they relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish not that false Prophetesse <hi>Jeze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,</hi> as she is called in the Epistle to the Church in <hi>Thyatira,</hi> who by her cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Doctrines deceives the people, and inveigles them into gross Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Practices.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. Thus little is conceded by those of our Reformed Churches that speak most favourably of those in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And yet this little must be retracted, unless we can make it out, that any of that Church are capable of sincere and unfeigned Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance while they are of it. For to repent as a Thief, because he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to be hanged, is not that saving Repentance. But to repent as a true Christian none can doe, unlesse he
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:94112:195"/>
has the Spirit of God, and be in the state of Regeneration.</p>
                     <p>For true Repentance arises out of the detestation of the uglinesse of Sin it self, and out of the love to the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chritude and amiablenesse of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Life and of true Vertue, which none can be touched with but those that are Regenerate or born of God. Now those holy and Divine Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the new Birth are so contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Frauds and Impostures, to the grosse Idolatries and bloudy Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which they from time to time have perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated upon the dear Servants of <hi>Christ,</hi> that it is impossible for any one that has this holy sense, but that he should incontinently fly from that Church with as much horrour and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frightment as any Countrey-man would from some evil Spectre, or at the approach of the Devil.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. <hi>He that is born of God sinneth not,</hi> saith S. <hi>John:</hi> How then can they <note place="margin">1 John 5. 18.</note> be so born whose very Religion is a Trade of sin, and that of the highest
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:94112:195"/>
nature, they ever and anon exercising grosse acts of Idolatry? besides that they are consenting (by giving up their belief and suffrage to the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therous Conclusions of that Church) to all the barbarous and bloudy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions of the Saints that either have happened or may happen in their own times, or ever shall happen, by that Church; they become, I say, guilty thereof by adjoyning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to this bloud-thirsty Body of men, with whom the Murther of those that will not commit Idolatry with them, and so rebell against God, is become an holy Papal Law and Statute.</p>
                     <p>And therefore, I say, how can any man conceive that those men are born of God who are thus deeply defiled with Murtherous and Idolatrous Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purities, but rather that they are in a mere blinde carnal condition, and uncapable, while they are thus, of any true and sincere Repentance, and consequently of repenting of their daily Idolatries which they commit,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:94112:196"/>
and ordinarily (to make all sure) <hi>in ipso articulo mortis,</hi> and therefore are out of all capacity of Salvation while they are members of that Church? As plainly appears both by this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Reason fetch'd from the nature of Regeneration, as also from the judgement of the <hi>Romanists</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves touching the state of Idolaters after this life, and chiefly from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse sentence of the Spirit of God in Scripture, as I intimated before.</p>

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:94112:198"/>
was to fall into according to Divine Prediction. So that we are as ancient and universal as the Apostolick Church it self, nor do we desire to appear to be the members of any Church that is not Apostolicall.</p>
                     <p>And for their boast of <hi>Miracles,</hi> which are produced to ratifie their crafty Figments, they are but Fictions themselves framed by their Priests, or Delusions of the Devil, according as is foretold concerning the coming of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> that Man of Sin, (which the Pope and his Clergy most assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly is,) namely, that <hi>his coming is after the working of Satan, with all</hi>

                        <hi>power, and signs, and lying wonders.</hi> So that they glory in their own shame, and boast themselves in the known Character of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> and would prove themselves to be <hi>Holy Church</hi> by pretending to the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of that <hi>Man of Sin,</hi> and by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing to the palpable signs of the Assistence of the Devil. For from thence are all Miracles that are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in favour of Practices that

are plainly repugnant to the Doctrines of the Holy Scriptures.</p>

But now, as for their <hi>Sanctity,</hi> what an <hi>holy Church</hi> they are, any one may judge upon the reading of the Lives of their Popes and History of their Cardinals, and other Religious Orders of that Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> how rankly all things smell of Fraud and Imposture, of Pride and Covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, of Ostentation and Hypocrisy; what monstrous examples of Sensua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity their <hi>Holinesses</hi> themselves have ordinarily been, of Fornication and Adultery, of Incest and Sodomie; to say nothing of Simonie, and that infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall sin of Necromancy. But for <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> and <hi>Idolatry,</hi> those horrid Crimes are not onely made familiar to them, but have passed into a Law with them, and are interwoven into the very Essence of their Religion. Judge then how <hi>holy</hi> that Church must be, whose Religion is the establishment of Idolatry and Murther. Of the latter of which Crimes the <hi>holy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition</hi> is an Instance with a witness.
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:94112:199"/>
And yet that Den of Murtherers, whose Office it is to kill men for not committing Idolatry, with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> must needs bear the title of <hi>Holy.</hi>

And the Pope with his Clergy is judged to be so by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, in that he is called the <hi>false Prophet,</hi> as well as the two-horn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">Apoc. 16. 13.</note> Beast, in those Visions of S. <hi>John.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And while he pretends himself to be a Prophet, even without Divine Revelation, one may plainly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:94112:199"/>
that he is a false one from this one notorious. Instance of Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation; which is a Doctrine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to common Sense and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and all the Faculties of the Mind of man, and bears a contradiction to the most plain and indubitable Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of all Arts and Sciences, as I have proved above. So that we may be more sure that this is false, then that we feel our own bodies, or can tell our toes and fingers on our hands and feet. Judge then therefore whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is more likely, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> should be infallible, or Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation a mere Figment, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially it being so serviceable for their worldly Advantages, and they being taken tardy in so many Impostures and Deceits.

                        <hi>the kingdome of God.</hi> And the form of words upon one's Death-bed can no more regenerate any one, then their Quinqueverbiall Charm can transubstantiate the Bread and Wine into the Body and Bloud of <hi>Christ.</hi> Where the form of Absolution has any effect, it must be on such persons as are already really regenerate and unfeignedly and sincerely penitent: which I have shewn to be incompe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible to any one so long and so far forth as he adheres to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. So that in this case one <hi>AEthio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian</hi> does but wash another, which is labour spent in vain.</p>
                     <p>There must be a change of Nature, or no externall Ceremonie nor words can doe any thing. For the form of Absolution is not a Charm, as I said, to change the nature of things, but onely a Ticket to passe Guards and Scouts, and to procure safe Conduct to the Heavenly Regions. But if by Regeneration and due Repentance one has not contracted an alliance and
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:94112:200"/>
affinity with the Saints and Angels, but is really still involved in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure and Hellish nature, the grim Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of that dark Kingdome will most certainly challenge their own, and they will be sure to carry that Soul captive into a sutable place, let the flattering Priest have dismissed her hence with the fairest and most hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full circumstances he could. This is the most hideous, the most dangerous and the most perfidious Cheat of that Church of <hi>Rome</hi> that ever she could light on for the damning of poor cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous Souls, that thus superstitiously depend on the vain breath of their Priest for the security of their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

that great Store and <hi>Treasury of the Merits</hi> of Holy men and women, their works of <hi>Supererogation,</hi> which they pretend to have the keeping and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing of.
