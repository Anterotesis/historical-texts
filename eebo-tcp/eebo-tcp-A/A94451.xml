            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE HONOURABLE CITIE OF LONDON. <hi>The Humble Petition of</hi> Philip Skippon, <abbr>Efq</abbr>
            </head>
            <opener>SHEWETH.</opener>
            <p>THat your Petitioner was a very eminent Inſtrument in carrying on the Work of Reformation; and that he did promote the Good Cauſe with the ſame zeal and endeavours as he did advance himſelf; whereto he is in gratitude obliged to ſay, you were (if not more forward) yet equally prompt with your Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner.</p>
            <p>But now ſo it is (may it pleaſe your Honours) that he finds all that former affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on towards him ſo cold ſince his Patron <hi>Oliver</hi> forſook this light, that he fears you will bring his gray haires down with ſorrow to his grave. He would attribute this change of your favourable and benigne Aſpect to the various mutations of the Times, but that they look ſo inauſpiciouſly and dangerouſly on him, he dares not think on them for his life, although the pleaſure and delight of that is already fled with his money beyond Sea, from whence he is alarum'd the <hi>Dutch</hi> will not part with one ſtiver ſince they heard of his diſgrace.</p>
            <p>In this ſtreight and exigence he hath betook himſelf to his Book of Corollaries, the Chriſtian Souldiers Exerciſe, but to very little conſolation, for there's not a word of returning his Coine again, but a long frivolous Diſcourſe of Patience, which he never intended for himſelf. And oh that one ray of Comfort more would ſhine forth from the Bodkins and Thimbles and the bright Plate-candleſticks in <hi>Guild-hall,</hi> how would he improve ſuch an advantage to his external happineſs! But alas thoſe Silver daies are done, and this iron Age hath overtaken your poor Petitioner.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, in regard of his Service at <hi>Leiſtithiel,</hi> where he alone deſpaired not of your Cauſe (for <hi>Eſſex</hi> had left him in the lurch, and 'twas his beſt courſe to ſhew confidence) be pleaſed to conſider him in this his diſtreſs, and befriend him in theſe following Requeſts.</p>
            <p>That You would be pleaſed by interpoſing Your powerfull aſſiſtance with the Governours of <hi>Suttons</hi> Hoſpital, to get him admitted a Pentioner there; or rather that You would pleaſe to obtain for him from the Parliament the next vacancy of a poore <hi>Knight at Windſor;</hi> otherwiſe your Petitioner, for all General <hi>Moncks</hi> deteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Oaths and Abjuration, will ſet up for himſelf a <hi>Knight of the Poſt,</hi> that's a Military as well as Civil terme, and will ſerve to compenſate his loſt Command of Major General.</p>
            <closer>And your Petitioner ſhall pray, &amp;c.</closer>
