         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

vvhen thou vvouldeſt haue peace
thou canſt not, becauſe vvhen
thou haddeſt it, thou regardeſt
it not: Againe, doſt thou mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure
at plentie? pittie but thou
ſhouldeſt want that is neceſſarie,
vvho hadſt rather ſee thy brother
<pb facs="tcp:5014:10"/>
ſtarue then to releeue him out of
thy aboundance: Oh vngratious
wretch, ſo far from the feeling of
Gods grace, that for a priuat gain
wouldſt wiſh a general griefe, like
a miſer that pinching his belly to
ſpare his purſe, wold ſee the death
of a vvhole Kingdome, to fill vp
one corner of his cofers: or doeſt
thou murmure at the plentie of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
beholding thine own pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nury?
Why, reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber thou brogh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
nothing into the vvorld, nor
ſhalt carry any thing with thee out
of it, and what thou haſt, is but
lent thee, &amp; ſhalbe taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thee,
or thou fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it: ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſt thou not then
content thy ſelfe vvith thy porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
and rather labour for thine
own good, then enuy at the welth
of another? or doſt thou murmur
<pb facs="tcp:5014:10"/>
at the vvealth of many, and thine
own pouerty? looke into thy ſelf,
and ſee if there be not more poo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,
then richer then thy ſelfe; and
if not, yet, that thou art not alone
to beare the burthen of thy croſſe.
But hadſt thou rather ſee a bare
harueſt, a naked tree, a thin Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
and a blaſted vineyard? then
thy barnes full of corn, thy ſtacks
full of hay, thy trees full of fruite,
and thy veſſels full of vvine? canſt
thou ſo much forget God, to bee
vnthankfull for his bleſsings, and
bee ſo vnnaturall to thine owne
heart, as to ſeeke the miſerie of
thine owne Soule? What dogge
would ſhew ſo diuelliſh a nature?
Haddeſt thou rather gnaw vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a
cruſt, then haue a whole loafe?
ſippe of a little cruſe, then drinke
<pb facs="tcp:5014:11"/>
of a full cup? vveare a peece of a
ragge, then a vvhole ſuite of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrell?
and a penny in thy purſe,
rather then thy cheſt full of gold?
then art thou either a foole, that
vnderſtandeſt not vvhat is good
for thee; or a dogge, that diſpiſeſt
that is giuen thee; or a deuill, in
not acknovvledgeing the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of thy God tovvards thee:
hadſt thou rather ſee a table with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
meat, a ſtable vvithout hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
a paſture vvithout Cattell, &amp;
a purſe vvithout a pennie; then
good meate, faire horſes, fat cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
and a full purſe? oh monſter
of nature, vvhat doſt thou then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
men? leaue therefore thy
murmuring, and let me thus farre
aduiſe thee: what thou haſt, ſpend
not vainly; what thou gaineſt, get
<pb facs="tcp:5014:11"/>
not vilely; vvhat thou vvanteſt,
beare patiently; and vvhat thou
giueſt, giue frankely, &amp; murmure
not to part vvith thy ple<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ty, nor at
the plentie of another, for plentie
is a bleſſing of God, vvhich taken
thankfully, breeds many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts,
while penury is a plague, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
inflicted vpon ſinne, or ſent
for a triall of vertue, vvhere pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
poſſeſſing the ſoule, the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
may bee the better ſeruant.
Murmur not therfore at the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of plentie, either vpon thy
ſelfe, or others. Againe, doſt thou
murmure at eaſe? oh vvhat mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
doth poſſeſſe thee? hadſt thou
rather tire out thy body, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> giue
reſt to thy mind? and labor out thy
heart, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> giue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort to thy ſpirit?
hadſt thou rather mourn the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſing?
<pb facs="tcp:5014:12"/>
cry then laugh? run the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vvalke? &amp;
be beaten of thine enemie, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be
kiſſed of thy friend? hadſt thou
rather watch two nights, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſleep
one? vvorke ten dayes, then play
one? and faſt ten vveekes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fare
vvel one? I do not beleeue thee, or
els beleeue thee to be mad. Hadſt
thou rather ride a hard trotter, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
an ambler? ſit on a Pitchforke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
a pillovv? lie on a board the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a bed?
if thy vvil ſo much exceed thy vvit,
I ſhall neuer take thee for a reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Creature; &amp; therfore mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure
not at eaſe, vvhich to nature
is ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fortable, &amp; to reaſon ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable:
but doeſt thou murmur
at eaſe in others, &amp; pain in thy ſelf?
others may haue the eaſe thou wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt,
&amp; thou the eaſe they cannot
haue: they may ſit while thou wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt,
<pb facs="tcp:5014:12"/>
but perhaps walke whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou
ſleepeſt: they may haue health, &amp;
thou ſickneſſe, yet thy conſcience
may be at better quiet: they may
fare delicately, &amp; thou hardly, yet
thy ſtomacke may diſgeſt better:
they may poſſeſſe more, yet thou
be better contented. Murmure
not therefore at eaſe, either in thy
ſelfe, or other, for it is a bleſsing
ſooner loſt then gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; &amp; murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
is the worke of malice, which
once ſetled in the minde, ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwes
more then bodie, when
many kinds of diſeaſes robbe the
heart of all eaſe. Again, dar'ſt thou
murmure at thy King, that hee is
not in all thinges to thy minde:
Traitor vnto God and man, hovv
canſt thou excuſe thy villany? whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
if thou canſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider his worth, &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:5014:13"/>
confeſſe his worthyneſſe, thou
wilt hate thine ovvne ſoule, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

one diſcontentiue thought
of his Maieſtie, or the leaſt
thought of hurt to his ſacred per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon:
but, baſe wretch that thou
art, to grudge at that vvhich thou
canſt not iudge off, or to inioy
that thou art not vvorthy off: for,
if thy King vvere vnlearned, it
might be a ſorrovve to thy heart;
if irreligious, a torment to thy
ſoule; if of baſe linage, it might
haue bin a vvound to thyne Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor;
if Tiranouſly minded, a vvoe
to thy comfort<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if vvickedly incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
a plague to thy patience:
but of a Royall Lyne, from the
Loynes of many Kinges, and fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
one Kingdome to an other, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by vniting of Kingdomes to

in the moſt neceſſary Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages,
as are gratious in his
perſon, and Maieſticall in his
place; in Religion, ſo zelous; in
diſpoſition, ſo vertuous; in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
ſo gracious; as both for his
preſence and his ſpirit, is vvorthy
to be honored, honorably loued,
and louingly ſerued. Hovv canſt
thou be ſo vile of diſpoſition, or
ſenceles of good, as to murmure
at ſo great a bleſsing, as God
hath giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thee in his gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t?
Doeſt thou murmure at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
and loue the ſame thy ſelfe?
Doeth he hunt and delight in
Dogges? better to nouriſh dogs,
<pb facs="tcp:5014:14"/>
vvho ſhevv but their natures, and
vvill bee at their Maſters Seruice,
then to maintain thoſe monſters
of men, that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to the nature
of men, vvill murmure at the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
of their Maſter. Again, hadſt
thou a King vvithout a Queene,
thou mightſt fear trouble through
vvant of Iſſue, but ſo gracious a
Queene, and the mother of ſo
bleſſed Children, ſo Princely a
Progenie, as may glad the hearts
of the vvhole Kingdome; Villain
to thine owne Soule, that vvilt
murmure at theſe Comforts, and
not be thankefull for theſe bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings?
Did he hunt thine heires
from their poſſeſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s? their heads
from their ſhoulders? thy Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
from their Churches? or
thy Cities from their Liberties?
<pb facs="tcp:5014:14"/>
then hadſt thou cauſe to grieue,
but haſt no vvarrant to murmure:
but hee that ſeeketh thy ſafetie,
continueth thy peace, encreaſeth
thy plentie, and maintayneth thy
pleaſure, is louing to thee, reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
in thy loue, and deſerues to
be loued of thee, What deuill can
poſſeſſe thee, that ſuch a King ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
pleaſe thee? wouldſt thou haue
him gouerned by thee, vvho go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernes
the vvhole Kingdome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides

being a Subiect, vvouldeſt bee a

to gouerne, vvhen thou haſt not
learned to be gouerned? Againe,
canſt thou by thy policie vnite
kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, as he hath don by his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon?
art thou ſo wel allied as to link
ſuch loue in royall lines? No, thou
<pb facs="tcp:5014:15"/>
art not; and if thou vvert<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet God
hath made thee a Subiect, and
therefore make not thy ſelfe a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell,
but rather learne hovv to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
his vvill, then to murmure at
his gouernment: be thankefull to
God for the much good in him,
and murmure not at the euill that
thou miſconceiueſt in him; leaſt
God ſeeing thy vileneſſe, bring
thy villany to light, and vvith a
ſhamefull death giue thee the due
of thy deſert: leaue then to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure
at him, and be thankfull for
him, murmure not at his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
conſidering his goodneſſe;
nor at his caſe, for thou knovveſt

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
his vvorthineſſe; nor at his
povver, conſidering his vviſdom:
but loue him, ſerue him, honour
<pb facs="tcp:5014:15"/>
him, and obey him, and be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to the Maieſty of the heauens,
that thou mayeſt behold ſuch a
Maieſty on Earth: Murmure not
at the tribute thou payeſt him, for
all thou haſt is too little for his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice:
Murmure not at the Seruice
thou doſt him, for thou canſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
doe him ynough for his vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thines:
Murmure not at thy vvant
of his bountie, leaſt he ſee more
thy greedineſſe then good vvil. In
ſumme, murmure not at him, not
any thing that may diſlike thee in
him, leaſt God making him ſee
thy vvickednes, thy life make an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſvver
for thy folly, vvhile continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in thy murmuring till thy

at the Counſel, either for the
<pb facs="tcp:5014:16"/>
povver of their authoritie, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of their place, or the State of
their poſſeſsions? Looke backe
into thy ſelfe, and bee aſhamed of
thy ſinne: Is not the care of the
Commonwealth the courſe of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
the quiet of the ſtate, and the
preſeruation of the vvhole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
vnder God and his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie,
in the hands of thoſe Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrats,
vvhoſe vviſdome deſerueth
honour, vvhoſe care deſerueth
praiſe, vvhoſe labour deferueth
vvealth, and vvhoſe vvil deſerueth
obedience; and canſt thou (ſence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe

not able to diſcerne the leaſt
part of their perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, offend thy

the wicked humor of Ingratitude?
<pb facs="tcp:5014:16"/>
vvhich growne out of Ignorance,
bred in Enuie, growes vp in Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,
&amp; ſhall die in Ignominie:
Fie vpon thy inhumane Nature;
that, abiding nothing that is
good, doeſt onely ſeede vpon
Euill: vvho being careleſſe of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
vvouldeſt haue no Law; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
in thy vvill, vvilt endure no
Counſaile; fond in thy vvit, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt
no reckoning of Wiſedome:
and not knowing the labour of
Studie, vvouldeſt allow nothing
for the Studient. Oh vvhat a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
vvoe would be in that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monvvealth,
vvhere thou ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
haue power to appoint Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours?
but leaue thy murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
at them, reuerence them in

<pb facs="tcp:5014:17"/>
vviſedomes, loue them in their
vertues, ſerue them in their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe,
and obey them in their
commaunds: leaſt finding thy
condition, they take order vvith
thy diſpoſition, vvhen to vveede
out ſuch a venemous Serpent, is
neceſſary for the preſeruing of
better ſpirits: for Murmurers are
like to Mutiners, vvhere one cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
villaine may be the ruine of a
whole Camp; for which, if there
vvere not Martiall Lawe, there
vvere no life for the Souldior, nor
honour in Armes. Againe, doeſt
thou murmure at the Lawyer? oh
vvitleſſe creature, how wouldeſt
thou keepe thy Landes, Goods,
or Houſes? if there vvere no Law
to maintaine thy right? How
<pb facs="tcp:5014:17"/>
wouldeſt thou haue thy vvrongs
redreſſed, if there vvere no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of Iuſtice? How ſhould the
King gouerne, and the Subiect
bee gouerned, but by the courſe
of Lawe? And are not the Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
Counſellors, and true Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſters
of the Law, rather to
bee honoured for their learning,
and rewarded for their labours,
then to bee murmured at for
their ſeruice: But liue thou with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the limits of the Law, and thou
vvilt not murmure at their
Lawes: For vvho hateth the
Iudge but the Theefe, the Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
the Coſener, or the Conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer?
and therefore murmure at
thy ſelfe, and leaue murmuring at
Lawyers. Againe, doeſt thou
<pb facs="tcp:5014:18"/>
murmure at the vvord of God?
oh, child of the diuell? is it not
the key of Grace, that openeth
the gate of heauen? and the lamp
of Loue that giues light vnto the
way of life? Is it not the comfort
of the heart? and the food of the

a Treaſure of that vvorth,
that all the vvorld cannot value:
a ioy of that Nature, that dooth
rauiſh the Soules of the Elect:
What ſhall I ſay to thee? But,
thou art a Deuill incarnate, that
ſo farre from the Spirit of Grace,
canſt bee vngratefull for ſo gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
a bleſsing, or murmure at
ſo glorious a gift of <hi>Mercie:</hi> for
to ſcorue the tidings of Saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb facs="tcp:5014:18"/>
is to haſten the vvay vnto

murmure, and the eſtate of Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murers.
<hi>Coran, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biram,</hi>
murmured at <hi>Moſes:</hi> what

at <hi>Dauids</hi> tenne thouſands:
What vvas his end? Hee killed
himſelfe. <hi>Iudas</hi> murmured at the
Boxe of Oyle, that vvas poured

Take heede therefore, murmure
<pb facs="tcp:5014:19"/>
not at the Word, nor at the will

Leaue therefore thy murmuring

vvith Chriſt to obey God; and
then ſhall the Deuill haue no
power to make thee murmure at
God. But let me come to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars;
Doeſt thou murmure
at this man, or that man, for this
cauſe, or that cauſe? Oh vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie
vvretch, how doeſt thou
trouble thy ſelfe? Call thy wits
a little better together, and
vveigh thy thoughts in an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
Ballance: If thou bee vvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer
then another, that is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
before thee, it may bee
hee is more Honourable: If
thou bee more Noble, hee
may bee more vviſe: If thou
more learned, hee more vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant:
If thou more valiant, hee
more vvealthie: If thou more
<pb facs="tcp:5014:20"/>
vvealthy, hee more honeſt; If
thou haſt a good face, hee may
haue a better body; if thou a
good body, he a better face; if
thou a good face and body, he a
better vvit; if thou a better vvit,
he a better heart; if thou an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
heart, yet hee a more graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Soule: and therefore, if ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be aduaunced, and thou diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed,
haue patience, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure
not; for, vvhat knoweſt
thou vvhether God vvill bleſſe
his humilitie, and correct thy
pride, or make him ſwell till hee
burſt, and make a triall of thy
loue in the truth of thy patience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
But let me ſee vvith thy murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
vvhat manner of man hee
ſhould be, vvhom thou wouldeſt
<pb facs="tcp:5014:20"/>
haue moulded to thy minde; if
thou be tall of ſtature, then leſſe
then thou, are dwarfes; if low of
ſtature, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tall men are Cyants;
if of a meane ſtature, then that
is the beſt proportion: So that
except all bee as thou art, thou
vvilt find fault vvith God in his
Creation, or Nature in her Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
or (through lacke of
vvit) vvith Fortune, in her Indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,
in preferring ſuch before
thee, as thou fondly thinkeſt
ſhould come behind thee: when,
if thou haddeſt thine owne eyes,
thou ſhouldeſt ſee in the glaſſe
of Truth ſo many imperfections
in thy ſelfe, as in the conceit of
vnworthineſſe, might make thee
rather come behind many, then
<pb facs="tcp:5014:21"/>
goe before any, and rather grieue
at thy ſelfe, then murmure at an
other: art thou finical &amp; fantaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call?
and wouldſt haue a man to
thine owne mind? what manner
of man ſhall he be? ſhaped like a
picture? countenanced like a
Bride? and talke like a Player?
oh fine foole, how thou wouldeſt
haue the ſigne of a man ſtand for
a man? and if thou be ſuch a one,
wouldeſt thou haue all like thy
ſelfe? alas, the world is ſo full of
fooles alreadie, that there is no
need of any more of them: and
therefore leaue thy murmuring,
and fal to ſome beter reckoning,
leaſt thy account come to worſe
then nothing, and while thou
art wiſe in thine owne conceit,
<pb facs="tcp:5014:21"/>
there may bee more hope of a
foole then of thee: doeſt thou
murmure to ſee a Traueller ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced
for his vertue, while thou
art forgotten for thy ſeruice? per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
his knowledge is more
worth then thy toile, and he hath
taken paines, while thou haſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
at eaſe: art thou a Trauailer,
and murmureſt at the home ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant?
perhaps, hee hath gotten
more wealth at home, then thou
abroad, and taken paines at
home, while thou haſt had plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
abroad; and what knovveſt
thou, vvhether the vviſedome of
State, or rather the vvill of God,
thinke it neceſſarie, to make a
Tryall of thy condition, ere
they revvarde thy deſerts: for
<pb facs="tcp:5014:22"/>
aduancement may bee a hurt to
Ambition, vvhile humilitie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
her heauen in this vvorld.
Murmure not therefore at the
good of another, nor grieue at
the nature of thine own Croſſe:
for, vvhen patience doth kindly
carry it, it is the beſt badge of a
Chriſtian; and doeſt thou mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure
to ſee one of baſe Linage
come to honour, vvhile thou li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt
in diſgrace? Take heed that
hee bee not the firſt, and thou
the laſt of a Noble Houſe, and
rather learne to thriue by his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
then continue thy decay by
thine owne folly. In ſumme,
leaue thy murmuring at the vvill
of God, or the vvelfare of any
man, or at thine owne vvoe; for
<pb facs="tcp:5014:22"/>
God hath his vvoorking in all
things, and if thou vvilt be one
of his children, thou muſt lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uingly
allow of vvhat hee doth.
But now, as to men, let me a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
ſpeake to vvomen. Doeſt
thou being faire, murmure at the
preferment of a foule one, and
in thy rage call her foule dowde?
Alas, thinke Fortune had neede
to doe ſomewhat for her, vvhen
Nature is ſo little her friend. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
it may bee her inward ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
might be of more worth then
thy forced Beautie. Art thou a
foule one? and murmureſt at the
aduancement of a faire creature?
and in diſtemper of thy braine,
call her Picture? Fie vpon thee,
ſo ſhalt thou be no mans meate,
<pb facs="tcp:5014:23"/>
foule vvithout and vvithin: for
the euill mind is more foule, then
the blackeſt face; and if ſhee bee
vertuous vvith her beauty, is ſhee
not then vvorthie of Honor? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
doſt thou murmure at the
vvealth of another, vvhile thou
art in pouertie? vvhy, it may bee
thou knovveſt not hovv ſhe gets
it, &amp; perhaps, thy ſelfe vvouldeſt
not ſo haue it: doeſt thou mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure,
that ſhe is more ſuedto by
Louers? vvhy, it may be ſhe is lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
for change, and thou for
choiſe: doeſt thou murmure at
her that hath more children then
thou? perhaps thou deſerueſt
them not, or it may be God doth
not bleſſe thee to thy deſire. Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
pray therefore then mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure,
<pb facs="tcp:5014:23"/>
leaſt a vvorſe plague befall
thee: doeſt thou murmure to ſee
a vvicked vvench put thee dovvn
in preferment? vvhat doeſt thou
knovv vvhether ſhe haue her hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
in this vvorld, vvhich thou
ſeekeſt not, or begin her hell, ere
ſhe came at it? againe, it may be,
her repentance may be gratious,
vvhen thy pride may be odious:
And therfore be ſhe fair or foule;
vviſe, or fond; vvealthie or poore;
godly, or vvicked, Murmure not
at any vvhatſoeuer ſhee bee, in
vvhat ſtate ſoeuer thou thy ſelfe
be: leaſt, in fretting at others for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
thou conſume thy ſelfe
vvith follie, vvhile he that hateth
the grudging heart, plague
home the Spirite of mallice: but
<pb facs="tcp:5014:24"/>
leauing vvomen as the vveaker
veſſels, let mee come againe to
men, that ſhould haue the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
ſpirits, to withſtand the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of Impatience. Note, I ſay, firſt
of murmuring, how many incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieniences
doe grow to the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murer
himſelfe, and then, to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
by his meanes; and againe,
how great are the comforts of
the contrary: Murmuring trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth
the minde, diſquiets the
heart, diſtempereth the bodie,
and ſometime breedes the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
of the purſe; it forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
reaſon, abuſeth nature, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
diſloialty, diſpleaſeth a friend,
and doth purchaſe an enemie: it
carrieth vvit from reaſon, Reaſon
from Grace, and Nature from her
<pb facs="tcp:5014:24"/>
ſelfe, yea &amp; ſometime, man, euen
from God to the Deuill: while
patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce enduring thoſe perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities,
that put reaſon to his beſt
power; nature is not diſtempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
reaſon not abuſed, grace is
embraced, and God is truely ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured,
the league of amitie is
continued, the law of nature is
not broken; Truth is gratious,
and the ſoule is bleſſed, where
the body is not diſtempered, nor
the mind diſturbed, the creature
is moſt able to giue glory to his
Creator: Note then the differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of theſe two natures: Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring,
a horrible vice, and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
a heauenly vertue; doe but
think on the fruit of murmuring,
and the condition, and end of
<pb facs="tcp:5014:25"/>
murmurers, rages, frettings, wars,
death, pouertie, ſicknes, and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rovv,
vvhile the child is ſicke of
the father, the vvife of the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
the brother of the ſiſter,
and one friend of another; vvhat
maſſacre, or murther hath there
grovvne, but through the inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of murmuring, and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
of murmurers? looke a little,
if thou bee a murmurer, of vvhat
kind thou art, and vvho thou art,
and ſo note the condition of thy
nature, or nature of thy conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
If thou be a man, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mureſt
againſt God, thou art a
Deuill; if thou bee a Subiect, and
murmure againſt thy King, thou
art a Rebell; if thou bee a Sonne
and murmure againſt thy father,
<pb facs="tcp:5014:25"/>
thou ſheweſt a baſtards nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
If thou murmure againſt thy
Brother, an vnkind nature; if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
thy friend, an vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
nature; if againſt an honeſt
man, an vnhoneſt nature; if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
a foole, an vnwiſe nature;
if againſt a Chriſtian, a hetheniſh
nature; if againſt a man, a dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
nature. Thus thou ſeeſt by
murmuring what thou ſhalt bee
eſteemed of God and man,
yea, and in thine ovvne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
of thy ſelfe, either a
Foole, a Knaue, a Heathen, a
Baſtard, a Traytor, a Dogge, of
a Deuill: and doeſt thou then
ſee the villanous nature and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of this qualitie, and wilt
<pb facs="tcp:5014:26"/>
not leaue it? take heede leaſt if
thou continue in it, that God vvil
hate thee for it, doe not ſend thee
to the deuill with it, who was the
firſt Author, and is the continual
nouriſher of it. Againe thinke
with thy ſelfe, when another man
ſhall find thee in thy murmuring,
either by thy diſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentiue coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
or ſoletarie delight, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtring
thy ſelfe from men, to
conuerſe with the Aire, hovv
great will be thy ſhame to heare
the skoffings, that will fall vpon
thy follie? Some will ſay thou art
mad, other, thou art fooliſh, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thou art dogged, but noe
man, that thou art either wiſe,
kind, or well in thy wits: Againe,
when thou haſt reuealed thy folly
<pb facs="tcp:5014:26"/>
to the world, and fretted thy ſelfe
to the heart, with the humor of
an euill ſpirit, and yet art neuer
the better any way, but manie
way a greate deale the worſe,
what canſt thou thinke of thy
ſelfe? but fret that thou dideſt
fret? bluſh at thy ſhame? grieue
at thy follie, and murmure at thy
ſelfe, that thou didſt murmure at
thy ſelfe or any other, while re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
which bringeth ſorrow,
is the beſt fruit of ſuch a frenzie:
Againe, when thou ſhalt ſee the
patience of another bleſſed, and
thy murmuring accurſed, an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
patience enriched, and thy
impatience impoueriſhed, an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
patience aduanced, &amp; thy
murmuring diſgraced, what canſt
<pb facs="tcp:5014:27"/>
thou thinke of it? but a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
eating into thy Soule worſe
then any <hi>Fistula</hi> in thy fleſhe:
pray then to the heauenly Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon
for a plaſter of patience,
with the oyle of true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
to cure thee of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe,
which in the worlde, at
leaſt, by all the Arte of the
Worlde is Incurable: wilt thou
ſee a murmurer truely diſcribed?
that thou maieſt the better hate
to bee his image: Behold his
Eyes, like a hogge, euer bent
downewards as if he were look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into Hell: his cheekes like
an Anathomie, where the fleſhe
from the bones doth fall, with
fretting; his browes euer wrinck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with frownes, to ſhew the
<pb facs="tcp:5014:27"/>
diſtemper of his vnquiet Braine;
his lippes euer puld inward, as if
Enuie would ſpeake, and durſt
not; his tongue, like the ſting of
a Serpent, which vttereth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but poiſon; his voice, like
the hiſſing of an Adder, which
maketh muſique but for hell; his
necke, like a weake piller, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his head ſtands tottering, and
readie to fall; his breaſt like an
impoſtume, that is ready to burſt
with corruption; &amp; his heart, the
Anuile wheron the deuill frames
his fireworke; his body a Trunk
where Sinne hath layed vp her
ſtore; his handes like clawes,
that catch at the world; and his
feete like vvinges, that make
haſt vnto hell: Now, doeſt thou
<pb facs="tcp:5014:28"/>
behold this ougly ſight? and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
not feare to bee ſuch a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter?
what ſhall I then ſay vnto
thee, but if God haue giuen thee
ouer to a reprobate ſence, there
is no reaſon to be had with thee,
nor hope of recouery to bee had
of thee; but, hoping a little bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in thee, let me goe a little fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with thee: The vvorde of
God ſaith <hi>Beati pacifici,</hi> bleſſed
are the peace makers, thinke then
it is a vvorke of the Deuill to
ſovv ſedition, and being at vvar
vvith thy ſelfe; hovv canſt thou
be at peace vvith the vvorld, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
it bee the good vvarre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tvvixt
the ſpirite and the fleſh,
vvhere the peace of conſcience o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercomes
the trouble of conceit;
<pb facs="tcp:5014:28"/>
by patience is the Soule poſſeſt,
vvhich is more vvorth then the
vvhole vvorld, and by murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
is the ſoule loſt, vvhich gon,
vvhat is the gaine of the vvorld?
Is it not ſtrange that all the parts
and the members of the bodie,
can ſo vvell agree togither, and
one doe ſeruice to another, and
men, the parts and members of
a common-vvealth, ſhould be ſo
at variance among themſelues? In
the body of man, if the head ake,
the heart is not vvell, if the Eye
be hurt, the head is diſtempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
the heart is diſeaſed, and all
the body is the vvorſe, if the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
bee hurt, the head vvill ſeeke
to help it, the heart hath a feeling
of it, the Eye vvil pittie it, and the
<pb facs="tcp:5014:29"/>
feete vvill goe for eaſe for it; if
the foote bee hurt, the Head,
Heart, and Hands will ſeeke for
cure of it, while the Eye vvill be
carefull to look to the dreſſing of
it; If the body bee diſeaſed, the
head vvith all the members vvill
labour for the helpe of it, that all
parts being in their perfect ſtate,
the mind or Soule may be at reſt:
&amp; if in this priuate body of man,
all things bee brought vnto this
good order, vvhat ſhame is it
for a common-vvealth, that men
ſhould bee ſo out of order? and
vvhile all parts of the bodie are
at the ſeruice of the head, to the
great peace of the heart, vvhy
ſhould not all Subiects ioyne to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither
<pb facs="tcp:5014:29"/>
in vnity of ſeruice to their
King, to the greate and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
peace of the vvhole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome?
God made all the parts
of the bodie for the Soule, and
vvith the Soule to ſerue him,
and all the Subiects in a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
to ſerue their King, and
with their King to ſerue him.
If the head of the bodie ake,
vvill not the heart bee greatly
greeued? and euerie part feele
his part of the paine of it? and
ſhall a King in his vvill bee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed,
and the hearte of his
kingdome, the heartes of his
Subiects, not haue a feeling
of it? Canne the Eye of the
bodie bee hurt, or greeued,
<pb facs="tcp:5014:30"/>
and neither the head, heart, nor
any other member bee touched
vvith the paine of it? No more
can the Counſell, the Eye of the
common vvealth bee diſturbed;
but the King vvill find it, and the
Common-vvealth vvill feel it;
can the hand, the Artificer, bee
hurt? but the common-vvealth
vvill find the lacke of it, the Eye
with pittie vvil behold it, and the
head vvith the eye, the King vvith
the Counſell take care for the
help of it? Can the labourer, the
foote be vvounded? but the body
of the State vvill feele it, the head
be carefull, the eye ſearchfull, and
the hand bee painfull in the cure
of it? and the common-vvealth?
the body bee diſeaſed, but the
<pb facs="tcp:5014:30"/>
King, his Counſell, and euerie
true Subiect, vvill put to his hand
for the helpe of it? hovv then
grovves this murmuring at the
vvill of God in men? vvhile there
is ſuch an agreement of the parts
in man, but only by the vvorke of
the deuill in man, to bring him
from God and the vvorlde, to
vvorke againſt himſelfe, his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
in the vvorld, and as hee
taught it firſt our pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts to bring
them out of paradiſe, ſo he vvil as
many as he can of their poſterity,
to lead them into Hell: But let
mee tell thee, it is better that a
fevv murmurers periſh vvith their
murmuring, then a vvhole king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
periſh vvith their mallice:
In the holy vvord I find vvritten;
<pb facs="tcp:5014:31"/>
If thine Eye offend thee, pull it
out; if thy hand offend thee, cut
it off: better to enter into heauen
vvith one hand, or one eye, then
vvith both into hell. But all this
vvhile, there is nothing ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of
the head, that muſt ſtill bee kept
on: ſo if a great man, or a meane
man do offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, cut him off, or cut
him ſhort, that he may do no hurt;
for better a me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber periſh, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the
head or the hart ſhould ake, then
either the King, or the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvealth
ſhould bee diſeaſed: but
for the King hovvſoeuer hee bee
diſpoſed, hee muſt not bee di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed:
for it is vvritten, <hi>Touch
not mine annointed, and do my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
no harme:</hi> againe, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
is as the ſin of vvitchcraft;
<pb facs="tcp:5014:31"/>
and vvhat greater tranſgreſſion,
then Rebellion? vvhich chiefly
hath her breeding in murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.
If thou haſt a cruell &amp; vvic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
King, take him for a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and pray for his amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
but murmure not at his
povver: but if thou haſt a good
King, take him as a bleſſing; and
hauing a good King, be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to God for him, &amp; for his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity,
ſerue him, loue him, &amp; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
him, &amp; hate thy ſelfe to haue
a thought of murmuring againſt
him, or any thing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded by
him: looke a little more into thy
glaſſe of murmuring, &amp; ſee (if at
laſt thou haſt the leaſt ſparke of
Gods grace) vvhat thou behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt:
God in the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s frowning
<pb facs="tcp:5014:32"/>
upon thee, his angels either mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring
for thee, or readie to
plague thee, his ſeruants on the
Earth hating thee, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
vvith his angells readie to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
thee; thy Soule made a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle
of ſinne, thy mind made
a torment to thy Soule, thy heart
made a greefe to thy bodie, and
euerie part of thy bodie out of
temper: while being driuen out
of the ground of all goodneſſe,
Thou ſhalt bee left in the maze
of al wickedneſſe, where, looſing
the hope of all co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort, thou ſhalt
liue in the hell of all miſerie; yet,
a little look further into thy ſelfe,
and into the vileneſſe of thy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
if it be touched with that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection:
If the weather pleaſe
<pb facs="tcp:5014:32"/>
thee not, thou wilt murmure at
the heauens: if the world goe not
with thee, thou willt murmure at
the vvorlde; if thy friend re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke
thee, thou vvllt murmure
at his care of thee: If thine enemy
ouercome thee, thou wilt mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure
at his fortune; If thy Father
bee aged, thou wilt murmure at
his life; If thy brother be thine el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
thou wilt murmure at his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance;
If thy neighbour grow
rich, thou wilt murmure at his
proſperitie; If a Stranger bee fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uored,
thou wilt murmure at his
grace, if a Begger bee releeued,
thou wilt murmure at his Almes;
and if a godly man bee beloued,
thou wilt murmure at Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing;
If thou bee a woman, or a
womaniſh man, then how many
<pb facs="tcp:5014:33"/>
things will trouble thee? thou
wilt murmure at faſhions, cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors,
toies, tricks, words, geſtures,
and a world of ſuch idle fancies,
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alwaies the other is the beſt,
&amp; nothing pleaſeth but variety:
hee, or ſhee hath the beſt face, the
beſt eye, the beſt hand, the beſt

foote, ſpeakes beſt, hath the beſt
countenance, ſings beſt, dances
beſt, rides beſt, feeds finelieſt,

thus all is beſt wher there is none
good; while, that, which ſhould
be beſt, ſerues God beſt, is not
ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of: for indeed, who ſerueth
God beſt, will not let his ſpirit be
led away with theſe idle humors:
doſt thou the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſee the follie of this
<pb facs="tcp:5014:33"/>
murmuring, and the hurt of ſo
great a poyſon? ſeeke the cure of

by patience; leaſt if it once get

wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in thy Soule: If thou be
a king, keepe thy ſeate; If a Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier,
know thy place; if a Scholler
plie thy booke; if a Souldier, look
to thine honor; If a marcha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, take
thy fortune; if a farmer follow thy

but murmur not, oh King, if thou

if thou haue not grace; nor Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
if thou want preferment; nor

nor Marcha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, if thou looſe goods;

nor beggar if thou get bare alms:
but murmuring at Gods wil; take
<pb facs="tcp:5014:34"/>
heede that thou looſe not thine
owne ſoule, more precious to
thee, then the whole world: Is it
not ſtrange to ſee the inſenſible
Creatures, what a concord there
is, and among the Creatures of
beſt ſence, ſo great a diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
In muſique the Treble is
the higheſt, and the baſe the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt;
the Tenor and Counter-Tenor
betvveen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: yet though
euery one hath his place, when
they are in their full concord,
they make the ſweeteſt harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny:
ſo in a Kingdome: a King is
the higheſt, and the labourer the
lovveſt: (I leaue out the Beggar
as an vnneceſſary member, but
only for the exerciſe of Charity)
bur, betwixt the King and the
<pb facs="tcp:5014:34"/>
labourer, there are Counſailers,
Preachers, Lawyers, Souldiars,
Marchants, and Artificers, and
when all theſe togither in due al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legeance
to their King, doe true
ſeruice vnto God, hovv excellent
a muſique is the ſound of peace
in ſuch a kingdom: If the ſtrings
be out of tune, the muſique will
be harſh, and if the people bee
out of order, the State cannot be
in peace: Thinke then, if among
theſe inſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſible Creatures be ſuch
an vnity as is moſt pleaſing, why
ſhould not among men bee ſo
great an vnion? that may bee as
well pleaſing as profitable? wee
canne bee contented with the

the oyle of <hi>Candie,</hi> the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb facs="tcp:5014:35"/>
of <hi>Spaine,</hi> the vvine of <hi>France,</hi>
and ſo, of other things, of other
Countries, to mingle with our
owne, to make a medicine for the
comfort or preſeruatiue of our
bodies, &amp; can we not vnite vnto
our ſelues, a people ſo like our
ſelues, &amp; ſo neer vnto our ſelues,
as might be to vs as our ſelues; if
we vvould looke vvith the eye of
Charity, vvhat bleſſing doth
grovv of loue: nothing did part
our land, but a little vvater, and
nothing can part our loue, but a
little vvill: but, as it may be ſaid,
of a more wilfull then wiſe man,
who hauing a coat made all of
one peece, vvas perſvvaded by a
Tailor to haue it cut in peeces,
and vveare guardes vpon the

ſeames; onely to ſet himſelfe on
vvorke, and make againe of the
ſhreds, giuing that part another
name, then before it had, that was
nevv ſet on againe; So, I may
ſay, this Land, once all one, and
by vvhat perſwaſion, I know not
cut off, was ſo lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g guarded, that
it ſeemed to bee of ſome other
ſtuffe, then the vvhole peece, till
it pleaſed God by the great pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of his Grace, in the Maieſtie of
our King to bring both Landes
againe into one: vvhich done, it
now reſteth, that the guards take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
away, no ſeame of diſſeuering be
to be ſeen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but, the Lands, as one
peece of Earth, enlarging the
bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of one Kingdom, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
be vnited in that vnio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that, to
<pb facs="tcp:5014:36"/>
auoid ambition, there be no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſention,
and to maintaine an vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
there be no Rebellion: for, as
there is one God, one King, and
one kingdome: ſo, there ſhould
bee one law, one loue, and one
life, one voice, one heart, and one
people: to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tradictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all reaſons are alleadged,
it is only lacke of loue, that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth
the heauen of ſuch a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines;
But, what euer thou bee,
that murmureſt at this motion,
let me ſay vnto thee, as the poore
woman of <hi>Ireland</hi> ſayes to her
dead husband: oh man, man,
why didſt thou die? Thou hadſt
Cowes, and thou hadſt a horſe;
thou hadſt a ſword, and a ſhirt of

<pb facs="tcp:5014:36"/>
die? ſo thou haſt a good King, a
ſweet Country, a kind people,
and a bleſſed peace, and vvhy
doeſt thou murmure? doeſt thou

That vvhen the murmuring of

vvhere, the people vnited, God is

ſuch a peace is applauded. The

God forbid: let not the Deuil ſo

of Chriſt; that vvhen a kingdom

if vve will be ſubiects, we muſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey

<hi>Eſope</hi> telleth a prettie tale to this
purpoſe: That a Father hauing
many ſonnes often diſagreeing,
and as it vvere at iarre one vvith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
called them before him,
and cauſed euery one to bring
vnto him, a little rod, or vvand,
vvhich taken of them, he bound
them vp altogither in one bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del;
vvhich made faſt vvith a ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d,
he gaue to euery one of his ſons,
one after another to breake;
vvhich they found impoſſible:
<pb facs="tcp:5014:39"/>
whereupon the Father tooke out
euerie rod, and gaue one to each
one of his ſonnes to breake, which
was quicklie performed: Now
quoth the father, ye ſee my ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes
of vvhat a ſtrength is loue, vvher
heartes are vnited togither; for as
theſe vvandes, ſo are yee; ſtrong
vvhen yee are knit togither in the

and to be broken, vvhen you are
diuided one from another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
ſo it may be ſaid of vs: If vve
be vnited, and knitte togither in
the band of brotherlie loue, our

our enimies; but if vve fall

<pb facs="tcp:5014:39"/>
the enimie vvill be ready to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uade

language? &amp; is it not poſsible for
our liues to make vs bretheren in
loues? Let vs ſee, vvher is the fault,
vvhat is the cauſe? and vvhy it
ſhould take place? In God? no,
hee loueth vnity: In the King?
no, hee vvould haue an Vnion:
In the Subiectes? noe, they
vvould bee obedient to their

they vvould bee obedient to
GODS vvill: In vvhome
<pb facs="tcp:5014:40"/>
then? Surely in none, except in
ſome priuate perſons for ſome
priuate cauſes, to ſome priuate
endes: oh then thoſe priuate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
are not for the publique
vveale: thoſe priuate cauſes for
no common good, and thoſe
priuate ends, are for no godly
end, but hoping there are none
ſuch: I ſpeake to none, but vviſh
all vvell, that all may be vvell: Is
not our Religion all one? and
ſhall vvee differ in Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies?
and if our Lavves vvere all
one, ſhould vve differ in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution?
our earth all as one, and
ſhall vvee then differ in nature?
vvhat ſhould bee the cauſe? but
this; vvhile God is vvorking, and
the King is vvilling, the Deuill
<pb facs="tcp:5014:40"/>
is ſtirring, and man is ſtriuing,
but, God is aboue the Deuil, and
a King is aboue his kingdome;
and vvhile God is God, and the
King gratious, though the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill

vvilfull. A true loues knot is long
in knitting, vvhen both endes
muſt meete in the middeſt: but

can there be loue in our liues? or
vnion in our hearts? but I hope,
that God who did create our

our hearts to his will, that wee

It is written that a man

but it may bee vvriten, that man

murmures at the poore man, that

I doubt I haue onely ſpoken of

that the vvorkeman cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree

hammering of a peece of vvorke
ſo vvorth the framing, let mee
make a compariſon betvvixt a

<pb facs="tcp:5014:48"/>
a greate Landlord will haue a
houſe builded, his will muſt bee
obeyed, hee giues commaund

that it bee ſpeedely performed:
The maiſter vvorkeman calls
his labourers, and giues order

Now vvhen the worke is in

is neceſſarie: If either the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men

there will no houſe bee built:
But if they fal to their buſines, &amp;

               </gap>ord God, our Sauiour Ieſus
<pb facs="tcp:5014:49"/>
Chriſt, the great Landlord, and
Lord of Heauen and Earth, will
haue a commonwealth builded,
and his will muſt be obeyed: for
performance whereof, hee hath
giuen commaundement to his

Lord King <hi>Iames</hi> in this world,
vnder God onely workemaiſter
of this vnion: where if either the

or vvhatſoeuer ſhews of loue

<pb facs="tcp:5014:49"/>
but let the labourers be

ſuch a common-vvealth vvill bee

all the vvorld ſhall not hurt it.
Conſider therefore the inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences
of diuiſion, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
and commodities of vnion,
and let not ſelfe-will carrie you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way

you ſee, if you vvill ſtill murmure

hovv many are againſt you?
God himſelfe, who loues vnitie:
the King, vvho vvould haue an v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion:
Subiects, that loue their

<pb facs="tcp:5014:50"/>
God, for they vvill bee obedient

are againſt you, for they will

the birdes, for they vvill ſing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither:
and is it not then a ſhame

goe from your ſelues vnto God,
and goe from the Deuill vnto

and fevv men but ſome vvay diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented:
vvhat ſhall I ſay, to

diuorcement: let then theſe
tvvo kingdomes be one, marrie
them in loue, and ſince our King
is the Father that giues them,
vvhile God himſelfe doth vnite
them, what Subiect or Chriſtian
can be ſo vngratious, as not to
<pb facs="tcp:5014:51"/>
giue his conſent to them? yea let
mee ſay vvith the miniſter in the
time of marriage: if any man
knovv any lavvfull, or iuſt cauſe,
vvhy theſe two Landes, now one
kingdome, ſhould not in marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
be lincked vvith ſuch a loue,
as may make them liue vnder
one lavv, and dvvell togither as
one people, let him novv ſpeake,
or euer hereafter hold his peace:
But if there bee any man, that
knovving no iuſt, nor lavvfull
cauſe, vvill out of the malicious
humor of a vvicked ſpirit, hating
to ſee a heauenly Action vpon
earth, murmur at the bleſſed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
of ſo gratious a worke,
the God of peace make him for
euer hold his peace.</p>
