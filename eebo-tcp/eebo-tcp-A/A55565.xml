            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Madam,</hi> we build no Temples, but if we can contribute any thing towards the Temple of God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair the ruins thereof, it is the highest point of our ambition and hopes. This small Treatise which

            <p n="1">1.

<pb facs="tcp:57360:3"/>
hearty wish) they must bless God and you for it.</p>
            <p>It is my joy, and it will be your <hi>Crown,</hi> that you and your children like that <hi>Elect Lady</hi> (in St. <hi>John</hi>) and her children,<note place="margin">2 Joh. 1.4.</note> do walk in the Truth and persevere therein, in these daies of apostasie: <hi>In this hour of temptation which is come upon all this Kingdom,</hi>

            <p>Yet my reason tells me, and it is the common voice and vote of divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers as I hear, that <hi>Catechising</hi> is a very necessary expedient for the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Christian Religion among us, and the most probable means, if not to
<pb facs="tcp:57360:8"/>
recover the <hi>Diseased</hi> from infection, yet to preserve the <hi>Sound</hi> from being infected.</p>
            <p>The principal way of fortifying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst false Teachers, is to be well-grounded in the principles of true teaching, that is, of the doctrine of Christ; without which, men are like chaff,<note place="margin">Sine magno molimine ab area ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutitur, quod nullo pondere in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra aream tenebatur.

            <p>And hence it is, that the <hi>Master-builders</hi> of our <hi>Sion</hi> (who have spent much pains in the Pulpit, yet) because they have spent so little in foundation-work, have found that they did but <hi>aedificare in ruinam,</hi> and that all their labour was but lost in building.</p>

            <p>This is the benefit and advantage of <hi>Catechistical</hi> exercises and of buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding up a Christian <hi>Methodically,</hi> from the foundation upward. Such an Edifice,<note place="margin">

or casheering of it (for company) with our other prayers of the Church, gives greatet offence to persons <hi>really</hi> godly; who are as much grieved in spirit at this affront as at any other put upon the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion in these frantick <hi>Coryban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiasms</hi> that have (of late years) possessed this Nation.</p>
               <p>The omitting of this <hi>Prayer,</hi> and <hi>Creed,</hi> and <hi>Commandments,</hi> in the public Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, have made some men believe that they were but some <hi>Grotesques,</hi> and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities in our Religion; some <hi>parentheses</hi> (as it were) or things indifferent, that might be used or omitted at pleasure: so that the people have often (since) mused what Religion hath been taught them these 1600 in this land, when the very corner-stones of it are now taken away, and the foundations are digged up.</p>

               <p>But this practice did not begin <hi>with,</hi> or <hi>by</hi> the Apostles neither: for they did but continue what was before in use in the Jewish Church, who admitted Proselytes into their Religion by this Rite or Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Baptizing, besides that of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision; as hath been observed unto us by men well verst in <hi>Rabbinical</hi> Wir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and the <hi>Rituals</hi> of all ages, as <hi>Ains<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi> on <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.12. <hi>Heins.</hi> his <hi>Ex<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>But indeed, the Jewish and the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Baptisms had different purposes and designations: by the one, the Proselytes were baptised into <hi>Moses,</hi> that is, the <hi>Mosaic</hi> Law and O<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>conomie: by the other, into <hi>Christ,</hi> that is, into his Faith, Rule and Discipline.</p>
               <p>And it is farther observed by the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:57360:75"/>
Writers, that of the Jewish proselytes, not onely men of years were baptized, but their young Children were also baptized with them, and received into the bosome of that Church, to be instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in their <hi>Law,</hi> when they should come to years.</p>
               <p>Which usage was taken up by <hi>John</hi> the Baptist, and afterwards by Christ and his Apostles, and continued in the reformed Common wealth, though to another pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose and design, as we touched before; and this Ceremony was thought sufficient to be retained for that end, when Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision was abolished.</p>
               <p>If the issue of the Question touching <hi>Infants-baptism</hi> lay upon this: Whether the Apostles of Christ did baptize Infants? The Scripture (by its own light) doth not clear the doubt, it tells us they bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized whole housholds, which testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies do (of themselves) make it but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that they baptized the children of those housholds: but if <hi>Catholic</hi> tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the voice of the Church he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed so much <hi>civility</hi> and credit with us, as to be believed for a matter of <hi>fact</hi> and story; then the business would soon be put beyond all pretensions of scruple, and made as secure and firm to our sense, as
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:57360:76"/>
any Article of our Creed: As upon the testimony of Travellers, and credible men, I might be induced to believe firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and undoubtedly, that there is such a City as <hi>Constantinople,</hi> though I neither saw it, nor doth the Scripture make any mention of it.</p>

               <p>THis must be understood of the <hi>adulti</hi> or men in years, that have not parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipated of the holy mysteries, but do ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly desire and long for them, but by some impediment and invincible necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, cannot obtain them: If the fault be not on their side, there is no danger, but the <hi>internal</hi> benefit of the Sacrament, is communicated to them, without the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal</hi> symbols.</p>
               <p>The penitent Thief on the cross went to heaven without Baptism, when <hi>Simon Magus</hi> went to hell with it: the children of <hi>Bethlehem</hi> that were baptized in their own blood, were qualified for heaven by that Baptism, without the Baptism of water; and Martyrdom in any other, doth

entitle them to a <hi>crown,</hi> even a crown of glory, though unbaptized.</p>
               <p>When the Emperour <hi>Valentinian</hi> died without Baptism, but had determined to receive it, but that he was prevented by death; St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> doth state his case thus; <hi>Quem regeneraturus eram,</hi>

               <p>In such cases, <hi>Baptismus flaminis sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plet baptismum fluminis,</hi> the Baptism of the Spirit doth supply the want of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-baptism; and the Spirit himself doth <hi>officiate</hi> for the Minister sometimes.</p>
               <p>From hence we may infer, that the case of children dying without Baptism, is not forlorne and disperate: we may not be such <hi>Rhadamanths</hi> as to passe damnatory sentences upon them, for want of that which was not in their power to compass: God doth not tye any to those ordinary Laws and <hi>methods</hi> whereby he saves man, but such as may have them, and are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to use them.

               <p>In like manner the Church of <hi>England,</hi> hath declared her judgement, touching the want of the Eucharist, if there be no more than the bare defect.
