            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>ſt Month of the Year, 1651, and in the Thirty Firſt Year of my Life; I <hi>Roger Hebden,</hi> Son of <hi>John Hebden,</hi> late of <hi>Appleton</hi> in the <hi>Street,</hi> then uſing the Calling of a <hi>Woollen Draper,</hi> and Dwelling in <hi>New Malton:</hi> The Lord God of Heaven and Earth, whoſe Love hath been to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, manifeſt in all Ages, and to all Generations of Men upon the Face of the Earth; about that time did manifeſt himſelf more fully than to many Ages and Generations, in ſending forth his Servants, who in his infinite Love, he had given to know his Kindneſs to them, in placing a Witneſs for himſelf in them, to lead and command them, as
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52316:4"/>
               <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 55.4. And altho' this kindneſs of the great God, the Author of the Good of all Mankind, I was made partaker of, with others, and, at ſundry times had felt his Witneſs at work in me, even when I was but Young, even about the Age, of Eleven or Twelve Years, and at ſeveral times in my Life-time after, bearing Teſtimony againſt the Evil of my Doings, and condemned me for the ſames, yet I knew not that this was of God, neither did I underſtand that this was given to Lead and Command me; and ſo when I did ſuch things as I knew to be evil, was condemned in my ſelf, not knowing who it was that Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned me, as <hi>John</hi> 1.5. &amp; 3.19. But the Lord God, in his infinite Love towards me, appeared, in ſending a faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of his, named <hi>George Fox,</hi> whom he had given to know the way of God, and to direct others to know the ſame, by his Power ſpeaking thorow him, made him ſerviceable to inform me, and bring me to the knowledge of that Light and Grace of God within me; which, when I heard of it, there was raiſed a Witneſs, that I had felt ſuch a thing divers times; and coming to underſtand who it was that I had reſiſted and pierced,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52316:4"/>it wounded me deeply; and after I came to ſee what had been the cauſe of my Trouble, avoiding it, I had Peace, as is in this Book mentioned: And the Lord going on with his Work in me, about ſix Months after, poured forth his Spirit of Prayer and Propheſie upon me. Thus I came to be made a Miniſter of Chriſt, whom I Preach; and in obedience to the ſame Spirit, being led into the World's Aſſemblies, occaſioned my being caſt into Priſon.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>I Being led by the Movings of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Lord in me, to be near <hi>Tadcaſter,</hi> amongſt Friends of Truth, who Worſhip God in Spirit. The 17th Day of the 10th Month, 1654. I came to a Houſe in <hi>Newton,</hi> being accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with divers other Friends, where the People of God were met together, to wait upon God, whilſt I there wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I was ſtirred in Spirit (to go to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52316:5"/>the World's People's Meeting-Place, in that Town, where they Worſhip an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known God) as <hi>Paul</hi> was, whilſt he waited at <hi>Athens,</hi> Acts. 17.16. And for ſpeaking ſuch words there, as are here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after expreſſed, was I by <hi>Robert Barwicke,</hi> called Juſtice, ſent Priſoner to <hi>York</hi>-Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, and kept Priſoner from the time afore-mentioned, until the 16th day of the 11th Month following; at which time, in <hi>Weatherby,</hi> at the Seſſions, I being called, an Indictment (as they call it) was read, wherein the Jury, for him called <hi>Lord Protector,</hi> did upon their Oaths preſent, that <hi>I Wilfully and Mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly,</hi> with ſuch like words, which they uſe in their Form, <hi>at ſuch a time, came to ſuch a place:</hi> By which Form, and through Ignorance, the Jurors, whom I pity, are led, as out of the Doctrine of Chriſt, in Swearing, ſo into the Work of the Devil, to tell Lyes, as I told them then: There was nothing of my Will in going thither, which was, and is my preſent Comfort.</p>
               <p>The thing they charged me withal, was the ſame in the <hi>Mittimus,</hi> namely, <hi>That I uttered unto Maſter</hi> Clapham (as they called him) <hi>many Railing and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viling Speeches;</hi> as, <hi>Thou art a Hirelings, a
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52316:5"/>dumb Dog,</hi> &amp;c. and the like; only that whereas <hi>Robert Barwicke,</hi> called <hi>Juſtice,</hi> ſaid in that Paper, called the <hi>Mittimus,</hi> that I ſpoke theſe words to him, <hi>Before he came forth of the Pulpit;</hi> therein being taxed to be a Lyar: Theſe words before-mentioned, to wit, <hi>Before he came out of the Pulpit,</hi> were left out of the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Therein Deceit was manifeſt, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he had given it under his Hand and Seal in the <hi>Mittimus,</hi> That all that was there written was done in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and hearing.</p>
               <p>Now, <hi>Friends,</hi> to You and to the World, a few words: As concerning what is here Charged upon me, before any of theſe words were ſpoken to him, he proved himſelf, and was ſeen to be what was ſaid of him, and to him; for before I ſpoke one word to him, he ſpoke to me, after he was come forth of the Pulpit: Then I asked him this Queſtion, By what Authority doſt thou ſpeak? He could not anſwer thereunto: And ſo proved himſelf like the <hi>Watch-Men, Iſaiah</hi> ſpoke of, Chap. 56.10. And alſo fled, like the <hi>Hireling Chriſt</hi> ſpoke of, <hi>John</hi> 10.13. before he was ſo called: Then I being moved to ſpeak to the People, to direct them to the <hi>Anointing,</hi>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:52316:6"/>their Teacher within them, the Way to Life; that <hi>Light</hi> wherewith Chriſt Jeſus hath enlightned them: And minding that, they would have no need to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſuch <hi>Hirelings,</hi> whereby their Souls might be deceived. And it being with me, even as it was with the Prophet <hi>Micah,</hi> Chap. 3.8. <hi>I was full of Power by the Spirit of the Lord, and of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> For the Word of the Lord unto me, before I went, was, <hi>Tell them of their Sins:</hi> And ſo to every one, as they came before me, as I was moved of the Lord, I declared unto them their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; and their Portion, without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, which they muſt find; which they called Judging. But as I told <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Barwicke,</hi> if he had been upon Earth, when Chriſt told the Jews, They were <hi>of their Father the Devil,</hi> he would have ſent him to Priſon. Therefore all you, who own this to be of God, be not haſty to ſpeak or act thus, becauſe it is agreeable to Scripture; for a bare literal <hi>Imitation</hi> will not carry forth in time of Trouble, neither will you find benefit by it: For it is only the Spirit of Truth that gives righteous Judgment; wait for the movings thereof. And on the contrary, you that talk of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52316:6"/>Fear to ſpeak evil of thoſe who are brought into the Life and Practice of them, as the Holy Men of God wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed; leſt the Scriptures condemn you.</p>

               <p>And now, further top declare how I was dealt with at that place, called <hi>Seſſions: Robert Barwicke</hi> declared, <hi>Lawyer</hi>-like, That he could do no otherwiſe with me than he had done, ſeeing he had never ſeen my Face before. To which I anſwered, I had been with him upon Occaſions, and often I had ſeen him, and he me. Then he ſaid, I might not affront him. I anſwered, I might not ſuffer him to Lie, but tell him of it. Then, after ſaying what he could againſt me, he at down, ſaying, That he being concerned in the buſineſs, would leave it to them others, called <hi>Juſtices;</hi> who asked me, Whether I would ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit or Traverſe? I anſwered, In the Will of God I was, and what he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them to do with me, they might. Then one of them asked me, What Call or Occaſion I had to that place. I anſwered, The ſame the Prophet <hi>Amos</hi>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:52316:7"/>had, to go into the King's Chappel, to cry againſt the <hi>Altar</hi> in <hi>Bethel;</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> into the <hi>Synagogues,</hi> as his manner was, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.16. <hi>Robert Barwicke</hi> hearing this, roſe up in great Rage, not heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what he had ſaid, That he would leave it to them; and begun to ſpeak his Imaginations, Prieſt-like, wherein was no Truth; and to ſay, that he perceived and thought it was my Practice to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb their Miniſters, as he called them; and proceeded further, uſing theſe Speeches, <hi>Sirrah, Sirrah.</hi> Then I bid him ſee, if theſe words did not come from an envious ſpirit: But he went on with Threats, that if I did ſo any more, he would ſend me to the <hi>Houſe of Correction,</hi> and have me ſoundly Whipp'd; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon theſe words were ſpoken, O <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny!</hi> Then he begun to take witneſs, that I called him a <hi>Tyrant;</hi> but they could not agree, and ſo left it: For one of them, called a <hi>Juſtice,</hi> ſaid, I ſaid, O <hi>Tyranny!</hi> Then they asked me again, whether I would ſubmit or Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe? I anſwered them as before. Then they concluded, that they ſhould get no other anſwer. Then I asked them, What Law I had broken? And ſaid, If I had broken a Law, they might lay the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52316:7"/>Penalty upon me: But they would not ſhew me any Law that I had broken. Then I asked them, If the <hi>Prophets</hi> were Railers? But they ſaid, that they might not diſcourſe with me. Then they cauſed me to be taken away. And thus were they ſuffered to act. And this is their time, wherein they rule over others to their own hurt: Herein they were ſeen, and taken notice of by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, both Officers, Soldiers, and others; the Event I leave unto Him, in whoſe Power I am, who is preſent.</p>

                  <p>Now, as for the former part thereof, in it ſelf lyes open that which hath been hid to many, That free Liberty is granted to all, in their Meeting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Worſhip God: This being made publick, will much reſtrain them that have been Rude, by reaſon of their Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance therein.

               <p>Now all of you, to whoſe hands this ſhall come, do not look upon it in Scorn, and take it ill, and haſtily thereupon Reply, as it is uſual with the People of the World, when they are ſpoken to hereof, What do you tell us? What will the wicked Ones of the World ſay, of Knowing, or Fearing, or Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God? We hope (will they ſay) that we Know, Fear and Serve God, as well as the beſt of you all.</p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:52316:17"/>
               <p>Therefore in love to your Souls, I exhort you all to conſider with your ſelves, whence have you this, to wit, the Knowledge of God, which brings into his Fear, with which he is ſerved, as is required, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 2.11. <hi>Serve the Lord with Fear:</hi> Who taught you it? Have you it any otherways, than from looking upon things without you; from Hearſay, or from the outward Declaration of Scripture, or looking upon your ſelves, and the reſt of the Creation? And from thence conclude, That there muſt be of neceſſity ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing above, or over all theſe things that are to be ſeen; from whence they had a Beginning, and have a Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; as alſo by Hearſay from Man, and the outward Declaration of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that declares of him, from whence all theſe things were and are, that he is God? But what do you know of him? By this you may ſay (knowing that he made all things) he is to be Served and Worſhipped by his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: And you may ſay, That you Serve him, and Worſhip him, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as you have been taught, and ought; all this may be granted, and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:52316:18"/>yet you all this while Strangers to God, yea, ſuch as know him not.</p>
               <p>Thus it was with the Children of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, whom the Lord complains of, by his Prophet, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 1.3. <hi>The Ox knoweth his Owner, and the Aſs his Maſter's Crib, but Iſrael, doth not know, my People doth not conſider:</hi> This People was not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to perform outward Sacrifices and Services, as is mentioned in the 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. <hi>Verſes</hi> of this firſt Chapter of <hi>Iſaiah;</hi> but the Lord asks them, <hi>To what purpoſe is the multitude of your Sacrifices unto me, ſaith the Lord? I am full of the Burntt Offerings of</hi> Rams; <hi>and the Fat of fed Beaſts: And I delight not in the Blood of</hi> Bullocks, <hi>or of</hi> Lambs, <hi>or of</hi> he-Goats; <hi>when you come to appear before me, Who hath required this at your hands, to tread my Courts? Bring no more vain Oblations, Incenſe is an Abomination unto me: The New Moons and Sabbaths, the calling of Aſſimblies,</hi> I <hi>cannot away with, it is Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guity, even the Solemn Meeting; your new Moons, and your appointed Feaſts, my Soul hateth, they are a trouble unto me, I am weary to bear them: And when you ſpread forth your hands, I will hide mine Eyes from you; yea, when you make many Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, I will not hear, your hands are full of Blood.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:52316:18"/>
               <p>Now, although theſe were ſuch Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, as they might have ſaid, That the Lord did require of them; yet there was another thing that the Lord required of them, without which, theſe were not acceptable, as in <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.22, 23. <hi>For, ſaith the Lord, I ſpake not to your Fathers, nor commanded them, in the day that I brought them out of the Land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>concerning Burnt Offerings and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices: But this thing commanded I them, ſaying, Obey my Voice, and I will be your God, and you ſhall be my People,</hi> &amp;c. And in the next verſe it is ſaid, <hi>But they hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened not:</hi> They might ſay, That they did his outward Commands, as theſe did, which he complained of by his Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> before mentioned, which knew not God, nor did conſider him; although he had, as in the firſt of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and 2<abbr>d</abbr> verſe, where it is written, <hi>I have nouriſhed and brought up Children, and they have rebelled againſt me:</hi> For, <hi>Whoſo knows and loves him, will keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments;</hi> this was and is the Sign and Token of ſuch as know God, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2, 3, 4. And hereby we know that we know him, if we keep his <hi>Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;</hi> he that ſaith, <hi>I know him, and keepeth not his Commandments, is a Lyar:</hi>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:52316:19"/>Now the Kingdom of God ſtands not in outward Sacrifices and Obſervances, but firſt comes inward, and there makes known what is to be done without, as Chriſt declares, <hi>The Kingdom of God comes not with outward Obſervations, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall they ſay, Lo here, or lo there; for behold the Kingdom of God is within you, Luke</hi> 17.20, 21. And as the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſaid, the thing which the Lord did require of them, was, to <hi>Obey his Voice;</hi> which if it had been on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his outward Commands, they might have pleaded with him, that theſe they had done; which the Lord by the Prophet asks them, what purpoſe they were to; and tells them, that although they did theſe things, yet his Soul loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them: But the things that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from them, and required of them, was theſe in the Verſes follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.16, 17. <hi>Waſh ye, make ye clean, put away the Evil of your doings from before mine Eyes; ceaſe to do Evil, learn to do Well, ſeek Judgment, relieve the Oppreſſed, judge the Fatherleſs, plead for the Widow:</hi> Whereupon he would be reconciled unto them; and they, thus doing, ſhould come to acquaintance with him, and receive good from him,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:52316:19"/>as in the 18th and 19th Verſes, <hi>Come now, and let us reaſon together, ſaith the Lord; though your Sins be as Scarlet, they ſhall be as white as Snow; though they be red like Crimſon, they ſhall be as wooll. If ye be willing and obedient, ye ſhall eat the good of the Land;</hi> but otherwiſe they might expect from him, as in the 20th Verſe, <hi>But if ye refuſe and rebel, ye ſhall be devoured wit the Sword: For the Mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now, according to theſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, is the Lord's requirings of his People, and Anſwers to them: I witneſs, (Praiſes to the Lord God Almighty for ever-more; to whom alone be the Praiſe for ever; By whom I am moved to write this forth, for the ſimple One's ſake) whilſt I was looking without, and knew nothing, but from Hearing, Conceivings, and from the outward Declaration of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture without; notwithſtanding all my Profeſſion of God in Word and in Action, yet I knew him not, but lived in Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, and under the Curſe and Wrath of God, which I did rhen ſee, and ſometimes feel, although I knew not then from whence it came, nor was not obedient to that which let me ſee it: <hi>But when it pleaſed the Lord, who
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:52316:20"/>ſeparated me from my Mother's Womb, and called me by his Grace, to Reveal his Son in me;</hi> then, not conſulting with Fleſh and Blood, but giving up in obedience to his Commands, made known in me, ceaſing to do Evil, and hearkening to the ſame that called upon me to forſake the Evil, to do well (for that is one in all) whereupon coming to ſee it my Duty, then the Adverſary (within me) of my Soul's good, and the Enemy of God, which would have hindered me, in giving obedience to the Commands of God, and ſo to have diſtruſted his Love, did thus within me alledge, againſt my giving up in Obedience to his Will made known, If it were poſſible that thou could'ſt keep his Commands for the time to come, to be made known to be thy Duty, yet what wilt thou do for what is paſt? Then the Lord was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to make known unto me, by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Teſtimony and Witneſs of his Spirit, which endureth, with plain Words within me, according to the Scripture fore-mentioned, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 1.18. That <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though my Sins had been as Scarlet, they ſhould be as white as Snow; though they had been red like Crimſon, they ſhould be as Wooll:</hi> Whereupon I found Peace; this
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:52316:20"/>Condition being concluded upon, to be obedient unto him for the time to come: This was in the Day of the Lord's great Power, wherein he did render Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance to His Enemies, and Fury to his Adverſaries in me; whereby the <hi>Keepers of the Houſe were made to tremble,</hi> as <hi>Eccl.</hi> 12.3. And in this Day of the Lord's great Power, <hi>looking upon him whom I had pierced,</hi> according to the Prophecy, which that day I witneſſed fulfilled, <hi>Zac,</hi> 12.10. <hi>And I will pour upon the Houſe of</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, <hi>and upon the Inhabitants of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>the Spirit of Grace and of Supplications, and they ſhall look upon me whom they have pierced, and they ſhall mourn for him, as one who mourneth for his only Son, and ſhall be in bitterneſs for him, as one that is in bitterneſs for his firſt Born.</hi> From the reading of this fulfilled, did ariſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and much Rejoycing; and no more remembrance of the Sorrow, for the <hi>Joy, that a Man Child was Born into the World,</hi> as <hi>John</hi> 16.21. Which then I came to ſee, ought to have ruled; which had been crucified in <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Egypt</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in me: In which Day of the Lord's great Power and Love to my Soul, in raiſing up the Seed in me, which ſins not, the Witneſs was manifeſt; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:52316:21"/>the obeying of that in me which is Pure, which doth his Will, I found the Witneſs, and a Teſtimony of his Love; but upon my diſobeying of that, and acting contrary thereunto, I found the Witneſs, and a Teſtimony of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure: And ſo I came to witneſs, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Scripture fore-mentioned, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 1.19, 20. <hi>If ye will be willing and obedient, ye ſhall eat the good of the land; but if ye refuſe and rebel, ye ſhall be devoured with the Sword.</hi> Thus the Scriptures were plain and true to me, and needed no meanings, but as open'd by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. And thus I came to know, and do bear witneſs, according to Scripture, <hi>That which is to be known of God, is to be known within;</hi> which brings into the true Fear and Obedience of him, as in <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.19. Becauſe, <hi>That which may be known of God, is manifeſt in them; for God hath ſhewed it unto them.</hi> And as the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge concerning God, which the World hath, doth ariſe from without; ſo like-wiſe doth their Fear, from what they hear of God, from Man, that he is Juſt, and a Rewarder of Evil Doers; and they conceive that it is thus, from the outward Declaration of Scripture, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſo declares of him: And all
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:52316:21"/>this may be, where there is not any true Fear of God; for where the true Fear of God is, this Effect it works, as theſe Scriptures declare, <hi>The Fear of the Lord is to hate Evil, Pride, Arrogancy, and the Evil Way, and the froward Mouth do I hate,</hi> Prov. 8.13. <hi>And by the Fear of the Lord, Men depart from Evil,</hi> Chap. 16.6. Thus it is, whoſo truly Fear the Lord, not only hate Evil, but depart from it; but many there be, which talk of Fearing God, and live in the Evil; ſuch, who have their Fear towards God, only taught by the Precepts of Men, will plead for it; that it muſt be ſo, and it can be no otherwiſe, whilſt they live here: And theſe do, as they did, whom the Lord complained of by His Prophet, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 29.13. <hi>For as much as this People draws near me with their Mouth, and with their Lips do honour me, but have removed their Hearts far from me; and their Fear towards me is taught by the Precepts of Men.</hi> And as the Lord then threatned, what he would do unto them, <hi>Therefore behold, I will proceed to do a marvellous Work, and a Wonder; for the Wiſdom of their Wiſe Men ſhall periſh, and the Underſtanding of their Prudent Men ſhall be hid.</hi> So it is now at this Day, thoſe who have been
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:52316:22"/>every one in their own Way, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the counſels of their own Hearts, ſeeking into the Myſteries of God, the Sealed Book, to teach others the Way to Fear God; the Counſel of God is hid from ſuch, and they are at Strife amongſt themſelves, about the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of God; one ſaying, <hi>Thus;</hi> and another, <hi>So;</hi> one ſaying, <hi>Lo here;</hi> and another, <hi>Lo there;</hi> one in <hi>this Form,</hi> and another in <hi>that Form;</hi> and they are all in Confuſion; and they, being out of the Fear of God, which is to hate Evil, and depart from it, whould lead others into Ways and Forms, without this: Pretending to Serve God; but they lead them out of the Way of Serving God, who do not lead them into the Holy Fear of him; for ſuch only, as hate and depart from the Evil, do Fear and Serve the Lord right, as <hi>Pſalm</hi> 2.11. <hi>Serve the Lord with Fear.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But theſe now in our Days, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be the Teachers of others the Way, whereby they may Know, Fear, and Serve God, are ſtrangers thereto themſelves; and although they pretend to be <hi>Miniſters of Chriſt,</hi> yet are found to be <hi>Antichriſts,</hi> contradicting Chriſt's own words, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.27. <hi>Neither knows
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:52316:22"/>any Man the Father, ſave the Son; and be to whomſoever the Son will reveal him;</hi> but this way of knowing the Father they deny, who ſay, That none muſt expect now, in theſe Days, to know God any other way than by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which they call his <hi>Revealed Will</hi> and <hi>Word.</hi> And here they ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt Chriſt, in plain Words, (which is their common Practice) to contradict Chriſt's Way to know the Father; to wit, by <hi>Revelation;</hi> but <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations</hi> are to ſuch as fear him; as <hi>Pſalm</hi> 25.14. <hi>The Secrets of the Lord are with them that Fear him;</hi> which <hi>Fear</hi> they being out of, are Strangers and Enemies to; ſuch who come to find the Fruits of the Fear of God, to know his Secrets; and here they muſt of neceſſity ſtand, to uphold their Kingdom, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying <hi>Immediate Revelation;</hi> although it be the Way, and no other Way hath Chriſt left upon Record (thereof) in Scripture, for any Man to know the Father by, but by the <hi>Revelation of his Son.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if they ſhould yield to this, then their goddeſs <hi>Diana,</hi> their Forms, made by the Invention of Man, which they
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:52316:23"/>cry up to poor ignorant People, as of great Concernment, will not only be deſpiſed, but alſo their Learning will be in danger to be ſet at nought; by which Craft they get their Wealth: And as <hi>Demetrius,</hi> Acts 19. with the Workmen of like Occupation, then cryed out, <hi>Great is</hi> Diana <hi>of the</hi> Epheſians: So it is now with the Prieſts and Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, among the dead Forms, they cry out, Great is the uſe of Learning and Study, to gather the Scriptures to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, ſo that one may give the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or make another plain; ſo they come to know the Secrets of God, which they conceive to be in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: But the <hi>Secrets of God</hi> were and are with ſuch as Fear him, which gave forth the Scriptures, as they were mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Holy Ghoſt; and the ſame that gave them forth, the ſame opens them, and nothing elſe can, as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture declares, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11. <hi>The things of God knows no Man, but the Spirit of God:</hi> No, but the Scriptures, to all ſuch as are not led by the Spirit of God, are a <hi>Myſtery,</hi> a <hi>Sealed Book;</hi> but thoſe who come into the Obedience of the Spirit, that gave them forth, to ſuch the <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery</hi> is revealed, the <hi>Seal</hi> taken off: And
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:52316:23"/>ſuch who gave the Scriptures forth, were the deſpiſed ones of the World; and ſuch as are brought into their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, are deſpiſed now, by thoſe who make uſe of their Words to get Gain with, although their Conditions they Scorn and Deride in others, as they would have done by <hi>Moſes,</hi> of whom it is left upon Record, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.21. that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid, <hi>I exceedingly Fear and Quake:</hi> And <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſaid, <hi>Mine Heart within me is broken, becauſe of the Prophets; all my Bones Shake, I am like a Drunken Man, and like a Man whom Wine hath overcome, becauſe of the Lord, and becauſe of the Words of his Holineſs,</hi> Jer. 23.9. And when <hi>Habakkuk</hi> heard the Word of the Lord, <hi>his Belly Trembled, his Lips Quiver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the Voice, rottenneſs entered into his Bones,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Hab.</hi> 3.16. And <hi>Paul</hi> was amongſt the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> in <hi>Weakneſs, and in Fear, and in much Trembling,</hi> 1 Cor. 2, 3. And the <hi>Corinthians</hi> received <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> with <hi>Fear and Trembling,</hi> 2 Cor. 7.15. Yea, thoſe Conditions which the Lord Commanded, and he hath ſaid in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he would have reſpect unto ſuch, they Scorn and Deride, by reaſon of their Ignorance and Malice: And ſo with them, to wit, the Prieſts and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:52316:24"/>Teachers of the People in dead Forms, it is true, as it was with the <hi>Sadduces</hi> that Chriſt ſpoke to, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.29. <hi>They err, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the Power of God;</hi> for although the Lord commanded his Prophet, by his Word, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 12.17, 18. <hi>Moreover the Word of the Lord came unto me, ſaying, Son of Man, Eat thy Bread with Quaking, and Drink thy Water with Trembling, and with Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesſs.</hi> And <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.21, 22. <hi>Hear now this, O Fooliſh People, and without Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; which have Eyes and ſee not, which have Ears and bear not, Fear ye not me ſaith the Lord? Will ye not Tremble at my Preſence?</hi> And the Lord by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> declares, <hi>Iſa. 66.3. But unto this Man will I look, even to him that is Poor, and of a Contrite Spirit. and Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth at my Word:</hi> And in the next verſe reckons up unto them their outward Sacrifices, which he did not at all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, but ſaith, <hi>He that killeth an Ox, is as if be ſlew a Man; he that ſacrificeth a Lamb, as it be cut off a Dog's Neck,</hi> &amp;c. And they which did all theſe outward Services, were ſuch as did caſt forth thoſe which did Tremble at the Word of the Lord, as in the fifth verſe, <hi>Hear the Word of the Lord, ye that Tremble at
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:52316:24"/>the Word of the Lord; Tour Brethren that bated you, and caſt you out, for my Names ſake, ſaid, Let the Lord be glorified: But be ſhall appear to your Joy, and they ſhall be aſhamed.</hi> Theſe that did thus, could have a fair pretence to ſay, <hi>Let the Lord be glorified;</hi> and it is the ſame now; for who are more Zealous for their outward Obſervances? They cry and ſay, <hi>Let the Lord be glorified,</hi> as tho' his Glory therein ſtands; and ſo caſt out, and Reproach with open Mouth, thoſe that ſee the emptineſs of them, and come forth of the Form, into the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Life, to Worſhip God in Spirit, which Service it is only that Glorifies him: But thoſe who Worſhip only in the Form, cry out upon thoſe that Fear God, and Tremble at his Word, and ſay, <hi>Wherfore ſhould the Ordinances be leſt?</hi> And ſo would make the Ignorant Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple believe, That we who fear the Lord, whom the World in Scorn call <hi>Quakers,</hi> who have been made to Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at the Preſence, and at the hearing of the Word of the Lord, as the Holy Men of God did, which Condition the Lord did require and accept; but thoſe who take their Words, but are Strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers unto their Life, and the Power of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:52316:25"/>the Lord, theſe I ſay caſt Reproach up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, and ſay, <hi>That we deny and caſt off the Ordinances of Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> But the time is come, to our Joy, and their Shame will follow; when the Lord comes to lay open their Nakedneſs, and clear our Innocency, in theſe things (as he hath done for me) which Work haſteth greatly, Praiſes Eternal be to him alone, who hath let me ſee (by the Light werewith Chriſt hat en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned me, <hi>Who is the true Light, which enlightneth every one that cometh into the World,</hi> John 1.9.) As the Lord by the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſaith, <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.22, 23. <hi>I ſpake not unto your Fashers, nor command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, in the Day that I brought them our of the Land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>concerning Burnt Offerings and Sacrifices; but this one thing commanded I them, ſaying, Obey my Voice, and I will be your God, and ye ſhall be my People,</hi> &amp;c. And when Jeſus Chrift was upon Earth, and ſpoke unto his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and told them what they muſt do to come after him, he did not tell them, That they muſt Sing <hi>David</hi>'s Condition, either, themſelves or others, or Baptize little Children, or Infants, with Water, or take a Text, or place of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:52316:25"/>Scripture, of another's Condition, and add to it their own Inventions; But theſe things ſaid he unto them, <hi>Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever will come after me, muſt deny himſelf, and take up his Croſs daily, and follow me,</hi> Luke 9.23. And in obedience to his Commands, we deny our ſelves, and take up the Croſs daily that accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies the ſame; whereby we are by him Baptized into that one Body, whereof he is Head; and we <hi>being many, do eat of one Bread, and drink of one Cup,</hi> not Carnal but Spiritual, where true Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion and Fellowſhip lies hid from the World, wherein we are altogether of one Spirit and of one Mind, even of the ſame Mind that was in Chriſt Jeſus, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Apoſtle's Exhortation, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.5.1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.1. <hi>And rejoycing in the ſame Spirit,</hi> Praiſes to our God for ever: <hi>And we Sing with the Spirit, and with the Underſtanding alſo,</hi> I Cor. 14.15. And with the ſame we Pray. But it is not ſo with the World's Teachers, who have their Form, or thoſe who are accounted the beſt of them, that fetch in of the <hi>Saints</hi> Words but dare not, however cannot truly ſay, That they are given them by the Spirit of God; and their Singing is the like, not from the Spirit
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:52316:26"/>of God, but taking <hi>David</hi>'s words, by which he declared the ſeveral Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that he was was in; and theſe they put into the Peoples Mounths, which they do not underſtand, and theſe they Sing without underſtanding; and ſo inſtead of glorifying of God, they diſhouour him; and this is one of the Practices uſed in their Church, as they call it, which is without in the World; but the true Church is in God, the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as in 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.1.</p>
               <p>Now theſe words that they Sing, are true, as they were ſpoken from <hi>David,</hi> who ſaid, That he watered his Couch with his Tears; but it is not ſo with many: And the will Sing his words, who could truly ſay, That he was not <hi>puft up in Mind,</hi> and had <hi>no ſcornſul Eye;</hi> whenas too many are <hi>puft up in Mind,</hi> and have <hi>ſcornful Eyes,</hi> and the like: Thus the Leaders of the People, their Prieſts, in moſt places put ſuch words into the Peoples Mounths, cauſing them to <hi>Err, and make them Hypocrites,</hi> in ſaying, They are as it is not with them; and ſo, by and in them is fulfilled that Scripture, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.16, 17. But if any ſhall ſay, Doth not the Apoſtle, <hi>Jomes</hi> 5.13. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:52316:26"/>
                  <hi>Is any Merry, Let him ſing Pſalms?</hi> Yea, and ſo it is with the redeemed Ones of the Lord, his Ranſomed witneſs that Prophecy fulifilled, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 35.10. and ſuch come to find in themſelves, according to the Apoſtle's Exhortation, being <hi>filled with the Spirit,</hi> Eph. 5.18, 19, 20. <hi>ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto themſelves in Pſalms, and Hymns, and Spiritual Songs, Singing and making Melody in their Hearts unto the Lord; gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thanks always for all things unto God, and the Father, in the Name of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt:</hi> This is to be with the Heart, it is not ſo with the World, I know it; when they are Offering up their Scari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, both of Prayers and Praiſes, they with their Mouths and Lips may be pretending to Serve God, whenas their Hearts may be in another place far from Him, according to Scripture, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.13. And after they have been Bleſſing God, and Singing to his Praiſe, as they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, How often in the ſame Mouth is Curſing? Which thing ought not to be, <hi>James</hi> 3.9, 10. Thus the Leaders of the People, by putting the Name of God in the Mouths of People, who are not in his Fear, they ſpeak it without underſtanding, and ſo take it in Vain, whom the Lord will not <hi>hold guilteſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:52316:27"/>
               <p>And as they have no Scripture for this their Practice, to Sing <hi>David</hi>'s Condition; neither have they and for Sprinkling or Baptizing (as they all it) little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, Infants, with Water, nor any Command from Chriſt in Scripture to do that to any; for thoſe who are got up in Imitation of the Letter, from <hi>John's Baptizing in</hi> Jordan <hi>thoſe that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed their Sins,</hi> Mat. 3.6. (or of his Baptiſm) yet he ſaid, <hi>There was one to come after him, which was preferred before him,</hi> John 1.15 &amp; 30. which was to <hi>Baptize with the Holy Ghoſt and with Fire,</hi> Mat. 3.11. And that he <hi>muſt Decreaſe, but Chriſt muſt Increaſe,</hi> John 3.30. This of Chriſt's being the true Baptiſm that was to encreaſe: The Apoſtle ſpeaks but of <hi>One Baptiſm,</hi> in <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.5, and by <hi>One Spirit,</hi> not by any Outward Sprinkling or Dipping into Water, that the Saints were <hi>Baptized into One Body,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.13. This Outward with Water, is not the Baptiſm that is to <hi>Save us</hi> (whereof that of <hi>Noah</hi>'s being ſaved in the Ark, was a <hi>Figure) but the anſwer of a good Conſcience towards God, by the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> according to 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.20, 21. Many may come to the outward <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> to have the filth of the Fleſh
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:52316:27"/>put off, but want the anſwer of a good Conſcience towards God, by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt: This I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a ſight of, was, through the Love of God towards me, a means to keep me back from going into thoſe other Forms in the World, that differed from the publick Profeſſion that was in this Nation; I being let ſee, that I might get into them, and no change in my Life wrought: And theſe Cries were often in mine Ears, <hi>Born again,</hi> a <hi>new Creature;</hi> which Condition is now wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed, Praiſes to our God for ever, by thoſe who come to witneſs that <hi>Baptiſm of the Spirit,</hi> ſpoken of in Scripture, whereby they come to be <hi>Buried with him by Baptiſm into Death,</hi> Rom 6.3, 4. <hi>And to be made partakers of his Sufferings, wherein is Rejoycing,</hi> 1 Pet. 4.13. But this is not known by Water-Baptiſm, but by the Obeying of the Spirit of our God.</p>
               <p>And as the World's Baptiſm is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, with Water; ſo is their Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on without, in Bread and Wine, which they call a <hi>Sacrament:</hi> For which, as now uſed by them, they have no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand from Chriſt, nor any ſuch Name given in Scripture to the outward Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:52316:28"/>And though Chriſt did eat the Paſſover with his Diſciples before he left them, yet he ſaid, <hi>That be would not hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth drink of this Fruit of the Vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's Kingdom,</hi> Mat. 26.29. Which <hi>Kingdom</hi> being Spiritual, it <hi>ſtands in that which is above all Carnal Things: For the Saints Communion and Fellowſhip is in the Light; 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.7. <hi>But if we walk in the Light as he is in the Light, we have Fellowſhip one with another;</hi> and their Fellowſhip</hi> was not only, <hi>One with another;</hi> but <hi>With the Father, and with his Son Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> 1 John 1.3. And it is the ſame now; they who walk in the Light finds it ſo. But I know it is not ſo with the World, by their receiving Bread and Wine; for when I did receive that with them, there was a thirſting that with them, there was a thirſting to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſomething of Chriſt with the Bread and Wine, but could get nothing, but came away empty. And after they have received Bread and Wine together, they are not thereby United into One; but too often live in Strife and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, as formerly, without any change at all.</p>
               <p>Neither have the Teachers of the World my Command from Chriſt, in
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:52316:28"/>Scripture, for taking a Text, or place of Scripture and to add thereto their own Inventions. But if any ſhall ſay, <hi>That Jeſus went into the Synagogue, and there was delivered unto him the Book of the Prophet</hi> Iſaih; <hi>and when he had opened the the Book, be found the place where it was written, The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, becauſe be hath anointed me to preach the Goſpel to the Poor,</hi> &amp;c. Luke 4.16, 17, 18, 19. From this ſome may conclude in themſelves, and ſay, That he took a Text, or place of Scripture, to ſpeak from it. To which I anſwer, It was not the words ſpoken of another, or another's Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but the Prophecy concerning him, which was then fulſilled; the Spinit of the Lond then being upon him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he did preach the Goſpel to the Poor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As in the 21 <hi>ſt</hi> verſe, <hi>He began to fay unto them, This day is this Scripture fulfilled in your ears.</hi> But which of the Teachers of the World can ſay truly, That they are, by the Spirit of the Lord being upon them, Anointed to preach the Goſpel to the Poor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as it was there written in that Prophecy of him, which he ſaid was then fulfilled? But other ways, by Man they are appointed, and the Love of Lucre, with the Praiſe
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:52316:29"/>of Men, are the chief Motives to put them forward to ſpeak: And ſo if they will follow Chriſt, let them follow him, and in plainneſs and honeſty in this his Practice, take the Scriptures that ſpeak of them, their Practive and Condition, as he did of his, which is fulfilled in them and by them; and then they may take the Book of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and open it in their Synagogues, and read to the People that place, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 56.11. where he ſpeaking before of the <hi>Watch-men,</hi> ſaith, <hi>They are Shepherds that cannot underſtand, they all look to their own way, every one for his gain from his quater;</hi> taking this Scripture, and reading it to the People, applying it to themſelves, that they are ſuch as look to their own way, every one for his gain from his quarter; that Scripture the People may witneſs with them, to be true in them, and fulfilled by them.</p>
               <p>And ſo they may turn into the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> where they may read themſelves unto the People; they being ſuch as <hi>bear Rule by their Means,</hi> Jer. 5.31. <hi>And which ſteal the Word from their Neighbour; which the Lord us againſt.</hi> For although they will be taking the Scriptures into their Mounths, can they
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:52316:29"/>prove that the Lord dit ever ſpeak by them? For their Trading with the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, is by Stealing from others; and as then, <hi>they did run, when the Lord did not ſend them,</hi> as in the ſame Chapter, verſe 22. <hi>therefore they profited not the People;</hi> let them read that unto the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: Wherein the People may ſee the cauſe why they have not profited by them.</p>
               <p>They may likewiſe read unto the People what the Lord by the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſaid that the falſe Prophets did, <hi>Chap. 34.3. They ſeek for the Fleece, and feed not the Flock;</hi> this they may read, and this the People who are not blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed may witneſs to be their greateſt Care, for to get the Fleece, more than to ſeed the Flock.</p>
               <p>They may turn unto the third Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Micah,</hi> and read in the 11th verſe, of <hi>Prieſts that taught for Hire;</hi> and ſuch as put into the falſe Prophets Mouths, then, they cry'd <hi>peace to them,</hi> as in verſe 5. but he that put not into their Mouths, <hi>they prepared war againſt him.</hi> Theſe Scriptures are fulfilled in them and by them; they teach for hire, and ſuch as will give them their deſire, they ſpeak Peace to ſuch, and will call them good <hi>Chriſtians;</hi>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:52316:30"/>but ſuch as cannot ſatisfie their deſires, ſeeing them to be no Miniſters of Chriſt, and ſo cannot maintain them, by acting againſt their Conſciences; againſt ſuch they do prepare War; either by Suing them at the Law, or Smiting with the Tongue, as <hi>Jer.</hi> 18.18. and with ſome of theſe they make War, againſt ſuch as cannot give them their Wages, becauſe they are not of Chriſt's ſetting down, agreeable unto <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. and <hi>Luke</hi> 10. Read theſe places, and there you may ſee the Wages that Chriſt appoints his Diſciples.</p>
               <p>Further, if they will imitate in Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Scripture belonging unto them, then they may read <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.67. <hi>Who love the uppermoſt Rooms at Feaſts, chief Seats in the Synagogues, Greetings in the Markets; and to be called of Men, Rabbi, Rabbi.</hi> And as the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> did bid others obſerve and do ſuch things as they did not themſelves, and laid heavy Burdens upon others, but they themſelves would not touch them, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.3, 4. So it is now with the <hi>Prieſts</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> the People may wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with me, that theſe Scriptures are true in them, and fulfilled by them: Woe from Chriſt was and is their Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:52316:30"/>And in the 11th verſe of the Epiſtle of <hi>Jude,</hi> they may read where their Portion is ſet down before their Practice: <hi>Woe unto them, for they have gone in the way of</hi> Cain, <hi>and ran greedily after the error of</hi> Balaam <hi>for reward;</hi> which is manifeſt at this day by their Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Suing Men at Law for their Wages.</p>
               <p>And the laſt place that I ſhall now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire them to read, is, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1. where the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>But as there were falſe Prophets alſo among the People, even as there ſhall be falſe Teachers amongſt you.</hi> And in the 3<abbr>d</abbr> verſe thus, <hi>And through Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhall they with fained words make Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe of you,</hi> &amp;c. This is their Practice, and is manifeſt to moſt Men, that their exchanging of Place and People is, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant-like, to get Gain; for the better ſome way, if not always for the more Money: And for their often exchanging, fained words they do not want, ſaying ſometimes, that they are ſorry to leave them; others, that they do not ſee that Fruit of their Miniſtry which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire; and thereupon they do and may exchange; as one did, to wit, Prieſt <hi>Sinclare</hi> of <hi>Slingsby,</hi> near <hi>Malton,</hi> in <hi>York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire;</hi> who having, within a few Years
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:52316:31"/>time, been at three Places, or Livings, as they are called; being come unto the fourth, I asked him the cauſe Why and How they could ſo often exchange? He anſwered, That they might, when they did not ſee that fruit of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry that they deſired: As if it were to ſee a change of Reformation in the People, as he pretended then. But unto me it doth plainly appear ſince, that it was <hi>fained;</hi> and that in his Conſcience will witneſs with me, that it was his own Earthly Profit, more than the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's Good: For this I know, that in reſpect of the People's Wickedneſs, he had as much cauſe to exchange, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Little Fruit or Reformation of Life doth appear; the ſame fained excuſe he might have, if he knew of a greater Living: For where he is now, is near, if not more than double the value of that he left; and there he had continued longer than at two places before. And thus it is with moſt, if not all of them, when they exchange Place and People, it is for the greater Profit; Self is in it commonly plain to be ſeen: And herein they go from Chriſt, and do not take that way to come after him, that he hath ſet down, <hi>Luke</hi> 9.23. <hi>If any Man
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:52316:31"/>will come after me, he muſt deny himſelf, and take up his Croſs daily, and follow me:</hi> But their way that they pretend to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ow him in, is in pleaſing themſelves, and to have their Wills at Liberty, and rule over others: And although Chriſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, Thoſe that will find Reſt to their Souls, to take his Yoak upon them, and learn of him to be meek and lowly in Heart, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.29. Yet theſe Pretenders are not ſo; for, Who more Proud or Impatient than they? Or, greater Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns of Pride in the Pariſh, than their Wives and Children in moſt places? I leave to all who have any Eyes to ſee, and behold, and judge, as there is juſt cauſe. If any ſhall ſay, Pride lies in the Heart, I know it; but as the Tree is known by its Fruits, even ſo the Heart may be known by its Fruits; for the Image of its delight is ſet up within, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be ſet up without; this or that thing which they deſire, or ſee others have, the Heart thinks is Good or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and it would have the like: And are not they, to wit, the Prieſts, their Wives and Children, ſuch as follow the Faſhions of the World, in uſing needleſs things, which are to ſatisfie the vain Mind, and the luſtful deſires of the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:52316:32"/>Heart; and the Apoſtle's Exhortation they are out of, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.14. and ſo ſhew themſelves to be in Ignorance, and luſt alive, many contending for the continuing of Sin, and the Devils Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Theſe Scriptures fore-mentioned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the Prieſts practiſed, are recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended unto them for to read unto the People, which they ought in Plainneſs and Simplicity, as it doth concern them, to take them to themſelves, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that they are their Conditions, and that they are the Men that have done theſe things and are guilty; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon forſaking, and no more practiſing that horrible and filthy thing, that hath been committed in this Land by them, to bear rule <hi>by their means,</hi> to ſeek for their <hi>Gain from their Quarter,</hi> to <hi>Teach for Hire,</hi> and other-like Practices heretofore mentioned, committed by them; they not only (as they come to ſee it) ſimply confeſſing it, but honeſtly forſaking it, then they ſhall find Mercy; but if they cover and hide their Sins, they ſhall not proſper: And this I was moved by the Spirit of the Lord to write unto them, that they may not plead Ignorance. Now you are warned of the Evil that
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:52316:32"/>ſhall follow, whilſt you have time, prize it, and return unto the Lord, leſt you remember this when it is too late, which is from him, who is a lover of your Souls: And this word is to you, O Prieſts.</p>
               <p>And in the mean time (until your Prieſts come unto this Honeſty, as to confeſs and forſake theſe filthy Practices) all you that profeſs your ſelves to be Chriſtians, and own the Scriptures, ſearch the Scriptures, and ſee if theſe things be not ſo; and if you find that it be ſo, and that your Teachers are ſuch in their Practices, as the true Prophets, Chriſt and his Apoſtles ſpoke againſt, then take heed, I warn you from the Lord, how you joyn with them, to hold them up in their Sins, leſt you partake of their Plagues. Now you are forewarned of the Evil, know that the Light is ariſen, that diſcovers their Ways and Deeds of Darkneſs in their Practices; therefore come forth from amongſt theſe wicked Men, who fear not God, but live in theſe wicked Practices fore-mentioned: And this word is to you, O People.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object,</hi> Now if any ſhall ſay (as they muſt if they will but ſpeak Truth) We
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:52316:33"/>know it is ſo with the moſt of them, but if we leave them, How ſhall we do for Teaching? They have Learning, and they are moſt likely to know the meaning of the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Scriptures were not given forth by the Learning, Wiſdom, not Will of Man, as in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. <hi>The Propheſie came not in old time by the Will of Man, but holy Men of God ſpake as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> And in the fore-going verſe he ſaith, <hi>Know this firſt, that no Propheſie of the Scripture is of any private Interpretation;</hi> and that nothing but that which gave them forth, can open them: And ſo in vain it is for you to go to ſuch, as ſay, They are not guided by the Spirit that gave forth the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor do therewith ſpeak, when unto you they do ſpeak of the Scriptures; nay, their Fruits, their Lives and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations will Witneſs it againſt them, if they ſhould affirm it with words: This know likewiſe, many of thoſe who gave forth the Scriptures, were Unlearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men in the World's Learning; nay, from the World's Learning they did not ſpeak them forth, but from the Mouth of the Lord, by the movings of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:52316:33"/>which the World's Wiſdom cannot reach; for Man by this Wiſdom knows not God, nor the things of God: We read that <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>David</hi> were keepers of Sheep, and <hi>Eliſha</hi> was a Plowman, that <hi>Amos</hi> was an Herdſman; and they ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>How knows this Man Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, having never learned?</hi> John 7.14, 15. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> being brought before the Rulers, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.13. The Rulers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that they were Unlearned, and Ignorant Men, marvelled; and divers of the Apoſtles were Fiſhermen; and <hi>Paul,</hi> tho' a learned Man, yet was a Tent-maker, <hi>Acts</hi> 18.3. And what things formerly he accounted gain to him, he accounted loſs for the excellency of the Knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus his Lord; and he did account them but Dung, that he might win Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.7, 8. which Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, even the Knowledge of Chriſt, he received not from Man, but by the Grace of God appearing unto him, which revealed the ſame within him, <hi>Gal.</hi> 15.16. And thi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſame Grace which appeared unto him, was and is the Saints Teacher, and whoſo are obedient unto it, it teaches them to deny Ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Worldly Luſts. <hi>Pilate,</hi> who crucified Chriſt, writ over his Head, in

                  <hi>Hebrew, Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine. The King of the Jews,</hi> John. 19.19, 20. And theſe Tongues many may underſtand, who know nothing of the things of God, neither can they receive them, for <hi>they are ſpiritually diſcerned,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.14. But theſe Tongues are Natural, and a natural Man may have them; and they do not tech any to depart from Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs; but the Grace of God being obeyed, doth; which is witneſſed, as in Scripture is declared, <hi>Titus</hi> 2.11, 12. <hi>The Grace of God that bringeth Salvation, hath appeared to all Men; teaching us, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying Ungodlineſs, and worldly Luſts, we ſhould live Soberly, Righteouſly and Godlily in this preſent World.</hi> This their Teacher was the Grace of God, which is near every one, within them; and the Church of God now witneſſing the Teachings thereof, come to the Promiſe, even the Word which is within, <hi>in the Mouth, and in the Heart;</hi> the ſame which the Lord did give to the Children of Iſrael, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.11, 12, 13, 14. <hi>For this Commandment which I command thee this day, it is not hidden from thee, neither is it, far off; it is not in Heaven, that thou ſhouldeſt ſay, Who ſhall go up for us to Heaven, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:52316:34"/>do it? Neither is it beyond the Sea, that thou ſhouldeſt ſay, Who ſhall go over the Sea for us, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it? But the Word is very nigh unto thee, in thy Mouth, and in thine Heart, that thou mayſt do it:</hi> Which doth agree, and is one with that, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.5, 6, 7, 8. where the Apoſtle ſpeaking of Chriſt being the end of the Law, for Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, to every one that believeth; <hi>For</hi> Moſes <hi>deſcribeth the Righeouſneſs which is of the Law, that the Man that doth theſe things, ſhall live by them; But the Righteouſneſs which is of Faith, ſpeaketh on this wiſe, Say not in thine Heart, Who ſhall aſcend into Heaven, that is, to bring Chriſt down from above? Or, Who ſhall deſcend into the deep, that is, to bring Chriſt up again from the Dead? But, what ſaith it? The Word is nigh thee, in thy Mouth and in thy Heart: That is, the Word of Faith which we Preach.</hi> And in <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.12, 13. <hi>The Word of God is quick and powerful, and Sharper than any two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edged Sword; piercing, even to the dividing aſunder of Soul and Spirit, and of the Joynts and Marrow; and it is a Diſcerner of the Thoughts and Intents of the Heart: Neigther is there any Creature that is not manifeſt in his Sight; but all things are naked and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:52316:35"/>open before Him, with whom we have to do.</hi> Thus the Scripture teſtifies of the Word of God; it is quick, and hath Power in it: That within, which lies under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath in all, whilſt they are in the Fall; this is that which with a <hi>ſtill low Voice,</hi> as if it were behind one, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.20, 21. when they turn out of the Commands of God, to act Wickedneſs, tells them in ſecret, that ſuch a thing they ought not to do; and this riſes up in them, when they do Evil; as when they tell a Lye, or when they think evil Thoughts, Hate or Back-bite, and tells them they ought not ſo to do: Yea, I do appeal to any, who have but any Knowledge of their Conditions, whether they have not found ſomething within them, time after time, check them for Evil Deeds, and that hath plainly ſhewn them, that they ought not to have done ſo as they did; when as they did Swear, Lie, were Drunk, or have been wrathful or envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous againſt others; when ſuch deeds have been done by them, then they have cryed for Mercy, and ſaid, They had done wrong: Now ſomething there was within them, that let them ſee plainly, That they ought not to have done ſo, although they did not know
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:52316:35"/>what it was; here <hi>Light ſhined in Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but the Darkneſs comprehended it not:</hi> And ſo it was with me many times; for there was that in me which did check me ſecretly, when I did tell a Lie for my Profit and Pleaſure, but I did not know what that was; yea, many a time, after I had done ſuch a thing, as to tell a Lie, I ſhould have been troubled in my ſelf for it: And there was ſomething in me that would have brought it to remembrance again, a good while after, as freſh as though it had been then ſpoken; yea, things which I did in ſecret, which none knew of without, to tell of them, ſuch things were raiſed up again into the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, even my ſecret Thoughts, and evil Intents, could not be kept, but theſe things would have been brought to remembrance, that ſuch a thing thou didſt, at ſuch a time, in ſuch a place; and ſuch Thoughts thou didſt think, which were evil: All things that ever I did, were laid open by the Righteous Law of God within me; yea, the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Wrath of God were ſhouwn me by the ſame to be my Portion: And I did not know any way how to get free from the ſame. And although it were many times ſhown me, that ſuch
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:52316:36"/>a thing I had done, and thereupon the Wrath of God was ſhown likewiſe to be the Portion thereof; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, I did ſtill run into the ſame, although I was condemned in my ſelf for it, not knowing what it was which did condemn me; ſo this was in a time of ignorance, as to the knowing what it was; yet there was that in me which cleared the Lord, when he did ariſe to Judgment in me: And if he had Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally Condemned me, my Condemnation had been juſt, for my diſobeying of what I knew: So that I know that the Lord will be Juſtified when he ariſes to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and all Mouths ſhall be ſtopped: for my Condemnation was not, in the Day of Account, for what I did not know, but that ſuch things were made known unto me to be my Duty to have done and I did them not; neither ſhall any be Condemned for what they know not, but for what they know, and do not obey: <hi>This is the Condemnation, that Light is come, yet Men love Darkneſs ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than Light,</hi> John. 3.19. This was true, I witneſs.</p>
               <p>And as the Word of God is thus Quick and Powerful, and ſearches the Heart, the Secrets thereof; rips up, lays
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:52316:36"/>open, and brings to remembrance things done in the dark; and ſo lets every one ſee the juſt Judgments of God to be their Portion, for acting contrary thereto. So the ſame which thus Checks and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves for Sin, the ſame being hearken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto, and obedience thereto being yielded, the ſame will remove the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and cleanſe from Sin; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Judgment, pour in <hi>Healing Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,</hi> as <hi>Hoſea</hi> 6.1. <hi>Come, and let us return unto the Lord; for he hath torn, and he will heal us: be hath ſmitten, and be will bind us up:</hi> This is witneſſed. And by obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame, their ways come to be cleanſed, as <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119.9. <hi>Wherewithal ſhall a young Man cleanſe his way? By taking heed thereto, according to thy. Word.</hi> If any ſay, That none can have their Ways cleanſed: Yet, <hi>David,</hi> the Prophet of the Lord, ſaid, That by taking heed to one's Ways, according to the Word of the Lord, a young Man may cleanſe his Ways: And in the 11th verſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares where this was, <hi>Thy Word have I hid in my Heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But if any ſhall ſay, Is Chriſt, the Word of God, in Men?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I anſwer with the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Examine your ſelves; know ye not
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:52316:37"/>your own ſelves, how that Jeſus Chriſt is in you, except you be Reprobates?</hi> But this may be hid from many, to know that he is there although it be ſo: Light doth ſhine in Darkneſs, although the Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs do not comprehend it; and ſo it is a Myſtery hid, as it hath been to know Chriſt within: Many that have expected Salvation from Chriſt, have been chiefly looking without them, and have not minded him; as is this <hi>Myſtery, which hath been hid from Ages and from Generations, but now is made manifeſt to his Saints; to whom God would make known what is the Riches of the Glory of this Myſtery among the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles; which is Chriſt in you the Hope of Glory,</hi> Col. 1.26, 27. And that <hi>Myſtery</hi> the Apoſtle found Revealed in him, by the Grace of God, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.15, 16. So that when it pleaſed God, who ſeparated him from his Mother's Womb, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him by his Grace, and revealed his Son in him, that he might preach Him unto the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> this was the true <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which he thus preached unto the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> whom the Lord was pleaſed by his Grace to reveal in him, as in plain words is here expreſſed. And this is Chriſt which we now preach, even the ſame as the Apoſtle preached; and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:52316:37"/>preaches any other, let him be accurſed; for we preach not our ſelves, but Chriſt Jeſus the Lord; and commend our ſelves to every Man's Conſcience in the ſight of God: <hi>For God, who command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Light to ſhine out of Darkneſs, hath ſhined in our Hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the Glory of our God, in the face of Jeſus Chriſts,</hi> 2 Cor. 2.5, 6. And ſo it is now, the ſame Light that hath ſhined in our Hearts, from God the Father of Lights, whereby we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Knowledge of God in the Pace of Jeſus Chriſt; the ſame we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to others, that they may come to the like Knowledge with us; and <hi>Rom. 1.15. That which may be known of God, is manifeſt in them; for God hath ſhewed it unto them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So turn within, to that which is Pure of God in you, to be guided by that which will lead you out of the Deeds of Darkneſs, into the Light of the Lord; and walking in it, you will come into the Land of the Living; and no more to be led to look for the Kingdom of God (in outward Obſervations) which I declare to be within; and the Scriptures witneſs with me, and ſo we agree: But whilſt I knew nothing but from Men,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:52316:38"/>I did not know It to be there, although the Scriptures ſo declare, as <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. <hi>That the Word is within; and that Chriſt is within,</hi> as Col. 1. Gal. 1. Rom. 10. <hi>And when the Phariſees demanded of Chriſt, when the Kingdom of God ſhould come, he anſwered them, and ſaid, The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God comes not with Obſervation; neither ſhall they ſay, Lo berk; or, Lo there for, behold, the Kingdom of God is within you,</hi> Luke 17.20, 21. Within the <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees,</hi> while they were looking without, and obſerving things without, to get thither, as it hath been the Practice, of many Profeſſors; but he tells them, It was <hi>within them, and did not ſtand in Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation;</hi> croſs to their Expectations That which keeps only in outward Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, leads into Conſuſion and Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; one ſaying, Lo here; another, Lo there; one ſays, This is the Way; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſays, Such a Way is the Way: So they differ about the Way, and come not to the end. <hi>But the Kingdom of God is not Meat and Drink, but Righteouſneſs, and Peace, and Joy in the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> as in Scripture is declared, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.17. And as Chriſt compares it, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.20, 21. <hi>Whereunto ſhall I liken the Kingdom of God? It is like unto Leaven, which
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:52316:38"/>Woman took and hid in three Meaſures of Meal, till the whole was leavened:</hi> And ſo it is, That of God in the Creature, Mankind, as he is under the Curſe, and in the Fall, is to him little, when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the great Lump of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Nature, which hides it: And That of God lyes low, under-neath, as even hid by the other, that it cannot be diſcerned by it; but yet it calls inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with a ſmall ſtill Voice and calls af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them, when they run into Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and tells them many times privily. That they ought not to have done ſuch a thing. Now, I ſay, that although this be low, this Voice within, yet it is heard ſometimes; and when obeyed, then it brings a croſs upon that deſire that would be running out into the Evil; ſo the Deſire in the Mind cannot have the fiberty, which formerly it had, to act the Evil; and ſo Sin dyes. As when the vain Mind would lead forth the Creature, either for Profit or Pleaſure, to tell a Lie, <hi>That</hi> of God within, which is pure, ſays, <hi>Lie not.</hi> Now that being obeyed, then that which would tell the Lie hath not the liberty, which former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it had; and ſo, inſtead of Lying, there is ſpeaking the Truth; and ſo
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:52316:39"/>Sin dyes. Thus the <hi>Leaven,</hi> which is pure of God, working, and being obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the contrary will be purged forth, and ſo the little <hi>Leaven will leaven the whole Lump.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the Lord hath not left himſelf without a Witneſs in Mankind, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he makes known what his Mind and Pleaſure is; and this ſhews what is Sin and Evil Deeds; and although it be not hearkened unto, nor obeyed, yet it is there: But this, where obeyed, brings into Chriſt, the <hi>Promiſed Seed;</hi> who, by his Power, hath bruiſed the Head of the Serpent; and doth bruiſe his Head, and break down his Power, and will overthrow his Kingdom of Darkneſs: This is witneſſed, Praiſes to the Lord for evermore, by thoſe who are Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to that Light of Chriſt, and his Power, within them, which checks and reproves for Sin: So the contrary Power, which formerly ruled, is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeyed and trodden down within; and ſo the Seed of the Serpent, which was Head, even the Head thereof, comes to be bruiſed by the Seed of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; this is witneſſed through the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare: For as the Enmity between the two Seeds is placed by the Lord, ſo the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:52316:39"/>Victory is obtained by joyning with <hi>That</hi> of Him, where his Power will be witneſſed, according to his Promiſe, But in vain it is for any ever to expect the Victory, who will not enter into the Warfare, ſo as to have the Serpent's Head broken; who will not joyn with the other Seed againſt it, ſo as to have Sin to dye; who will not deny them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of their Sins, but give liberty to their Luſts; for there can be no dying of Sin, until there be a dying of that which brings it forth: For, as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture declares, <hi>God made Man upright, but they have ſought out many inventions,</hi> Eccleſ. 7.29. But he was not ſo created in the many Inventions, but <hi>in the Image of God,</hi> Gen. 1.26. The Evil was of Man's finding out; for the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, <hi>Such a thing thou ſhalt not do,</hi> Gen. 2.16, 17. Now, although the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand was, <hi>Thou ſhalt not eat;</hi> Man through Temptation aſpiring, thinking to be High, fell Low, acts contrary to the Command, and ſo broke it: <hi>The Tranſgreſſion of the Law is Sin,</hi> 1 John 3.4. And as Sin came at the firſt, by break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Command of God, ſo whilſt there is a running on, to be guided by that which at the firſt brought Sin,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:52316:40"/>there can be no dying of Sin; but adding Sin to Sin, and filling up the Meaſure of Iniquity: But as there is a hearkening, and giving up in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence unto that Divine Light within, which checks and reproves for Sin; then the other part, which leads forth the Creature unto the acting of Sin, comes to be denied, and ſo Sin will dye.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But if any ſhall ſay, Is there this Light in every one?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Scriptures declare of Chriſt, I <hi>am the Light of the World,</hi> John 8.12. And <hi>John,</hi> the Fore-runner of Him, ſaith, <hi>That he was not that Light, but was ſent to bear witneſs of that Light, that was the true Light, which lighteth every Man that comes into the World,</hi> John 1.8.9. And Chriſt, who was the true Light, compares the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven unto a Man travelling into a far Country, who called his Servants, and delivered unto them his Goods; unto every Man, according unto his ſeveral ability,</hi> Mat. 25.14, 15. And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Grace of God, which bringeth Salvation, hath appeared unto all Men,</hi> Tit. 2.11. Who can this deny, but that there hath that appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto them, which if hearkened unto
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:52316:40"/>and obeyed, would have redeemed them from the Evil of their Ways, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the Obedience? So this Light, wherewithal Chriſt Jeſus hath enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned every one that comes into the World, doth ſhine in the dark. Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the Creature, Mankind, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Darkneſs does not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, it, as <hi>John.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Light ſhines in Darkneſs, and the Darkneſs comprehends it not:</hi> Yet, notwithſtanding, as <hi>John</hi> 3.19. <hi>This is the Condemnation, that Light is come into the World, and Men love Darkneſs ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than Light, becauſe their Deeds are evil:</hi> All which I witneſs, according to theſe Scriptures: That there was a Light, a Meaſure of that which was pure of God in me, which appeared unto me, which did convince of Sin and Evil Deeds; time after time, this did ſhine into my Underſtanding, although the Darkneſs was ſuch in me, that this Light could not be known by it, Yet it was there; and this Light was my Condemnation in ſecret, when contrary thereunto I acted. That which in the firſt place did convince of Sin and Evil Deeds, did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards riſe up in me, and condemn me: And this all muſt witneſs, all that will not be obedient thereunto muſt be
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:52316:41"/>ſlain by him; yea, all his Enemies that will not have him to Reign over them, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.27. Therefore in vain it is for any to expect him to be their Saviour <hi>in</hi> their Sins, for he was not given by God for that end; but to <hi>Save his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from their Sins,</hi> Mat. 1.21. But if any ſhall ſay, Is this poſſible ever for any to be ſaved from their Sins whilſt they are here? And may ſay, <hi>If any ſay, We have no Sin, we deceive our Selves,</hi> 1 John 1.8. I Anſwer, doth not the ſame Apoſtle ſay, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.9. <hi>Whoſoever is Born of God, doth not commit Sin, for his Seed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth in him, and he cannot Sin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is Born of God:</hi> Here is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Seed remaining in him, which cannot Sin, becauſe he is Born of God. Now this doth the Scriptures reconcile, which ſeem to be at odds, to know the two Seeds in Mankind; what Seed that is that doth Sin, and what Seed that is that doth not Sin, neither can Sin; for this know, and this you may likewiſe feel within, As there is one Seed that calls upon, and leads forth the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for to act Wickedneſs, ſo there is another that could never conſent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, but was burthened by Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, yet did reprove in ſecret; and if
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:52316:41"/>it had been hearkened unto, and obeyed, then it would have been exalted in Men, and ſet above the other, and ſo have ruled in the Creature; and the Creature being therewith guided, would be kept from Sin; for <hi>he that doth Righteouſneſs, is Righteous, even as Chriſt is Righteous;</hi> and the other which committeth Sin, is of the Devil, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.7, 9. <hi>And for this purpoſe was the Son of God manifeſted. that he might deſtroy the Works ef the Devil; and to take away Sin;</hi> as in the 5th verſe, which is ſeen and witneſſed, to be the end and purpoſe of God ſending his Son; but firſt he muſt be known to be Judge, to <hi>condemn Sin in the Fleſh,</hi> as the Apoſtle declares, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. <hi>For what the Law could not do, in that it was weak thorow the Fleſh, God ſending his own Son, in the likeneſs of ſinful Fleſh, and for Sin, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned Sin in the Fleſh:</hi> And this is by Chriſt's Appearance, who ſaid, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.34. <hi>Think not that I come to ſend Peace on Earth: I come not to ſend Peace, but a Sword.</hi> And he ſays, <hi>John</hi> 9.39. <hi>For Judgment am I come into the World:</hi> He comes firſt to break their Peace, who have been at quiet and aſleep in their Wickedneſs, before he ſpeak Peace un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them; and ſo every one muſt know
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:52316:42"/>him, as in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 33.22. <hi>The Lord is our Judge, the Lord is our Law-giver, the Lord is our King, and he will Save us.</hi> And whoſo doth not know him thus, knows him not ſavingly at all.</p>
               <p>Therefore all you who do not know God any otherways but by hearſay, and are only looking upon things without, your Ignorance I pity; and in love to your Souls, as I am moved of the Lord, I have written this unto you, for to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form your Underſtandings, where you are to wait to hear the Voice of God, and the ſame obeying, your Souls may live: Therefore, every one in particular, turn your Ear, the Ear of your Soul within, hearken, do not you hear ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing within you, calling upon you to ceaſe from the Evil of your ways, and to do the Good? Which being hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened unto, then you will find Judgment from the Righteous God of Life to paſs upon the Enemies of your Soul's good; and from the ſame you will find Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands go forth, to let you know what you are to do, which will be contrary to what you have formerly delighted in; ſo your deſires will be croſſed, when they are running forth into the Earth, to delight in fading Objects, or any
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:52316:42"/>manner of Wickedneſs; and ſo you will come to find a Law come forth from another, which formerly you have not known, ſo as to obey; and as Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is given thereunto, you will find that ariſe up in you, for to Rule over whatſoever would not it ſhould Reign, and then Salvation is near: Thus by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, by a living Faith, and Obedience to the Commands of God, made known by that his Light within, you ſhall come to find him, <hi>Judge, Lawgiver, King</hi> and <hi>Sarviour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore none expect to know God, otherwiſe than he is: The Children of Diſobedience muſt know him to be a juſt Judge, rendering unto every one according unto their Works, as the Scriptures declare of him; ſuch as do not ceaſe to do Evil, and learn to do Well, but Rebel againſt him, muſt be devoured with the Sword; read <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 1. &amp; <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. where the Apoſtle ſaith, that God <hi>will render unto every Man according to his Deeds: To them who by patient continuance in well doing, ſeek for Glory and Honour, and Immortality, Eternal Life: But unto them that are Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious, and do not obey the Truth, but obey Unrighteouſneſs, Indignation and Wrath:
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:52316:43"/>Tribulation and Anguiſh upon every Soul of Man that doth Evil, of the</hi> Jew <hi>firſt, and alſo of the</hi> Gentile. <hi>But Glory, Honour, and Peace, to every Man that worketh Good, to the</hi> Jew <hi>firſt, and alſo to the</hi> Gentile. <hi>For there is no reſpect of Perſons with God.</hi> Therefore what is ſaid unto the Prieſts, is ſaid to the People of all Profeſſions; Search the Scriptures, and ſee where you do find your Condition in the Scriptures; whoſo lives in Wickedneſs, being guided by the wicked One, Woes, and the Plagues of God they may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, as the Scriptures declare, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 3.11. <hi>Wo to the Wicked, it ſhall be ill with him, for the Reward of his hands ſhall be given him.</hi> Firſt, therefore thou that lives in a Profeſſion of God and Chriſt in Words, and acts not the ſame in Deed and Truth, read <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.5. but theſe things doſt to be ſeen of Men; this was their Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice to whom the <hi>Wo</hi> was due, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.27, to 37. Read, You that have got the Prophets, Chriſt's and the Apoſtles Words to talk of, and Paint your ſelves outwardly with a Form of Godlineſs, <hi>but deny the Power thereof,</hi> and Hate and Perſecute thoſe who live in the Life of what you Profeſs; the Woes, the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Hell, you may read there to be
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:52316:43"/>your Portion, unleſs you Repent: You Hypocrites, conſider betime and Repent, that you may eſcape it: And in the next place, you that would have the good word of all, this may be accounted Wiſdom ſo to Conform; but it is that Wiſdom which is from beneath, from the Serpents Seed, to which the Curſe is; therefore thou that wouldeſt have all to ſpeak well of thee, read <hi>Luke</hi> 6.26. <hi>Wo unto you, when all Men ſhall ſpeak well of you:</hi> This may ſeem ſtrange to others, as it did unto me, whoſe deſire is to have all to ſpeak well of them. Now, this is not to encourage any for to walk ſo, as to give any juſt occaſion for any to ſpeak evil of them; but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, as Chriſt doth Exhort in the next Verſes, to <hi>Love your Enemies, do good to them which Hate you, Bleſs them that Curſe you, and Pray for them which Deſpitefully uſe you:</hi> Yet this I know, and ſo all others find it, as they come to walk up in Obedience to that which is pure of God in them; it is ſo croſs and contrary unto that which guides the World, even all Men of what Profeſſion ſoever, being guided by another Seed, they cannot have their good words as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly; the Enmity between the two
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:52316:44"/>Seeds, that is the cauſe; therefore thou that haſt the good word of the wicked, queſtion thy Condition, thou haſt great cauſe, leſt thou art not under the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God, but under the Wo of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And thou whoſe deſires is to get Wealth by Fraud and Deceit, Lying and Diſſembling, and may call this a provident Care for thy Self and Family; thou <hi>Infidel,</hi> that dareſt not truſt God, but acts contrary unto that of him in thee, that tells thee in ſecret, that thou oughteſt not ſo to do; read <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Wo unto him that coveteth an evil Covetouſneſs to his Houſe, that he may ſet his Neſt on High.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And all you who live in the <hi>Luſt of the Fleſh, the Luſt of the Eye, and Pride of Life,</hi> which things are not of God, read 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.16. <hi>Luſting after ſtrong Drink, not only to be Drunk themſelves, but to make others Drunk,</hi> read <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.15. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.1. <hi>Wo to the Crown of Pride, to the Drunkards of</hi> Ephraim: So others from the Luſt within, let the Eye looſe after Beauty, fine Apparel, and the like; all theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from one Root, the Unrighteous Seed within, to which the Plagues and Woes of God are due, and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:52316:44"/>of God it muſt not Inherit, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let none deceive themſelves with vain hopes, but read 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9, 10. <hi>Know ye not that the Unrighteous ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God,</hi> &amp;c. but ſuch (if they Repent not) muſt be <hi>for the Lake,</hi> and the <hi>Wine-preſs of the Lord's Wrath without the City;</hi> with <hi>whatſoever worketh Abomination, or telleth a Lye, Rev.</hi> 21.8, 27. &amp; 14.19, 20. Therefore all People of all Profeſſions, conſider your own Condition, your Life and Practices, take the Scriptures, ſearch and ſee where you can find out your own Condition, and amongſt whom, whether amongſt the Godly or amongſt the Wicked, and that you may take and read the Portion laid down in Scripture, belonging unto your Practice.</p>
               <p>And do not meddle with others Conditions laid down in Scriptures, nor the Promiſes that were made to them (ſo as to apply them to your ſelves whilſt in your Sins) that did Fear and Serve the Lord, who when they witneſſed the ſame fulfilled in them, they were made to <hi>rejoyce with Trembling, Pſalm</hi> 2.11. which is now witneſſed by many, Praiſes to the Lord our God for evermore, who hath ariſen to our
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:52316:45"/>joy, although we be ſuch as are caſt forth and reproached, as they were, who did Fear before the Lord, and Tremble at his Word, by ſuch as did pretend to Glorifie God, as in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.5. This Scripture, we whom the World in Scorn call <hi>Quakers,</hi> of which Name I am not aſhamed, being one whoſe Fleſh hath been made for to Tremble, and Bones to Shake, <hi>at the Judgments of the Lord, and at his Word,</hi> as the Holy Men of God did, read <hi>Ezra</hi> 10.3, 9. <hi>Job</hi> 4.14. &amp; 21.6. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119.120. <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.9. <hi>Dan.</hi> 10. <hi>Hab.</hi> 3.16. Theſe and ſuch like Scriptures, we who wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs them true, and to have been ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in us, and in obedience to the ſame Power are kept, can read with Comfort, from the Teſtimony within our own ſelves, wherein we may and do rejoyce in Perſecution and Suffering for Righteouſneſs ſake, which none knows, but as they are guided by the <hi>Righteous One,</hi> wherein is our Happineſs, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we be numbred amongſt the Tranſgreſſors of Men's Laws, yet we ſuffer not as evil Doers; for who goes under the name of <hi>Quakers,</hi> and ſuffers for evil Doing, are neither owned by us, nor know our Joy; who ſuffers as
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:52316:45"/>Chriſtians, herein can Rejoyce, in as much as we are made Partakers of Chriſt's Sufferings; and can and may read 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.13, 14, 15, 16. Our Sufferings being for the ſame that the Prophets, Chriſt, and the Apoſtles, practiſed; to wit, for ſpeaking againſt Formal and Falſe Worſhips and Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and againſt Sin in Plainneſs, even in their publick Meeting-places, as they did, as in 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 13.1, 2. By the Word of the Lord the Prophet cryed againſt the <hi>Altar</hi> in <hi>Bethel, Jeroboam</hi> ſtanding by. And by the Word of the Lord, <hi>Amos</hi> propheſied in the <hi>King's Chappel</hi> in <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel;</hi> and in plainneſs ſpeaks of the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God to befall <hi>Jeroboam, Amos</hi> 7. But this was not from the Letter, the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Declaration of Scripture, that they ſpoke; but from the Movings of the Spirit of the Lord in them, as <hi>Propheſies</hi> came, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. And the Father and Mother of <hi>Jeſus</hi> found him in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, amongſt the Doctors, <hi>both hearing them, and asking them Queſtions,</hi> Luke 2.46. And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> an his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner was, went into the Synagogues, and Reaſoned with them three Sabbath Days together out of the Scriptures: And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Synagogues he went at three ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:52316:46"/>places; to wit, at <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> at <hi>Berea,</hi> and at <hi>Athens,</hi> read <hi>Acts</hi> 17. for which he was then Perſecuted. And it is the ſame Generation in Nature now, which Perſecutes for the ſame Practices; as then, <hi>He that was Born after the Fleſh, perſecuted him that was Born after the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; even ſo it is now, Gal.</hi> 4.29. And ſo all that live in Perſecution, Hating and Envying, and in Pride, Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Drunkenneſs, Swearing, Lying, or any ſuch like Wickedneſs, take the Scriptures, and look who they were that did ſuch things, and what was to be their Portion. And this uſe you may make of the Scriptures, Search them, and ſee every one where you can find your own Condition; for this I know, and ſo you ſhall find, That if you do apply the Promiſes to your ſelves, which do not belong to that Condition which you live in, that will do you no good at all in the time of trouble: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all conſider betimes, now whilſt you have time, and now that you are warned.</p>
               <p>And all People, of all Profeſſions, ceaſe from looking at your Profeſſion, and ſee whoſe Work you do, and what Fruit it is that you bring forth; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:52316:46"/>it be the Works of the Fleſh, or the Fruits of the Spirit of God, which are different, as the Scripture declares, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.19, 20, 21, 22, 23. <hi>Now the works of the Fleſh are manifeſt, which are theſe; Adultery, Fornication, Uncleanneſs, Laſcivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs Idolatry, Witcheraft, Hatred, Vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, Emulations, Wrath, Strife, Sedition, Hereſies, Envyings, Murders, Drunkenneſs, Revellings, and ſuch like; of the which I tell you before, as I have told you in time paſt, that they which do ſuch things ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God. But the Fruit of the Spirit is Love, Joy, Peace, Long-ſuffering, Gentleneſs, Goodneſs, Faith, Meekneſs, Temperance; againſt ſuch there is no Law. And be not deceived, God will not be mocked; for ſuch as you ſow, ſuch ſhall you reap: If ye ſow to the Fleſh, then ye ſhall reap Corruption; but he that ſoweth to the Spirit, ſhall of the Spirit reap Life Everlaſting;</hi> which is witneſſed, as in Scripture declared, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.7, 8. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with Bowels of Love running forth towards your Souls, I exhort you all to conſider, whoſe Will it is that you are doing, and what it leads into; <hi>For the Will of God is your Sanctification,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 4.3. Therefore take heed, I charge you all in the Preſence of the Lord, and by
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:52316:47"/>his Spirit, how you go on in any Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, and lay the blame upon God, and ſay, When the Lord will, it ſhall be otherwiſe: It is not his Will that any ſhould go on in their Wickedneſs, but <hi>that all ſhould turn from their Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, and Live;</hi> but your <hi>Deſtruction,</hi> I do declare unto you all, to be from and of your ſelves, running on your own Wills, working the Works, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting to live after the Fleſh, which brings <hi>Death,</hi> as the Scripture declares, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13. <hi>For if ye live after the Fleſh, ye ſhall dye; but if ye through the Spirit do mortifie the Deeds of the Fleſh, ye ſhall live.</hi> And the Lord is not wanting on his part, for to bring to Life; but by the Spirit of his dear Son he calls upon every one, for to return from the Evil of their Ways; and as Obedience there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto is given, the Deeds of the Fleſh come to be mortified, and ſo they come to witneſs Life. But if any ſay, Hath every one the Spirit of Chriſt? I anſwer, with the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9. <hi>If any Man have not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his;</hi> that is, ſuch as do not live up to the Spirit of Chriſt, ſo as to enjoy its Indwelling: <hi>For a Manifeſtation of the Spirit is given to every Man to profit with:</hi>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:52316:47"/>And ſo every one, as they ſtoop down in Obedience to <hi>that</hi> of God in them, which is pure, which riſes up within them, and ſhews them Evil Deeds, and calls upon them to depart there-from; they owning this to be of God; from thence this Fear comes to be placed in the Heart, that they dare not act contrary thereto, but the ſame they obey; and ſo him ſerve and worſhip, who is a Spirit, and is worſhipped in Spirit and Truth: Which, that you may all do, is my Deſire and Prayer to the Lord for you all; by whom I have been moved to write this forth; unto whom I have cleared my Conſcience, and unburdened my Spirit, in the informing your Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings in the way of his Worſhip; who is God over all, and Bleſſed and Praiſed for evermore: <hi>Hallelujah</hi> to the Higheſt.</p>

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:52316:48"/>him; though <hi>he be not far from every one of us,</hi> as in <hi>Acts</hi> 17.27. Which being known and obeyed, will bring into the true Fear of him; which muſt be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he can be ſerved or worſhipped, who is a Spirit, and is worſhipped in Spirit and Truth; which is witneſſed, as in Scripture declared, <hi>John</hi> 4.24</p>
               <p>And although it be ſo now with me, and ſuch like, as it was with thoſe, <hi>which did Tremble at the Word of the Lord,</hi> Iſa. 66.5. That this Generation doth caſt Reproach upon, and ſay, That we deny the Ordinances of Jeſus Chriſt; and for a pretence ſay, <hi>Let the Lord be glorified,</hi> as they did: But the Lord hath already ariſen to our Joy, who have been made to Tremble at his Word, and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands obey: And your Shame will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, when the Lord lays open your Nakedneſs to all the World, as he hath done to me, which haſteth greatly: Praiſes Eternal be unto Him alone, who hath let me ſee, by the Light where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Chriſt Jeſus hath enlightned me, <hi>who is the true Light which enlightneth eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man that cometh into the World,</hi> John 1.9. That divers of your Obſervations, in your pretended Worſhip of God, are not the real Ordinances of Jeſus Chriſt,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:52316:49"/>but the Inventions of Man; for which you have no Command from Chriſt, nor Example in Scripture, as they are uſed by you: And naming thee, and thy practice, as is hereafter written, it came to me for to ſend thee in Writing what was written of thee, before it went forth unto any other: With a Warning therein written unto thee, and the reſt of thy Brethren, <hi>Prieſts,</hi> who live in theſe Practices hereafter mentioned, who take Tithes, as the <hi>Prieſts</hi> did, who were of <hi>Levi;</hi> but the <hi>Stranger,</hi> the <hi>Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,</hi> and the <hi>Widdow,</hi> have no liberty for to eat thereof with you, and to be ſatisfied therewith, as it was required, <hi>Deut.</hi> 14.29. And your Store-houſe, that you, inſtead of keeping for them, is for your own particular Proſit, and not to receive them into, for to diſtribute forth as the Lord required: And ſo as you own <hi>Tithes,</hi> take the Name of <hi>Prieſts,</hi> who were of <hi>Levi,</hi> and do as they did; and never make mention of the Name of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who was of another Tribe; to wit, of <hi>Judah;</hi> of which Tribe <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> ſpake nothing of <hi>Prieſthood,</hi> Heb. 7. 13, 14. Neither did <hi>Chriſt</hi> ever, that we read of in Scripture, ſpeak any thing concerning this being continued, for to
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:52316:49"/>be his Miniſters Wages: But if any ſay, When were they taken away? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>That the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood being changed, there is made of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity a change of the Law,</hi> Heb. 7.12. And none will ſay, but that Law which made the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> gave the <hi>Tithes,</hi> and ſo muſt end together by right: For Chriſt's Miniſters were not for to ſtand, and for to condition with People for any ſuch Wages, but <hi>as they had freely received, ſo freely give,</hi> Mat. 10.8. <hi>And into what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Houſe or City they did enter, if they were received, there to remain, Eating and Drinking ſuch things as they had given them;</hi> and this was the Hire he appoints his, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.7. But thou, and ſuch like, will either ſee or hear from Man what you may have, before you will ſit down with a People; and ſo plainly ſhew, that you dare not truſt; but live by Senſe, and not by Faith in the Son of God. And as you are ordained and ordered by Man to your Places, and your Wages of Man's ſetting down, and the Will of Man only to be ſeen in all theſe things, ſo never profeſs your ſelves to be more than Miniſters made by Worldly Men, and for Worldly Ends; and then poor Ignorant People may know you as you
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:52316:50"/>are, who have long been deceived by you, looking upon you to be Miniſters of Chriſt; or elſe prove that it is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: But it was not ſo with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>He was not of Man,</hi> Gal. 1.1. <hi>neither by Man, but by Jeſus Chriſt, and God the Father, who raiſed him from the Dead;</hi> and ſuch an one I own; and all others, who walk contrary, I teſtifie againſt, as Deceivers of the People.</p>
               <p>And now, for to write unto thee at preſent in ſhort thus, Concerning thoſe things which you uſe, and call ſome of them <hi>Ordinances of Chriſt,</hi> which I ſay he did not Ordian: And prove that he did, if thou canſt, by plain Scripture, and let me hear it in Writing; and do not Back-bite, that is a work of Dark-neſs, and condemned with the Light that comes from Chriſt jeſus. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do to me as thou wouldſt be dealt withal. And what is ſaid of thee, and thy Brethren, do not call it Railing; for it is no harſher than Chriſt's telling the Jews, That <hi>they were of their Father the Devil,</hi> although they pretended to be of <hi>Abraham;</hi> yet the Fruits which proceeded from their Luſts, made them manifeſt, as yours alſo do, to be as
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:52316:50"/>he ſaid, <hi>John</hi> 8.44. And as to your Practice, this I ſay, That when Chriſt Jeſus was upon Earth, whom in Words ſome of you pretend to be Followers of (when he told his Diſciples what they muſt do to come after him) he did not tell them, That they muſt Sing <hi>David</hi>'s Words, either themſelves or others, not being Witneſſes of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions: Or Sprinkle little Children, or Infants, with Water: Or take a Text, or Place of Scripture, another's Condition, and add to it their own Inventions: But theſe things ſaid he unto them, <hi>Whoſoever will come after me, muſt deny himſelf, and take up his Croſs daily, and follow me,</hi> Luke 9.23.</p>

                  <hi>A Letter,</hi> written to Friends in the Eaſt, and North Ridings of <hi>Yorkſhire;</hi> to be read at their ſettled Meetings.</head>
               <p>ALL <hi>Friends,</hi> In the Meaſure that you have received of the Spirit of God, dwell and wait for increaſe from him;
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:52316:51"/>and do not fear Want, not do you di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt the Love of God; but there wait upon him in the Obedience to his Will made manifeſt, being content with what is made known by him: <hi>That</hi> Mind in you that would know more than he gives you to know, is proud, and is not willing to do what is made known. Therefore take heed of that which would be high, that is not of God: It's the Lowly that the Lord loves, and he will give more Grace to the Humble; but he reſiſts the Proud, and the Rich and Full muſt be ſent empty away, So all of you I exhort, to dwell low, at the Feet of Jeſus; wait for to hear his Word, every one, at the leaſt Appearance of his Light and Grace, which is pure in you; bend down in Obedience, and herein only do you Worſhip God, who is a Spirit, and is Worſhipped in the Spirit and in Truth: This is not only in Form, here is no act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by meer imitation of others, who keep here, to be guided by that which is pure in themſelves; this leads into the Power, and into the endleſs Life, which changes not, nor will wither, but endure for ever; where is Peace endleſs and unutterable. Therefore all to
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:52316:51"/>come forth of that which Fades, into that which will Endure; and every one of you, as you come into the ſincere Obedience of that which is pure, the meaſure of the Grace of God within your Selves, you will come to witneſs that Comfort flow in, which is not from below, but is from above, and over all theſe things that are Viſible and Periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: And this which Unites you unto God, the ſame will Unite you one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another, and the Peace of God you will come to witneſs, which paſſeth Underſtanding, whereby the Heart and Mind is kept in the Knowledge and Fear of God; and the Bleſſing of God you thereupon will partake of, even of the <hi>Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt,</hi> as the Apoſtle prayed that they might have, to whom he writ: And I pray God that you may have the ſame continually, whereby you may be known to be of God and Chriſt, and to be guided by his Spirit, the Fruit whereof is Love, Joy, Peace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore, my Friends and Brethren every where, I exhort you to conſider from whence comes Strife, Envying and Diviſions; proceed they not from hence, from the Luſts that war in the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:52316:52"/>of ſuch, who are looking at others with an evil Eye, and watching over others for Hurt, and not Good? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the Preſence of the Living God, I charge you by his Spirit, that you ſuffer not this amongſt you; even no Strife, nor Envying one another, as you will anſwer it before the Terrible and Dreadful God, before whom you muſt all give an Account for all the Actions done in the Body; therefore any of you that hath any thing againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, do not ſpeak of it behind his Back, for that's a work of Darkneſs; but in love ſpeak to them of it; and if they will not hear, then acquaint thoſe who are appointed in the Church, for to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine Differences, and end Strife, that they may be proceeded againſt, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the good Order given forth in the Churches, from the Spirit of Truth; and ſo Strife will be ended, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies ceaſe, ſo that thoſe who are found in the fault, if they fall not under the juſt Reproof, then they may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed.</p>
               <p>But Friends, It is ſadneſs of Heart to me, to think of it, that any that hath made but ſo much as a Profeſſion of Chriſt, much more that thoſe that have
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:52316:52"/>taſted of the Love of God in meaſure, ſhould ſo much forget themſelves, and what they do Profeſs, as that there ſhould be cauſe for to Reject any ſuch, and deny them the Society of the Saints: Therefore as my Heart's deſire is, ſo my Prayers unto the Lord for you all are, That he would open the Eyes of ſuch who have been in fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ways, or that live in Strife, Envy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Back-biting one another, that they may turn from their wicked Ways and live; for their <hi>Deſtruction,</hi> if they be Deſtroyed, <hi>is of themſelves;</hi> for the Lord not only by his Light in them ſhews the Evil, but alſo by his Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers hath many times, and now at this time by his Servant, whom he is pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for to make uſe of, doth Charge and Require all ſuch among you, once more for to ceaſe from all Strife and Envying, Surmiſing, Whiſpering, and ſpeaking Evil one of another behind your Backs, and that you all deal Plainly, Simply and Honeſtly one with another, in what you ſee or hear that is amiſs; and none to be Raſh or Haſty in Reproving, but let all things that are done amongſt you, be done in Meekneſs and Love, and then you will be a People, amongſt whom
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:52316:53"/>the Lord will delight to dwell, who is a God of Love; and the Fruit of the Spirit will be ſeen amongſt you, which is <hi>Love;</hi> and then I ſhall not have cauſe for to write unto you from Sorrow, but from the Inflowings of Love, which is my Delight; for Sorrow it is unto me, God is my Witneſs, for to Write unto any among you of a Rod, but I cannot forbear; for the <hi>Rod is</hi> prepared <hi>for the Backs of Fools,</hi> who wander from <hi>That</hi> of God within, which is pure, which ought to Guide; and it is to <hi>Such</hi> that I am forced to hold forth the Rod with Sorrow and Weeping, that there ſhould be any ſuch Fools ſheltering themſelves amongſt the Flock of Chriſt. But I thank my God, that there is ſuch amongſt you, who are my Joy and Rejoycing; yea, my glorying to my Brethren; yea, and I truſt in the Lord that they ſhall be ſo, and none can take it from me.</p>
               <p>Therefore all who have received the Love of God, dwell low in the Love received, that you may find daily the Inflowings of the Love of God, that the daily growth you may witneſs, even that which Nouriſhes the Babe, that it daily feeds upon; the <hi>Milk of the Word</hi> you may ſuck from the Breaſts of
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:52316:53"/>Conſolation, which all they receive, who are obedient to that which is Pure, even the Meaſure of the Grace of God in themſelves. And all you whoſe Minds are run forth into the Vanities; <hi>Ob turn ye, turn ye, Why will you Dye?</hi> This is the Lords call by his Spirit in his Servant, and conſider wherein have you run forth; return within, hearken, call to mind what is paſt, and what did call when you were running forth into the Evil, and you would not hear, but put off: And now whilſt that you have time, prize it, and return unto the Lord, by a ſpeedy Reformation of Life, all you ſtiff necked ones who think much to ſtoop down to the Croſs, to walk in that way wherein your Wills are croſſed, and Self is denyed; never expect to have Sin to dye, until you deny your Selves and your own Wills, for it's the daily Croſs that Chriſt's Diſciples muſt take up, and follow him in: Therefore, thou Fool and Unwiſe, do not deceive thy ſelf, in forming up a nearer or eaſier Way than this; his <hi>Yoke is eaſie,</hi> his <hi>Burden is light;</hi> when it comes to be taken up, it is not Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, but Joyous: Oh come into the Obedience, and than thou ſhalt witneſs
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:52316:54"/>what I ſay to be Truth; do not ſay, How long ſhall I do ſuch things? That's it which makes the Burthen great, for to conſult with the Carnal Part (which would limit the Lord, and would ſet him down a way that you would ſerve him in) that is for Deſtruction, that muſt never enter; it's that which is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and obedient, and doth not ſay, wherein, or how long; but which is willing to wait, and doth not make haſte, but believes in the Lord; it is that part, and thoſe that are therewith guided, that <hi>Eat the good of the Land,</hi> and come to partake of Peace and Reſt to their Souls; therefore none to look our, or to fear, what the Lord will call you to, for therein the Adverſary will many times preſent ſuch Hardſhips unto you, for to cauſe you to Deſpair, and to Diſtruſt of his Power in carrying you through; yea, many times may and will preſent harder things to you, than ever you come to be exerciſed in; however, when you come into the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, it is not ſo hard as the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary did preſent: Therefore you that have found him to be a Lyar, do not truſt him any more, but truſt in him that delivers you, that he will deliver
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:52316:54"/>you. And ſo you will come to find it, for he never failed any that truſted in him; therefore none to look before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, but all in the Light wait, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from the Lord, what his Mind is. And do not deſire for to know all what you ſhall do hereafter, let thoſe thoughts that are ſo forward be judged down with the Light, which ſhews the. Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thereof, and ſo you will be kept from running into Confuſion, for it is ſuffering the deſire to run forth before the Light, that leads into trouble of Mind: Therefore all in the Silence and Stilneſs of Spirit, wait to hear that which is pure in you ſpeak, which calls for Purity, and teſtifies againſt all Impurity, and Deeds of Darkneſs; that's the Light that ſhines in Darkneſs, and the Voice to which you ought to give Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and this is contrary to your own Wills and Deſires, that requires ſuch things of you, and calls upon you for to do ſuch things as is contrary to what formerly you have delighted in; when this calls, then the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nature will deſire a Sign, as the <hi>Jews</hi> did. <hi>Whether he be of God,</hi> yea, or nay; and (when the Lord requires Obedience) will be fit to ſay, Stay, be not haſty,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:52316:55"/>ſtay for Movings, know certainly. Now when nothing of ſelf is to be ſeen, then the Adverſary would hinder; but when a Motion comes in, that ſeems difficult, or not clear, then is the time that you are to wait for clearneſs; but when the Command is clear, and that which is required tends to Self-denial, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of ſelf lyes at the bottom after Examination, then be Faithful and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient.</p>
               <p>And this I am moved for to write unto you that are not acquainted with the Wiles of the Adverſary, but are Ignorant of his Devices; that when a thing is preſented unto you for to do, then for to return within, to ſee if there were not a deſire for to do ſuch a thing, and an end in the doing of it; that if ſuch a thing be done, then you will be looked or when in Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, you will find Peace, or the like: Now upon the Examination, when ſuch ends are ſeen, then the not haſty, but wait; but then the Adverſary will be fit to threaten with diſobedience; but do not heed him, for ſuch waiting, as to know the Mind of God, that you may not be deceived, will not be laid upon you by the Lord as diſobedience; but
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:52316:55"/>herein will you find the difficulties taken away, and the Miſts and Darkneſs that was in your Minds will be expelled; here waiting, not with reſolution to put off, but that you may not be deceived; then the Lord will clear up unto you his Mind and Pleaſure, and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

               <p>A Paper being given into my Hand, ſaid to be a Copy of ſome words thou didſt write of <hi>John Brown,</hi> who gave thee a Book to read over, wherein were laid down ſome of the Ranters Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; wherein thou writeſt, That thou find'ſt, in the Reading of it, that the ſaid <hi>John Brown</hi> judgeth thee to be a <hi>Ranter,</hi> and one that is defiled with the Pollutions of the World; and that thou ſhalt be accounted amongſt the number of Reprobates.</p>
               <p>Now, Man, conſider within thy ſelf, what thou writeſt, did <hi>John Brown,</hi> thus judge thee to be? Nay, look nearer, doth not <hi>That</hi> in thy Conſcience judge
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:52316:57"/>thee, and tell thee, that thou art run forth from thy Guide, which is pure, which would have kept thee in the Fear of God; and which did ſo, whilſt thou were't guided by it; and that did, whilſt thou kept'ſt to it, ſeparate thee from the Pollutions and Filthineſs that the World lives in; but now, with the Dog, thou art returned to thy Vomit; and with the Sow, that was in meaſure waſhed, unto her wallowing in the Mire again. And the Reprobate Mind ruling in thee, thou muſt expect thy Portion with thy Companions: That in thy Conſcience will witneſs the Truth of this. Although thou proceed and ſay, <hi>That thou art freed from his Doom, and all his Compliants, by the Merits and Mercies of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> I anſwer, When Chriſt Jeſus ſhall come to ſit Judge in thee, thou ſhalt then be made to confeſs, that theſe thy words are vain Boaſting; and that his Merits and Mercies thou art ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of, nor never canſt know, until thou return to be guided by that which checks thee in ſecret for the Evil of thy Doings; and whatſoever thou doſt, not therewith being guided, it is Self-Righteouſneſs, and of the Devil; and ſo art guided by the Fancies of thy own
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:52316:57"/>vain Mind: For that Mind is vain, that leads the Creature into Vanities. Now conſider, if it be not ſo with thee, that ſuch things as thou didſt ſee a Vanity in, thou art returned back to do thoſe things again. Therefore let Shame ſtop thy Mouth, for accuſing others of what thou art guilty of thy ſelf.</p>
               <p>And for the <hi>Raſh Judgment,</hi> thou ſpeakeſt <hi>of caſting upon our fellow Creatures, which are the Workmanſhip of God's Hands, as well as we; who lives in the height of Conceits; above all the People in the World:</hi> Hence I do declare thee (from whence this is) to be a falſe Accuſer; for the Judgment is not paſt upon the Creature, as it is the Workmanſhip of God's Hands, but chiefly upon the wicked One in the Creature, and only upon the Creature as ſubject to him, which is the Enemy of God. And ſaying, <hi>We live in Conceits:</hi> That is thy own Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as will be made manifeſt; and thou may'ſt as well condemn them, who ſaid, <hi>That they knew that they were of God, and that the whole World lay in Wickedneſs.</hi> And no other Light do we ſpeak of, to be guided by, but that Light where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Chriſt Jeſus hath enlightned every one that cometh into the World; which
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:52316:58"/>Light thou ſay'ſt, is the <hi>Conceits of our own Minds:</hi> And here I charge thee, in the Preſence of the Living God, to be an Evil Speaker of that Light which comes from his dear Son, ſaying, <hi>It is the Conceits of our own Minds:</hi> So I charge thee to make it appear, that thou didſt hear any of us ever ſpeak of any Light, to be guided by, but the Light of Jeſus Chriſt in the Conſcience; and if thou canſt not, then let Fear take hold upon thee, and Shame ſmite thee in thy Face; to ſay, <hi>That Light is the Conceit of our own Minds,</hi> that carries us on in the Work. But the <hi>Grace of God, and his Mercies,</hi> thou ſayeſt, <hi>are above all our raſh Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Conceit.</hi> I anſwer, The Grace of God, and his Mercies, thou haſt turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into Laſciviouſneſs, and out of a vain light Mind thou ſpeakeſt of Bleſſing and Praiſing his moſt Holy Name; and ſays, in thy Conceits, <hi>That he will ſit as Judge him ſelf, to confound the Conceits, and raſh Judgments, and Imaginations of high Aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Spirits of boaſting Men; of which Spirit and Mind</hi> Quakers <hi>are of,</hi> thou ſayeſt; and ſo in Scorn writeſt <hi>Adieu Quakers.</hi> How couldſt thou get this written, and not be condemed in thy Conſcience, that it was in Scorn? Nay, conſider,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:52316:58"/>let the Search paſs through, and a Wir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhall ſpeak in thee for me, That theſe words were in Scorn written. And although thou ſayeſt, <hi>God himſelf will ſit Judge, to confound the Conceits, and raſh Judgments, and Imaginations of high Aſpiring Spirits of boaſting Men; of which Spirit and Mind</hi> Quakers <hi>are of.</hi> here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what thou haſt ſaid, <hi>That God ſhould ſit;</hi> but thou art Exalted, as if got into his Seat to judge, not with his Spirit; but with Scornful Mind, ſpeaks of that Condition which his People Witneſſed, and he Commanded: And here thou ſhews to all that have any Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or Eyes to ſee, That thou haſt no Bridle to thy Tongue; and ſo thy Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is in vain. Then thou asks, out of a vain Mind, <hi>What Rule we have in Scripture for our high Conceits of our ſelves?</hi> Here <hi>Iſhmael</hi> makes himſelf manifeſt in thee. And further ſays, <hi>If we imitate our formed Weekly Meetings from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and Diſciples, we Err; for they lived in the Truth, and we live in the Conceits of Mind.</hi> I anſwer, meer Imitation, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Spirit, we deny: But this is known, that who are guided by the ſame Spirit that the Apoſtles were, it will bring them to follow their good
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:52316:59"/>Example: And did they not meet Week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? Deny it if thou canſt. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as thou ſayedſt, <hi>They lived in the Truth, and we in the Conceits of Mind.</hi> Here again I charge thee, that ſo ſpeaks, to be a falſe Accuſer. And thou ſayeſt, <hi>God is Judge of the whole World Himſelf:</hi> Whereas he Judgeth by his Son and Saints: For do not the Scriptures ſay, <hi>That the Father Judgeth no Man, but hath committed all Judgment to the Son?</hi> John 5.22. and in the 27th verſe, <hi>And hath given him authority to execute Judgment alſo, becauſe he is the Son of Man:</hi> And in the Epiſtle of <hi>Jude,</hi> 14, and 15 verſes, <hi>Behold, the Lord cometh with Ten Thouſands of his Saints, to execute Judgment upon all,</hi> &amp;c. But thou ſheweſt thy ſelf to be an Oppoſer of Chriſt; and it is true, and nor raſh Judgment, to ſay ſo of thee, who art found in the Enmity: And it is not for us to work, before the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Creator of Heaven and Earth doth work in us; but his Acting in the Creature is a Myſtery to thy carnal Mind, and thou art not Judged before the time; and this Judgment, wherewith the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed One in thee, and others, is judged, ſhall not Condemn us; for That of God in your Conſciences, ſhall witneſs it to
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:52316:59"/>be true, and Condemn all for you who live in the Filth of the Fleſh, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the World, Acting contrary to what you are Convinced of, for Self-Ends and Fear of Man. And further, thou proceed'ſt, and ſay, <hi>The turning of the Mind what way we will, that we call the Word of the Lord:</hi> Thou falſe Accuſer and evil Speaker, of the things thou doſt not underſtand, how long wilt thou ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the envious One to rule in thee, and to ſpeak Evil of that thou underſtandeſt nor? If thou knoweſt the <hi>Word of the Lord, which is as a Fire ſhut up in the Bones,</hi> Jer. 20.9. and how it comes, thou wilt know, that it is not in our power, to turn it what way we will. Therefore make out what thou ſayeſt; otherwiſe, thy Mouth being ſtopped, own thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation upon thy falſe Accuſation. Thou ſayeſt, <hi>The Word came by Revelation;</hi> but how it comes, thou knoweſt not: neither canſt thou ſay, in the Preſence of the Lord, and not Lie, That the Lord ever ſpoke one Word unto thee, for to declare abroad; and yet wilt be Judging of others. Then thou further proceeds, for to bid <hi>John Brown, Let high Aſpiring Thoughts and Conceits depart; and let Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly Love be placed in his Heart, and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:52316:60"/>and Pity poſſeſs his Soul.</hi> This I know, that Tenderneſs and Pity doth poſſeſs his Soul, and in his Heart he doth love them that are Brethren in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> But to the Deceit that rules in thee, and others, which would have fair and pleaſant Words, thoſe who are guided by the Spirit of Chriſt, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſpeak <hi>Peace,</hi> but pronounce <hi>Woes,</hi> as they are moved by the Lord; and <hi>Wo</hi> unto that in thee, which would have all Men to ſpeak well of thee, that is thy Enemy, and the Enemy of God; and whilſt that rules in thee, thou art under the Wrath; and the Woes belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Wicked, thou muſt expect, whilſt therewith guided. And in bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, <hi>Let high Aſpiring Thoughts and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits depart;</hi> thou ſpeakeſt of Conceits and Aſpiring Thoughts, and thou bids, <hi>Let Tenderneſs and Pity poſſeſs his Soul.</hi> Here thou art to be tryed, whether thou live not in Conceits thy ſelf; yea, or nay So, What is the Soul? Now this thou may'ſt anſwer, as Scripture declares, <hi>That God breathed into Man's Noſtrils the Breath of Life, and Man became a Living Soul.</hi> But further, I demand of thee, What this is in the Creature? Now if thou canſt not give an account of this,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:52316:60"/>What this is in the Creature; Then thou muſt acknowledge, that thou haſt been Exhorting another, To let <hi>Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Pity poſſeſs</hi> thou know'ſt not what, more than a Word; but the Soul is more that a Word: And when thou comeſt to know it, then thou ſhalt ſee thy high Aſpiring Thoughts and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits that thou haſt lived in, and to know and acknowledge, that this is written in love and Pity unto thee, from</p>

               <p>FRom the time of my being commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Priſoner by <hi>Robert Barwicke,</hi> as is expreſſed in the fore-part of this Book, I continued as Priſoner, (but ſeveral times, at my own and Friends deſire, had liberty to viſit Friends in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try) and at the Aſſizes, held in the 7th Month of the Year 1655. when I had been between thirty and forty Weeks a Priſoner, I was called, and was tryed, and cleared accordingly, as is hereafter mentioned.</p>
               <p>Being called before <hi>William Steel,</hi> Judge, it was ſaid, That I ſtood there
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:52316:61"/>Indicted ſince the laſt Aſſizes; the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment being read, it was demanded of me, What I ſaid to it, Was I guilty or not guilty? To which was anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this purpoſe, That what I ſaid, I ſhould not deny, (there being put into the Indictment, that I wilfully and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſly uttered forth ſuch words as they read) the truth was, that I ſpoke ſuch words; but that ſuch words were ſpoken from my own Will, or Malice, that I denied; and ſaid, That was their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, which put the words in. Then the Judge asked, What I ſaid, as to the Subſtance of the thing? My anſwer was, What I ſpoke, I ſhould not deny. Then he asked me, If I would be tried by God and the Country? My anſwer was, The Lord he is my Tryer, and what he will ſuffer the Country to do, I am ſatisfied. Thus I, with other three Friends, who had been called at the Aſſizes before, and could not ſay, neither Guilty, nor Not Guilty, (true words and falſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mixt together in our Indictments) were to come to our Tryal before the Country; and the next day, being called and ſet in the midſt, amongſt thoſe there Arraigned for Fellony and Murder: A Jury being choſen, and they being
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:52316:61"/>about to ſwear them; I ſpoke to the Judge, to put him in mind of what paſſed between us the Day before, how that he asked, If I would be tried by God and the Country? And my anſwer thereunto being, That the Lord he is my Tryer, and what he ſuffered the Country to do, I am ſatisfied; but that their Swearing is not allowed, but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by Chriſt; and in teſtifying againſt it, I clear my Conſcience: Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this, they called for Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence againſt me; but not any appearing, the Jury gave in their <hi>Verdict</hi> (as it is called) that I was Not Guilty. Then I appealed to that of God in all their Conſciences to judge, how I had been dealt withal; who had been between thirty and forty weeks a Priſoner, and none for to lay any thing to my charge: But they would make no anſwer to that, but haſted to take me away. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſome ſaid, I might recover Damage for my Impriſonment. But I anſwered them, I had not ſo learned of Chriſt, for to render Evil for Evil.</p>

               <p>NOW, Whereas mention is made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of my being caſt into Priſon at <hi>Alisbury;</hi> it was for my going into a Steeple-Houſe at <hi>Newport-pagnel,</hi> where ſtanding quietly until the Prieſt had done his Preaching, who had been tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in a bemoaning manner, that <hi>The Devil caſt Fiery-Darts, and Hand-Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does</hi> (as it were) <hi>into the Soul:</hi> It being made known unto me, as I ſtood by, that he knew not what the Soul was, which he ſaid the Devil did ſuch things to; ſo words were ſpoken unto him, to this purpoſe; <hi>Man, thou haſt been ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much as concerning the Soul, it were

               <p>IN the Year following I was ordered in the Movings of the Lord's Spirit, for to viſit Friends; the former part thereof I paſſed through the <hi>Eaſtern Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> up to <hi>London,</hi> and returned thorow the middle Counties: Then before the middle of that Summer, I paſſed into <hi>Scotland</hi> about that time when King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second came into <hi>England</hi> again; and after my paſſing through ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral parts of <hi>Scotland,</hi> amongſt moſt of them few Friends that were then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the Truth, them to ſtrengthen for to ſtand in the day of Tryal, then approaching; for then many did expect we ſhould ſoon have been brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, either to have denyed our God, or under great Sufferings; and then was a time of much Wickedneſs and Lewdneſs, much of God's good Creatures conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in Drinking and Fires making, Ringing and Rejoycing, becauſe of the Coming of the King: Notwithſtanding all that Lewdneſs, which was then aloſt, by the Lord's Power, I and a Friend with me, named <hi>Samuel Watſon,</hi> paſſed and had little Interruption, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned forth of <hi>Scotland</hi> into <hi>Cumberland,</hi> and viſited ſeveral Friends in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:52316:66"/>and ſo returned into <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> before the middle of Summer: About the time, and after King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second returned into <hi>England</hi> again: But there were ſome who could not be content therewith; amongſt others, ſome of them called <hi>Fifth Monarchy Men,</hi> who, as I underſtand, expect <hi>Chriſt to come for to Reign Outwardly in Perſon upon Earth;</hi> and ſome few of them, being ſtirred up in a forward Zeal, without a true Knowledge of what Spirit they were of, did riſe in <hi>London,</hi> whereby a great Diſturbance was occaſioned; then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently Proclamation was ſent forth, and we who were called <hi>Quakers,</hi> were rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned with <hi>Ranters,</hi> and them who made the Diſturbance, and ſo were numbred amongſt the Tranſgreſſors, though Innocent: Then by the Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation we were not to enjoy our Meetings for to wait upn God, under any Pretence of Worſhipping (or to that purpoſe were words in it) as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly; but if we did, which many durſt not neglect, then we were to be Apprehended, and had before Juſtices of the Peace, and there we were to have the Oaths of Supremacy and Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance proſered, which if we refuſed,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:52316:67"/>then by the Proclamation we were either to find Sureties for good Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, or go to Goal until the next Aſſizes: To this purpoſe was the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>france of the Proclamation, as I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: By this means we were hunted for, and ſought out at our Meetings by wicked Men, who were glad of ſuch an opportunity; and this gladded the Hearts of the Wicked, and made the Hearts of the Righteous ſad for a time; but the Lord comforted, and made His meet together with boldneſs (although ſome few did faint) and with boldneſs we were carried before the Magiſtrates, and could not Obey their Commands, nor own that we were of Evil Behaviour, by entering into Bonds for the Good Behaviour, and to take the Oaths, and ſo break the Commands of Chriſt Jeſus, who ſaith, <hi>Swear not at all,</hi> Mat. 5. And ſo we were ſent to Priſon to <hi>York</hi>-Caſtle: There were committed upon that account, between four and five Hundred, and ſome of us, I and others, were continued a Quarter of a Year's time or more; but the Lord cleared or more; but the Lord cleared our Innocency, and they ſet us at Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in the Lord's time, therefore it is good to truſt in Him.</p>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:52316:67"/>
               <p>Preſently after this, the King conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to that Act of Parliament, which they made againſt us; That was to this purpoſe, <hi>That if we,</hi> to wit, the People called <hi>Quakers, did meet together, upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Worſhipping of God, to or above the number of Five, we were to be apprehended, and be proceeded againſt for the ſame, by Fines and Baniſhment.</hi> But this diſmayed not many, although many (for meeting together to wait upon the Lord, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, in obedience him) were Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, and Fined; and ſome, as I have heard, in <hi>London,</hi> where their Cruetly was grear, were haled forth of their Meetings, and cut by rude and wicked Perſons; and one died of Wounds that he received; others, by Magiſtrates, were Sentenced to Baniſhment; but the Lord diſappointed them. But as for me, I was not caſt into Priſon upon that Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, but was called before the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates: But herein was and is may Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, that I did not ſee that I neglected my Duty in meeting amongſt the Lord's People, for fear of Man. And after a time, the Rulers they forbore purſuing that Act, and we had our Meetings much quieter than could have been expected; and Truth did
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:52316:68"/>ſpead; and Deſires in People, after the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Way of God, encreaſed; and the Lord God gladded the Hearts of his People, by letting them ſee now, by this Power, the Wicked were chained. And then the Biſhops, they ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by their Power, to terrifie the Lord's Hoſt, the Followers of the Lamb; but prevailed not, (Praiſed be the Lord) but the Lord's Mercies were multiplied upon his People, both Inward and Outward.</p>
               <p>After this, it pleaſed the Lord (for the Trial of this People, and that his Power might be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt) to ſuffer the Powers of the Earth in the following Year, to make another Act againſt our Meetings, more ſtrict and cruel than the former; the Subſtance whereof was to this purpoſe, (to wit) That if we, namely, thoſe People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> ſhould, after the firſt Day of <hi>July,</hi> 1664. meet together above the number of Five, under a pretence of Worſhipping God; we ſhould for the firſt Offence, according to the pleaſure of them in Commiſſion for Juſtices of the Peace, pay a Sum of Money, under Five Pounds, or ſuffer a time of Impriſonment, not exceeding Three Months; for the Second Offence the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty was doubled; and for the Third Offence, they were either to pay One Hundred Pounds, or to be Baniſhed into ſome of the King's Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Plantations; and if they within Seven Years time ſhould return without Liberty, then to be proceeded againſt as Felons: And the like Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natly they were to undergo, in whoſe Houſes or Grounds ſuch Meetings were kept. But Praiſed be the Lord, all this prevailed not, nor terrified the Lord's People; neither durſt they neglect their Duty: For even the Firſt Day of the Week, after this Act took place, at my outward Being,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:52316:68"/>where there might be above a Hundred Friends of Truth, and others, there was no Moleſtation from without. But upon the 8th Day of the Month following, I being with ſeveral other Friends, met together in <hi>Sherif-Hutton,</hi> for to wait upon the Lord; the ſence of God's Goodneſs to me and his People being upon my Spirit, and I being kneeled down, and expreſſing the ſame, as the Spirit gave utterance: There ruſhed in one rude Man, with ſome Soldiers, who haled me forth; and that Man, with the Conſtable, had me before one Sir <hi>Thomas Gowre,</hi> who was a Parliament Man, and in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to do Juſtice; who asked me, If I ſpoke any words amongſt the People? Or to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. My anſwer was, as is afore expreſſed. And after I expreſſed the ſame, he ſaid, That was a Tranſgreſſion of the Act. My Wife ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by, and hearing him ſay ſo, thought in her Mind, (as ſhe ſaid ſince) If that were a Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of the Act, for me to expreſs the <hi>Sence of God's Goodneſſ upon my Spirit,</hi> ſhe was well content, that I ſhould ſuffer for it; or to this effect things paſſed. So the next Day, he and <hi>George Mountain,</hi> being in Commiſſion for to do Juſtice, by their Warrant, commited me, and a Friend, named <hi>John Hicks,</hi> (at whoſe Houſe the Meeting was) to Priſon to <hi>York-Caſtle,</hi> for the ſpace of Eleven Weeks and Five Days.</p>
               <p>The Cruelties of Men were much ſeen, in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing this Act, in ſeveral parts of the Nation, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in and about <hi>London,</hi> Sentencing many for Baniſhment, and Baniſhing ſome; but they were much reſtrained of what might be intended; for that Summer, that many might have been ſent away, there was Wars by Sea, and the Peſtilence very hot about <hi>London;</hi> which I believe did, as the Lord ſaw it good, put a great ſtop to them
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:52316:69"/>in ſending many away, who were Sentenced for Baniſhment; although many of our dear Friends in that common Calamity the Lord took away by Death, that all might be humbled, as as ſhown me at that time, when I was Priſoner the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time upon that Act in <hi>York-Caſtle,,</hi> which was thus occaſtioned: I being at a Meeting of Friends of Truth, namely thoſe People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> at <hi>Biſhop-Wilton,</hi> in the Eaſt-Riding of <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> upon the 14th Day of the 3d Month, 1665. the Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles came with a Warrant, and there with took us, (our Meeting being, as they ſaid, an Unlawful Meeting) and the next Day had us before <hi>Tobias Jenkins</hi> and <hi>Liebard Robinſon,</hi> in Commiſſion to have done Juſtice, who committed me, and nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen other Friends, to Priſon for three Months. In all theſe things the Lord's Support was much ſeen, by thoſe that Feared Him; and the Proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the Act, who thought to have wearied us, grew weary in many places; and Meetings became very quiet for ſome time; and Truth prevailed exceedingly: Bleſſed be Lord for ever, whoſe work it was to Strengthen His, and to give them Courage and Comfort every way.</p>
