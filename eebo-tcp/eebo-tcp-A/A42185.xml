            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER HEALTH.</head>
            <p>IF to have oppoſed a ſweeping Plague could ever eſtabliſh a Phyſician's Gloyr; whether you conſider the Dangers he reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cued others from, or thoſe he run him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into, or yet his Skill that enabled him for it; certainly for <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s to reſiſt the Plague of an Empirical Infection, cannot now be our Diſhonour. For, take it from <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, every Diſeaſe undertaken by a Quack is altogether as dangerous as the Plague. When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore People do ſo generally die with the To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of their Folly upon them, who can blame <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s for exempting the living from this Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality? Yet in doing this We foreſee, that Empiriciſm, like Infection, will falſely be imputed to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s; he that Cures either, being at one time or other avoided as ſick of the
<pb facs="tcp:38456:3"/>
ſame Diſeaſe. However, we hope your Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, better informed by the good effect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of our Art, would clear us of that Scandal, were not our Qualifications ſufficient to rub the Pitch off our own Fingers.</p>
            <p>All of the Honourable, the Colledge of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians in <hi>London,</hi> whereof we are Members, have, to a Man of them, been affected with the dying Groans of Perſons Murdered by Intruders into Phyſick. Theſe formerly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared only now and then, like the event of ſome petty Rencontre; but now they are heard ſo mournful and ſo numerous, that Quacking looks as if it were attended with the effects of a pitch'd Battel. Not a Week paſſes but ſome of us are called to theſe dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Objects; whom we generally find to have been treated much in the manner following, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon our enquiry into the caſe it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, the Sick was ſeized with a Fever, whoſe ſymptoms as to us related, did portend no danger; We know a Vomit would have been proper, the Intruder gave a Perl Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial; The Party ought to have been Bled, the Perl Cordial was repeated; ſome noble <hi>Diaphoretick</hi> or <hi>Febrifuge</hi> ſhould have been adminiſtred, the Perl Cordial was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated; All this while a low Diet ſhould have been kept, but inſtead thereof Gelly-broths
<pb facs="tcp:38456:3"/>
were intruded: Thus through omiſſion and commiſſion the ſymptoms of a dying Man ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, then come in <hi>Alkermes</hi> and a Bliſter; and a little before the Paſſing-Bell tolls in come We, to behold People Murdered, and our own Proſeſſion thus abuſed.</p>
            <p>Imagine you, what Impreſſion theſe Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Cruelties muſt make upon ſuch a Body of Men, whoſe Charity, we do inform you, bears its proportion to that Learning, which is admired abroad, and is likewiſe acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged here at home by the moſt Malicious of our Enemies. How do you think, when the Laws are not ſilent, can we be ſo, againſt ſuch bare-fac'd Offenders? Juſtly has the College animadverted on ſeveral Empiricks in getting the Statutes of the Realm executed upon them: And wiſely has the whole Body thereof conſidered of prudential Methods to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the obtaining the end and intent of the Law; <hi>viz.</hi> the ſuppreſſion of Empirical Man-ſlayers. Sundry methods have former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been under their Debate; the reſult where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was, that ſome <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaking like this of Ours would prove the moſt effectual. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced therefore by ſuch a general Opinion, and moreover encouraged hereto by ſeveral of the Society, beſide the unanimous Reſolution of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s five on the Point; We, for the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb facs="tcp:38456:4"/>
Good, and, we hope, not to the Diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of our Profeſſion, do proceed in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod following, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p n="1">1. At the <hi>Angel</hi> and <hi>Crown</hi> in <hi>Kingſtreet London,</hi> We have a Repoſitory, furniſhed with the moſt noble and efficacious Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines; faithfully prepared with our own hands.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Every day in the Week, from ſeven in the Morning till eight at night; one or other of Us will conſtantly attend at the Repoſitory, there to give his Advice, and to diſpenſe the Medicines with his own Hand; or elſe to go himſelf or ſend ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Us, where a Viſit is required.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Every <hi>Munday</hi> and <hi>Thurſday</hi> in the Week, from two till ſix in the Afternoon, We will all of Us attend at the Repoſito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, there to adviſe and conſult upon ſuch Caſes, as ſhall then be propoſed to Us, and accordingly to diſpenſe the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines; or to depute ſome of the Conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to viſit, when required.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Either at the Repoſitory, or at our ſeveral reſpective Dwellings, We are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to give to the Poor our Advice <hi>gratis,</hi> and to ſupply them with Medicines at low rates.</p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:38456:4"/>
And, that it never may be ſaid, We talk as much like Impertinents, as they that oppoſe the giving of our own Phyſick, let every thinking Perſon well conſider the weight of what we have to ſay in favour of theſe our Propoſals. We therefore acquaint you, that the Laws have impowered Phyſicians in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to give as well as preſcribe Phyſick. But to the end, Reaſon, and not bare Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity may prevail, believe it altogether as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, as it is lawful for us ſo to do. For every one that prepares a Medicine according to the Diſpenſatory, unleſs he will be ſo inſipid as to condemn what himſelf does, muſt own that our College, who made that Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, is able to prepare the things deſcribed in it; Or, that He is guided by the Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Perſons, who themſelves know not how to perform, what they direct others to do: Which can hardly be acknowledged by a Man, who otherwiſe perhaps thinks better of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf than of the Authors of the Diſpenſatory. Moreover, if in leſs knowing Times the beſt Phyſicians Preſcribed and Diſpenſed their own Medicines with their own hands (as <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> with his own hands prepared the great Treacle for ſeveral of the Emperors of <hi>Rome,</hi> and gave moſt of his own Phyſick) what Weakneſs is it now to think, in a Practico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philoſophical
<pb facs="tcp:38456:5"/>
Age, wherein Learned Men of all Profeſſions do ſo generally addict them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the ſearch of Nature, that Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans alone ſhould neglect their Province, and not know the preparation of their own Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, which comprehends a great ſhare of Natural Inquiries? Among Men not profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Phyſicians, the Honourable, and Learned Mr. <hi>Boyl</hi> is Maſter of many noble Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in Medicine. In reference to Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who can be ſo injurious to the Memory of our <hi>Harvey,</hi> as to ſay, that He who found out the Circulation of the Blood, and knew the Vital Proceſs from the firſt vibration of the ſalient Point in the <hi>Embryo,</hi> till it drew, nay expired its vital Air, who dares ſay, He knew not the Proceſs of a Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Preparation? With what curious Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments has our <hi>Willis</hi> enriched Pharmacy, who, to our knowledge, put his own hand to the Work? Nor have Phyſicians abroad, ſuch as <hi>Sylvius, Ettmuller, Wedelius</hi> and others, been ſparing of their own pains in making moſt curious Remedies. And do not think, that all Men of Abilities in Pharmacy are dead out of our College; but to avoid pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable Flattery in reciting of living Names, let our Adverſaries name that one Man of the College, who has not ſolid skill in Pharma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
<pb facs="tcp:38456:5"/>
If they cannot name him, let all Men, who value their Health, judge between Them and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s. Our College has Publiſhed a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſatory, containing a complete preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Medicines; but not one ſyllable of what any one of theſe Medicines is good for, the Application of all (to prevent miſtakes) being reſerved to their Breaſts, who invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or approved them. Yet ſeveral of our bare Medicine-makers have preſumed to give theſe preparations to the ſick improperly, they not knowing the true Uſe of them; whereby many have been brought to untimely Ends. Nor is this all, they, under pretext of their Calling, too often vary our Preſcripts, or by ſlandering them, prevent their being taken. Whoſe hands then, think ye, ſhould we truſt but our own, in preparing our Remedies, if we either value your Lives or our own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation? But more than all this, the moſt effectual Remedies depend upon ſo long and ſuch curious Proceſſes, that only read men, and they that know the intricacies of Nature, can prepare them aright: To Adulterate them, 'tis true, is eaſie; and to buy them of ſuch as fell cheaper than they prepare carefully, is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious; but if you will either buy them true, or uſe them right, you muſt deal with Men of Art and not of Trade only.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:38456:6"/>
And of what moment the Advice of a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician in taking of Medicines is, were not People too little ſenſible, We needed be leſs ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous in making them more. But, as We ſaid, Compounders not knowing the uſe or nature of Medicines; becauſe they can go no farther than the Diſpenſatory, which only ſhews the making of them, We do aſſure you, that he runs a great hazard of his Life, who in his Sickneſs takes any Medicine without the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of a Phyſician. For were you but as through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convinced as We do certainly know, that an improper Diet does as ſurely kill as any Poiſon could, you would hardly adventure upon Medicines, which produce more violent effects upon our bodies than food can, without being aſſured by men of skill, that ſuch Medicines are proper for you.</p>
            <p>Knowing therefore the neceſſity of taking advice with all Medicines, and finding in our Practice how difficult ſome Caſes are; We have provided not only, that one Phyſician ſhall always be attending; but that many may aſſiſt one another in adviſing upon difficult Caſes. So that all the day long you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fail of a Phyſician at our Repoſitory; nor every <hi>Monday</hi> and <hi>Thurſday</hi> in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon of a Conſultation of ſeveral. Where we hope, that as all perſons of Ingenuity under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<pb facs="tcp:38456:6"/>
a Phyſician's Merit, ſo all ſhall receive mutual treatment from <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s; nor ſhall the great Objection of the chargeableneſs of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians hold againſt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, inaſmuch as we ſhall endanger no Mans Eſtate by the price of his Health, nor will we demand any thing for our Advice of the Indigent.</p>
            <p>Thus, you ſee, the Good of all, and the Credit of our Profeſſion is our Meaning, which you have farther explained to you in the enſuing Book. In it are contained all things that a Phyſician can well ask his Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent: and tho' ſeveral things may ſeem ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous and liable to Cavil; yet to the Judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and to Men of Art, there will appear nothing ſuch: For better it is, that many Queſtions more than need ſhould be put, than that any one leſs ſhould be forgotten. For inſtance; without the knowledge of a Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent's Conſtitution no Advice can ſafely be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; without the knowledge of the Complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Colour, Stature and other Accidents, the Conſtitution cannot be known; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the Queſtions mentioned in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Book, no man can be informed herein as he ought. By the convenience of this Book People wholly ſtrangers to Us may have our advice at a distance, as if preſent: And ſuch as had rather we ſhould know the
<pb facs="tcp:38456:7"/>
Diſeaſe than the Patient that is troubled with it, have hereby the opportunity of receiving Advice, he to whom that Advice is given, remaining altogether to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s unknown. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all Cavil at our plain Expreſſion in Male and Female caſes is vain; ſince to hear ſome neceſſary queſtions asked, would ſurely offend a modeſt Ear, which to read will not raiſe the leaſt emotion of a Bluſh: So that no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's Modeſty (who has this Book) need be put to the torture, in relating what ſome may think is here too boldly expreſſed; yet in many caſes of abſolute neceſſity by Phyſicians to be known. But peruſe the advantages of this Book.</p>
            <p>And thus, without Necromantick Art we can raiſe the Idea of an abſent Patient; when raiſed, without the inſpiration of any <hi>Python</hi> We can ſhrewdly divine what his Fate will be; and ſo, if either Knowledge of Secrets, or Fore-knowledge of what is to come, were ever counted Oraculous, <hi>Delos</hi> it ſelf did never own a much ſurer Oracle.</p>
            <p>For indeed We have not only ſtudied in the beſt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities of <hi>Europe;</hi> but We have put theſe our Studies into practice for many years in other Metropolitan Cities of this part of the World, where ſeveral of us have been Collegiate Phyſicians, as well as in
<pb facs="tcp:38456:7"/>

               <head>The Advantages of this Book.</head>
               <p n="1">§. I. SUCH ſick Perſons as have not the Convenience, or are not in a Capacity of calling in Phyſicians; by reaſon they ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther live at too great a diſtance, or are in no condition to defray that Phyſicians charges upon a journey, whom they make choice of above others, or that they ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will not or cannot go to him them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, will here find theſe inconveniences removed. For here they have every Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:38456:9"/>
and Queſtion, which Phyſicians uſe to propound to their Patients, from whence they take their Indications, and more than will ſerve their turn.</p>
               <p n="2">§. II. By this mean many poor ſick People will not henceforth be deſtitute of Advice; as they are in the Countrey, and in places remote from great Towns: A thing which redounds to the great Detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſeveral. For that they are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated to commit their Caſe to Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeons, Apothecaries, Barbars, and good Women dwelling in Villages, who are not always ſufficiently inſtructed how to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe a ſickneſs aright nor it's accidents. Through which ill management, the fick frequently dye of Diſeaſes, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſlight and curable, had they but been well treated. And, which is moſt deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, the ſick are little ſollicitous either in ſetting their Houſe in order, or about their Eſtate of a higher conſequence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not in the leaſt apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of any danger they are in. Which fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Accidents may henceforth in a great meaſure be avoided: Foraſmuch as one ſhall meet with none ſo ignorant, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded they can but read, who may not be capable of giving ſufficient inſtructions to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:38456:9"/>
Us concerning the Eſtate of the abſent Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, and concerning his Sickneſs, by the ſole uſe of this Book.</p>
               <p n="3">§. III. Thoſe ſame ſick Perſons, who in the Countrey and places remote are under Chirurgeons and Apothecaries hands, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of ſtating their Caſe, and thereby of conſulting Phyſicians about their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes, will be much better attended, whilſt not any one Circumſtance requiſite to the entire and perfect knowledge of their Diſeaſe, is forgot: It being notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that moſt of the great faults, which are committed in the management of the Sick, procede from this, that their Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are not well known, one being taken for another. And ſeeing that Phyſick is not an Art of Divination, as the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Vulgar perſwade themſelves, too much Circumſpection cannot be uſed in ſtating the Caſe aright to Phyſicians. And this will be much better done, when they that ſend, have their inſtructions in Print, the reading whereof will lead them, as by the hand, to the obſerving all things worth conſideration, which might otherwiſe eaſily ſlip their Memory. So that thoſe, who other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe would have been negligent in their Relation, in order to have Advice from
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:38456:10"/>
Phyſicians, cannot now be ſo any longer: for as much as they are obliged to note, or make mention of each particular Head in the Book.</p>
               <p n="4">§. IV. And even Phyſicians themſelves, of whom Advice is taken, being abſent, muſt of neceſſity by this Method be more exact in their knowledge and judgment of Diſeaſes, and in preſcribing their Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. For they, as they are obliged, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning their Advice with this Book, wherein the ſick Party and the Diſeaſe are drawn to the Life, and deſcribed, the defects of their Preſcriptions, if any there are, will be far more evident. As faults in Limning are beſt diſcovered, when the Piece and the Original are both in view, or when the Features of the abſent Party are well known to us. Such will be the ſtate of the ſick delineated by this Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by means whereof Perſons skilled in the Art of Phyſick may judge of the Abilities of that Phyſician, who gave his Advice: Which can never be done in the way Men practiſe preſcribing Piece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meal, wherein a Man can only diſcern whether the Preſcript be well doſed, and poſſibly whether it came from a Phyſician experienced in the Practice of his Art;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:38456:10"/>
but not whether it be preſcribed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently, nor whether it be proper for the Patient and the Diſeaſe, which is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal thing. So that every Phyſician, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering what it will conduce to his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, though now perhaps he is condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by Conſcience alone, will moreover be concerned in reference to his Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Which will ſerve for a double Incite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to encourage, and a double Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to bind him firm to his utmoſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour.</p>
               <p n="5">§. V. Phyſicians, that have Perſons of Quality under their hand, and ſuch as of whom it will be of import to remark from time to time, yea ſeveral times a day, the ſtate of their Sickneſs, will here alſo find a notable eaſe to their Memory, and a great Abridgment. For having as many Books as they will mark at divers times, they can ſet down in each of theſe Books the then preſent State of their Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, after the manner of Aſtronomers, who ſet down from time to time the State of the Heavens upon Paper; which State would o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe ſlip out of their mind, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the judgment that they would make: As on the contrary theſe different States of their patient will facilitate the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:38456:11"/>
which they will draw from com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>paring them; ſo as to gather the <hi>Criſes</hi> and the other Movements of Nature, which they have to do withal.</p>
               <p n="6">§. VI. There are ſeveral diſhonourable Diſeaſes, which hinder the Sick from diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering themſelves, and they by this Baſhful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs render themſelves incurable: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as by this Book any one may conceal his or her Name, which contributes nothing to the cure of Diſeaſes, and may receive good and ſalutary Advice.</p>
               <p n="7">§. VII. And whereas Seeing is the quickeſt and moſt comprehenſive of all the Senſes, here one will at once have in Sight a multitude of Queſtions, which it would be tedious to hear asked and anſwered: And one may fix on what things are conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, paſſing by ſuch things as to the Party ſeem worthy of little or no conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</p>
               <p>Now you have ſeen ſome of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of this Book; the Uſe of it will diſcover to you the reſt.</p>
               <p n="8">§. VIII. We need not here trouble our ſelves at all to anſwer thoſe that take upon them to decry the Inventions of others, and ſay that a man cannot comprehend in one Book an infinite number of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:38456:11"/>
a diverſe Combination where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of varies the Caſe; ſince the Letters of an Alphabet alone are ſufficient to deſcribe infinite Volumes. And when Phyſicians, Chirurgeons, and Apothecaries, and in their abſence other Perſons who ſhall ſend or come to us or others to ask Advice concerning a Diſtemper, do find matters extraordinary in it, nothing will hinder, but they may add them; ſince Treatiſes of Nature do admit Diſcourſes of Monſters.</p>
               <p n="9">§. IX. Little alſo can they hurt us, who tell us, this Invention is not our own. May they not as well reproach <hi>Galen,</hi> who took his Doctrin from <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> and he from others? It being no ſlight matter to put things in Order, and to introduce a new Uſe of them. But leaving Vain-glory to others, we ſhall reckon it ſufficient, that ſeveral Perſons do receive benefit, without regard whence it comes. And poſſibly, even they that would have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Novelty, might be the firſt in quarrelling upon that very account.</p>
               <p n="10">§. X. Others may find the Reading of this Work troubleſome and diſagreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, becauſe they may judge it, as it is, void altogether of Embelliſhment, and without Affectation, when they perhaps
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:38456:12"/>
may be deſirous of florid Language. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they know not, that height of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion is no more proper for inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, than Flowers are for nouriſhment; and ſince we intend the profit of all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind indifferently, which is compoſed, for the greater ſhare, of people who have not leiſure for theſe things, our manner of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe muſt be accommodated to their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie's, which will not prove uſeleſs to the Intelligent, as the more exalted Terms of our Art would be to the leſs knowing.</p>
               <p n="11">§. XI. Some will alſo think it ſtrange, that we make an Enumeration ſo exact of things, from which we may gather Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations; poſſibly, becauſe they behave themſelves ſo little after this manner in their Conſultations. But let ſuch Men know this, that they cannot with too much Circumſpection treat the Almightie's Maſter-piece: Moreover, the things which ſuper-abound, being not at all bad, ſuch as have a mind to make uſe of this Book may leave what they will, and mark no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what they ſhall find pertinent to their Deſign.</p>
               <p n="12">§. XII. They that reproach us, will not be wanting alſo to render us odious to Phyficians of other places, as if we ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:38456:12"/>
them of ignorance, and as if they knew not how to ſtate a Caſe, when it is neceſſary to take fome ſound Advice. But we have too good an Opinion, yea better than thoſe that envy us, of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of all Doctors in Phyſick, who have obtained their Degrees in famous Univerſities, too good certainly ever to call it in queſtion. We honour them, and are ready to conſult with them; ſo far are we from the leaſt intention of harm to them. And one may truly ſay of this work, that as it will ſerve as an <hi>Ariadne</hi>'s Clew, to guide by the hand the meaner ſort, who may be deſtitute of Phyſicians, and other Perſons, capable to ſtate their Caſe; ſo it will ſerve as a <hi>Medium</hi> to the more knowing Phyſicians, and who as ſuch are ordinarily fulleſt of employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to ſave their time, which to them is very precious. Moreover, they are not only at liberty by this Invention to ſtate ſeveral Caſes, for one; but they may eaſe themſelves of this trouble by the meaneſt of their Servants, that can read; nay, by the Patients themſelves. Furthermore, they that are experienced know, that Phyſick is an Art of Society, the Practice whereof is in this found different
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:38456:13"/>
from the Law, in that a Lawyer who pleads well, is never a whit the leſs e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed, though he loſe his Cauſe. But the ignorant Vulgar judge raſhly of a Phyſician by the event of the Diſeaſe; from whoſe Calumny he cannot better protect himſelf than by Conſultation, which Men cannot ſometimes have with the Phyſicians of the place, becauſe there is not a ſufficient number, and no good un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding among thoſe there are, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are too much in the Patients favour, and will not depart from their former Advice, or out of reſpect they will not gain-ſay one another. There is not any way more advantageous to maintain the Reputation of skillful Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, and of ſuch as omit nothing in the cure of a Diſeaſe, albeit the Succeſs proves not always correſpondent to their Care, than to juſtifie their Proceedings by other Perſons diſintereſſed and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of judging: To which this Book will give more aſſiſtence than any hitherto.</p>
               <p n="13">§. XIII. And thus will this Work hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth be a Touch-ſtone to diſtinguiſh Phyſicians from Pretenders; Theſe fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing more than the uſe of this Book and the Method it contains: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:38456:13"/>
one may eaſily by this mean know the faults, which they have committed in their management of Diſeaſes, and alſo may judge whether they have known them well; whereas ſuch as are expert in their Profeſſion deſire no better, than to make any one a Witneſs of their Actions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:38456:14"/>
AND becauſe in examining things, which a Phyſician ought to know, in order to his underſtanding a Diſeaſe well, and that he may direct his Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to the purpoſe, there are ſome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations common to both Sexes, ſome peculiar to each, and others yet apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to Chirurgery; the firſt of the eight Chapters into which this Book is divided, ſhall be common to both Sexes; the ſecond for Males; the third for Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males; and the five laſt ſhall be Chirurgical, treating of Swellings, Wounds, Ulcers, Bones broken and out of joynt; conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with ſome things concerning the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy which hath been given the Sick, the date of the Book, an Anſwer to ſome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, and an Alphabetical Table. Some of which muſt be omitted by ſuch as they concern not, to wit, the Chapter concerning Males, by ſuch as ſhall ask Advice for a Woman or Girl, and then that of Females, when one deſires judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment concerning a Man or Boy; and ſo other Chapters.</p>
               <p>The Uſe of this Book is in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; One muſt make a mark with a Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:38456:14"/>
or draw a ſlight line with a Pen up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the number, or on that part of the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure which one would denote: With this diſtinction in reference to the Figures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting the Body of Man or the parts thereof, that to mark a pain or any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ail, the line ends on the Skin or the outſide of the Figure, without being continued with Points: but to ſignifie an internal pain or ail of the ſame Part, one muſt continue the line with Points.</p>
               <p>As, to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie <figure>
                     <p>
                        <list>
                           <item>A</item>
                           <item>B</item>

                     </p>
                  </figure>
 a ſuperficial wound on the right Cheek I muſt repreſent it by the line [A,] which ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply ends on that part, without being continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Points. But to ſhew a deep wound or pain in the left Cheek, beyond the line [B,] which ends there, this line muſt be yet continued with more or leſs Points, accordingly as the Ail ſhall lye deep. And when the pain or other grievance is any way extended, the line muſt divide it ſelf into two, three or more Rays,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:38456:15"/>
which muſt end round about, juſt where the grief reaches: Thus, if you look on the lines that begin at the Letter [C] one of which goes to the middle of the Forehead, another to the Crown, and a third to the left ſide of the Head, they ſignifie a pain in half of the ſame, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a <hi>Hemicrany,</hi> and by the common ſort the <hi>Megrim.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So, to repreſent the ſtate of a ſick Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, whoſe Father lived a long time, but ſickly and troubled with the Gout, who was begot by him in his old Age, of a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in her youth and health. This ſick Perſons conſtitution is weakly; the Skin without hair, clear, ſoft, thin and moiſt; the Colour pale; of a middle Stature; habit of Body lean; takes liquid Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cins with eaſe, but ſolid ones with diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty; hard to Purge, but eaſie to Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I muſt underſcore it with a Pen or Pencil, as you may ſee. And ſuch as have leiſure may write it out on a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per apart, leaving the Words which are not included or marked: And by this means one will find the Senſe compleat, and not at all interrupted with other words, uſeleſs to the matter in hand. As for example;</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:38456:15"/>
The Perſon for whom Advice is deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, is deſcended from a Father of a long, middling or ſhort Life, yet living Healthy, or who was troubled with the Headach, Palſie, Apoplexy, Falling-ſickneſs, Conſumption, Dropſie, Gravel, Stone, Colick, Venereal Diſeaſe, Gout, Piles, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Who begat him in his Youth; Manhood or Old Age; Of a Mother of a long, middling, or ſhort Life, or yet living: Healthy, or who was troubled with the Headach, Palſie, Apoplexy, Fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-ſickneſs, Conſumption, Dropſie, Fits of the Mother, Gravel, Stone, Colick, Venereal Diſeaſe, Gout, Piles, Leproſie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who bore the Patient in her Youth, in in her middle Age, or towards her old Age.</p>
               <p>As to the Conſtitution, it is Hale, Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling, or Weakly.</p>
               <p>The Stature, very Tall, Middling, or very Low.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:38456:16"/>
And ſo of the reſt; For it will be eaſie to apply to the ſame uſe, and to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy every word of this Book to give its meaning. As in preſſing the Fingers upon the Keys of a Virginal, you make ſome of them give their ſound, while others lye ſtill; whence proceeds the Harmony of the Inſtrument. But if the meaning of every Article of theſe Obſervations be not apprehended, or if ſome (as we ſaid) ſeem not pertinent to the Subject; ſuch may be let alone, As likewiſe one may to a whole Caſe add what he ſhall judge is wanting.</p>
               <p>Thus have we done with the Eſſay, which we thought good to premiſe, for the clearing of our grand Deſign, and the Practice of the ſame. Now we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede to</p>

            <p>VVHereas the five laſt Chapters of this Book are Chirurgical, our Intent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is only to give Advice, and to leave the manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Operation wholly to Chirurgeons. For ſince an external Tumour oft-times upon its receſs, cauſeth internal Diſeaſes, and again, ſince Fevers are often attended with Abſceſſes in ſome external Part; a Phyſician's and a Chirurgeon's mutual Aſſiſtence is often neceſſary to a Patient: And ſince a ſymptomatick Fever does ever attend conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable hurts done by Violence, in every ſuch Caſe Medical advice ought to be joined with manual Operation. Conſidering therefore that ſeveral Caſes cannot be managed aright without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of theſe things, we have ſo far, as aforeſaid, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted upon them. Nor are we inſenſible, what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries the Chirurgeons, that ſerviceable Order of Men, but Patients eſpecially, do daily ſuffer from Pretenders in this kind: But we will not ſo much as breathe a Vein; leaving, as we ſaid, all Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons buſineſs to whom it properly belongs: To all Apothecaries alſo, who tranſgreſs not the limits of their Calling, and conſequently neglect not their buſineſs, we are ready to ſend our Preſcripts.</p>
