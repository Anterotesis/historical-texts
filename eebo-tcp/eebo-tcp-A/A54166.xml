            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Gentlemen,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Wonder mightily at the News you ſend me, that
ſo many of the Town are averſe to the <hi>Repeal</hi> of
the Penal Statutes; ſurely you mean the Clergy
of the preſent Church, and thoſe that are Zealous for
their Dignity and Power: For what part of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
has felt the Smart of them more, and at all
times, and on all occaſions repreſented their miſcheif
to the Trade, Peace, Plenty and Wealth of the
Kingdom, ſo freely as the Town has always done?
But you unfold the Riddle to me, when you tell
me, <hi>'tis for fear of Popery,</hi> tho I own to you, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
comprehend it, any more then you do Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation:
For that we ſhould be afraid of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
for the ſake of Liberty, and then afraid of it
becauſe of Perſecution, ſeems to me abſurd, as it is,
that Liberty ſhould be thought the high way to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution.
But becauſe they are upon their fears,
pray let me tell you mine, and take them among the
reſt in good part.</p>
            <p>If the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> ſeek eaſe by Law, 'tis an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to me they deſire to turn good Countrymen,
and take the Law for their Security, with the reſt
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60049:3"/>
of their Neighbours; and a greater Complement
they cannot put upon our Engliſh Conſtitution, nor
give a better pledge of their deſires to be at peace
with us. But if we are ſo Tenacious as we will keep
on foot the greateſt blemiſh of our Reformation,
viz. our <hi>Hanging, Qua tering, Plunder Baniſhing Laws;</hi>
Is it not turning them out of this quiet courſe, and
telling them if they will have eaſe, they muſt get it
as they can, for we will never conceed it? And
pray tell me if this be not thruſting them upon the
methods we fear they will take, at the ſame time
that we give that, for the reaſon why we do ſo.</p>
            <p>If Law can ſecure us, which is the plea that is
made, we may doubtleſs find an expedient in that
which may repeal theſe, if the danger be not of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
it ſelf, but of our looſing it by them at laſt;
for there is no michief the wit of man can invent,
that the wit of man cannot avoid. But that which
I confeſs makes me melancholy, is, that methinks
we never made more haſte to be couſ<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ned; no not in
the buſineſs of the <hi>Declaration of Indulgence,</hi> when
in the name of Property that was actually damn'd,
which at leaſt reprieved it; and the price the Church
of <hi>England</hi> gave for it, <hi>viz.</hi> her promiſe of a legal
caſe, actually failed us: For inſtead of ſaving our
ſelves from Popery, we are by theſe partialities pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60049:3"/>
it every day, and methinks fooliſhly for our
own ſafety; becauſe there can be no other end in
doing ſo, then ſecuring that Party which calls it ſelf
the <hi>Church of England,</hi> that is in her Conſtitution none
of the beſt Friends to Property; for mens Liberties
and Eſtates are by her Laws made forfeitable for
Non-conformity to Her: And I Challenge the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
of all time ſince Popery got the Chair in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
to produce an eight part of the Laws, to ruin
men for Conſcience, that have been made ſince the
other has been the national Religion, which is, I ſay,
a ſcandal to the Reformation.</p>
            <p>She ſays, ſhe is afraid of Popery, becauſe of its
Violence, and yet uſes Force to compel it; <hi>Is not this
reſiſting Popery with Popery?</hi> which we call loving
the Treaſon but ha<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ce or Deſtroy others, but they
ſhould not have Power to Force or Deſtroy her, no
not to ſave themſelves: Shift the hand never ſo
often, this <hi>Weapon</hi> is ſtill the ſame. 'Twere happy
therefore that all Parties were diſarm'd of this Sword,
and that it were put where it ought only to be, in
the Civil Magiſtrates hand, to terifie Evil Doers,
and cheriſh thoſe that do well, remember<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng St <hi>Peter's</hi>
ſaying (in <hi>Cornelius</hi>'s caſe) for an Example, <hi>I perceive
now of a truth that God is no reſpecter of Perſons, but
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60049:4"/>
thoſe that fear him, and work Righteouſneſs in all Nations
ſhall be accepted:</hi> Elſe what ſecurity does the Church
of <hi>England</hi> give to the great body of her Diſſenters,
that ſhe will not do what ſhe fears from Popery, when
ſhe has a Prince of her own Religion upon the
Throne, that has made ſo fair a Progreſs theſe laſt
ſix and twenty Years in ruining families, for non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
under Princes of an other Perſwaſion. Come,
Intereſt will not lye, ſhe fears Liberty, as much as
Popery: Since thoſe that want, and plead for the one,
are an hundred times more in number then the
Friends of the other, and all of her ſide, that Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſhould not mount the Chair: So that ſhe would
get more then ſhe would loſe by the Repeal, if an
equal deſire to ſubject both Popiſh and Proteſtant
Diſſenters to her Power and Government be not the
Principle ſhe walks by in her preſent Averſion.</p>
            <p>And to ſhew you that this is the caſe, and that
her averſion to Popery is a ſham to the Liberty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired,
the Diſſenters are of no uſe to her, while the
penal Laws are on foot; for by them they are put
in the power of a Prince of the Religion of the
Church ſhe fears; but the moment they are repealed,
ſo far as concerns the preventing Popery to be nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal,
the Diſſenters are equally intereſted with
the Church of <hi>England</hi> againſt it. But then here is
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60049:4"/>
the miſchief; This Liberty takes the Rod out of her
hand; ſhe can no more <hi>whip People into her Churches,</hi>
and ſhe perhaps may modeſtly ſuſpect her own ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
and ability to preach them thither.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, if ſhe were in earneſt againſt Popery,
more then in love with her own Power and Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure;
that is, if the World were not in the way,
ſhe would rejoyce to deliver Men of her own Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
that are ſo much more numerous then the
Papiſts, that they might ballance againſt her fears of
their prevailing: But to cry ſhe is for Liberty to
Proteſtant Diſſenters, and make the demonſtration
of it, her <hi>keeping up the Laws that ruin them,</hi> and
then ſay it is for fear of the Religion the Prince owns,
and yet force them into his hands by doing ſo, is,
I muſt confeſs, ſomething incomprehenſible.</p>
            <p>Beſides, properly and naturally ſpeaking, the
Church of <hi>England</hi> is the People of <hi>England,</hi> and when
its apply'd to a Party, 'tis a Faction to the whole;
and that Title has no more Truth in it, then 'tis ſence
to ſay the Roman Catholick Church, which in
Engliſh, is a particular Univerſal Church: And pray
is there no room left to conſider this hard caſe of the
Kingdom? I hope the civil Magiſtrate will, who
is the ſupream Paſtor of this civil Church on Earth.
Is ſhe then no more then a Party? no certainly.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60049:5"/>
and how great a one, a true Liberty of Conſcience
would beſt tell us, and that is the true reaſon, and not
Popery, that ſhe is tender in the point.</p>
            <p>I conclude then, that whilſt thoſe of that Religion
only deſire to be upon the Level with others; I mean
upon <hi>Native Rights,</hi> the <hi>Great Charter,</hi> what we all of
us call, our <hi>Birth-right,</hi> let us not refuſe it, leſt God
ſuffer them to prevail to curb our partiallity. There
are Laws enough to puniſh Offenders againſt the State,
if theſe were repealed, and not condemn People by
<hi>Anticipation. That Law which catches a Proteſtant,
will catch a Papiſh Traytor, Riotor or ſeditious Perſon.</hi>
Again, let us reflect, that we have a Prince of Age,
and more honour; the proſpect of three excellent
Princes of the Proteſtant Religion, the paucity of
the Papiſts, the number of the Enemies of their
Commnion, their unity in that averſion: what
greater ſecurity can we have in the World? <hi>Policy,
Honour, Religion, Number, Vnity, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ay, Neceſſity too,</hi>
conſpire to make us ſafe: for all theſe are concerned
in the means of our preſervation; unleſs our fears
and our follies ſhould prevail: which I confeſs I
apprehend moſt; for they will be deſerted of God,
that forſake him and themſelves too; <hi>who dare do a
certain evil that a ſuppoſed good may come of it, contradict
their own Principles deny what they expect, ſow what they
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60049:5"/>
would not reap, do to others what they would not that others
ſhould do to them:</hi> But there is a God in Heaven, and
he is juſt: He will meet to us what we meaſure to
one another, and his Judgment is inevitable. I
therefore adviſe the Church of <hi>England</hi> to be as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
in her Chriſtian complyances as is poſſible: <hi>Firſt,</hi>
becauſe it is impious to keep up diſtroying Laws
for Religion, when her Saviour tells her upon this
very Queſtion, <hi>That he came not to deſtroy mens lives but
to ſave them. Secondly,</hi> Becauſe by this ſhe will wipe
off rhe Reproach ſhe throws by continuing them,
upon her own Apologies for Liberty of Conſcience,
when under the wheel of Power. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Becauſe
Liberty to the Papiſts by Law, is bringing them into
the legal intereſt of the Kingdom, and will prevent
the force, they may elſe be driven to, by being
made and left deſperate: For 'its not to be thought
they will willingly pay the reckoning in another
Reign, if by any means they can prevent it; and
keeping up the penal Laws can be no ſecurity to the
Church of <hi>England</hi> from ſuch attempts, though they
may provoke them upon her. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> She here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
ſaves her diſſenters; and if it be really her inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to do ſo, ſhe has no other way, and this unites
them to her in affection and intereſt, if not in Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.
But if on the contrary ſhe perſiſts obſtinately
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60049:6"/>
to refuſe this national paciffick; the diſſenters, I
hope, will conſider their honeſt Intereſt, <hi>Conſcience and
Property,</hi> and imbrace thoſe oppertunities to ſecure
them, that God in his all-wiſe providence is pleaſed
to yield them in this conjuncture. Thus Gentlemen,
you have my thoughts upon your News, pray com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
them to our acquantance, and believe that
I am, <hi>Yours, &amp;c.</hi>

            <p>FOr the <hi>Teſts</hi> that <hi>are</hi> ſo much diſcourſed of, I ſhall
only ſay, that 'tis, an other myſtery of the
Times to me, how the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that
was againſt the <hi>Excluſion,</hi> can be for them that were
deſign'd for a <hi>Preamble</hi> to it; ſince in ſo doing, ſhe
is for that which was contrived to introduce the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion</hi>
ſhe was ſo Zealouſly againſt. I confeſs I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
underſtood her very well, and ſhe grows more
and more unintelligible; but this I know, that ſhe
muſt either be ſorry for what ſhe has done, or ſhe
did not know what ſhe did. The firſt reflects upon
her Loyalty, the laſt upon her underſtanding; and
becauſe I think that the leaſt, and likelieſt evil, I
conclude ſhe is no infallible Guide upon the
Queſtion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:60049:6"/>
Another thing you tell me, that gives great of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
is, his Majeſties turning out Proteſtants, and
putting in People of his Religion. This I conceive a
fault, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> is only anſwerable
for. Other Princes have been ſo unhappy as to Suffer
<hi>Teſts</hi> and <hi>Marks</hi> of diſtinction that have broken and
diſorder'd their Kingdoms, by depriving thoſe of their
Temporal comforts, that would not receive them;
and this People eſteemed a mighty grievance; and
were frequent and elegant in their complaints about
it. We have a King now, that would remove theſe
<hi>Marks</hi> of diſtinction, and ſecure all men upon their
native Right and Bottom, That all Parties might ſit
ſafely under their own Vine, and under their own
Fig-tree; ſo that now, <hi>who is for Liberty?</hi> becomes
the <hi>Teſt.</hi> Are they then fit to be truſted that are out
of his Intereſt, and againſt the Liberty he is for, and
the Nation wants and craves? Or is it good ſenſe,
that he (who is mortal as well as other men) ſhould
leave the Power in thoſe hands, that to his face ſhow
