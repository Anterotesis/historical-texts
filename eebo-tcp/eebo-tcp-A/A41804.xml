            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An Appeal of Murther from certain unjuſt Judges, lately ſitting at the <hi>Old Baily,</hi> to the righteous Judge of Heaven and Earth; and to all ſenſible Engliſh-men, containing a Relation of the Tryal, Behaviour, and Death of Mr. <hi>William Anderton,</hi> Executed <hi>June 16. 1693.</hi> at Tyburn, for pretended High-Treaſon.</head>
            <p>WEre all Men truly Good, publick Laws would be of little or no uſe. For all political Laws are the <hi>good Daughter</hi> of a <hi>bad Mother,</hi> as being preventionally or occaſionally the Off-ſpring of ill Manners; but without them there is no Living in any Comfort or Security: hence all civilized Nations have ever gloried in their Laws, as their Honour and Safety, and heretofore none more than the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and perhaps none with greater reaſon; for it may be a difficult Task for a well-read Hiſtorian to find out a Kingdom under the Cope of Heaven, where the Lives, Liberties, and Properties of Subjects are more cautiouſly and critically ſecured; but eſpecially in caſe of <hi>Life</hi> (the Foundation of all humane Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings) wherein no Conjectures or Preſumptions are allowed, but the Law requires at leaſt two credible and poſitive Witneſſes, and if any thing be doubtful or controverted, always judgeth in <hi>favorem vite,</hi> and makes even the <hi>Judg</hi> himſelf of <hi>Councel</hi> to the <hi>Priſoner,</hi> that he may by no means miſcarry through any Error, Ignorance, Paſſion, or Inadvertency. But after all, the Law is a dead Letter, and cannot execute it ſelf; and when it ſo happens, that the Laws, which were made againſt <hi>Offences,</hi> are ſeized by the <hi>Offenders,</hi> and turned againſt thoſe whom they were deſigned to protect, the Sins of any Nation can ſcarce draw upon them a more heavy Curſe and Judgment: For then the Sheep are daily dragg'd to tryal before the Wolf, and nothing but Villany is maintain'd, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:32650:2"/>
and promoted; and an honeſt Man had a thouſand times better fall into the hands of a <hi>Confederacy</hi> of <hi>High-way-men,</hi> who will rob and diſpatch him with ſome kind of Generoſity, than under the clutches of a <hi>corrupt Miniſter of Law,</hi> who after a ſwinging mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification in a naſty Priſon, ſhall at length in a great deal of ſtate, with mighty formality, and tedious ceremony, proudly doom him to death, and all under colour and pretence of thoſe Laws, which, if they could ſpeak for themſelves, would <hi>acquit the Priſoner and hang the Judge</hi>; and whether the following caſe be not a freſh and lamentable Inſtance of ſomething too like this, I ſhall leave wholly to the Readers Judgment, after an impartial Peruſal.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>William Anderton</hi> knowing himſelf to be mortally, though cauleſly hated, by ſome Perſons, had abſconded of late for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable time, as it has been the hard fortune of divers great and good Men to do in theſe difficult times; but being by a parcel of falſe Villains betrayed to Mr. <hi>Robert Stephens,</hi> Meſſenger of the Preſs, and his ſworn Enemy, he was apprehended on the ſecond of <hi>May</hi> this preſent 1693. and <hi>Stephens</hi> (whoſe Malice much out-weighs his Brains) not content with his Perſon, plainly plundered the Houſe, carrying away Goods to a conſiderable Value, which there was no colour of Law for him or any Man elſe to ſeize; and this I ſuppoſe might be one great motive, to make him ſwear ſo deſperately at the Tryal, that he might take away a Man's Life, who otherwiſe might come upon him for Robbing him of his Goods; the Booty ſecured, away he goes, in triumph with his Priſoner, to my Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Holt,</hi> where he railed againſt him in a very indecent manner; the Judge was very calm, and ſaid very little to the matter, but, upon the accuſation, committed Mr. <hi>Anderton</hi> to <hi>Newgate,</hi> not for <hi>High Treaſon</hi> as is falſely alledged, by that Lying Pamphleteer, <hi>licenſed according to Order,</hi> who publiſhed that mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Account of his <hi>Converſation, Behaviour and Execution</hi> which was cryed about Streets immediately after his death; That Judge knew the Law better, and I believe is not in himſelf ſo very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:32650:2"/>
to overſtrain it. Whilſt he thus ſtood committed for Miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour, he was bailable; and accordingly very ſufficient Bail was offered for him; but <hi>Aaron Smith,</hi> who wiſely weighs what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage is to be made of every Priſoner, and conſiders not only the Perſon himſelf, but the Intereſt he is engaged in, and the Friends he may be ſuppoſed to have, thought too few Guineas were offered; and therefore ſtill kept off the Bail endeavouring to make a better Market; but while things hung thus between the <hi>Bail</hi> and the <hi>Bail-maſter,</hi> on a ſuddain the Controverſy was ended by the coming of a freſh <hi>Warrant</hi> upon the former, which committed the Priſoner for <hi>High Treaſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This way of Proceeding being ſomewhat unuſual gave occaſion to divers Cenſures; ſome ſaid, <hi>it was only a Trick to prevent his being bayled:</hi> others ſaid, <hi>that the Fact, though never ſo fully proved, could not amount to High Treaſon, and that they could not touch his Life; and that they had hereby done him a Kindneſs, becauſe upon his Tryal he would be diſcharged without any further Impriſonment or Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Puniſhment:</hi> But theſe, I ſuppoſe, were more converſant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Lawyers than the Politicians, and could better tell what ought to be done, than what ſome Men were contriving to do. Others judg'd this <hi>freſh Commitment to be the reſult of new Councels, and a plain Evidence, that they had taken new Meaſures; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did hence conclude, that he was thought a Perſon not only dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, but fit to make an Example, and that therefore it was reſolved he ſhould be hanged right or wrong:</hi> And the Event proved theſe to be in the right.</p>
            <p>Now ſuch illegal Proceedings and bloody Councels very ill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes thoſe who complained of ſmaller Failings in others, and have turned all things upſide down under a pretence to mend Matters and reform Abuſes; but there is nothing more ſanguina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, than a pretending <hi>State-Reformer</hi>; nothing more cruel and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage, than a <hi>Moderation-Man</hi> got into Power. But theſe doings being naturally ſo odious to Engliſh men, I hope they will conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:32650:3"/>
that the difference is not great, whether they be hanged with <hi>Popiſh</hi> or <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Halters; and will ſee at laſt, that they have a very ill ſecurity for their Lives, Liberties, and Properties, when thoſe who take upon them to guard them from Popery, become more Lawleſs and Cruel than Papiſts. There were indeed ſome even in the Councel who did diſlike theſe Proceedings: but others prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; and it would not be forgotten, that there is a certain ſly <hi>plump Divine,</hi> who perhaps is as good at <hi>Hocus Pocus</hi> Tricks, as any Man in <hi>Europe</hi>; he can cut a Man's Throat ſo neatly, that he ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver know who hurt him; he will put at his pleaſure all into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion and hurry, make Men ſo mad that they know not where they are, nor care what Miſchief they do; and all the while, as if he had <hi>Gyges</hi>'s Ring, ſhall walk inviſible, and ſhall not be ſo much as ſuſpected to have had any hand in the matter: To this Crafts-Maſter <hi>Robin Stephens</hi> made haſte over the Water to ſet forth his great Services, and to receive ample Praiſes, if not a Reward. But his Expectation was ſadly baulk'd; for the Oracle fell foul up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, telling him, <hi>that now he was threatened to be turn'd out of his Place he could find theſe Men, and that it might juſtly be thought that he had been confederate with them all this while, and falſe to the Government; and that if he did not give better Teſtimony of his good affection to the Government, and that he was an Enemy to ſuch kind of Men, he might loſe his Place for all this.</hi> Now all this is only an Uſe of Inſtruction to a Meſſenger who was malicious enough of himſelf; for the plain Engliſh of it is this; <hi>'Tis true you have taken a Printer, but what of that? For unleſs you go through with your Work, and ſwear him out of his Life, you do the Government no Service, and had as good have done nothing at all:</hi> Guilt is ever mercileſs and bloody, a Man is got into the head of a Schiſm, has ſeiz'd on <hi>N<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

the King</hi>; now the Priſoner was of a Trade that told Tales, and the wicked <hi>Mufty</hi> ſtrongly preſum'd that this was the Man, who had not only often refreſh'd his Memory with the mention of his Guilt, but did give him ſome diſturbance in the poſſeſſion of his ill-gotten Goods, and therefore he was unpardonable, ſuch a Man he could not endure ſhould live. But though he knows not how to forgive, yet I heartily wiſh he may repent, that God may for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give him, leſt he find Hell a more difficult place to get out of than of late he imagin'd.</p>
            <p>I ſhall paſs by ſeveral Circumſtances, which perhaps ſome would think material, that I may avoid Tediouſneſs and come to the Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al itſelf, which was begun on <hi>Thurſday June</hi> 1, but reſpited till <hi>Saturday</hi> following, that this bloody Scene might be acted with the greater Solemnity. The Court being ſet, ſeveral appeared on the Bench, but his real and effectual Judg was <hi>Treby,</hi> one of the old Republican ſtrain, and as fit a Perſon as could have been pickt out for ſuch a murderous Deſign; this Man being <hi>Recorder</hi> of the City of <hi>London,</hi> when the Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> was condemned for <hi>High Treaſon,</hi> and by his place being to paſs Sentence upon him did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare himſelf exceedingly troubled in mind and mightily diſſatisfy'd becauſe there was only one poſitive Witneſs, and other circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Evidence againſt his Lordſhip, and not two poſitive Evidences to the ſame fact, as he ſaid the Law required: But ſee how mens Conſciences can face about, when their Malice is to be gratified; he could now brow-beat, revile, and in effect <hi>force a Jury</hi> to bring in a Verdict of <hi>High Treaſon,</hi> when there was not one poſitive Evidence to any matter of fact, nor indeed any Evidence at all, that could directly affect the Priſoner as to the matter in his Indictment. The Lord deliver me and all honeſt Men from <hi>Trebyan Juſtice. He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodotus</hi> relates of <hi>Cambyſes,</hi> that he took an unjuſt Judge and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his Skin to be ſlead off, and tann'd, and therewith the Seat of Juſtice to be lined, and then put his Son in the place, who ſitting upon his Father's hide, could not want a Monitor to make him care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:32650:4"/>
to pronounce righteous Judgment; and for my part I cannot give a reaſon why <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſhould not be as ſollicitous to have Juſtice duly adminiſtred as <hi>Heathens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Anderton</hi> made it his Requeſt, that he might have a Copy of his Indictment, but it would not be granted; and indeed ſo great Care was taken, and ſo ſtrict a Charge given, that neither before nor after his Tryal could any Copy be obtained, ſo long as he lived; whether it may be had now I know not. The Crime laid to his Charge was the <hi>Compoſing, Printing and Publiſhing two Malicious Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Libels:</hi> The firſt intituled, <hi>Remarks upon the preſent Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, and late Revolution in England</hi>; The ſecond, <hi>a French Conqueſt neither deſirable nor practicable.</hi> As to the later of theſe it is now certainly known, that he had no hand in it, and that it was Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at a Preſs which he never ſaw, and by Perſons with whom for a long time he had no Communication: and it muſt be allowed to be a reaſonable Suppoſal, that his Judge knew this at the time of his Tryal. For the Government had at that time in their cuſtody thoſe Perſons, who knew when and where it was Printed (and as it was ſaid) had made a Diſcovery of all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> perhaps of more than they knew: The Papers of that ſort taken upon the Priſoner were ſent to him the day before he was ſeized; and ſome have a vehement ſuſpicion, that it being reſolved he ſhould be taken the next day, thoſe Pamphlets were ſent before hand that ſomething might cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be found upon him: But his Innocence in that Matter hath ſince been made evident to all the World by an irrefragable Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; for this <hi>September</hi> Seſſions at the <hi>Old Baily, Price</hi> in open Court made Oath, that he and the Priſoners then at the Bar, <hi>Newbolt</hi> and <hi>Butler,</hi> Printed the <hi>French Conqueſt.</hi> This was both a Surpriſe and a Choak-pear to ſome there, and a murmuring noiſe ran through the Court, whilſt ſome whiſper'd, <hi>And was</hi> Anderton <hi>then hanged for that which othes have done?</hi> And the <hi>Attorney General,</hi> a Man who need not be taught to ſpeak, was ſtruck dumb and look'd blank, I ſuppoſe in anger and indignation that he ſhould be
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:32650:4"/>
impos'd upon to accuſe a Man of a thing for which he loſt his Life; and the ſame Man in the ſame Court proved innocent. For this I do think of him that he would not knowingly proſecute a falſe Accuſation againſt an innocent Man, tho this is more than I would ſay of the Judge.</p>
            <p>Upon the Tryal the principal Evidence againſt the Priſoner was <hi>Robin Stephens</hi> the Meſſenger: Now all Courts of Judicature uſe to have a particular regard to the Credibility of the Witneſſes, and not to throw away any mans Life upon the Teſtimony of infamous malicious Perſons; and ſuch as care not what they ſwear. Now the Man is yet living to bear witneſs of it againſt whom <hi>Robin Stephens</hi> in Malice made Oath before a <hi>Juſtice of the Peace,</hi> that he was a buſie, troubleſome <hi>Diſſenter,</hi> came not to his Pariſh-Church, nor had received the Sacrament there, for the ſpace of Twelve Months then laſt paſt, and the Gentleman being brought before the <hi>Juſtice of Peace</hi> to ſatisfy the Law in that caſe, he gave ſuch convincing Evidence to the ſaid <hi>Juſtice</hi> that he was a conſtant Churchman, and for Eleven of the ſaid Twelve Months had received the Sacrament at his own Pariſh-Church, that the <hi>Juſtice</hi> gave him his Warrant to take up <hi>Stephens for making a falſe Oath</hi>; and the Warrant he late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had to produce, and I believe hath ſtill. But what a rare Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low this is for honeſt Mens Lives to depend on, you ſhall farther perceive by the Teſtimony he gave upon the Tryal.</p>
            <p>One thing whereof Mr. <hi>Stephens</hi> made Oath was, that at the time of Mr. <hi>Anderton</hi>'s Apprehenſion, he did in Words diſown the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and call'd K. <hi>W. Hook noſe,</hi> not ſubmitting himſelf. Now as to the Words this is abſolutely falſe; for ſome ſcuffle there was but not a Word ſpoken. Mr. <hi>Anderton</hi> in the time of his Health and Liberty was a Man of Integrity, and ſo far from being given to Lying, that he particularly hated a Lyar, and ſuch a Perſon no one can think would perſiſt in a needleſs Lye at his Death; and to the very laſt he denyed the ſpeaking any ſuch Words; but for a further Evidence he told to ſeveral Perſons the very reaſon of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:32650:5"/>
his Silence. For he ſaid he knew <hi>Robin Stephens</hi> to be <hi>ſhort-ſighted,</hi> but withal that he knew his Voice, and that while he did not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcover himſelf by ſpeaking, he was in ſome hope to give him the ſlip. But if <hi>Robin Stephens</hi> be pleaſed a little better to recollect himſelf, he may then perhaps remember that another Perſon about three days before that time had ſaid ſuch Words to him; but he ought to have a care how he transfers Matters from one Man to another; for that is the way not only to condemn the innocent, but to acquit the guilty: But after all, ſuppoſe it true, that he had ſpoken that unhandſome Word; a <hi>diſreſpectful Term</hi> it might be, but Treaſon it was not, neither was it any thing to his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment; and why then ſhould a Judge make ſuch a buſtle about it, and exerciſe his Wit thence to prove the Priſoner diſaffected to the Government? What hath a Judge to do with a Man's Affections? If a Jury will be prevail'd on to find a man guilty of High Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for ſaying a Man has a <hi>Hook-noſe,</hi> who really has a <hi>Hook-noſe,</hi> they will hang a Man for ſpeaking truth; and that is an ill Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try for an honeſt Man to live in.</p>
            <p>Another part of Mr. <hi>Stephens</hi>'s Evidence was, that he there took an old Trunk fill'd with Papers and Pamphlets, and that he had ſeen the ſaid Trunk formerly, and knew it to be Mr. <hi>Anderton</hi>'s, and leſt the poor old Trunk ſhould not be ſufficiently taken notice of, it is put into the Ordinary's Paper, and alſo into that which was cry'd about on the day of his Execution. Now the Reaſon of Swearing to the Knowledge of the Trunk was, becauſe it was not found in any of the Rooms that could be proved to belong to Mr. <hi>Anderton</hi>: But if <hi>Robin Stephens</hi> had never ſeen that Trunk be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, then he muſt make a falſe Oath in ſwearing that he had ſeen it before, and that he knew it to belong to Mr. <hi>Anderton</hi>: and indeed he had never ſeen that Trunk before, nor did it belong to Mr. <hi>Anderton.</hi> For I can name the Gentlewoman to whom the Trunk did belong; and in whoſe conſtant uſe it hath been for theſe Ten years laſt paſt and upwards, in whoſe houſe <hi>Robin Stephens</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:32650:5"/>
never was that ſhe can tell, nor doth ſhe ſo much as know him; and ſome Weeks before Mr. <hi>Anderton</hi>'s Apprehenſion ſhe innocent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lent the ſaid Trunk to a Perſon who ſaid ſhe had occaſion for ſuch a thing for a little time, and did expect it to have been return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but now ſhe muſt loſe her Trunk, and dare not own it, leſt ſhe ſhould bring herſelf into a great deal of Trouble for doing a common neighbourly Kindneſs.</p>
            <p>But the Evidence which was principally relyed on, and which ſeemed moſt ſtrongly to affect the Priſoner, was the matter of the Desk, as to which <hi>Robert Stephens</hi> made Oath, <hi>that he took out of the ſaid Desk</hi> 40 <hi>or</hi> 50 <hi>of a ſort of the Remarks and French Conqueſts.</hi> Now herein lay the great Maſter-piece of <hi>Robin Stephens</hi>'s Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany, for he had ſeen the Desk formerly, and might well remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and ſwear to the knowledge of it, and moreover the Desk was taken in a room, which was owned to belong to Mr. <hi>Anderton</hi>; but all this comes ſhort; for it is no Treaſon to have a Desk, yea even a notoriouſly known Desk; and therefore to do the Feat it was requiſite, that ſome Books ſhould be found in that Desk, and then it would be reaſonably ſuppoſed, that the Books did belong to the Owner of it; though this is no infallible Reaſoning. For Mens Books, Moneys, and other Commodities, are often laid up in other Mens Desks; every thing is not a Man's own, which he has in Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion. But the truth is, there was not ſo much as one of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks</hi> or <hi>French Conqueſts</hi> in the ſaid Desk; and if after Mr. <hi>Anderton</hi> was apprehended, <hi>Robin Stephens</hi> or any of his Gang did ſteal the ſaid Desk, and put ſuch treaſonable Papers into it, I would ask of any indifferent Perſon, Whether he, or they, or Mr. <hi>Anderton</hi> ought to be hanged for it? I could name the Perſon who hath more than once told me, that when-ever he could appear with ſafety, he would be ready to make Oath, That about an hour before Mr. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derton</hi> was ſeized he had occaſion to look for ſomething in the ſaid Desk; and that at that time there was nothing in it, but two Quires of clean white Paper, and ſome bound Books (<hi>i.e.</hi> ſuch as the Bible,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:32650:6"/>
Common Prayer-Book, Whole Duty of Man, and Books commonly uſed in Families) and not any ſtitcht Books, and that he was with Mr. <hi>Anderton</hi> to the very minute that he was taken, and is as ſure, as it is poſſible for Man to be, that neither he nor any other did put any ſuch Books into the ſaid Desk from the time he had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſearch it, to the time of Mr. <hi>Anderton</hi>'s apprehenſion, for which he gives many convincing matters in evidence, too long to be here inſerted. He had no occaſion to ſpeak of this till after the Tryal; for he could not foreſee ſuch a malitious Contrivance, nor know before-hand what <hi>Stephens</hi> would ſwear; or if he had, he durſt not appear to give Evidence, leſt he himſelf ſhould fall under the ſame ſate; but it is well known, that the Priſoner peremptorily denied any ſuch Books to have been there, though he own'd the Desk; and he uſed an Argument to convince the Bench of the truth of what he ſaid, drawn from the very Evidence given againſt him, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Desk was ſmall and not able to contain half ſo many Books, as were ſworn to be taken out of it; and for proof hereof deſired that the Desk might be brought into the Court for the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and all others Satisfaction: But his righteous Judge would not allow it, but ſhuffled off the matter, ſaying, That the Number of Books <hi>was only matter of ſuppoſal.</hi> But then is Blood with him ſo cheap, and can he be ſatisfied in Conſcience to hang a Man for a <hi>Suppoſal,</hi> and that <hi>Suppoſal falſe</hi>; and ſuch a <hi>Suppoſal,</hi> that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf durſt not ſuffer to be examined, leſt it ſhould have made it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, that their <hi>grand Evidence</hi> was a perjured Rogue? This was the only piece of Evidence that did in the leaſt ſeem to affect the Priſoner; and therefore ought to have been fairly and fully canvaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and not ſo lightly huddled and ſham'd over; all the other Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence was nothing to the purpoſe; and if even this had been true, it could not have caſt him. For the having Books in a Desk is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Compoſſing, Printing, nor Publiſhing,</hi> which is the Crime charged in the Indictment.</p>
            <p>The ſubſtance of the aforeſaid Teſtimony concerning the Books
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:32650:6"/>
being taken out of the Desk was ſeconded by the Evidence of <hi>Hooper</hi> Beadle of the Hall, and the <hi>Conſtable</hi> and his <hi>Beadle.</hi> Now though the Falſhood of the thing is already made manifeſt, yet I ſhall retain ſome Charity for theſe Perſons, till I find cauſe to the contrary; becauſe it is very probable, that they might be deceived. For if <hi>Stephens,</hi> or any Agent of his, in the time of the huddle, and removal of things, did put ſuch Books into the Desk, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards examine it before the ſaid <hi>Conſtable</hi> and <hi>Beadles,</hi> they might ignorantly ſwear to his Contrivance; and they might truly ſay ſuch Books were <hi>taken out of the Desk,</hi> and not know that <hi>Stephens</hi> and not Mr. <hi>Anderton</hi> put them in. But there is one thing, which ſhews them to be too looſe and heedleſs in the matter of an Oath, in that they alledged ſo many of the <hi>French Conqueſts</hi> to be there, when it is certain there was not the fourth part of ſo many in the houſe, which (as I have already told you) were ſent him the day before, and which the Government it ſelf now (if it did not then) well knows were not Printed by him. And yet after all this mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude they were content to fall to one of each, that they might be particularly ſworn to; and when Mr. <hi>Conſtable</hi> was asked, how he knew thoſe to be the Books, and was deſired by the Priſoner to read the Titles of thoſe Books whereof he accuſed him, truly it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, that the learned Gentleman had been bred to no ſuch dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous things as Writing or Reading. Now could a more unqueſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Witneſs have been produced to printed Books, and their Titles, than a Man that cannot read? But for a help at a dead lift, it was ſaid that he had made <hi>his private Mark</hi> on the ſaid Books; but then it ought to be conſidered. That his <hi>private Mark</hi> was made to the two Books at the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Holt</hi>'s Chamber, which <hi>Robin Stephens</hi> produced out of his Pocket, when the Priſoner was brought to be examined. Now what did his Mark ſet on two Books at the Lord Chief Juſtice's Chamber, which were all the while before in another Man's Cuſtody, ſignify to prove that thoſe were the Books, which were about four hours before taken out of a Desk in <hi>S. James</hi>'s?
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:32650:7"/>
               <hi>Robin Stephens</hi> might have produced what Books he pleaſed, and in all likelihood this Man would have ſet his <hi>private Mark</hi> on them; but if he would have been ſure, he ought to have ſet his <hi>private Mark</hi> at the time of their being taken out of the Desk; but if there were not villanous Treachery in the caſe, there was no ſuch Book to be <hi>marked.</hi> Would any Judge, who had either a Grain of Senſe or Conſcience, hang a Man upon ſuch Evidence as this?</p>
            <p>I ſuppoſe it is for a blind, that <hi>Stephens</hi> ſwore, <hi>that coming to the Door (i. e. Scudamore</hi>'s) <hi>and asking what Lodgers they had, turning his head aſide, he ſaw the Priſoner's Mother in the Yard, who crying out Murther, the Priſoner came out of the Houſe, and fell upon him.</hi> For I cannot imagine what ſhould make him ſwear ſuch a needleſs Lye, unleſs it were to cover the Treachery, whereby the Priſoner was betray'd, and to bear the World in hand, that he accidentally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered him by eſpying his Mother. For his Mother was not in the Yard, but in the common Room, which they uſed for their Kitchen; and <hi>Stephens</hi> came into the Yard, and directly to the Door, which by chance at that time was bolted; and when he could not by force get in (for the Priſoner's Wife and Mother ſpying him out at the Window would not open the Door) he took down a pane of Glaſs, and was ſtriving to come in that way, whereupon they opened the Door, and at the out-cry of his Mother and Wife in that Room, the Priſoner Mr. <hi>Anderton</hi> came upon him, who had eſcaped the <hi>Buzzard,</hi> had it not been for the ſtrong Guard he had ſet.</p>
            <p>This piece of Evidence alſo admirably well agrees with another, <hi>That he ſaw him ſhoving up a Bed, which ran upon Wheels.</hi> Now the Bed ſtood in a Room, from which you muſt come thorough two Doors into the Yard. In ſhort, Mr. <hi>Anderton</hi> did not ſhove up the Bed, nor was he firſt ſeen to <hi>Stephens</hi> at this time of his apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, either in that Room, or in the Yard, but in their Kitchen or common Room lying between both. And indeed as to this matter the Priſoner convinced him of the Falſhood of it in the open Court;
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:32650:7"/>
but however it was taken no notice of. The Witneſs muſt not be diſparaged or diſcouraged, though ſome Men will be apt to wonder at his Wit, how he could contrive to forſwear himſelf in ſo many particulars.</p>
            <p>Beſides <hi>Stephens, the Conſtable and the Beadles,</hi> there were alſo two Printers ſworn, <hi>viz. Roberts</hi> and <hi>Snowden,</hi> the Subſtance of whoſe Evidence was, <hi>That they had ſeen the Characters in the Hall, together with the</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and that they did believe it was the Letter that Printed that Book, (i. e.</hi> the Book then ſhewed in Court) <hi>as alſo that the two Books were Printed with one and the ſame Letter or Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</hi> Now if this Evidence be true, it ought to have acquitted him; if it be falſe, it ought not to have hurt him. For the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment well knows where and by whom one of the Books was printed, and that it was not Printed by Mr. <hi>Anderton,</hi> nor had he any manner of hand in it, or any communication at that time with thoſe Printers; and if both the Books were printed with the ſame Letter or Character, then I think it is a pretty fair and clear Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, That he printed neither of the ſaid Books, and conſequently ought upon this Evidence to have been diſcharged. But be the matter true or falſe, what ſignifies <hi>believing</hi> in this caſe? Is one Man to be hanged for anothers <hi>believing?</hi> Malice is put to its ſhifts, when without any colour of Legal Evidence it is forced to <hi>believe</hi> a Man out of his Life. But if ſuch Evidence as this ſhall be looked on as good and ſatisfactory in matter of Life, I think the whole So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of Printers are deeply concerned in it, and that they are all in very dangerous Circumſtances; for I am aſſured by a very under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding Printer, that there is not a Printing-houſe in Town, but hath of the ſame ſort of Letter or Character, ſo that upon ſuch an Oath as this, any or all the Printers of the Town might have been taken, and whom they thought fit hanged. For there is none of them but had Characters as ſuitable to the Book, as that which was ſworn to; and if it had been ſeized, and thus ſworn to, they were as lyable to be hanged as <hi>Anderton.</hi> At this rate the Government
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:32650:8"/>
need not give themſelves the charge of a Meſſenger of the Preſs, nor the trouble of ſuch frequent Searches; but as ſoon as any Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious or Treaſonable Pamphlet comes abroad, it is but going to the next Printers and ſeizing his Letter, and having found ſome of the ſame ſort of Character, to get a couple of Rattle-headed Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows to ſwear to it, and hang him; and thus they may pick and chuſe what Printers they pleaſe to hang. Was ever ſuch a wiſe Oath made by two Printers? but <hi>Snowden</hi> was made choiſe of, for his notoriouſly known Malice againſt the Priſoner, and no doubt but his Fellow was endued with ſome excellent Quality or other.</p>
            <p>There was brought in another Witneſs, who made Oath, that about three Quarters of a year before, he had ſold the Priſoner Paper by the Name of <hi>Williamſon.</hi> Now what is the Crime of buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Paper? The <hi>Stationers</hi> would have an ill Trade, if every Man ſhould make himſelf a Traytor, who becomes a Cuſtomer to any of them. Whatever they conjectured, no body offered to prove, that he made any ill uſe of his Paper; and then if he had bought half the Paper in the Town, I know not what harm had been in it, provided that he had honeſtly paid for it. What need was there to have troubled ſuch a Witneſs as this? There can ſcarce be thought any other Reaſon, but that they were reſolved to run a Man down with noiſe and number, againſt whom they wanted ſufficient Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
            <p>Thus I have examined the Witneſſes, and I do not know that I have omitted any thing material ſpoken by them; their buſineſs was to fix the Preſs, Letter, and Pamphlets upon the Priſoner, to prove he worked there, but particularly, that he printed the two Books laid in the Indictment; which if their Evidence did not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to, it ſignified nothing. Now if a Man carefully conſider the whole Evidence in relation hereto, he will plainly perceive, that it was either falſe, inconſiſtent, or impertinent, and after all no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpoſe. For he ſtood indicted for <hi>Compoſing, Printing, and Publiſhing</hi> two particular Pamphlets, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Remarks</hi> and <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="5 letters">
                     <desc>•••••</desc>

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:32650:8"/>
Conqueſt.</hi> I ſuppoſe they themſelves did not think him the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer, that word was put in for Formality's ſake; but however if they did, there was no offer in the leaſt to prove it; nor was there any proof, that he printed both, or either of the Books laid in the Indictment, or any other Book, or that he printed at all; nor was it proved, that he publiſhed the ſaid Books, or any other Books; nay, there was not the leaſt thing, that looked like an Evidence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards any one of theſe things; ſo that there was not one tittle of his Indictment proved. Let us now ſee what art this reverend Judg could uſe to condemn him? For any Man who had known the Laws of <hi>England</hi> would have thought he had been ſafe enough.</p>
            <p>The Priſoner with a great deal of calmneſs and clearneſs had all along made appear the inſufficiency of the Evidence; but the Judg, he as much crys it up, ſtrains all his Rhetorick to ſet gloſſes upon it, over-rules all, and though for Faſhion-ſake he leave it to the Jury, yet he perſwades them, that they could not but ſee in it, what no body elſe could: and now like a Knaviſh Diſputant, who begs the the Queſtion, he takes for granted, that the matter of Fact was proved, though the contrary was as clear as Noon-day. But then from this falſe Suppoſition of the proof of matter of Fact, there aroſe matter of Law, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether Printing were Treaſon? And in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence hereof, Whether it were within the purview of the Statute of the 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3? As to this, the Priſoner deſired he might have the benefit of <hi>Councel,</hi> and pleaded his Right to it, urging not only the Privilege of every Engliſh-man, but that it was the Practice of all our Courts of Juſtice, and that no Man was denied Councel where any matter of Law aroſe, and inſtanced in the caſe of <hi>Sydney</hi> and others, to whom the Judges freely and readily aſſigned Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel as to matter of Law, and own'd it to be their Right. But the buſineſs of our tender Judge was by any means whatſoever to caſt the Priſoner, and to make ſeveral new Preſidents in this one Man, nor durſt he truſt ſo plain a caſe with the meaneſt Lawyer: or that had been to expoſe their own Malice and Weakneſs, an<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:32650:9"/>
and whole Court would eaſily have ſeen through the Buſineſs; but as for the Priſoner himſelf they thought he might eaſily be dealt with, and the matter veiled; for either by the advantage of their skill in Law, or the awe of their Authority, ſuch a Perſon might be eaſily quelled, and therefore they peremptorily deny to him, what was (as the Learned in the Law tell me) never denied to any Man before, <hi>Councel as to matter of Law.</hi> Being thus ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly over-ruled, he was conſtrained to be his own <hi>Councel.</hi> A hard caſe, and a very diſcouraging part to plead Law againſt a Judg of Law, who improved his Art and Authority, againſt him to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, and appeared reſolutely bent to have his Blood right or wrong. Nevertheleſs not to be wanting to himſelf, he undertook that part, and made ſuch a Plea as ſtunn'd his Jury, and gave ſatisfaction to the whole Court, except ſuch as came thither with a reſolution to Murther him. The things which he principally inſiſted on, as to matter of Law, were three. 1. That Printing (though even that was not proved) was not Treaſon. 2. That the Crime laid to his charge came not within the purview of the 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. 3. That if it did, yet by the ſaid Statute he ought to be diſcharged; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there was not ſuch Witneſs againſt him as that Statute requires, and without which it condemns no Man. And theſe he proved fully and clearly by ſeveral caſes in Law, by ſeveral Authorities from that great Oracle of Law the Lork <hi>Coke,</hi> and from our plain Laws and Statutes themſelves, he argued from the Statute whereon he was indicted, that whereas that made two things Treaſon; <hi>Conſpiring the Death of the King, and Levying War.</hi> The Printer, who worked for hire, could not be guilty of this what-ever the Author might; and further that the Books contained nothing of ſuch matter, but the contrary, of which he produced an Inſtance full and plain; he alſo urged, that that Statute allows no conjectural Preſumptions, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, or ſtrains of Wit, but direct and manifeſt proof by, at leaſt, two Witneſſes, whereas there was not one againſt him, that ſpoke to the purpoſe, or any thing like it; he preſſed and explain'd
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:32650:9"/>
the Statue 1<hi>mo Marie,</hi> even to a demonſtration of his caſe. For whereas that Statute ſaith, <hi>no Act, Deed or Offence, ſhall be adjudged Treaſon, but ſuch as are declared and expreſſed to be ſuch by the</hi> 25 <hi>of</hi> Edw. 3. It is abſolutely impoſſible, that Printing ſhould be any ways declared or expreſſed in that Act, it not being known in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> till eight Kings Reigns after, and not long invented, before it travail'd hither. Any Man that had but a grain of Senſe, Reaſon, or Conſcience, would have thought this ſhould have ſtruck the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dead; but he ſtill urged further an Act of their own; and where Men will not ſo much as ſtand to their own Acts, happy are they who have nothing to do with ſuch. In the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, an Act was made to <hi>prevent abuſes in Printing,</hi> &amp;c. by which the Printer upon the firſt Offence is diſabled to follow his Trade for three years, and upon the ſecond diſabled for ever with Fine, Impriſonment, or other corporal Puniſhment not extending to Life or Limb; this is pretty ſevere, and yet a great way off Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; but this being in favour of that King was made only for his Life, and conſequently expired with him; but no longer ſince then the laſt Seſſions of Parliament was this very Act revived, and the <hi>preſent Government</hi> obtain'd it not without great Strugling: But to what purpoſe? Or I would fain know what favour was done it, if there were more effectual Remedies before? And I think it may be worth while for the Parliament when they ſit next to conſider for what reaſon they revived that Law, or whither it be to any pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe for them to make that or any other Law, if even whilſt they are freſh made, and in all Mens view and knowledge, a Judg ſhall dare openly not only to ſet them aſide, but to violate them, and judge contrary to them. But I ſhall trouble the Reader no further with his Plea, which had been here inſerted, but that ſome thought it would be too tedious, and not ſo proper for all ſorts of Perſons, as being fraught with much Latin and French, which he was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated to uſe as to the matters he cited. In ſhort, he acquitted himſelf ſo well, that all indifferent Perſons were abundantly ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:32650:10"/>
and yet it proved to no more purpoſe than a <hi>Wall-lecture.</hi> The reaſon is, the Tryal was only a piece of Pageantry, and the Man was condemned long before; but to over-rule this without more ado, had been a down-right Affront both to Law and Reaſon, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Mr. Judge muſt needs make a Flouriſh; and now a Man would expect, that he ſhould have gon through all the Caſes, Statutes, and Arguments uſed by the Priſoner, and fairly and fully confuted him; but I thank you, no ſuch matter; if the Man had but little Honeſty, yet he had more Wit; he warily leaves it all in the Lurch, and to put a blind upon the matter, makes a Bluſter with two or three old muſty impertinent Preſidents, which had not ſeen the Sun for many Ages, the chief of which was that of Sir <hi>John Oldcaſtle</hi> Lord <hi>Cobham,</hi> and he might as well have urged the Caſe of the <hi>Man in the Moon.</hi> For what was my Lord <hi>Cobham</hi>'s Caſe to Printing? That famous <hi>Wicklevite</hi> lived in the Reign of <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, ſome ſcores of years before Printing was thought on, which came not into <hi>England</hi> till the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh; and the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner had very well obſerved, That what is not expreſſed in the Statute 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. (and it is impoſſible Printing ſhould be expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed there) is barr'd from being any ways adjudged or interpreted Treaſon, by the Statute 1 <hi>mo Marie.</hi> In ſhort, in ſumming up the Evidence to the Jury, the Judg acted not the part of a Judg, but rather of a keen malitious Councel or Accuſer, and muſtered up all his Arts to inſnare and impoſe upon the Jury; he aggravated to the utmoſt every little Punctilio, which he thought might be any thing ſervicable to beget in the Jury an hard Opinion of the Priſoner; he could not let the Bed with Wheels alone, but whipt it up and down like a Top; he could not forbear bruſhing the poor Man's Night-gown; he rambled from St. <hi>James</hi>'s to <hi>Hoxton,</hi> and fetcht in every little Trifle with all the witty Malice imaginable; nay, if you will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him, he lookt into the very Soul of the Man, and told the Jury what was within him; he was an <hi>ill-minded Man,</hi> a <hi>diſaffected Perſon,</hi> he was <hi>no Lover of the Government</hi>; and in my Conſcience I
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:32650:10"/>
cannot tell how he ſhould, the Government had not uſed him to well, that he ſhould be paſſionately fond of it; but above all he took mighty Pains to beat it into their heads, That <hi>Printing was an Overt Act:</hi> But on the other hand, of there being two Witneſſes to the proving the Fact (alas, he knew there was not one) or of any thing the Priſoner had pleaded though plain and ſubſtantial Law, or of any thing that did make for the Priſoner, not a Word did he ſpeak; and when he had thus diſguiſed the buſineſs with all the skill he had, The Jury were ſent out to conſider of their Verdict.</p>
            <p>Whilſt the Jury were withdrawn all ſorts of People were big with Expectation, what would be the Iſſue of the buſineſs; many, who who were very well affected to the Government, thought he could not be found guilty, and do not ſtick to ſay ſtill, that he had very hard meaſure; nay, even <hi>Robin Stephens,</hi> who thirſted for his Blood, was fearful he would eſcape; for as he was paſſing along the Streets coming up to three Gentlemen, one of whom asked what they thought would become of Mr. <hi>Anderton, Stephen</hi>'s laying his hand on Mr. <hi>M—ſh</hi>'s Shoulder ſaid thus, <hi>The Rogue pleaded bravely, and I believes hopes he hath Friends among the Jury to get off; but if ſuch as he are acquitted, the Government muſt give us Orders to ſtob them whereever we find them.</hi> I think this is a faithful Servant of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment indeed, a Man who will go through ſtitch with his work; but then, my Dear Country-men! what would become of the Laws, if every Rogue ſhould have a Licenſe to murther whom he pleaſeth?</p>
            <p>After two hours debate the greater part of the Jury became very well inclined to have found <hi>Not Guilty</hi>; but there was a true Trojan amongſt them, one who loved Miſchief and the Government in his Soul; and he was for hanging Men for being <hi>Jacobites,</hi> not for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Guilty: and being ſince told of the ſeverity of their Verdict, he readily acknowledged, <hi>that the Evidence did not amount to the proof of the Fact, but,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>what of that? I believed he was guilty, and I will hang a hundred of them for half ſo much Evidence.</hi> A very
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:32650:11"/>
uſeful Man, and certainly deſerves a Pention, if he have not one already. When the Jury appeared, the Queſtion was asked, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were agreed of their Verdict? A zealous Man anſwered, No. Whereat the Court fround, and ſhew'd themſelves much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed, when the <hi>Fore-man</hi> of the Jury (who is a Man well affected to the Government, but withall a ſenſible Man, not malicious, and deſirous that all Men may have fair play for their Lives) put this Queſtion to the Bench, <hi>Whether the having thoſe things by him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making any further uſe of them, did affect the Priſoner as to Life?</hi> Now this Queſtion was very pertinent. For all that was proved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Priſoner, was that ſuch things were found there, and it ought to be taken notice of, that though the thing was call'd in Queſtion, yet it was not proved, that the Room, where the things were found, did belong to him; and there was a Perſon preſent in Court, and brought thither by means of <hi>Robin Stephens,</hi> who offered to make Oath, that the Room was hired by one <hi>Williams,</hi> and that the ſaid <hi>Williams</hi> had paid the laſt Quarters Rent for it; whereupon <hi>Stephens</hi> and others gave her very ill Names, and with great Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings drave her out of the Court, and both ſhe and her Husband have been ſomewhat ſcurvily uſed ſince. The Queſtion, though very proper, was nothing pleaſing; but after ſome frowning and pouting, <hi>Treby</hi> aroſe and anſwered, <hi>No.</hi> In which anſwer he plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledged, that all that was offered in proof againſt the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, did not affect him; but then he further ſaid, <hi>That was not their Buſineſs, they were to find it Printing, and that was a ſufficient Overt-Act.</hi> But then is Printing Treaſon? If ſo, then we have a Trade that is Treaſon, at which Men work every day, and are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by Law, which is not more ſevere againſt any thing, than Treaſon. But perhaps he will ſay, he meant <hi>the Printing theſe Books</hi>; but with his good leave, there was no ſuch thing proved, nay, not ſo much, as that he printed at all. And muſt a Jury find a matter of which no manner of Evidence at all is given? He might as well have bid them find it <hi>Conjuring,</hi> for any proof that was offered of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:32650:11"/>
it. But if the thing were ſuppoſed, yet I believe his Lordſhip is the firſt, that ever declared Printing as ſuch, to be an Overt-Act of Treaſon; and I ſhall leave it to the Learned in the Law to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, when they ſhall think fit, what Crime that is, and how to be puniſhed, when a Judg takes away a Man's Life by declaring that to be an Overt-Act of Treaſon, which the Law doth not ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
            <p>But I cannot omit it, as ſeeming to me a thing of ſad and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Conſideration, that when ſome of the Jury-men, as by way of complaint, ſaid thus. <hi>My lord, our Fore-man is of Opinion, this Fact is not proved.</hi> He preſently replied, <hi>Whether it be proved or no, you ought not to determine; the bare finding the Books in his Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody would not be Treaſon; but the caſe is, Gentlemen, here is a Man that has a Printing-Preſs, to which no Man has admiſſion but himſelf; and this Man is found with</hi> Errata <hi>and</hi> &amp;c. (not a tittle of all this proved) <hi>ſo that he muſt needs print the Treaſon.</hi> To this a pert Jury-man anſwered, <hi>'Tis a very ſtrong Preſumption, my Lord</hi>! And then Baron <hi>Powel</hi> clenched the Nail with this grave ſaying. <hi>A violent Preſumption is as much as if a Man had been there and done it himſelf.</hi> What bleſſed times are theſe? Would not a Man think, that <hi>Aſtrea</hi> were come down from Heaven again, and ſat in Court? For was ever ſuch brave Juſtice known? The Jury are <hi>ſworn</hi> to proceed <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Evidence,</hi> but the Judg tells them, <hi>they are not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine whether the thing be proved or no. i. e.</hi> They are brought thither to be forſworn, and to hang Men contrary to their Oath upon the bare <hi>Say-ſo</hi> of a Lying corrupt Judg. The Law ſays there ſhall be <hi>poſitive Evidence in caſe of Life,</hi> but a great Lawyer ſays, <hi>a violent Preſumption</hi> is the ſame thing. In plain terms, (Country-men) this is not to <hi>murther</hi> a ſingle Man, but to <hi>murther the Laws</hi>; and the moſt innocent Engliſh-man breathing has no ſecurity of his Life againſt a <hi>preſuming</hi> Judg.</p>
            <p>Theſe Anſwers, or rather Shams, being returned to the Queſtions, after ſome other ill Words, and ill Looks, the Jury were ſent back
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:32650:12"/>
again, where almoſt three hours more were ſpent in debating the matter before they could come to a Concluſion, and then part complied, rather tired and frighted than convinced; The laſt, who came in, was the Foreman; and it is beſitting the times, for the head to follow the tail; nor were they Arguments, but Terrours, which ſhock'd his Judgment, and brought him off at the laſt; ſome of his fellow Jury-men uſed him rudely, gave him very ill Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and threatned him high with the Government, and thus all being awed into a Compliance, away they come with their wicked, but to the Court welcome, Verdict, and bring in the Priſoner <hi>Guilty.</hi> And now the Judg, to ſhew how acceptable it was to him, falls a ſtroaking the Jury; and endeavours to make them ſome amends for the hard words he had given them before, telling them, <hi>That they had done like honeſt and good Men, and had brought in a Verdict agreable to their Evidence.</hi> The moſt impudent Lye that ever was ſpoke from a Bench; for there was not one tittle of Evidence ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as to his <hi>Compoſing, Printing, or Publiſhing,</hi> which was the Crime laid to his Charge in the Indictment. But the Foreman, when he came to have the liberty of his thoughts, was not pleaſed with what was done; and that he might prevent the miſchief, what in him lay, he did declare his diſſatisfaction, and that alſo was made known, and at another time, had been enough to have ſtaid Judgment: But they had gained their wicked Point, and would not depart from it; Sentence according to courſe was put off to the laſt day of the Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, in the mean time the Priſoner, that he might either ſave his Life, or leave thoſe who ſought his Blood without excuſe, had a Petition drawn and delivered, which is as followeth.

                           <p>THat whereas your Petitioner has been by the Jury found Guilty of Printing the Books laid in the Indictment, and thereby is concluded from Queſtioning the Legal Evidence they had for it, though your Petitioner humbly appeals to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips Obſervations and Conſciences, whether all that was ſworn came up to more, than bare circumſtantial Evidence, of his bare Printing them; which in Caſes of Treaſon, as your Petitioner is informed, has never been allowed. And whereas your Petitioner was adviſed, That bare Printing theſe Books (admitting the ſame proved) could not by the Laws be conſtrued as an Overt-Act of Treaſon in the bare Printer; And your Petitioner requeſted the Court again and again, That this matter might be argued by his Counſel, which the Court were pleaſed not to permit. Your Petitioner yet notwithſtanding, not doubting of your Lordſhips Inclinations, not only to do him all Juſtice, but to ſhew him all the Mercy and Favour you can that may conſiſt with your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips Juſtice; and humbly conceiving, That this Court, by fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſidering your Petitioner's Caſe, may, even yet, be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Relieving your Petitioner, eſpecially, if upon hearing what your Petitioner can ſay, your Lordſhips ſhall be ſatisfied, That your Petitioner hapned to be Convicted through any Errour or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, (as no Man was ever exempt from Errour, and the beſt of Men are always readieſt to confeſs it) Your Petitioner therefore humbly beſeecheth your Lordſhip's Patience ſeriouſly to read and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:32650:13"/>
conſider ſome few (of many) Reaſons which your Petitioner hath heard from others, which he herein has ſet down as briefly as he can as followeth.) Firſt, They lay down, That the Treaſon laid in the Indictment, being that Of the intent of the heart, (expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Statute by Compaſſing and Imagining the King's Death) requires by Law Two Proofs, The one of the Fact, the other of the Inference, and that both theſe muſt be plain; That of Fact called the Overt-Act) muſt be proved by direct and poſitive Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, by Two Witneſſes at leaſt, and not by Circumſtantials only (as this of Printing was againſt your Petitioner, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no poſitive Proof at all, not ſo much as by One Witneſs given of his Printing either of the Books laid in the Indictment.) And then, that of Fact being thus proved, muſt by neceſſity of Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence as evidently and certainly prove, That the Party in doing ſuch Overt-Act could intend or imagine thereby nothing leſs than the King's Death; And if either of theſe Proofs fall ſhort of ſuch neceſſary Certainty ſuch Indictment muſt fail, the Law, for great Reaſons, regarding only ſuch plain and direct Proofs in theſe great Charges.</p>
                           <p>Now can a Printer, <hi>Quatenus</hi> only the Printer of theſe Books, be thereby inferred to Aſſent to and Approve of the matters and things contain'd in theſe Books, and that neceſſarily too, <hi>Quatenus</hi> the Printer? By the ſame Legal Logick every Printer may be proved to have in his heart and approve of all the Opinions, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Imaginations contained in all the Books he ever Printed: For, a <hi>Quatenus ad omne valet Conſequentia.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>'Tis true (ſay They) Writing and Speaking have, in ſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, been accounted as Overt-Acts, and there might be good Reaſon for it, as a Man expreſſing his own Mind by his own Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and by his own Words, which, according to the manner of his Writing or Speaking, may evidently appear to come from his Own heart; And your Petitioner doth not doubt but that the Writing a Book, as in Cardinal <hi>Pool</hi>'s Caſe, and the Signing the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:32650:13"/>
Warrant for the Execution of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, as in the Caſe of the Regicides, which Caſes were urged by ſome of the Court againſt your Petitioner, were ſufficient Overt-Acts, to prove the Compaſſing and Imagining the King's Death. But can theſe Inſtances be any thing to the Caſe of a Printer? whoſe buſineſs it is, as a Printer only, to print the Thoughts of Others, being accounted in Law only as a meer Mechanick, and whoſe end thereby is to get Money for his Work. And for further reaſon in this matter, they obſerve, That as it doth not appear that bare Printing was ever pretended to be an Overt-Act within Stat. 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. ſo when the Parliament of 13 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. carried up Treaſon to the higheſt, for the Preſervation of the King's Perſon during his Life, and (among other things) particularly therein took notice of Printing, yet would they not thereby lay ſo great a Penalty upon the Printers, as, no doubt, conſidering the unreaſonableneſs of Compriſing ſuch Tools and Mechanicks within an Act intended for Perſons of higher Deſigns: But this Parliament kept the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in their Remembrance, as intending to conſider them by themſelves in another Act, as they very ſoon after did; for the very ſame Parliament in 13 and 14 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. make an Act which they ſtile, <hi>An Act for preventing Abuſes in Printing Seditious, Treaſonable, and Unlicenſed Books and Pamphlets, and for regulating Printing and Preſſes</hi>; and therein, as they fix them their Rules and Bounds, ſo they allot them their Puniſhment: Which, for the firſt Offence, is Diſability for three years; and for the ſecond, perpetual Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability, Fine, Impriſonment, or other corporal Puniſhment at Diſcretion.</p>
                           <p>Wherefore, the Premiſes throughly weighed and conſidered, your Petitioner humbly implores your Lordſhips, That, in favour of Life, in a new and extraordinary Caſe, and That too, of Treaſon, your Lordſhips would be pleaſed to extend ſo much Mercy to your Petitioner as to ſuſpend your Judgment and pronouncing Sentence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

            <p>Here is no need of a Comment; this Petition ſpeaks for it ſelf, and doubtleſs will continue to ſpeak to their everlaſting Shame, who anſwered it only with Neglect and Scorn. When the laſt day of the Seſſions came, and the Priſoner was asked in courſe what he had to ſay, why Sentence ſhould not be paſſed upon him? He deſired that his Petition might be read; but the Court not being willing to take notice of the knowledge of any ſuch Petition, thereby to elude his Requeſt, he foreſeeing it, had provided one ready, and offered it to be read, but no Man daring to take and read it, he took the freedom to read it himſelf, and then offered theſe things further in Arreſt of Judgment, which he drew up by way of Queries.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Whether if a Jury not being competent Judges of the matter of Fact whereof they are to judge, and bring in their Verdict againſt the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent contrary to Law; I ſay, whether Judgment ought to paſs upon the Defendent becauſe of that Verdict?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Whether if a Judg, (who is Counſel for the Defendent, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore indiſpenſibly bound to take particular Cognizance of what the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent urgeth in his own behalf, as well as what is alledged againſt him) in ſumming up the Evidence, doth omit (out of forgetfulneſs or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe) the only material Point upon which the whole Indictment is founded, and which the Defendent ſo much urged in his own behalf; and alſo which inevitably led the Jury into this Miſtake of their Verdict; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I ſay, this be not ſufficient to ſtay Judgment?</hi>

            <p n="3">3. <hi>Whether any Judg,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>can conſtrue</hi> Printing <hi>to be a</hi> ſufficient Overt-Act, <hi>till it be ſo declared by Parliament?</hi>

               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:32650:14"/>Theſe Queries, and this Petition, will ſome time or other be thought conſiderable; and the rather for that the Priſoner did make it his <hi>humble and laſt Requeſt, That theſe things being matter of Law, he might be allowed Counſel to plead them, or any other matter of Law in his Caſe.</hi> And he backt his Requeſt with this modeſt Reaſon; <hi>That being matter of Law, he thought the ſatisfaction of the Judg's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience concerned in it, as well as his Life; but if his Counſel could be ſatisfied or fairly over-ruled in it, he would acquieſce without more ado.</hi> The matter now lay wholly before the <hi>City Recorder Salathiel Lovel</hi>; and ſome Perſons perhaps will wonder how the ſoppiſh Tool could ſo eaſily get over theſe matters; but he is mounted into a Station above himſelf, and now thinks himſelf above all Senſe, Reaſon or Law: Thus much he knew, that his buſineſs was to doom the Man to die, not to expoſe the matter by diſputing the Caſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore after a flouriſh or two of Empty Rhetorick, he in a bravery proceeds to pronounce that dreadful Sentence, which the Law allots to Treaſon; which is not barely death, but to have the heart and bowels torn out and burnt, and the body diſmemb'red, and the Quarters ſet up or diſpoſed as Authority orders. Thus Innocence falls before the Guilty; and it is the Triumph of a hardned Sinner to waſh his hands in blood.</p>
            <p>Whilſt Mr. <hi>Anderton</hi> was preparing for his Death, his Friends were ſtruggling for his Life: he had many Friends upon the account of his known ability, induſtry, and integrity; others were taken with his manly behaviour, and clear pleading upon his Tryal; and others were more forward to move in his Caſe in pity or indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation at his Lawleſs uſage. Thoſe who were concern'd in it, might have obſerved the activity and zeal of charitable and pitiful Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, the fair and open dealing of ſome generous Noble Perſons, the pretty Fetches and Tricks of little Courtiers to hook in a prize, but above all the Artifices of a Council in declining what was before-hand reſolved ſhould not be granted. The Queen (as ſtill upon occaſion it was anſwered) could do nothing without the Council,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:32650:15"/>
nor the Council without the Queen; if the Council was met, the Queen was not there, or if ſhe was there, there wanted ſuch and ſuch of the Council, without whom nothing could be done; and thus things at every turn were ſhuffled off: but where the danger is imminent, and time ſhort, Perſons are willing to watch hard and look out ſharp; taking this courſe his diſconſolate Wiſe had at laſt ſo fairly ſet the Council, that it was thought they could not avoid giving her a direct Anſwer; for though they were reſolved he ſhould not live, yet (the matter being ſo warmly debated amongſt all ſorts of Perſons) they were not willing to ſay peremptorily he ſhould die: To put her by now, this Artifice ſerved effectually; a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Waiters attending about the Council Chamber fell foul upon the poor Woman, in no very courtly Language, reproaching and reviling her, That ſhe did not bring her Husband to Confeſſion: In ſhort, they ſo teazed and plagued her, that they drove her away, and an old Hag followed her, perſecuting her, and all that came near her as Friends, with ſuch vehement and bitter Language, that they were forced to quit the place. But of theſe things there is a worthy pious Gentlewoman, who never ſpares any pains to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote a work of Charity or Mercy, can give a better account than I; and they being too long to be inſerted here, with her, and to her careful Obſervation, I leave them. It did at laſt plainly appear, that the reaſon of <hi>Caiaphas</hi> prevailed, <hi>It was expedient one ſhould die.</hi> (Pardon the Expreſſion, for the very Words were uſed,) and therefore no matter whether the Law was ſtrained, or not; they had caught a Man whom they thought fit ſhould die, if not for his Crimes, yet for Example: And thus we have bravely ſecured our Lives, Liberties and Eſtates, when men are hanged for Reaſons of State, not for Offences againſt Law.</p>
            <p>I now draw near to his laſt <hi>Exit,</hi> only I crave leave to premiſe a very ſhort account of his Life. Mr. <hi>Will. Anderton</hi> was born at <hi>Wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi> in <hi>Yorkſhire, Sept.</hi> 29. 1663. his Father's Name was alſo <hi>William Anderton,</hi> an eminent Clothier in that Town, his Mothers <hi>Elizabeth,</hi>

the Daughter of Mr. <hi>Maximilian Topham,</hi> ſhe is yet living, a Woman of a Maſculine Spirit, yet as pious as couragious: for though in this Man ſhe loſt the Son both of her love and ſupport, (for ſhe is fallen into poverty) and would readily have given her own life in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change to have ſaved his, yet ſhe bore it with ſuch a Chriſtian Magnanimity, that ſhe did not ſtick to ſay, That <hi>ſhe thanked God, that he had ſingled out one of her Children to dye in ſo good a Cauſe.</hi> He was brought up in the Grammar-School there, till he was fit for the Univerſity, for which he was deſigned by his Father, whoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire was to have made him a Clergy-man; but he, conſidering with himſelf, that ſince his Father's death, by many Loſſes and Croſſes, the Eſtate had been very much impaired, and that there were others beſide himſelf to be brought up, and diſpoſed of in the World, ſo that a tolerable Univerſity-maintenance could not be allowed him without cruſhing his Mother, and Brother and Siſters, he reſolved to betake himſelf to a Trade. When his School-maſter heard of this, he was extreamly troubled; for he looked on him as a Boy of as great hopes as any he had taught; and to divert him from his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, did promiſe and undertake, that amongſt his Friends and Acquaintance he would procure him a Maintenance, but the Boy being unwilling to depend on ſuch Uncertainties made haſte away up to <hi>London,</hi> in the year 1679. where he was unfortunately bound Apprentice to one <hi>Thomas Snowden</hi> a Printer, and withal a furious Bigotted Fanatick; who uſing to pray (after his faſhion) every Night in his Family, never failed in one part of his Prayer to blother out moſt malitious Invectives and venomous Imprecations againſt the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and its Members, eſpecially the Clergy. His new Apprentice, who had been bred by his Loyal Parents in the Doctrine and Practice of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> could not endure this; but when his Maſter fell to praying backwards, would get up on his Feet, and manifeſtly ſhew his diſlike. At firſt his Maſter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved him, and thought to have perſwaded him with Argument, but at that weapon the Apprentice was too hard for him, which
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:32650:16"/>
made his angry Maſter have recourſe to the <hi>Argumentum bacilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> thinking he would at leaſt be able to cudgel his young Man into Fanaticiſm: But ſtill as often as the Maſter came to the mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious part of his Prayers, ſo often the Apprentice aroſe, though he was as often beaten for it; till in the end his Maſter perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his immoveable Reſolution, and knowing that he could not ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie his own Proceedings, gave him leave to pray his own way, and to go to Church: but withall bore him ſuch an eternal grudge for it, that he laid hold on all Advantages imaginable to uſe him ill; and by the ſilly Oath he made againſt him at the Tryal, any man would think, it ſtuck by him ſtill. Such doings made the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentice ſo very uneaſie, that about half of his Time being ſerved, after complaint made to the Chamberlain, he was turned over to one <hi>Miles Fletcher,</hi> with whom he lived very comfortably the reſt of his time, he reſpecting and faithfully ſerving his Maſter, and his Maſter entirely loving his Apprentice. It is a Trade wherein ſome excel in one part, and ſome in another; but Mr. <hi>Anderton</hi> had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to that perfection in it, that ſeveral skilful Perſons now give him the Character, that <hi>take him for all parts of his Trade together, he hath ſcarce left his Fellow behind him in</hi> England. When this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Revolution was brought about, wherein Men in the face of Heaven forſoook and renounced thoſe Principles which before they had valued themſelves upon, againſt and above all the World; our Sufferer choſe the better, not the ſtronger ſide, adhereing to the <hi>Orthodox</hi> not the <hi>Apoſtate</hi> Church of <hi>England,</hi> and being for <hi>True</hi> not <hi>Sham-Loyalty,</hi> which became the occaſion of his glorious though untimely end.</p>
            <p>From the time of his Commitment to the very moment of his Death he was of a very even and ſweet behaviour, being modeſtly couragious, chearful without Lightneſs, and devout without Oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. He made it his particular Requeſt, that ſome Miniſter or Miniſters would be with him every Morning and Evening to read the Prayers of the Church, and perform ſuch other Offices as in
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:32650:16"/>
ſuch caſe as his did belong to that Function, which except one day in the Week was duly obſerved, and ſometimes oftner; for when any Clergy came accidentally to viſit him, if they did neglect to offer, he commonly requeſted them to pray with him. He gave little or no entertainment to any hopes of Life, as being ſenſible that it was rather Malice than Matter againſt him; and that a Crime may be pardoned, but Malice is not to be ſatisfied without the deſtruction of its Enemy, if he once come in its Power. He often expreſs'd a great Satisfaction in the Cauſe for which he ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; ſaying, <hi>that it miniſtred to him both Comfort and Courage, and that he doubted not but that God would acquit whom the Court had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</hi> As to the Ordinary, he indeed in point of Conſcience re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to communicate with him, yet mildly and modeſtly telling him that he was deſirous to give him no Trouble, and requeſted of him that he would not any ways concern himſelf with him or about him; at which Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> fell into ſuch an unſeemly intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate fit of Rage, that he reviled the Priſoner with bitter Words, and very generouſly damned both him and all the Miniſters that came at him to Hell: but he took it patiently, and returned not the leaſt Word that might ſeem to ſound harſhly. As his Wife once laid her hand on his Fetters and wept; he intreated her to forbear, ſaying, <hi>he was leſs than a Man that could not bear that, but that her Tears were more grievous to him than his Fetters</hi>: Another time as he was hanging a Link on the Chair thereby to eaſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſomewhat from the weight of his Fetters, and perceiving his Wife to look very heavily at it, he ſaid chearfully to her, <hi>My Dear, theſe are my Arms</hi> alluding to the Arms of their Family, being Sable, two ſingle Shack-bolts, and one-double Argent, which if the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks will give me leave) I take to be very honourable bearing, as being originally given to ſuch, who having behaved themſelves va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantly in the <hi>Holy Wars,</hi> yet had the Misfortune to be for ſome time made Priſoners by the Infidels; or to ſuch who did either by their Proweſs fetch off, or by their Charity redeem ſuch Priſoners.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:32650:17"/>
But it would be endleſs to inſiſt on theſe ſmall Matters, I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore haſten to the great and laſt Act of this ſad Tragedy. When <hi>Tucker</hi> told him that the <hi>Dead Warrant</hi> was come, and that he was in it; he gave him thanks for giving him notice of it, that he might be ſure he had now nothing elſe to do, but to prepare to dye; ſaying further, <hi>The Lord's Will be done.</hi> He received the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sacrament twice during his Impriſonment; but whether it be cuſtomary, or that they had particular Order, the Keeepers all (except <hi>Walker,</hi> who was all along not only civil, but even com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate towards the Priſoner) the Evening and Morning before he ſuffered became exceeding rugged and harſh not only to him, but to all that came to him; inſomuch that his Mother and Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther coming that Morning to receive the Communion with him could neither beg nor buy admiſſion; and the poor old Woman was forced to depart without joyning in the laſt Act of Chriſtian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him, or ſo much as taking her intended laſt Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel of him; which looks as if ſome Perſons took a pride in Baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Cruelty, and ſtudiouſly ſet themſelves to add to the ſorrows of the afflicted. Other very unbecoming Actions towards him I could mention, which I ſhall forbear, being unwilling to ſet forth that Barbarity which ſome delight to act. When he was brought down to go to the place of Execution, he entred into the Sledge, and rode along in it with that calm Behaviour and decent Courage, as ſtroke the Beholders with remorſe and amazement, and made his Enemies gnaſh their Teeth with Indignation, to ſee him triumph over their Malice even in his Death. In his Paſſage all the way the People rather ſeem'd ſorrowful, than inclinable to offer any Abuſe, except near S. <hi>Giles</hi>'s Church, where a rude fellow treated him with very ſpiteful Language, to which he made no return, but lifting up his eyes to Heaven, ſaid, <hi>O ſweet Jeſus! how much more haſt thou ſuffered for me and for Mankind? and ſhall not I learn of thee patiently to bear the undeſerv'd Reproaches of this inconſiderate Man?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As he was coming up to the Place of Execution, a Clergy-man,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:32650:17"/>
got up into the Cart to be ready to receive him; at which the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ſeemed to be much incenſed; for he gave him very ill Words, bidding him <hi>get him down,</hi> and ſaying, <hi>he ought not be there, nor ſhould he be ſuffered</hi>; The Miniſter replyed little, but ſtayed ſtill, till (ſee how one ill Nature helps another) Major <hi>Richardſon</hi> came up, and with Threatnings and his Cane lifted up forced him to come down, who immediately thereupon applied himſelf to the Sheriffs (for by this time they were come up) when ſome ill Perſon ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted that he was a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> to which the Priſoner preſently anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Mr. Sheriff, upon the Words of a dying Man he is not, but a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of the Church of</hi> England. I mention this purpoſely that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may take notice what ill uſe is made of the Words <hi>Papiſt</hi> and <hi>Popery</hi>; and how neceſſary it is that they were better underſtood: for to be called a Papiſt is dangerous, but to be one or to teach the worſt of Popiſh Doctrines is advantageous; heretofore <hi>the Power of Depoſing Kings</hi> and <hi>Equivocation, either as to Oaths, Promiſes, or any Tranſactings</hi> were accounted <hi>Popiſh Doctrines,</hi> and thoſe who own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them were univerſally condemned; but now you have thoſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Doctrines in every Pulpit in the Town, and the Perſons by all applauded. What prepoſterous Doings are theſe, to hate the Name and love the Thing? to knock an honeſt Man o'th' head, for being maliciouſly and falſely called a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> and to admire him for a Saint who really acts upon Popiſh Principles, whilſt he raiſeth theſe Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals, and rails againſt Popery? whether may not People be led, who will ſuffer themſelves to be thus deluded? <hi>I pray God open their eyes, that they may ſee the things that belong to their Peace, before they be hid from their eyes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Due to return to our Buſineſs, the <hi>Ordinary</hi> made all the oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he could; but the Sheriff granted the Priſoner's Requeſt, bidding the <hi>Ordinary</hi> hold his Peace, and ſaying it was a thing never deny'd to a dying Man. Being in the Cart, and alſo the Priſoner's Brother, he uſed an Office which ſeemed to be collected out of ſeveral Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the Common-Prayer Book, with ſuch ſmall Alterations as
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:32650:18"/>
might ſerve to adapt them to the preſent Occaſion; being ſince asked the Reaſon, he ſaid that he did it both for the Authority of the thing, and alſo to avoid any Cavils that might be made at, or any Snares that might be laid for, any of his own Conceptions. But But when he came to mention the Creed he put theſe particular Queſtions to the Priſoner. <hi>Do you believe theſe Articles which you are now about to rehearſe with me, to contain that Faith which hath all along been received by the Church of Chriſt? and particularly by the Church of</hi> England? <hi>and is this the Faith wherein you die, and wherein you hope for Salvation</hi>? The Priſoner making Anſwer, <hi>I do ſo believe, and am now ready to die in that Faith, and in that Faith hope for Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Then ſaid the Miniſter, if ſo, ſay after me: Then they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated the Creed, raiſing their Voices ſomewhat higher than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary; after that the Miniſter asked him ſeveral Queſtions concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Repentance, his Charity, his endeavours o<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Reſtitution for any Wrongs by him done his forgiving of others any Wrongs done to him, and the like. And then, at the earneſt Requeſt of the dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Man he denounced the Abſolution, then proceeding to divers other Prayers they concluded with that Sentence in the Office for the Burial of the Dead: <hi>O holy and merciful Saviour, thou muſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Judge eternal, ſuffer me not at my haſt hour for any pains of Death to fall from thee.</hi> This being over, the Miniſter (whether that he could not endure to ſee the Man die, or that he would not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with the <hi>Ordinary,</hi> or for ſome other Reaſon beſt known to himſelf,) after he had particularly embraced Mr. <hi>Anderton,</hi> fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently recommended his Soul to God, and taken his laſt Farewel of him, went down out of the Cart: The Sheriffs civilly command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a way to be made, and were readily obeyed, he paſſing through the Crowd, not only with eaſe but reſpect. During the time the Priſoner was at his private Devotions, an Order came to remit the Quartering of his Body, which being by ſome thought a Reprieve, it was handed to him, and having read it, and finding it no more, he returned it, ſaying, <hi>I thank you Mr. Sheriff, the Will of the Lord
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:32650:18"/>
be done.</hi> Having leave from the Sheriffs to ſpeak his mind if he had any thing to ſay to the People; he began to ſpeak, but being troubleſomely interrupted by the Ordinary, and alſo finding he could not be heard, he deſired a Speech he had prepared might be taken out of his Pocket and given to the Sheriffs, to be by them Printed, or Diſpoſed as they thought fit, which hath been ſince Printed, and is as followeth:

                     <p>Liberty and Property hath for ſome years made an hideous Cry in theſe Kingdoms, and nothing more than the Rights and Privileges of the Subject is the Pretence of our preſent Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verers; and doubtleſs it was for the ſake of theſe that ſo many of my inſatuated and blind Countrymen rebell'd againſt their Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and Injur'd Monarch, whilſt Religion (Rebellions Umbrage) was made the Covert of the hidden Deſigns of thoſe who have now demonſtratively ſhewn, that they ſought nothing leſs than our Ruin: And that theſe were only Pretences to gain their ends, the very blind, although they cannot ſee, yet muſt certainly feel it. Under the like Pretences do our Deliverers ſtill continue to deliver us even from what they pleaſe, that they think will but in the leaſt help to effect what they came for: Under the Notion of the neceſſity of a War, they deliver us from our Mony, and from our Traffick and Commerce, by which ſo great a part of the Kingdom is ſuſtained: Under the Notion of carrying it on, they kidnap our young Men, the Flower of our Kingdom, and directly contrary to Law tranſport them; and to ſave their own Foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers put them in them firſt Onſets of their Battles, as the Heathens did the Chriſtians of old, that their Enemies Swords might be blunted with killing them, before they came to encounter them: They exhauſt all our Stores both for Sea and Land, and carry away all our Artillery; and if any Man ſeem but to diſapprove of theſe their Proceedings under the Notion of Law they mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

him: Nay, if they do but ſo much as ſuppoſe him not to be on their ſide, he muſt be a Traitor, and no matter what the Law ſays, they ſay he ſhall die.</p>
                     <p>Can any thing be more plain to demonſtrate this than my preſent Caſe? My ſuppoſed Crime was Printing, and all that the Witneſſes could perſonally ſay againſt me, was, That I was a Man againſt the Government, and had called the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> Hook-noſe, though I proteſt I never did; not one of them could ſay, nor did they offer to ſay, that I ever printed the Books of which they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe me, or procured them to be printed, or publiſhed any of them, or that the Materials were mine, or that I hired the Room where they were found; but I was an ill Man, and that was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient: By which 'tis plain, that they were reſolved right or wrong to have my Life.</p>
                     <p>That they deſigned not to <hi>Try</hi> but to <hi>Convict</hi> me is as plain; for they refuſed poſitively to allow me Counſel to ſuch Matters of Law, as was never refuſed to any before; and though I cauſed ſeveral Statutes to be read, ſome to prove that there muſt be two Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes at leaſt to the Fact; others, that though there had been two, as there was not one, yet poſitively declared that it was not Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: Nay, the very laſt Seſſion of Parliament was it enacted, That the Printer of Seditious and Treaſonable Books ſhould for the <hi>firſt</hi> Offence be puniſhed no otherwiſe than not to follow his Trade for three years, and for the <hi>ſecond</hi> Offence never to follow it more, and ſuch farther Puniſhment as ſeemed fit to the Court, <hi>not exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Life or Limb.</hi> Now though mine (had it been proved) had but been the <hi>firſt,</hi> yet you ſee contrary and in direct oppoſition to the Law, they make it High Treaſon: And when the Jury could not agree to find me Guilty, and came down to ask the Court, Whether the finding theſe Things there, and ſuppoſing them to be mine, ſince it could not be prov'd that I printed theſe Books, or had made any uſe of them, could affect my Life? I ſay, when the Jury asked this Queſtion, and the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Treby</hi> told
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:32650:19"/>
them poſitively, <hi>No, it did not</hi>; yet withal he told them, <hi>That that was not their Buſineſs, their Buſineſs was to find me Guilty of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting:</hi> And while they ſtayed, the Court frown'd upon them to that degree, that the Foreman told them, he was not to be frighted; upon which they publickly reviled them, calling them, <hi>ill Men, ill Subjects, and a Pack of Knaves</hi>; and ſo terrified them into a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance. That this is true, thoſe who were near know too well, although the partial Writer of the Tryals hath moſt perfidiouſly publiſhed not only an unfair, imperfect, and lame Account, but hath alſo ſtuff'd it with down-right Untruths and Falſhoods, and left out whatſoever made for me; not ſo much as mentioning the Contradictions of the Witneſſes in what they did ſwear, their ſwearing to ſome things that made for me, and when I took hold of them they denied them, nor hath he in the leaſt told the World of the Judg's over-ruling whatſoever I offered, without giving any other Anſwer than that <hi>it ſhould be ſo becauſe they would have it ſo</hi>; with many other ſuch things, which the conſcientious Auditors can teſtify.</p>
                     <p>And now I pray conſider where is this Liberty and Property? where the Rights and Privileges of the Subject? Nay, where the very Laws themſelves? And conſequently where is the Security of any Man? Why, even in the Deliverers Pockets, where your Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is, and where alſo without all doubt, if you look not well to your ſelves, your Eſtates e're long will be likewiſe. What are the Proceedings but Arbitrary in a ſuperlative Manner, and ſuch as no Reign ever produced before? Theſe were they you were hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore only afraid of, being jealous without juſt Cauſe; but now you ſee them actually come upon you. I hope you your ſelves will put a ſtop to them, by laying theſe Proceedings before the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, for had it been Sitting at this preſent theſe Proceedings durſt not have been practiſed; and I pray God to put ſo ſpeedy an end to them, that as I am the firſt, ſo I may be the laſt that may ſuffer by them.</p>

            <p>Several ſorts of Men have their ſeveral Objections againſt this poor Man's Speech, which he wrote the day before he dyed, between the hours of Eight and One, being fourteen times interrupted in the Writing of it, and forced to convey a Copy of it through a Key<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hole to a Friend, leaſt it ſhould be taken from him. Some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, That <hi>he did not pray for the Queen</hi>; but theſe ſurely forget what Man they have to do with. Formerly in ſuch caſes Men uſed to pray for their King; and when they were acquitteed uſed to ſay,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:32650:20"/>
               <hi>God bleſs the King,</hi> without any further Notice of other Perſons, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs there were particular Reaſon for it: But ſince a <hi>joint Regency</hi> hath been ſet up, it hath followed in courſe that they pray'd for the King and Queen; but he was a Man who would not countenance this, or take any Notice of it, and therefore uſed the old form and way, not caring who excepted againſt it. But if any Honourers of their Queen by miſtake except theſe, they may know, that he honoured her as much as they; and doubtleſs ſhe will believe no leſs of him, who prayed ſo heartily for the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> the Son of her Womb, his Majeſties care, and all their good Subjects hopes.</p>
            <p>Others alledge, that it hath too much Levity in it for the Speech of a dying Man, and for that reaſon quarrel with the word <hi>Kidnap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping</hi> in it, and that is the very term now by all uſed, and by which all Men expreſs and underſtand the Fact ſignified by it; and he that would ſpeak to be underſtood by all, ſhould ſpeak in the Language uſed by all: when Words are new and freſh, they carry along with them ſomewhat of the lightneſs, quaintneſs, or other particular Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour or Quality of the firſt Deviſer, but when they are once ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated and naturalized by uſe, that Humour is loſt, and they become in ſome meaſure neceſſary; and he that will find fault with a Man for ſpeaking as other Men do, perhaps will find in the End, that more will find fault with him.</p>
            <p>On the quite contrary, there are others who are as much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with the Sharpneſs and Severity of it; ſo difficult a matter it is to pleaſe all Palats. But this is only in that part of his Speech, where his ſubject matter plainly engaged him to ſpeak ſomewhat af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that manner; and therefore the Objectors ought to conſider, that there are ſome things in their own Nature ſo harſh and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful, that a Man cannot mention them without ſeeming to grate or bite; but then how Evil and Severe are thoſe things themſelves? And if a Man muſt neceſſarily ſpeak of ſuch Matters, they ought to lay the blame on the things, which extort from a Man ſuch ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of Language, not on the Man, who ſpeaks properly and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:32650:21"/>
to the nature of the things, which was always eſteemed a Virtue and Commendation. Some Perſons can find fault with the Excellencies of a Man, as I remember it was one Objection againſt Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi>'s Paper, that he <hi>reaſoned too logically</hi>: the ſame Crime I am apt to think will never be objected to him, who pick'd the quarrel. Were any of theſe ſmooth Men to ſuffer in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with ſuch kind of Juſtice as Mr. <hi>Anderton</hi> had, perhaps it might ſet their Tongues and Pens on edge to ſpeak and write as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Truth as he did.</p>
            <p>There are others, who employ time, which might be better ſpent in ſeeking or making Exceptions againſt this brave Man; But I will leave them with <hi>Trinculo</hi> to mutiny by themſelves; I wiſh all of them had ſeen him and converſed with him in the time of his Confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; they then would rather have admired him, than diſparaged him; a Man upon whom the Terrours of Death made no Impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; no Man that came to him could ever diſcover any the leaſt ſign of fear, or perturbation of Mind in him, but found him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in the ſame ſweet even temper, excepting only in his Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Exerciſes of Religion, wherein he was very fervent and vehement, as powring out all his Soul to his God. To carp and cavil is no hard matter, but to die is not ſo very eaſie; and I hope I ſhall be thought to make no ill Wiſh, if I wiſh that thoſe who are ſo ready to cenſure, may be able to make as brave and as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian an End, as this poor Man did, who is perſecuted both living and dead.</p>
            <p>During the time that the <hi>Ordinary</hi> buſied himſelf, he was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved not to mind him, but to imploy himſelf in his private De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions, and after the Delivery of his Speech to the Sheriffs, his Cap pulled over his Eyes ready for Execution, he prayed thus; <q>Moſt great and moſt merciful Lord God! do thou look down upon me thy poor unworthy Servant in this hour of my great extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and have Mercy upon me. Sweet Jeſus, receive my Soul into thine everlaſting Kingdom, for into thy hands do I commend

my Spirit, becauſe thou haſt redeemed it, O Lord God of Truth! Come Lord Jeſus, and receive my pretious Soul, Father of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy have mercy upon me; O God the Son, Redeemer of the World, have mercy upon me; Lord, comfort and ſupport my Soul in theſe my laſt Minutes, come ſweet Jeſus, come quickly, and ſave me ſweet Jeſus by thy moſt pretious Blood, by thy Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and bloody Sweat, and by the coming of the Holy Ghoſt, O Lord, do thou deliver me.</q> Here the <hi>Ordinary</hi> put in ſaying, you muſt give a ſign when you are ready; whereupon the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs charged him not to interrupt them; and as he was proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Siſter deſired to ſpeak to him, which was granted; who kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him and weeping over him ſaid, <hi>be of good comfort though there is no Pardon for you here yet there is above.</hi> So when they had taken a Chriſtian leave of each other, he returned to his Devotions, when after a ſhort pathetical Prayer conſtantly calling upon his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour the Cart drove away. His Body was conveyed to a Houſe near, till the dusk of the Evening, and then brought to Town, both for quietneſs ſake and to prevent giving Offence; but as privately as it was done, that Blood-hound <hi>Stephens</hi> purſu'd him dead, and was obſerved to walk ſeveral times by the Houſe, and to give notice to the Mob; ſo that he who was deſigned to have been ſtollen to his Grave by a few Friends late in the night, was follow'd by a very numerous Train, but without any manner of Incivility, and now lies interr'd in little S. <hi>Bartholomew</hi>'s Church-yard, expecting a joyful Reſurrection, and the coming of the righteous Judge, before whom <hi>William</hi> and <hi>Mary, Anderton</hi> and <hi>Treby</hi> ſhall appear without any other difference or reſpect, than what their Sins or their Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues ſhall make; and from whom they ſhall receive according to what they have done in the fleſh, be it good or evil.</p>
