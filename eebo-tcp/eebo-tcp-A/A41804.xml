            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An Appeal of Murther from certain unju≈øt Judges, lately ≈øitting at the <hi>Old Baily,</hi> to the righteous Judge of Heaven and Earth; and to all ≈øen≈øible Engli≈øh-men, containing a Relation of the Tryal, Behaviour, and Death of Mr. <hi>William Anderton,</hi> Executed <hi>June 16. 1693.</hi> at Tyburn, for pretended High-Trea≈øon.</head>
            <p>WEre all Men truly Good, publick Laws would be of little or no u≈øe. For all political Laws are the <hi>good Daughter</hi> of a <hi>bad Mother,</hi> as being preventionally or occa≈øionally the Off-≈øpring of ill Manners; but without them there is no Living in any Comfort or Security: hence all civilized Nations have ever gloried in their Laws, as their Honour and Safety, and heretofore none more than the <hi>Engli≈øh,</hi> and perhaps none with greater rea≈øon; for it may be a difficult Task for a well-read Hi≈øtorian to find out a Kingdom under the Cope of Heaven, where the Lives, Liberties, and Properties of Subjects are more cautiou≈øly and critically ≈øecured; but e≈øpecially in ca≈øe of <hi>Life</hi> (the Foundation of all humane Ble≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øings) wherein no Conjectures or Pre≈øumptions are allowed, but the Law requires at lea≈øt two credible and po≈øitive Witne≈ø≈øes, and if any thing be doubtful or controverted, always judgeth in <hi>favorem vite,</hi> and makes even the <hi>Judg</hi> him≈øelf of <hi>Councel</hi> to the <hi>Pri≈øoner,</hi> that he may by no means mi≈øcarry through any Error, Ignorance, Pa≈ø≈øion, or Inadvertency. But after all, the Law is a dead Letter, and cannot execute it ≈øelf; and when it ≈øo happens, that the Laws, which were made again≈øt <hi>Offences,</hi> are ≈øeized by the <hi>Offenders,</hi> and turned again≈øt tho≈øe whom they were de≈øigned to protect, the Sins of any Nation can ≈øcarce draw upon them a more heavy Cur≈øe and Judgment: For then the Sheep are daily dragg'd to tryal before the Wolf, and nothing but Villany is maintain'd, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged,

and promoted; and an hone≈øt Man had a thou≈øand times better fall into the hands of a <hi>Confederacy</hi> of <hi>High-way-men,</hi> who will rob and di≈øpatch him with ≈øome kind of Genero≈øity, than under the clutches of a <hi>corrupt Mini≈øter of Law,</hi> who after a ≈øwinging mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification in a na≈øty Pri≈øon, ≈øhall at length in a great deal of ≈øtate, with mighty formality, and tedious ceremony, proudly doom him to death, and all under colour and pretence of tho≈øe Laws, which, if they could ≈øpeak for them≈øelves, would <hi>acquit the Pri≈øoner and hang the Judge</hi>; and whether the following ca≈øe be not a fre≈øh and lamentable In≈øtance of ≈øomething too like this, I ≈øhall leave wholly to the Readers Judgment, after an impartial Peru≈øal.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>William Anderton</hi> knowing him≈øelf to be mortally, though caule≈øly hated, by ≈øome Per≈øons, had ab≈øconded of late for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øiderable time, as it has been the hard fortune of divers great and good Men to do in the≈øe difficult times; but being by a parcel of fal≈øe Villains betrayed to Mr. <hi>Robert Stephens,</hi> Me≈ø≈øenger of the Pre≈øs, and his ≈øworn Enemy, he was apprehended on the ≈øecond of <hi>May</hi> this pre≈øent 1693. and <hi>Stephens</hi> (who≈øe Malice much out-weighs his Brains) not content with his Per≈øon, plainly plundered the Hou≈øe, carrying away Goods to a con≈øiderable Value, which there was no colour of Law for him or any Man el≈øe to ≈øeize; and this I ≈øuppo≈øe might be one great motive, to make him ≈øwear ≈øo de≈øperately at the Tryal, that he might take away a Man's Life, who otherwi≈øe might come upon him for Robbing him of his Goods; the Booty ≈øecured, away he goes, in triumph with his Pri≈øoner, to my Lord Chief Ju≈øtice <hi>Holt,</hi> where he railed again≈øt him in a very indecent manner; the Judge was very calm, and ≈øaid very little to the matter, but, upon the accu≈øation, committed Mr. <hi>Anderton</hi> to <hi>Newgate,</hi> not for <hi>High Trea≈øon</hi> as is fal≈øely alledged, by that Lying Pamphleteer, <hi>licen≈øed according to Order,</hi> who publi≈øhed that mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Account of his <hi>Conver≈øation, Behaviour and Execution</hi> which was cryed about Streets immediately after his death; That Judge knew the Law better, and I believe is not in him≈øelf ≈øo very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:32650:2"/>
to over≈øtrain it. Whil≈øt he thus ≈øtood committed for Mi≈øde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour, he was bailable; and accordingly very ≈øufficient Bail was offered for him; but <hi>Aaron Smith,</hi> who wi≈øely weighs what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage is to be made of every Pri≈øoner, and con≈øiders not only the Per≈øon him≈øelf, but the Intere≈øt he is engaged in, and the Friends he may be ≈øuppo≈øed to have, thought too few Guineas were offered; and therefore ≈øtill kept off the Bail endeavouring to make a better Market; but while things hung thus between the <hi>Bail</hi> and the <hi>Bail-ma≈øter,</hi> on a ≈øuddain the Controver≈øy was ended by the coming of a fre≈øh <hi>Warrant</hi> upon the former, which committed the Pri≈øoner for <hi>High Trea≈øon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This way of Proceeding being ≈øomewhat unu≈øual gave occa≈øion to divers Cen≈øures; ≈øome ≈øaid, <hi>it was only a Trick to prevent his being bayled:</hi> others ≈øaid, <hi>that the Fact, though never ≈øo fully proved, could not amount to High Trea≈øon, and that they could not touch his Life; and that they had hereby done him a Kindne≈øs, becau≈øe upon his Tryal he would be di≈øcharged without any further Impri≈øonment or Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Puni≈øhment:</hi> But the≈øe, I ≈øuppo≈øe, were more conver≈øant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Lawyers than the Politicians, and could better tell what ought to be done, than what ≈øome Men were contriving to do. Others judg'd this <hi>fre≈øh Commitment to be the re≈øult of new Councels, and a plain Evidence, that they had taken new Mea≈øures; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did hence conclude, that he was thought a Per≈øon not only dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, but fit to make an Example, and that therefore it was re≈øolved he ≈øhould be hanged right or wrong:</hi> And the Event proved the≈øe to be in the right.</p>
            <p>Now ≈øuch illegal Proceedings and bloody Councels very ill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes tho≈øe who complained of ≈ømaller Failings in others, and have turned all things up≈øide down under a pretence to mend Matters and reform Abu≈øes; but there is nothing more ≈øanguina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, than a pretending <hi>State-Reformer</hi>; nothing more cruel and ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage, than a <hi>Moderation-Man</hi> got into Power. But the≈øe doings being naturally ≈øo odious to Engli≈øh men, I hope they will con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:32650:3"/>
that the difference is not great, whether they be hanged with <hi>Popi≈øh</hi> or <hi>Prote≈øtant</hi> Halters; and will ≈øee at la≈øt, that they have a very ill ≈øecurity for their Lives, Liberties, and Properties, when tho≈øe who take upon them to guard them from Popery, become more Lawle≈øs and Cruel than Papi≈øts. There were indeed ≈øome even in the Councel who did di≈ølike the≈øe Proceedings: but others prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; and it would not be forgotten, that there is a certain ≈øly <hi>plump Divine,</hi> who perhaps is as good at <hi>Hocus Pocus</hi> Tricks, as any Man in <hi>Europe</hi>; he can cut a Man's Throat ≈øo neatly, that he ≈øhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver know who hurt him; he will put at his plea≈øure all into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu≈øion and hurry, make Men ≈øo mad that they know not where they are, nor care what Mi≈øchief they do; and all the while, as if he had <hi>Gyges</hi>'s Ring, ≈øhall walk invi≈øible, and ≈øhall not be ≈øo much as ≈øu≈øpected to have had any hand in the matter: To this Crafts-Ma≈øter <hi>Robin Stephens</hi> made ha≈øte over the Water to ≈øet forth his great Services, and to receive ample Prai≈øes, if not a Reward. But his Expectation was ≈øadly baulk'd; for the Oracle fell foul up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, telling him, <hi>that now he was threatened to be turn'd out of his Place he could find the≈øe Men, and that it might ju≈øtly be thought that he had been confederate with them all this while, and fal≈øe to the Government; and that if he did not give better Te≈øtimony of his good affection to the Government, and that he was an Enemy to ≈øuch kind of Men, he might lo≈øe his Place for all this.</hi> Now all this is only an U≈øe of In≈øtruction to a Me≈ø≈øenger who was malicious enough of him≈øelf; for the plain Engli≈øh of it is this; <hi>'Tis true you have taken a Printer, but what of that? For unle≈øs you go through with your Work, and ≈øwear him out of his Life, you do the Government no Service, and had as good have done nothing at all:</hi> Guilt is ever mercile≈øs and bloody, a Man is got into the head of a Schi≈øm, has ≈øeiz'd on <hi>N<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

the King</hi>; now the Pri≈øoner was of a Trade that told Tales, and the wicked <hi>Mufty</hi> ≈øtrongly pre≈øum'd that this was the Man, who had not only often refre≈øh'd his Memory with the mention of his Guilt, but did give him ≈øome di≈øturbance in the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of his ill-gotten Goods, and therefore he was unpardonable, ≈øuch a Man he could not endure ≈øhould live. But though he knows not how to forgive, yet I heartily wi≈øh he may repent, that God may for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give him, le≈øt he find Hell a more difficult place to get out of than of late he imagin'd.</p>
            <p>I ≈øhall pa≈øs by ≈øeveral Circum≈øtances, which perhaps ≈øome would think material, that I may avoid Tediou≈øne≈øs and come to the Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al it≈øelf, which was begun on <hi>Thur≈øday June</hi> 1, but re≈øpited till <hi>Saturday</hi> following, that this bloody Scene might be acted with the greater Solemnity. The Court being ≈øet, ≈øeveral appeared on the Bench, but his real and effectual Judg was <hi>Treby,</hi> one of the old Republican ≈øtrain, and as fit a Per≈øon as could have been pickt out for ≈øuch a murderous De≈øign; this Man being <hi>Recorder</hi> of the City of <hi>London,</hi> when the Lord <hi>Ru≈ø≈øel</hi> was condemned for <hi>High Trea≈øon,</hi> and by his place being to pa≈øs Sentence upon him did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare him≈øelf exceedingly troubled in mind and mightily di≈ø≈øatisfy'd becau≈øe there was only one po≈øitive Witne≈øs, and other circum≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Evidence again≈øt his Lord≈øhip, and not two po≈øitive Evidences to the ≈øame fact, as he ≈øaid the Law required: But ≈øee how mens Con≈øciences can face about, when their Malice is to be gratified; he could now brow-beat, revile, and in effect <hi>force a Jury</hi> to bring in a Verdict of <hi>High Trea≈øon,</hi> when there was not one po≈øitive Evidence to any matter of fact, nor indeed any Evidence at all, that could directly affect the Pri≈øoner as to the matter in his Indictment. The Lord deliver me and all hone≈øt Men from <hi>Trebyan Ju≈øtice.

            <p>Mr. <hi>Anderton</hi> made it his Reque≈øt, that he might have a Copy of his Indictment, but it would not be granted; and indeed ≈øo great Care was taken, and ≈øo ≈øtrict a Charge given, that neither before nor after his Tryal could any Copy be obtained, ≈øo long as he lived; whether it may be had now I know not. The Crime laid to his Charge was the <hi>Compo≈øing, Printing and Publi≈øhing two Malicious Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øonable Libels:</hi> The fir≈øt intituled, <hi>Remarks upon the pre≈øent Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, and late Revolution in England</hi>; The ≈øecond, <hi>a French Conque≈øt neither de≈øirable nor practicable.</hi> As to the later of the≈øe it is now certainly known, that he had no hand in it, and that it was Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at a Pre≈øs which he never ≈øaw, and by Per≈øons with whom for a long time he had no Communication: and it mu≈øt be allowed to be a rea≈øonable Suppo≈øal, that his Judge knew this at the time of his Tryal. For the Government had at that time in their cu≈øtody tho≈øe Per≈øons, who knew when and where it was Printed (and as it was ≈øaid) had made a Di≈øcovery of all<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> perhaps of more than they knew: The Papers of that ≈øort taken upon the Pri≈øoner were ≈øent to him the day before he was ≈øeized; and ≈øome have a vehement ≈øu≈øpicion, that it being re≈øolved he ≈øhould be taken the next day, tho≈øe Pamphlets were ≈øent before hand that ≈øomething might cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be found upon him: But his Innocence in that Matter hath ≈øince been made evident to all the World by an irrefragable Te≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; for this <hi>September</hi> Se≈ø≈øions at the <hi>Old Baily, Price</hi> in open Court made Oath, that he and the Pri≈øoners then at the Bar, <hi>Newbolt</hi> and <hi>Butler,</hi> Printed the <hi>French Conque≈øt.</hi> This was both a Surpri≈øe and a Choak-pear to ≈øome there, and a murmuring noi≈øe ran through the Court, whil≈øt ≈øome whi≈øper'd, <hi>And was</hi> Anderton <hi>then hanged for that which othes have done?</hi> And the <hi>Attorney General,</hi> a Man who need not be taught to ≈øpeak, was ≈øtruck dumb and look'd blank, I ≈øuppo≈øe in anger and indignation that he ≈øhould be
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:32650:4"/>
impos'd upon to accu≈øe a Man of a thing for which he lo≈øt his Life; and the ≈øame Man in the ≈øame Court proved innocent. For this I do think of him that he would not knowingly pro≈øecute a fal≈øe Accu≈øation again≈øt an innocent Man, tho this is more than I would ≈øay of the Judge.</p>
            <p>Upon the Tryal the principal Evidence again≈øt the Pri≈øoner was <hi>Robin Stephens</hi> the Me≈ø≈øenger: Now all Courts of Judicature u≈øe to have a particular regard to the Credibility of the Witne≈ø≈øes, and not to throw away any mans Life upon the Te≈øtimony of infamous malicious Per≈øons; and ≈øuch as care not what they ≈øwear. Now the Man is yet living to bear witne≈øs of it again≈øt whom <hi>Robin Stephens</hi> in Malice made Oath before a <hi>Ju≈øtice of the Peace,</hi> that he was a bu≈øie, trouble≈øome <hi>Di≈ø≈øenter,</hi> came not to his Pari≈øh-Church, nor had received the Sacrament there, for the ≈øpace of Twelve Months then la≈øt pa≈øt, and the Gentleman being brought before the <hi>Ju≈øtice of Peace</hi> to ≈øatisfy the Law in that ca≈øe, he gave ≈øuch convincing Evidence to the ≈øaid <hi>Ju≈øtice</hi> that he was a con≈øtant Churchman, and for Eleven of the ≈øaid Twelve Months had received the Sacrament at his own Pari≈øh-Church, that the <hi>Ju≈øtice</hi> gave him his Warrant to take up <hi>Stephens for making a fal≈øe Oath</hi>; and the Warrant he late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had to produce, and I believe hath ≈øtill. But what a rare Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low this is for hone≈øt Mens Lives to depend on, you ≈øhall farther perceive by the Te≈øtimony he gave upon the Tryal.</p>
            <p>One thing whereof Mr. <hi>Stephens</hi> made Oath was, that at the time of Mr. <hi>Anderton</hi>'s Apprehen≈øion, he did in Words di≈øown the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and call'd K. <hi>W. Hook no≈øe,</hi> not ≈øubmitting him≈øelf. Now as to the Words this is ab≈øolutely fal≈øe; for ≈øome ≈øcuffle there was but not a Word ≈øpoken. Mr. <hi>Anderton</hi> in the time of his Health and Liberty was a Man of Integrity, and ≈øo far from being given to Lying, that he particularly hated a Lyar, and ≈øuch a Per≈øon no one can think would per≈øi≈øt in a needle≈øs Lye at his Death; and to the very la≈øt he denyed the ≈øpeaking any ≈øuch Words; but for a further Evidence he told to ≈øeveral Per≈øons the very rea≈øon of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:32650:5"/>
his Silence. For he ≈øaid he knew <hi>Robin Stephens</hi> to be <hi>≈øhort-≈øighted,</hi> but withal that he knew his Voice, and that while he did not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcover him≈øelf by ≈øpeaking, he was in ≈øome hope to give him the ≈ølip. But if <hi>Robin Stephens</hi> be plea≈øed a little better to recollect him≈øelf, he may then perhaps remember that another Per≈øon about three days before that time had ≈øaid ≈øuch Words to him; but he ought to have a care how he transfers Matters from one Man to another; for that is the way not only to condemn the innocent, but to acquit the guilty: But after all, ≈øuppo≈øe it true, that he had ≈øpoken that unhand≈øome Word; a <hi>di≈øre≈øpectful Term</hi> it might be, but Trea≈øon it was not, neither was it any thing to his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment; and why then ≈øhould a Judge make ≈øuch a bu≈øtle about it, and exerci≈øe his Wit thence to prove the Pri≈øoner di≈øaffected to the Government? What hath a Judge to do with a Man's Affections? If a Jury will be prevail'd on to find a man guilty of High Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon for ≈øaying a Man has a <hi>Hook-no≈øe,</hi> who really has a <hi>Hook-no≈øe,</hi> they will hang a Man for ≈øpeaking truth; and that is an ill Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try for an hone≈øt Man to live in.</p>
            <p>Another part of Mr. <hi>Stephens</hi>'s Evidence was, that he there took an old Trunk fill'd with Papers and Pamphlets, and that he had ≈øeen the ≈øaid Trunk formerly, and knew it to be Mr. <hi>Anderton</hi>'s, and le≈øt the poor old Trunk ≈øhould not be ≈øufficiently taken notice of, it is put into the Ordinary's Paper, and al≈øo into that which was cry'd about on the day of his Execution. Now the Rea≈øon of Swearing to the Knowledge of the Trunk was, becau≈øe it was not found in any of the Rooms that could be proved to belong to Mr. <hi>Anderton</hi>: But if <hi>Robin Stephens</hi> had never ≈øeen that Trunk be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, then he mu≈øt make a fal≈øe Oath in ≈øwearing that he had ≈øeen it before, and that he knew it to belong to Mr. <hi>Anderton</hi>: and indeed he had never ≈øeen that Trunk before, nor did it belong to Mr. <hi>Anderton.</hi> For I can name the Gentlewoman to whom the Trunk did belong; and in who≈øe con≈øtant u≈øe it hath been for the≈øe Ten years la≈øt pa≈øt and upwards, in who≈øe hou≈øe <hi>Robin Stephens</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:32650:5"/>
never was that ≈øhe can tell, nor doth ≈øhe ≈øo much as know him; and ≈øome Weeks before Mr. <hi>Anderton</hi>'s Apprehen≈øion ≈øhe innocent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lent the ≈øaid Trunk to a Per≈øon who ≈øaid ≈øhe had occa≈øion for ≈øuch a thing for a little time, and did expect it to have been return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but now ≈øhe mu≈øt lo≈øe her Trunk, and dare not own it, le≈øt ≈øhe ≈øhould bring her≈øelf into a great deal of Trouble for doing a common neighbourly Kindne≈øs.</p>
            <p>But the Evidence which was principally relyed on, and which ≈øeemed mo≈øt ≈øtrongly to affect the Pri≈øoner, was the matter of the Desk, as to which <hi>Robert Stephens</hi> made Oath, <hi>that he took out of the ≈øaid Desk</hi> 40 <hi>or</hi> 50 <hi>of a ≈øort of the Remarks and French Conque≈øts.</hi> Now herein lay the great Ma≈øter-piece of <hi>Robin Stephens</hi>'s Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany, for he had ≈øeen the Desk formerly, and might well remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and ≈øwear to the knowledge of it, and moreover the Desk was taken in a room, which was owned to belong to Mr. <hi>Anderton</hi>; but all this comes ≈øhort; for it is no Trea≈øon to have a Desk, yea even a notoriou≈øly known Desk; and therefore to do the Feat it was requi≈øite, that ≈øome Books ≈øhould be found in that Desk, and then it would be rea≈øonably ≈øuppo≈øed, that the Books did belong to the Owner of it; though this is no infallible Rea≈øoning. For Mens Books, Moneys, and other Commodities, are often laid up in other Mens Desks; every thing is not a Man's own, which he has in Po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øe≈ø≈øion. But the truth is, there was not ≈øo much as one of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks</hi> or <hi>French Conque≈øts</hi> in the ≈øaid Desk; and if after Mr. <hi>Anderton</hi> was apprehended, <hi>Robin Stephens</hi> or any of his Gang did ≈øteal the ≈øaid Desk, and put ≈øuch trea≈øonable Papers into it, I would ask of any indifferent Per≈øon, Whether he, or they, or Mr. <hi>Anderton</hi> ought to be hanged for it? I could name the Per≈øon who hath more than once told me, that when-ever he could appear with ≈øafety, he would be ready to make Oath, That about an hour before Mr. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derton</hi> was ≈øeized he had occa≈øion to look for ≈øomething in the ≈øaid Desk; and that at that time there was nothing in it, but two Quires of clean white Paper, and ≈øome bound Books (<hi>i.e.</hi> ≈øuch as the Bible,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:32650:6"/>
Common Prayer-Book, Whole Duty of Man, and Books commonly u≈øed in Families) and not any ≈øtitcht Books, and that he was with Mr. <hi>Anderton</hi> to the very minute that he was taken, and is as ≈øure, as it is po≈ø≈øible for Man to be, that neither he nor any other did put any ≈øuch Books into the ≈øaid Desk from the time he had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion to ≈øearch it, to the time of Mr. <hi>Anderton</hi>'s apprehen≈øion, for which he gives many convincing matters in evidence, too long to be here in≈øerted. He had no occa≈øion to ≈øpeak of this till after the Tryal; for he could not fore≈øee ≈øuch a malitious Contrivance, nor know before-hand what <hi>Stephens</hi> would ≈øwear; or if he had, he dur≈øt not appear to give Evidence, le≈øt he him≈øelf ≈øhould fall under the ≈øame ≈øate; but it is well known, that the Pri≈øoner peremptorily denied any ≈øuch Books to have been there, though he own'd the Desk; and he u≈øed an Argument to convince the Bench of the truth of what he ≈øaid, drawn from the very Evidence given again≈øt him, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Desk was ≈ømall and not able to contain half ≈øo many Books, as were ≈øworn to be taken out of it; and for proof hereof de≈øired that the Desk might be brought into the Court for the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and all others Satisfaction: But his righteous Judge would not allow it, but ≈øhuffled off the matter, ≈øaying, That the Number of Books <hi>was only matter of ≈øuppo≈øal.</hi> But then is Blood with him ≈øo cheap, and can he be ≈øatisfied in Con≈øcience to hang a Man for a <hi>Suppo≈øal,</hi> and that <hi>Suppo≈øal fal≈øe</hi>; and ≈øuch a <hi>Suppo≈øal,</hi> that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf dur≈øt not ≈øuffer to be examined, le≈øt it ≈øhould have made it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, that their <hi>grand Evidence</hi> was a perjured Rogue? This was the only piece of Evidence that did in the lea≈øt ≈øeem to affect the Pri≈øoner; and therefore ought to have been fairly and fully canva≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed, and not ≈øo lightly huddled and ≈øham'd over; all the other Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence was nothing to the purpo≈øe; and if even this had been true, it could not have ca≈øt him. For the having Books in a Desk is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Compo≈ø≈øing, Printing, nor Publi≈øhing,</hi> which is the Crime charged in the Indictment.</p>
            <p>The ≈øub≈øtance of the afore≈øaid Te≈øtimony concerning the Books

being taken out of the Desk was ≈øeconded by the Evidence of <hi>Hooper</hi> Beadle of the Hall, and the <hi>Con≈øtable</hi> and his <hi>Beadle.</hi> Now though the Fal≈øhood of the thing is already made manife≈øt, yet I ≈øhall retain ≈øome Charity for the≈øe Per≈øons, till I find cau≈øe to the contrary; becau≈øe it is very probable, that they might be deceived. For if <hi>Stephens,</hi> or any Agent of his, in the time of the huddle, and removal of things, did put ≈øuch Books into the Desk, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards examine it before the ≈øaid <hi>Con≈øtable</hi> and <hi>Beadles,</hi> they might ignorantly ≈øwear to his Contrivance; and they might truly ≈øay ≈øuch Books were <hi>taken out of the Desk,</hi> and not know that <hi>Stephens</hi> and not Mr. <hi>Anderton</hi> put them in. But there is one thing, which ≈øhews them to be too loo≈øe and heedle≈øs in the matter of an Oath, in that they alledged ≈øo many of the <hi>French Conque≈øts</hi> to be there, when it is certain there was not the fourth part of ≈øo many in the hou≈øe, which (as I have already told you) were ≈øent him the day before, and which the Government it ≈øelf now (if it did not then) well knows were not Printed by him. And yet after all this mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude they were content to fall to one of each, that they might be particularly ≈øworn to; and when Mr. <hi>Con≈øtable</hi> was asked, how he knew tho≈øe to be the Books, and was de≈øired by the Pri≈øoner to read the Titles of tho≈øe Books whereof he accu≈øed him, truly it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, that the learned Gentleman had been bred to no ≈øuch dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous things as Writing or Reading. Now could a more unque≈øtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Witne≈øs have been produced to printed Books, and their Titles, than a Man that cannot read? But for a help at a dead lift, it was ≈øaid that he had made <hi>his private Mark</hi> on the ≈øaid Books; but then it ought to be con≈øidered. That his <hi>private Mark</hi> was made to the two Books at the Lord Chief Ju≈øtice <hi>Holt</hi>'s Chamber, which <hi>Robin Stephens</hi> produced out of his Pocket, when the Pri≈øoner was brought to be examined. Now what did his Mark ≈øet on two Books at the Lord Chief Ju≈øtice's Chamber, which were all the while before in another Man's Cu≈øtody, ≈øignify to prove that tho≈øe were the Books, which were about four hours before taken out of a Desk in <hi>S. James</hi>'s?
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:32650:7"/>
               <hi>Robin Stephens</hi> might have produced what Books he plea≈øed, and in all likelihood this Man would have ≈øet his <hi>private Mark</hi> on them; but if he would have been ≈øure, he ought to have ≈øet his <hi>private Mark</hi> at the time of their being taken out of the Desk; but if there were not villanous Treachery in the ca≈øe, there was no ≈øuch Book to be <hi>marked.</hi> Would any Judge, who had either a Grain of Sen≈øe or Con≈øcience, hang a Man upon ≈øuch Evidence as this?</p>
            <p>I ≈øuppo≈øe it is for a blind, that <hi>Stephens</hi> ≈øwore, <hi>that coming to the Door (i. e. Scudamore</hi>'s) <hi>and asking what Lodgers they had, turning his head a≈øide, he ≈øaw the Pri≈øoner's Mother in the Yard, who crying out Murther, the Pri≈øoner came out of the Hou≈øe, and fell upon him.</hi> For I cannot imagine what ≈øhould make him ≈øwear ≈øuch a needle≈øs Lye, unle≈øs it were to cover the Treachery, whereby the Pri≈øoner was betray'd, and to bear the World in hand, that he accidentally di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered him by e≈øpying his Mother. For his Mother was not in the Yard, but in the common Room, which they u≈øed for their Kitchen; and <hi>Stephens</hi> came into the Yard, and directly to the Door, which by chance at that time was bolted; and when he could not by force get in (for the Pri≈øoner's Wife and Mother ≈øpying him out at the Window would not open the Door) he took down a pane of Gla≈øs, and was ≈øtriving to come in that way, whereupon they opened the Door, and at the out-cry of his Mother and Wife in that Room, the Pri≈øoner Mr. <hi>Anderton</hi> came upon him, who had e≈øcaped the <hi>Buzzard,</hi> had it not been for the ≈øtrong Guard he had ≈øet.</p>
            <p>This piece of Evidence al≈øo admirably well agrees with another, <hi>That he ≈øaw him ≈øhoving up a Bed, which ran upon Wheels.</hi> Now the Bed ≈øtood in a Room, from which you mu≈øt come thorough two Doors into the Yard. In ≈øhort, Mr. <hi>Anderton</hi> did not ≈øhove up the Bed, nor was he fir≈øt ≈øeen to <hi>Stephens</hi> at this time of his apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion, either in that Room, or in the Yard, but in their Kitchen or common Room lying between both. And indeed as to this matter the Pri≈øoner convinced him of the Fal≈øhood of it in the open Court;
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:32650:7"/>
but however it was taken no notice of. The Witne≈øs mu≈øt not be di≈øparaged or di≈øcouraged, though ≈øome Men will be apt to wonder at his Wit, how he could contrive to for≈øwear him≈øelf in ≈øo many particulars.</p>
            <p>Be≈øides <hi>Stephens, the Con≈øtable and the Beadles,</hi> there were al≈øo two Printers ≈øworn, <hi>viz. Roberts</hi> and <hi>Snowden,</hi> the Sub≈øtance of who≈øe Evidence was, <hi>That they had ≈øeen the Characters in the Hall, together with the</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and that they did believe it was the Letter that Printed that Book, (i. e.</hi> the Book then ≈øhewed in Court) <hi>as al≈øo that the two Books were Printed with one and the ≈øame Letter or Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</hi> Now if this Evidence be true, it ought to have acquitted him; if it be fal≈øe, it ought not to have hurt him. For the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment well knows where and by whom one of the Books was printed, and that it was not Printed by Mr. <hi>Anderton,</hi> nor had he any manner of hand in it, or any communication at that time with tho≈øe Printers; and if both the Books were printed with the ≈øame Letter or Character, then I think it is a pretty fair and clear Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, That he printed neither of the ≈øaid Books, and con≈øequently ought upon this Evidence to have been di≈øcharged. But be the matter true or fal≈øe, what ≈øignifies <hi>believing</hi> in this ca≈øe? Is one Man to be hanged for anothers <hi>believing?</hi> Malice is put to its ≈øhifts, when without any colour of Legal Evidence it is forced to <hi>believe</hi> a Man out of his Life. But if ≈øuch Evidence as this ≈øhall be looked on as good and ≈øatisfactory in matter of Life, I think the whole So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of Printers are deeply concerned in it, and that they are all in very dangerous Circum≈øtances; for I am a≈ø≈øured by a very under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding Printer, that there is not a Printing-hou≈øe in Town, but hath of the ≈øame ≈øort of Letter or Character, ≈øo that upon ≈øuch an Oath as this, any or all the Printers of the Town might have been taken, and whom they thought fit hanged. For there is none of them but had Characters as ≈øuitable to the Book, as that which was ≈øworn to; and if it had been ≈øeized, and thus ≈øworn to, they were as lyable to be hanged as <hi>Anderton.</hi> At this rate the Government
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:32650:8"/>
need not give them≈øelves the charge of a Me≈ø≈øenger of the Pre≈øs, nor the trouble of ≈øuch frequent Searches; but as ≈øoon as any Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious or Trea≈øonable Pamphlet comes abroad, it is but going to the next Printers and ≈øeizing his Letter, and having found ≈øome of the ≈øame ≈øort of Character, to get a couple of Rattle-headed Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows to ≈øwear to it, and hang him; and thus they may pick and chu≈øe what Printers they plea≈øe to hang. Was ever ≈øuch a wi≈øe Oath made by two Printers? but <hi>Snowden</hi> was made choi≈øe of, for his notoriou≈øly known Malice again≈øt the Pri≈øoner, and no doubt but his Fellow was endued with ≈øome excellent Quality or other.</p>
            <p>There was brought in another Witne≈øs, who made Oath, that about three Quarters of a year before, he had ≈øold the Pri≈øoner Paper by the Name of <hi>William≈øon.</hi> Now what is the Crime of buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Paper? The <hi>Stationers</hi> would have an ill Trade, if every Man ≈øhould make him≈øelf a Traytor, who becomes a Cu≈øtomer to any of them. Whatever they conjectured, no body offered to prove, that he made any ill u≈øe of his Paper; and then if he had bought half the Paper in the Town, I know not what harm had been in it, provided that he had hone≈øtly paid for it. What need was there to have troubled ≈øuch a Witne≈øs as this? There can ≈øcarce be thought any other Rea≈øon, but that they were re≈øolved to run a Man down with noi≈øe and number, again≈øt whom they wanted ≈øufficient Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
            <p>Thus I have examined the Witne≈ø≈øes, and I do not know that I have omitted any thing material ≈øpoken by them; their bu≈øine≈øs was to fix the Pre≈øs, Letter, and Pamphlets upon the Pri≈øoner, to prove he worked there, but particularly, that he printed the two Books laid in the Indictment; which if their Evidence did not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to, it ≈øignified nothing. Now if a Man carefully con≈øider the whole Evidence in relation hereto, he will plainly perceive, that it was either fal≈øe, incon≈øi≈øtent, or impertinent, and after all no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpo≈øe. For he ≈øtood indicted for <hi>Compo≈øing, Printing, and Publi≈øhing</hi> two particular Pamphlets, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Remarks</hi> and <hi>

Conque≈øt.</hi> I ≈øuppo≈øe they them≈øelves did not think him the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øer, that word was put in for Formality's ≈øake; but however if they did, there was no offer in the lea≈øt to prove it; nor was there any proof, that he printed both, or either of the Books laid in the Indictment, or any other Book, or that he printed at all; nor was it proved, that he publi≈øhed the ≈øaid Books, or any other Books; nay, there was not the lea≈øt thing, that looked like an Evidence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards any one of the≈øe things; ≈øo that there was not one tittle of his Indictment proved. Let us now ≈øee what art this reverend Judg could u≈øe to condemn him? For any Man who had known the Laws of <hi>England</hi> would have thought he had been ≈øafe enough.</p>
            <p>The Pri≈øoner with a great deal of calmne≈øs and clearne≈øs had all along made appear the in≈øufficiency of the Evidence; but the Judg, he as much crys it up, ≈øtrains all his Rhetorick to ≈øet glo≈ø≈øes upon it, over-rules all, and though for Fa≈øhion-≈øake he leave it to the Jury, yet he per≈øwades them, that they could not but ≈øee in it, what no body el≈øe could: and now like a Knavi≈øh Di≈øputant, who begs the the Que≈øtion, he takes for granted, that the matter of Fact was proved, though the contrary was as clear as Noon-day. But then from this fal≈øe Suppo≈øition of the proof of matter of Fact, there aro≈øe matter of Law, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether Printing were Trea≈øon? And in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øequence hereof, Whether it were within the purview of the Statute of the 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3? As to this, the Pri≈øoner de≈øired he might have the benefit of <hi>Councel,</hi> and pleaded his Right to it, urging not only the Privilege of every Engli≈øh-man, but that it was the Practice of all our Courts of Ju≈øtice, and that no Man was denied Councel where any matter of Law aro≈øe, and in≈øtanced in the ca≈øe of <hi>Sydney</hi> and others, to whom the Judges freely and readily a≈ø≈øigned Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel as to matter of Law, and own'd it to be their Right.

and whole Court would ea≈øily have ≈øeen through the Bu≈øine≈øs; but as for the Pri≈øoner him≈øelf they thought he might ea≈øily be dealt with, and the matter veiled; for either by the advantage of their skill in Law, or the awe of their Authority, ≈øuch a Per≈øon might be ea≈øily quelled, and therefore they peremptorily deny to him, what was (as the Learned in the Law tell me) never denied to any Man before, <hi>Councel as to matter of Law.</hi> Being thus ≈øhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øly over-ruled, he was con≈øtrained to be his own <hi>Councel.</hi> A hard ca≈øe, and a very di≈øcouraging part to plead Law again≈øt a Judg of Law, who improved his Art and Authority, again≈øt him to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt, and appeared re≈øolutely bent to have his Blood right or wrong. Neverthele≈øs not to be wanting to him≈øelf, he undertook that part, and made ≈øuch a Plea as ≈øtunn'd his Jury, and gave ≈øatisfaction to the whole Court, except ≈øuch as came thither with a re≈øolution to Murther him. The things which he principally in≈øi≈øted on, as to matter of Law, were three. 1. That Printing (though even that was not proved) was not Trea≈øon. 2. That the Crime laid to his charge came not within the purview of the 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. 3. That if it did, yet by the ≈øaid Statute he ought to be di≈øcharged; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe there was not ≈øuch Witne≈øs again≈øt him as that Statute requires, and without which it condemns no Man. And the≈øe he proved fully and clearly by ≈øeveral ca≈øes in Law, by ≈øeveral Authorities from that great Oracle of Law the Lork <hi>Coke,</hi> and from our plain Laws and Statutes them≈øelves, he argued from the Statute whereon he was indicted, that whereas that made two things Trea≈øon; <hi>Con≈øpiring the Death of the King, and Levying War.</hi> The Printer, who worked for hire, could not be guilty of this what-ever the Author might; and further that the Books contained nothing of ≈øuch matter, but the contrary, of which he produced an In≈øtance full and plain; he al≈øo urged, that that Statute allows no conjectural Pre≈øumptions, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, or ≈øtrains of Wit, but direct and manife≈øt proof by, at lea≈øt, two Witne≈ø≈øes, whereas there was not one again≈øt him, that ≈øpoke to the purpo≈øe, or any thing like it; he pre≈ø≈øed and explain'd
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:32650:9"/>
the Statue 1<hi>mo Marie,</hi> even to a demon≈øtration of his ca≈øe. For whereas that Statute ≈øaith, <hi>no Act, Deed or Offence, ≈øhall be adjudged Trea≈øon, but ≈øuch as are declared and expre≈ø≈øed to be ≈øuch by the</hi> 25 <hi>of</hi> Edw. 3. It is ab≈øolutely impo≈ø≈øible, that Printing ≈øhould be any ways declared or expre≈ø≈øed in that Act, it not being known in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> till eight Kings Reigns after, and not long invented, before it travail'd hither. Any Man that had but a grain of Sen≈øe, Rea≈øon, or Con≈øcience, would have thought this ≈øhould have ≈øtruck the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dead; but he ≈øtill urged further an Act of their own; and where Men will not ≈øo much as ≈øtand to their own Acts, happy are they who have nothing to do with ≈øuch. In the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, an Act was made to <hi>prevent abu≈øes in Printing,</hi> &amp;c. by which the Printer upon the fir≈øt Offence is di≈øabled to follow his Trade for three years, and upon the ≈øecond di≈øabled for ever with Fine, Impri≈øonment, or other corporal Puni≈øhment not extending to Life or Limb; this is pretty ≈øevere, and yet a great way off Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon; but this being in favour of that King was made only for his Life, and con≈øequently expired with him; but no longer ≈øince then the la≈øt Se≈ø≈øions of Parliament was this very Act revived, and the <hi>pre≈øent Government</hi> obtain'd it not without great Strugling: But to what purpo≈øe? Or I would fain know what favour was done it, if there were more effectual Remedies before? And I think it may be worth while for the Parliament when they ≈øit next to con≈øider for what rea≈øon they revived that Law, or whither it be to any pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe for them to make that or any other Law, if even whil≈øt they are fre≈øh made, and in all Mens view and knowledge, a Judg ≈øhall dare openly not only to ≈øet them a≈øide, but to violate them, and judge contrary to them. But I ≈øhall trouble the Reader no further with his Plea, which had been here in≈øerted, but that ≈øome thought it would be too tedious, and not ≈øo proper for all ≈øorts of Per≈øons, as being fraught with much Latin and French, which he was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øitated to u≈øe as to the matters he cited. In ≈øhort, he acquitted him≈øelf ≈øo well, that all indifferent Per≈øons were abundantly ≈øati≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:32650:10"/>
and yet it proved to no more purpo≈øe than a <hi>Wall-lecture.</hi> The rea≈øon is, the Tryal was only a piece of Pageantry, and the Man was condemned long before; but to over-rule this without more ado, had been a down-right Affront both to Law and Rea≈øon, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Mr. Judge mu≈øt needs make a Flouri≈øh; and now a Man would expect, that he ≈øhould have gon through all the Ca≈øes, Statutes, and Arguments u≈øed by the Pri≈øoner, and fairly and fully confuted him; but I thank you, no ≈øuch matter; if the Man had but little Hone≈øty, yet he had more Wit; he warily leaves it all in the Lurch, and to put a blind upon the matter, makes a Blu≈øter with two or three old mu≈øty impertinent Pre≈øidents, which had not ≈øeen the Sun for many Ages, the chief of which was that of Sir <hi>John Oldca≈øtle</hi> Lord <hi>Cobham,</hi> and he might as well have urged the Ca≈øe of the <hi>Man in the Moon.</hi> For what was my Lord <hi>Cobham</hi>'s Ca≈øe to Printing? That famous <hi>Wicklevite</hi> lived in the Reign of <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, ≈øome ≈øcores of years before Printing was thought on, which came not into <hi>England</hi> till the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh; and the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoner had very well ob≈øerved, That what is not expre≈ø≈øed in the Statute 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. (and it is impo≈ø≈øible Printing ≈øhould be expre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed there) is barr'd from being any ways adjudged or interpreted Trea≈øon, by the Statute 1 <hi>mo Marie.</hi> In ≈øhort, in ≈øumming up the Evidence to the Jury, the Judg acted not the part of a Judg, but rather of a keen malitious Councel or Accu≈øer, and mu≈øtered up all his Arts to in≈ønare and impo≈øe upon the Jury; he aggravated to the utmo≈øt every little Punctilio, which he thought might be any thing ≈øervicable to beget in the Jury an hard Opinion of the Pri≈øoner; he could not let the Bed with Wheels alone, but whipt it up and down like a Top; he could not forbear bru≈øhing the poor Man's Night-gown; he rambled from St. <hi>James</hi>'s to <hi>Hoxton,</hi> and fetcht in every little Trifle with all the witty Malice imaginable; nay, if you will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him, he lookt into the very Soul of the Man, and told the Jury what was within him; he was an <hi>ill-minded Man,</hi> a <hi>di≈øaffected Per≈øon,</hi> he was <hi>no Lover of the Government</hi>; and in my Con≈øcience I
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:32650:10"/>
cannot tell how he ≈øhould, the Government had not u≈øed him to well, that he ≈øhould be pa≈ø≈øionately fond of it; but above all he took mighty Pains to beat it into their heads, That <hi>Printing was an Overt Act:</hi> But on the other hand, of there being two Witne≈ø≈øes to the proving the Fact (alas, he knew there was not one) or of any thing the Pri≈øoner had pleaded though plain and ≈øub≈øtantial Law, or of any thing that did make for the Pri≈øoner, not a Word did he ≈øpeak; and when he had thus di≈øgui≈øed the bu≈øine≈øs with all the skill he had, The Jury were ≈øent out to con≈øider of their Verdict.</p>
            <p>Whil≈øt the Jury were withdrawn all ≈øorts of People were big with Expectation, what would be the I≈ø≈øue of the bu≈øine≈øs; many, who who were very well affected to the Government, thought he could not be found guilty, and do not ≈øtick to ≈øay ≈øtill, that he had very hard mea≈øure; nay, even <hi>Robin Stephens,</hi> who thir≈øted for his Blood, was fearful he would e≈øcape; for as he was pa≈ø≈øing along the Streets coming up to three Gentlemen, one of whom asked what they thought would become of Mr. <hi>Anderton, Stephen</hi>'s laying his hand on Mr. <hi>M‚Äî≈øh</hi>'s Shoulder ≈øaid thus, <hi>The Rogue pleaded bravely, and I believes hopes he hath Friends among the Jury to get off; but if ≈øuch as he are acquitted, the Government mu≈øt give us Orders to ≈øtob them whereever we find them.</hi> I think this is a faithful Servant of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment indeed, a Man who will go through ≈øtitch with his work; but then, my Dear Country-men! what would become of the Laws, if every Rogue ≈øhould have a Licen≈øe to murther whom he plea≈øeth?</p>
            <p>After two hours debate the greater part of the Jury became very well inclined to have found <hi>Not Guilty</hi>; but there was a true Trojan among≈øt them, one who loved Mi≈øchief and the Government in his Soul; and he was for hanging Men for being <hi>Jacobites,</hi> not for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Guilty: and being ≈øince told of the ≈øeverity of their Verdict, he readily acknowledged, <hi>that the Evidence did not amount to the proof of the Fact, but,</hi> ≈øaith he, <hi>what of that? I believed he was guilty, and I will hang a hundred of them for half ≈øo much Evidence.</hi> A very
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:32650:11"/>
u≈øeful Man, and certainly de≈øerves a Pention, if he have not one already. When the Jury appeared, the Que≈øtion was asked, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were agreed of their Verdict? A zealous Man an≈øwered, No. Whereat the Court fround, and ≈øhew'd them≈øelves much di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plea≈øed, when the <hi>Fore-man</hi> of the Jury (who is a Man well affected to the Government, but withall a ≈øen≈øible Man, not malicious, and de≈øirous that all Men may have fair play for their Lives) put this Que≈øtion to the Bench, <hi>Whether the having tho≈øe things by him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making any further u≈øe of them, did affect the Pri≈øoner as to Life?</hi> Now this Que≈øtion was very pertinent. For all that was proved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt the Pri≈øoner, was that ≈øuch things were found there, and it ought to be taken notice of, that though the thing was call'd in Que≈øtion, yet it was not proved, that the Room, where the things were found, did belong to him; and there was a Per≈øon pre≈øent in Court, and brought thither by means of <hi>Robin Stephens,</hi> who offered to make Oath, that the Room was hired by one <hi>Williams,</hi> and that the ≈øaid <hi>Williams</hi> had paid the la≈øt Quarters Rent for it; whereupon <hi>Stephens</hi> and others gave her very ill Names, and with great Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings drave her out of the Court, and both ≈øhe and her Husband have been ≈øomewhat ≈øcurvily u≈øed ≈øince. The Que≈øtion, though very proper, was nothing plea≈øing; but after ≈øome frowning and pouting, <hi>Treby</hi> aro≈øe and an≈øwered, <hi>No.</hi> In which an≈øwer he plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledged, that all that was offered in proof again≈øt the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoner, did not affect him; but then he further ≈øaid, <hi>That was not their Bu≈øine≈øs, they were to find it Printing, and that was a ≈øufficient Overt-Act.</hi> But then is Printing Trea≈øon? If ≈øo, then we have a Trade that is Trea≈øon, at which Men work every day, and are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by Law, which is not more ≈øevere again≈øt any thing, than Trea≈øon. But perhaps he will ≈øay, he meant <hi>the Printing the≈øe Books</hi>; but with his good leave, there was no ≈øuch thing proved, nay, not ≈øo much, as that he printed at all. And mu≈øt a Jury find a matter of which no manner of Evidence at all is given? He might as well have bid them find it <hi>Conjuring,</hi> for any proof that was offered of

it. But if the thing were ≈øuppo≈øed, yet I believe his Lord≈øhip is the fir≈øt, that ever declared Printing as ≈øuch, to be an Overt-Act of Trea≈øon; and I ≈øhall leave it to the Learned in the Law to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, when they ≈øhall think fit, what Crime that is, and how to be puni≈øhed, when a Judg takes away a Man's Life by declaring that to be an Overt-Act of Trea≈øon, which the Law doth not ≈øo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
            <p>But I cannot omit it, as ≈øeeming to me a thing of ≈øad and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Con≈øideration, that when ≈øome of the Jury-men, as by way of complaint, ≈øaid thus. <hi>My lord, our Fore-man is of Opinion, this Fact is not proved.</hi> He pre≈øently replied, <hi>Whether it be proved or no, you ought not to determine; the bare finding the Books in his Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtody would not be Trea≈øon; but the ca≈øe is, Gentlemen, here is a Man that has a Printing-Pre≈øs, to which no Man has admi≈ø≈øion but him≈øelf; and this Man is found with</hi> Errata <hi>and</hi> &amp;c. (not a tittle of all this proved) <hi>≈øo that he mu≈øt needs print the Trea≈øon.</hi> To this a pert Jury-man an≈øwered, <hi>'Tis a very ≈øtrong Pre≈øumption, my Lord</hi>! And then Baron <hi>Powel</hi> clenched the Nail with this grave ≈øaying. <hi>A violent Pre≈øumption is as much as if a Man had been there and done it him≈øelf.</hi> What ble≈ø≈øed times are the≈øe? Would not a Man think, that <hi>A≈øtrea</hi> were come down from Heaven again, and ≈øat in Court? For was ever ≈øuch brave Ju≈øtice known? The Jury are <hi>≈øworn</hi> to proceed <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Evidence,</hi> but the Judg tells them, <hi>they are not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine whether the thing be proved or no. i. e.</hi> They are brought thither to be for≈øworn, and to hang Men contrary to their Oath upon the bare <hi>Say-≈øo</hi> of a Lying corrupt Judg. The Law ≈øays there ≈øhall be <hi>po≈øitive Evidence in ca≈øe of Life,</hi> but a great Lawyer ≈øays, <hi>a violent Pre≈øumption</hi> is the ≈øame thing. In plain terms, (Country-men) this is not to <hi>murther</hi> a ≈øingle Man, but to <hi>murther the Laws</hi>; and the mo≈øt innocent Engli≈øh-man breathing has no ≈øecurity of his Life again≈øt a <hi>pre≈øuming</hi> Judg.</p>
            <p>The≈øe An≈øwers, or rather Shams, being returned to the Que≈øtions, after ≈øome other ill Words, and ill Looks, the Jury were ≈øent back

again, where almo≈øt three hours more were ≈øpent in debating the matter before they could come to a Conclu≈øion, and then part complied, rather tired and frighted than convinced; The la≈øt, who came in, was the Foreman; and it is be≈øitting the times, for the head to follow the tail; nor were they Arguments, but Terrours, which ≈øhock'd his Judgment, and brought him off at the la≈øt; ≈øome of his fellow Jury-men u≈øed him rudely, gave him very ill Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and threatned him high with the Government, and thus all being awed into a Compliance, away they come with their wicked, but to the Court welcome, Verdict, and bring in the Pri≈øoner <hi>Guilty.</hi> And now the Judg, to ≈øhew how acceptable it was to him, falls a ≈øtroaking the Jury; and endeavours to make them ≈øome amends for the hard words he had given them before, telling them, <hi>That they had done like hone≈øt and good Men, and had brought in a Verdict agreable to their Evidence.</hi> The mo≈øt impudent Lye that ever was ≈øpoke from a Bench; for there was not one tittle of Evidence ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as to his <hi>Compo≈øing, Printing, or Publi≈øhing,</hi> which was the Crime laid to his Charge in the Indictment. But the Foreman, when he came to have the liberty of his thoughts, was not plea≈øed with what was done; and that he might prevent the mi≈øchief, what in him lay, he did declare his di≈ø≈øatisfaction, and that al≈øo was made known, and at another time, had been enough to have ≈øtaid Judgment: But they had gained their wicked Point, and would not depart from it; Sentence according to cour≈øe was put off to the la≈øt day of the Se≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions, in the mean time the Pri≈øoner, that he might either ≈øave his Life, or leave tho≈øe who ≈øought his Blood without excu≈øe, had a Petition drawn and delivered, which is as followeth.

Thus Innocence falls before the Guilty; and it is the Triumph of a hardned Sinner to wa≈øh his hands in blood.</p>
            <p>Whil≈øt Mr. <hi>Anderton</hi> was preparing for his Death, his Friends were ≈øtruggling for his Life: he had many Friends upon the account of his known ability, indu≈øtry, and integrity; others were taken with his manly behaviour, and clear pleading upon his Tryal; and others were more forward to move in his Ca≈øe in pity or indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation at his Lawle≈øs u≈øage. Tho≈øe who were concern'd in it, might have ob≈øerved the activity and zeal of charitable and pitiful Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtians, the fair and open dealing of ≈øome generous Noble Per≈øons, the pretty Fetches and Tricks of little Courtiers to hook in a prize, but above all the Artifices of a Council in declining what was before-hand re≈øolved ≈øhould not be granted. The Queen (as ≈øtill upon occa≈øion it was an≈øwered) could do nothing without the Council,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:32650:15"/>
nor the Council without the Queen; if the Council was met, the Queen was not there, or if ≈øhe was there, there wanted ≈øuch and ≈øuch of the Council, without whom nothing could be done; and thus things at every turn were ≈øhuffled off: but where the danger is imminent, and time ≈øhort, Per≈øons are willing to watch hard and look out ≈øharp; taking this cour≈øe his di≈øcon≈øolate Wi≈øe had at la≈øt ≈øo fairly ≈øet the Council, that it was thought they could not avoid giving her a direct An≈øwer; for though they were re≈øolved he ≈øhould not live, yet (the matter being ≈øo warmly debated among≈øt all ≈øorts of Per≈øons) they were not willing to ≈øay peremptorily he ≈øhould die: To put her by now, this Artifice ≈øerved effectually; a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Waiters attending about the Council Chamber fell foul upon the poor Woman, in no very courtly Language, reproaching and reviling her, That ≈øhe did not bring her Husband to Confe≈ø≈øion: In ≈øhort, they ≈øo teazed and plagued her, that they drove her away, and an old Hag followed her, per≈øecuting her, and all that came near her as Friends, with ≈øuch vehement and bitter Language, that they were forced to quit the place. But of the≈øe things there is a worthy pious Gentlewoman, who never ≈øpares any pains to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote a work of Charity or Mercy, can give a better account than I; and they being too long to be in≈øerted here, with her, and to her careful Ob≈øervation, I leave them. It did at la≈øt plainly appear, that the rea≈øon of <hi>Caiaphas</hi> prevailed, <hi>It was expedient one ≈øhould die.</hi> (Pardon the Expre≈ø≈øion, for the very Words were u≈øed,) and therefore no matter whether the Law was ≈øtrained, or not; they had caught a Man whom they thought fit ≈øhould die, if not for his Crimes, yet for Example: And thus we have bravely ≈øecured our Lives, Liberties and E≈øtates, when men are hanged for Rea≈øons of State, not for Offences again≈øt Law.</p>
            <p>I now draw near to his la≈øt <hi>Exit,</hi> only I crave leave to premi≈øe a very ≈øhort account of his Life. Mr. <hi>Will. Anderton</hi> was born at <hi>Wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi> in <hi>York≈øhire, Sept.</hi> 29. 1663. his Father's Name was al≈øo <hi>William Anderton,</hi> an eminent Clothier in that Town, his Mothers <hi>Elizabeth,</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:32650:15"/>
the Daughter of Mr. <hi>Maximilian Topham,</hi> ≈øhe is yet living, a Woman of a Ma≈øculine Spirit, yet as pious as couragious: for though in this Man ≈øhe lo≈øt the Son both of her love and ≈øupport, (for ≈øhe is fallen into poverty) and would readily have given her own life in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change to have ≈øaved his, yet ≈øhe bore it with ≈øuch a Chri≈øtian Magnanimity, that ≈øhe did not ≈øtick to ≈øay, That <hi>≈øhe thanked God, that he had ≈øingled out one of her Children to dye in ≈øo good a Cau≈øe.</hi> He was brought up in the Grammar-School there, till he was fit for the Univer≈øity, for which he was de≈øigned by his Father, who≈øe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øire was to have made him a Clergy-man; but he, con≈øidering with him≈øelf, that ≈øince his Father's death, by many Lo≈ø≈øes and Cro≈ø≈øes, the E≈øtate had been very much impaired, and that there were others be≈øide him≈øelf to be brought up, and di≈øpo≈øed of in the World, ≈øo that a tolerable Univer≈øity-maintenance could not be allowed him without cru≈øhing his Mother, and Brother and Si≈øters, he re≈øolved to betake him≈øelf to a Trade. When his School-ma≈øter heard of this, he was extreamly troubled; for he looked on him as a Boy of as great hopes as any he had taught; and to divert him from his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolution, did promi≈øe and undertake, that among≈øt his Friends and Acquaintance he would procure him a Maintenance, but the Boy being unwilling to depend on ≈øuch Uncertainties made ha≈øte away up to <hi>London,</hi> in the year 1679. where he was unfortunately bound Apprentice to one <hi>Thomas Snowden</hi> a Printer, and withal a furious Bigotted Fanatick; who u≈øing to pray (after his fa≈øhion) every Night in his Family, never failed in one part of his Prayer to blother out mo≈øt malitious Invectives and venomous Imprecations again≈øt the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and its Members, e≈øpecially the Clergy. His new Apprentice, who had been bred by his Loyal Parents in the Doctrine and Practice of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> could not endure this; but when his Ma≈øter fell to praying backwards, would get up on his Feet, and manife≈øtly ≈øhew his di≈ølike. At fir≈øt his Ma≈øter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved him, and thought to have per≈øwaded him with Argument, but at that weapon the Apprentice was too hard for him, which
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:32650:16"/>
made his angry Ma≈øter have recour≈øe to the <hi>Argumentum bacilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> thinking he would at lea≈øt be able to cudgel his young Man into Fanatici≈øm: But ≈øtill as often as the Ma≈øter came to the mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious part of his Prayers, ≈øo often the Apprentice aro≈øe, though he was as often beaten for it; till in the end his Ma≈øter perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his immoveable Re≈øolution, and knowing that he could not ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtifie his own Proceedings, gave him leave to pray his own way, and to go to Church: but withall bore him ≈øuch an eternal grudge for it, that he laid hold on all Advantages imaginable to u≈øe him ill; and by the ≈øilly Oath he made again≈øt him at the Tryal, any man would think, it ≈øtuck by him ≈øtill. Such doings made the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentice ≈øo very unea≈øie, that about half of his Time being ≈øerved, after complaint made to the Chamberlain, he was turned over to one <hi>Miles Fletcher,</hi> with whom he lived very comfortably the re≈øt of his time, he re≈øpecting and faithfully ≈øerving his Ma≈øter, and his Ma≈øter entirely loving his Apprentice. It is a Trade wherein ≈øome excel in one part, and ≈øome in another; but Mr. <hi>Anderton</hi> had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to that perfection in it, that ≈øeveral skilful Per≈øons now give him the Character, that <hi>take him for all parts of his Trade together, he hath ≈øcarce left his Fellow behind him in</hi> England. When this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Revolution was brought about, wherein Men in the face of Heaven for≈øoook and renounced tho≈øe Principles which before they had valued them≈øelves upon, again≈øt and above all the World; our Sufferer cho≈øe the better, not the ≈øtronger ≈øide, adhereing to the <hi>Orthodox</hi> not the <hi>Apo≈øtate</hi> Church of <hi>England,</hi> and being for <hi>True</hi> not <hi>Sham-Loyalty,</hi> which became the occa≈øion of his glorious though untimely end.</p>
            <p>From the time of his Commitment to the very moment of his Death he was of a very even and ≈øweet behaviour, being mode≈øtly couragious, chearful without Lightne≈øs, and devout without O≈øten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. He made it his particular Reque≈øt, that ≈øome Mini≈øter or Mini≈øters would be with him every Morning and Evening to read the Prayers of the Church, and perform ≈øuch other Offices as in
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:32650:16"/>
≈øuch ca≈øe as his did belong to that Function, which except one day in the Week was duly ob≈øerved, and ≈øometimes oftner; for when any Clergy came accidentally to vi≈øit him, if they did neglect to offer, he commonly reque≈øted them to pray with him. He gave little or no entertainment to any hopes of Life, as being ≈øen≈øible that it was rather Malice than Matter again≈øt him; and that a Crime may be pardoned, but Malice is not to be ≈øatisfied without the de≈øtruction of its Enemy, if he once come in its Power. He often expre≈øs'd a great Satisfaction in the Cau≈øe for which he ≈øuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; ≈øaying, <hi>that it mini≈øtred to him both Comfort and Courage, and that he doubted not but that God would acquit whom the Court had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</hi> As to the Ordinary, he indeed in point of Con≈øcience re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu≈øed to communicate with him, yet mildly and mode≈øtly telling him that he was de≈øirous to give him no Trouble, and reque≈øted of him that he would not any ways concern him≈øelf with him or about him; at which Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> fell into ≈øuch an un≈øeemly intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate fit of Rage, that he reviled the Pri≈øoner with bitter Words, and very generou≈øly damned both him and all the Mini≈øters that came at him to Hell: but he took it patiently, and returned not the lea≈øt Word that might ≈øeem to ≈øound har≈øhly. As his Wife once laid her hand on his Fetters and wept; he intreated her to forbear, ≈øaying, <hi>he was le≈øs than a Man that could not bear that, but that her Tears were more grievous to him than his Fetters</hi>: Another time as he was hanging a Link on the Chair thereby to ea≈øe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf ≈øomewhat from the weight of his Fetters, and perceiving his Wife to look very heavily at it, he ≈øaid chearfully to her, <hi>My Dear, the≈øe are my Arms</hi> alluding to the Arms of their Family, being Sable, two ≈øingle Shack-bolts, and one-double Argent, which if the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks will give me leave) I take to be very honourable bearing, as being originally given to ≈øuch, who having behaved them≈øelves va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantly in the <hi>Holy Wars,</hi> yet had the Misfortune to be for ≈øome time made Pri≈øoners by the Infidels; or to ≈øuch who did either by their Prowe≈øs fetch off, or by their Charity redeem ≈øuch Pri≈øoners.

But it would be endle≈øs to in≈øi≈øt on the≈øe ≈ømall Matters, I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ha≈øten to the great and la≈øt Act of this ≈øad Tragedy. When <hi>Tucker</hi> told him that the <hi>Dead Warrant</hi> was come, and that he was in it; he gave him thanks for giving him notice of it, that he might be ≈øure he had now nothing el≈øe to do, but to prepare to dye; ≈øaying further, <hi>The Lord's Will be done.</hi> He received the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sacrament twice during his Impri≈øonment; but whether it be cu≈øtomary, or that they had particular Order, the Keeepers all (except <hi>Walker,</hi> who was all along not only civil, but even com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa≈ø≈øionate towards the Pri≈øoner) the Evening and Morning before he ≈øuffered became exceeding rugged and har≈øh not only to him, but to all that came to him; in≈øomuch that his Mother and Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther coming that Morning to receive the Communion with him could neither beg nor buy admi≈ø≈øion; and the poor old Woman was forced to depart without joyning in the la≈øt Act of Chri≈øtian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him, or ≈øo much as taking her intended la≈øt Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel of him; which looks as if ≈øome Per≈øons took a pride in Ba≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs and Cruelty, and ≈øtudiou≈øly ≈øet them≈øelves to add to the ≈øorrows of the afflicted. Other very unbecoming Actions towards him I could mention, which I ≈øhall forbear, being unwilling to ≈øet forth that Barbarity which ≈øome delight to act. When he was brought down to go to the place of Execution, he entred into the Sledge, and rode along in it with that calm Behaviour and decent Courage, as ≈øtroke the Beholders with remor≈øe and amazement, and made his Enemies gna≈øh their Teeth with Indignation, to ≈øee him triumph over their Malice even in his Death. In his Pa≈ø≈øage all the way the People rather ≈øeem'd ≈øorrowful, than inclinable to offer any Abu≈øe, except near S. <hi>Giles</hi>'s Church, where a rude fellow treated him with very ≈øpiteful Language, to which he made no return, but lifting up his eyes to Heaven, ≈øaid, <hi>O ≈øweet Je≈øus! how much more ha≈øt thou ≈øuffered for me and for Mankind? and ≈øhall not I learn of thee patiently to bear the unde≈øerv'd Reproaches of this incon≈øiderate Man?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As he was coming up to the Place of Execution, a Clergy-man,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:32650:17"/>
got up into the Cart to be ready to receive him; at which the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ≈øeemed to be much incen≈øed; for he gave him very ill Words, bidding him <hi>get him down,</hi> and ≈øaying, <hi>he ought not be there, nor ≈øhould he be ≈øuffered</hi>; The Mini≈øter replyed little, but ≈øtayed ≈øtill, till (≈øee how one ill Nature helps another) Major <hi>Richard≈øon</hi> came up, and with Threatnings and his Cane lifted up forced him to come down, who immediately thereupon applied him≈øelf to the Sheriffs (for by this time they were come up) when ≈øome ill Per≈øon ≈øug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge≈øted that he was a <hi>Papi≈øt,</hi> to which the Pri≈øoner pre≈øently an≈øwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Mr. Sheriff, upon the Words of a dying Man he is not, but a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øter of the Church of</hi> England. I mention this purpo≈øely that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may take notice what ill u≈øe is made of the Words <hi>Papi≈øt</hi> and <hi>Popery</hi>; and how nece≈ø≈øary it is that they were better under≈øtood: for to be called a Papi≈øt is dangerous, but to be one or to teach the wor≈øt of Popi≈øh Doctrines is advantageous; heretofore <hi>the Power of Depo≈øing Kings</hi> and <hi>Equivocation, either as to Oaths, Promi≈øes, or any Tran≈øactings</hi> were accounted <hi>Popi≈øh Doctrines,</hi> and tho≈øe who own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them were univer≈øally condemned; but now you have tho≈øe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Doctrines in every Pulpit in the Town, and the Per≈øons by all applauded. What prepo≈øterous Doings are the≈øe, to hate the Name and love the Thing? to knock an hone≈øt Man o'th' head, for being maliciou≈øly and fal≈øely called a <hi>Papi≈øt,</hi> and to admire him for a Saint who really acts upon Popi≈øh Principles, whil≈øt he rai≈øeth the≈øe Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals, and rails again≈øt Popery? whether may not People be led, who will ≈øuffer them≈øelves to be thus deluded? <hi>I pray God open their eyes, that they may ≈øee the things that belong to their Peace, before they be hid from their eyes.</hi>

            <p>Due to return to our Bu≈øine≈øs, the <hi>Ordinary</hi> made all the oppo≈øiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he could; but the Sheriff granted the Pri≈øoner's Reque≈øt, bidding the <hi>Ordinary</hi> hold his Peace, and ≈øaying it was a thing never deny'd to a dying Man. Being in the Cart, and al≈øo the Pri≈øoner's Brother, he u≈øed an Office which ≈øeemed to be collected out of ≈øeveral Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the Common-Prayer Book, with ≈øuch ≈ømall Alterations as

might ≈øerve to adapt them to the pre≈øent Occa≈øion; being ≈øince asked the Rea≈øon, he ≈øaid that he did it both for the Authority of the thing, and al≈øo to avoid any Cavils that might be made at, or any Snares that might be laid for, any of his own Conceptions. But But when he came to mention the Creed he put the≈øe particular Que≈øtions to the Pri≈øoner. <hi>Do you believe the≈øe Articles which you are now about to rehear≈øe with me, to contain that Faith which hath all along been received by the Church of Chri≈øt? and particularly by the Church of</hi> England? <hi>and is this the Faith wherein you die, and wherein you hope for Salvation</hi>?

And then, at the earne≈øt Reque≈øt of the dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Man he denounced the Ab≈øolution, then proceeding to divers other Prayers they concluded with that Sentence in the Office for the Burial of the Dead: <hi>O holy and merciful Saviour, thou mu≈øt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Judge eternal, ≈øuffer me not at my ha≈øt hour for any pains of Death to fall from thee.</hi> This being over, the Mini≈øter (whether that he could not endure to ≈øee the Man die, or that he would not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with the <hi>Ordinary,</hi> or for ≈øome other Rea≈øon be≈øt known to him≈øelf,) after he had particularly embraced Mr. <hi>Anderton,</hi> fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently recommended his Soul to God, and taken his la≈øt Farewel of him, went down out of the Cart: The Sheriffs civilly command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a way to be made, and were readily obeyed, he pa≈ø≈øing through the Crowd, not only with ea≈øe but re≈øpect.

                     <p>That they de≈øigned not to <hi>Try</hi> but to <hi>Convict</hi> me is as plain; for they refu≈øed po≈øitively to allow me Coun≈øel to ≈øuch Matters of Law, as was never refu≈øed to any before; and though I cau≈øed ≈øeveral Statutes to be read, ≈øome to prove that there mu≈øt be two Witne≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes at lea≈øt to the Fact; others, that though there had been two, as there was not one, yet po≈øitively declared that it was not Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon: Nay, the very la≈øt Se≈ø≈øion of Parliament was it enacted, That the Printer of Seditious and Trea≈øonable Books ≈øhould for the <hi>fir≈øt</hi> Offence be puni≈øhed no otherwi≈øe than not to follow his Trade for three years, and for the <hi>≈øecond</hi> Offence never to follow it more, and ≈øuch farther Puni≈øhment as ≈øeemed fit to the Court, <hi>not exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Life or Limb.</hi> Now though mine (had it been proved) had but been the <hi>fir≈øt,</hi> yet you ≈øee contrary and in direct oppo≈øition to the Law, they make it High Trea≈øon: And when the Jury could not agree to find me Guilty, and came down to ask the Court, Whether the finding the≈øe Things there, and ≈øuppo≈øing them to be mine, ≈øince it could not be prov'd that I printed the≈øe Books, or had made any u≈øe of them, could affect my Life? I ≈øay, when the Jury asked this Que≈øtion, and the Lord Chief Ju≈øtice <hi>Treby</hi> told

them po≈øitively, <hi>No, it did not</hi>; yet withal he told them, <hi>That that was not their Bu≈øine≈øs, their Bu≈øine≈øs was to find me Guilty of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting:</hi> And while they ≈øtayed, the Court frown'd upon them to that degree, that the Foreman told them, he was not to be frighted; upon which they publickly reviled them, calling them, <hi>ill Men, ill Subjects, and a Pack of Knaves</hi>; and ≈øo terrified them into a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance. That this is true, tho≈øe who were near know too well, although the partial Writer of the Tryals hath mo≈øt perfidiou≈øly publi≈øhed not only an unfair, imperfect, and lame Account, but hath al≈øo ≈øtuff'd it with down-right Untruths and Fal≈øhoods, and left out what≈øoever made for me; not ≈øo much as mentioning the Contradictions of the Witne≈ø≈øes in what they did ≈øwear, their ≈øwearing to ≈øome things that made for me, and when I took hold of them they denied them, nor hath he in the lea≈øt told the World of the Judg's over-ruling what≈øoever I offered, without giving any other An≈øwer than that <hi>it ≈øhould be ≈øo becau≈øe they would have it ≈øo</hi>; with many other ≈øuch things, which the con≈øcientious Auditors can te≈øtify.</p>
                     <p>And now I pray con≈øider where is this Liberty and Property? where the Rights and Privileges of the Subject? Nay, where the very Laws them≈øelves? And con≈øequently where is the Security of any Man? Why, even in the Deliverers Pockets, where your Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is, and where al≈øo without all doubt, if you look not well to your ≈øelves, your E≈øtates e're long will be likewi≈øe. What are the Proceedings but Arbitrary in a ≈øuperlative Manner, and ≈øuch as no Reign ever produced before? The≈øe were they you were hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore only afraid of, being jealous without ju≈øt Cau≈øe; but now you ≈øee them actually come upon you. I hope you your ≈øelves will put a ≈øtop to them, by laying the≈øe Proceedings before the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, for had it been Sitting at this pre≈øent the≈øe Proceedings dur≈øt not have been practi≈øed; and I pray God to put ≈øo ≈øpeedy an end to them, that as I am the fir≈øt, ≈øo I may be the la≈øt that may ≈øuffer by them.</p>

            <p>Several ≈øorts of Men have their ≈øeveral Objections again≈øt this poor Man's Speech, which he wrote the day before he dyed, between the hours of Eight and One, being fourteen times interrupted in the Writing of it, and forced to convey a Copy of it through a Key<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hole to a Friend, lea≈øt it ≈øhould be taken from him. Some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, That <hi>he did not pray for the Queen</hi>; but the≈øe ≈øurely forget what Man they have to do with. Formerly in ≈øuch ca≈øes Men u≈øed to pray for their King; and when they were acquitteed u≈øed to ≈øay,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:32650:20"/>
               <hi>God ble≈øs the King,</hi> without any further Notice of other Per≈øons, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øs there were particular Rea≈øon for it: But ≈øince a <hi>joint Regency</hi> hath been ≈øet up, it hath followed in cour≈øe that they pray'd for the King and Queen; but he was a Man who would not countenance this, or take any Notice of it, and therefore u≈øed the old form and way, not caring who excepted again≈øt it. But if any Honourers of their Queen by mi≈øtake except the≈øe, they may know, that he honoured her as much as they; and doubtle≈øs ≈øhe will believe no le≈øs of him, who prayed ≈øo heartily for the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> the Son of her Womb, his Maje≈øties care, and all their good Subjects hopes.</p>
            <p>Others alledge, that it hath too much Levity in it for the Speech of a dying Man, and for that rea≈øon quarrel with the word <hi>Kidnap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping</hi> in it, and that is the very term now by all u≈øed, and by which all Men expre≈øs and under≈øtand the Fact ≈øignified by it; and he that would ≈øpeak to be under≈øtood by all, ≈øhould ≈øpeak in the Language u≈øed by all: when Words are new and fre≈øh, they carry along with them ≈øomewhat of the lightne≈øs, quaintne≈øs, or other particular Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour or Quality of the fir≈øt Devi≈øer, but when they are once ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated and naturalized by u≈øe, that Humour is lo≈øt, and they become in ≈øome mea≈øure nece≈ø≈øary; and he that will find fault with a Man for ≈øpeaking as other Men do, perhaps will find in the End, that more will find fault with him.</p>
            <p>On the quite contrary, there are others who are as much di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plea≈øed with the Sharpne≈øs and Severity of it; ≈øo difficult a matter it is to plea≈øe all Palats. But this is only in that part of his Speech, where his ≈øubject matter plainly engaged him to ≈øpeak ≈øomewhat af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that manner; and therefore the Objectors ought to con≈øider, that there are ≈øome things in their own Nature ≈øo har≈øh and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful, that a Man cannot mention them without ≈øeeming to grate or bite; but then how Evil and Severe are tho≈øe things them≈øelves? And if a Man mu≈øt nece≈ø≈øarily ≈øpeak of ≈øuch Matters, they ought to lay the blame on the things, which extort from a Man ≈øuch ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of Language, not on the Man, who ≈øpeaks properly and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:32650:21"/>
to the nature of the things, which was always e≈øteemed a Virtue and Commendation. Some Per≈øons can find fault with the Excellencies of a Man, as I remember it was one Objection again≈øt Mr. <hi>A≈øhton</hi>'s Paper, that he <hi>rea≈øoned too logically</hi>: the ≈øame Crime I am apt to think will never be objected to him, who pick'd the quarrel. Were any of the≈øe ≈ømooth Men to ≈øuffer in the ≈øame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with ≈øuch kind of Ju≈øtice as Mr. <hi>Anderton</hi> had, perhaps it might ≈øet their Tongues and Pens on edge to ≈øpeak and write as ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Truth as he did.</p>
            <p>There are others, who employ time, which might be better ≈øpent in ≈øeeking or making Exceptions again≈øt this brave Man; But I will leave them with <hi>Trinculo</hi> to mutiny by them≈øelves; I wi≈øh all of them had ≈øeen him and conver≈øed with him in the time of his Confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; they then would rather have admired him, than di≈øparaged him; a Man upon whom the Terrours of Death made no Impre≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; no Man that came to him could ever di≈øcover any the lea≈øt ≈øign of fear, or perturbation of Mind in him, but found him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in the ≈øame ≈øweet even temper, excepting only in his Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Exerci≈øes of Religion, wherein he was very fervent and vehement, as powring out all his Soul to his God. To carp and cavil is no hard matter, but to die is not ≈øo very ea≈øie; and I hope I ≈øhall be thought to make no ill Wi≈øh, if I wi≈øh that tho≈øe who are ≈øo ready to cen≈øure, may be able to make as brave and as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtian an End, as this poor Man did, who is per≈øecuted both living and dead.</p>
            <p>During the time that the <hi>Ordinary</hi> bu≈øied him≈øelf, he was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerved not to mind him, but to imploy him≈øelf in his private De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions, and after the Delivery of his Speech to the Sheriffs, his Cap pulled over his Eyes ready for Execution, he prayed thus; <q>Mo≈øt great and mo≈øt merciful Lord God! do thou look down upon me thy poor unworthy Servant in this hour of my great extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and have Mercy upon me. Sweet Je≈øus, receive my Soul into thine everla≈øting Kingdom, for into thy hands do I commend

my Spirit, becau≈øe thou ha≈øt redeemed it, O Lord God of Truth! Come Lord Je≈øus, and receive my pretious Soul, Father of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy have mercy upon me; O God the Son, Redeemer of the World, have mercy upon me; Lord, comfort and ≈øupport my Soul in the≈øe my la≈øt Minutes, come ≈øweet Je≈øus, come quickly, and ≈øave me ≈øweet Je≈øus by thy mo≈øt pretious Blood, by thy Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and bloody Sweat, and by the coming of the Holy Gho≈øt, O Lord, do thou deliver me.</q> Here the <hi>Ordinary</hi> put in ≈øaying, you mu≈øt give a ≈øign when you are ready; whereupon the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs charged him not to interrupt them; and as he was proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Si≈øter de≈øired to ≈øpeak to him, which was granted; who ki≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing him and weeping over him ≈øaid, <hi>be of good comfort though there is no Pardon for you here yet there is above.</hi> So when they had taken a Chri≈øtian leave of each other, he returned to his Devotions, when after a ≈øhort pathetical Prayer con≈øtantly calling upon his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour the Cart drove away. His Body was conveyed to a Hou≈øe near, till the dusk of the Evening, and then brought to Town, both for quietne≈øs ≈øake and to prevent giving Offence; but as privately as it was done, that Blood-hound <hi>Stephens</hi> pur≈øu'd him dead, and was ob≈øerved to walk ≈øeveral times by the Hou≈øe, and to give notice to the Mob; ≈øo that he who was de≈øigned to have been ≈øtollen to his Grave by a few Friends late in the night, was follow'd by a very numerous Train, but without any manner of Incivility, and now lies interr'd in little S. <hi>Bartholomew</hi>'s Church-yard, expecting a joyful Re≈øurrection, and the coming of the righteous Judge, before whom <hi>William</hi> and <hi>Mary, Anderton</hi> and <hi>Treby</hi> ≈øhall appear without any other difference or re≈øpect, than what their Sins or their Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues ≈øhall make; and from whom they ≈øhall receive according to what they have done in the fle≈øh, be it good or evil.</p>
