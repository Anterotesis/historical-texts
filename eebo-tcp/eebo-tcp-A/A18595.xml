            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For seeing nothing can be said, that hath not been before said, the singularitie of some mens conceits, (otherwayes exellent well deseruing) are no more to be soothed, than the peremptorie posies of two very sufficient Translators commended. To come in print is not to seeke praise, but to craue pardon: I am vrgd to the one; and bold to begge

the other, he that offende<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> being forst, is more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusable than the wilfull faultie, though both be guilty, there is difference in the guilt. To ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue custome, and auoid as I may cauill, oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing your fauors against my feare, Ile shew reason for my present writing, and after proceed to sue for pardon. About three moneths since died M. <hi>Robert Greene,</hi> leauing many papers in sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Booke sellers hands, among other his Groats<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth of wit, in which a letter written to diuers play-makers, is offensiuely by one or two of them taken, and because on the dead they cannot be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenged, they wilfully forge in their conceites a liuing Author: and after tossing it two and fro, no remedy, but it must light on me. How I haue all the time of my conuersing in printing hindred the bitter inueying against schollers, it hath been very well knowne, and how in that I dealt I can sufficiently prooue. With neither of them that take offence was I acquainted, and with one of them I care not if I neuer be: The other, whome at that time I did not so much spare, as since I wish I had, for that as I haue moderated the heate of liuing writers, and might haue vsde my owne discretion (especially in such a case) the Author beeing dead, that I did not, I am as
<pb facs="tcp:17363:3"/>
sory, as if the originall fault had beene my fault, because my selfe haue seene his demeanor no lesse ciuill than he exelent in the qualitie he professes: Besides, diuers of worship haue reported, his vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightnes of dealing, which argues his honesty, and his facetious grace in writting, that aprooues his Art. For the first, whose learning I reuerenee, and at the perusing of <hi>Greenes</hi> Booke, stroke out what then in conscience I thought he in some dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure writ: or had it beene true, yet to publish it, was intollerable: him I would wish to vse me no worse than I deserue. I had onely in the copy this share, it was il written, as sometime <hi>Greenes</hi> hand was none of the best, licensd it must be, ere it could bee printed which could neuer be if it might not be read. To be breife I writ it ouer, and as neare as I could, followed the copy, onely in that letter I put something out, but in the whole booke not a worde in, for I protest it was all <hi>Greenes,</hi> not mine nor Maister <hi>Nashes,</hi> as some vniustly haue affirmed. Neither was he the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an Epistle to the second part of Gerileon, though by the workemans error T. N. were set to the end: that I confesse to be mine, and repent it not.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:17363:4"/>Thus Gentlemen, hauing noted the priuate cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, that made me nominate my selfe in print; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aswell to purge Master <hi>Nashe</hi> of that he did not, as to iustifie what I did, and withall to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme what <hi>M. Greene</hi> did: I beseech yee accept the publike cause, which is both the desire of your delight, and common benefite: for though the toye bee shadowed vnder the Title of <hi>Kind-hearts Dreame,</hi> it discouers the false hearts of diuers that wake to commit mischiefe. Had not the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer reasons been, it had come forth without a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and then shuld I haue had no cause to feare offending, or reason to sue for fauour. Now am I in doubt of the one, though I hope of the other; which if I obtaine, you shall-bind me hereafter to bee silent, till I can present yee <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

For such is the folly of this age, so witlesse, so audaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that there are scarce to manye pedlers brag themselues to be printers because they haue a bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del of ballads in their packe, as there be idiots that thinke themselues Artists, because they can English an obligation, or write a true staffe to the tune of fortune. This folly raging vniuersally, hath infired me, to write the remembrance of sundry of my deceased frends, personages not alltogether ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure, for then were my subiect base, nor yet of any honourable carriage, for my stile is rude and bad:
<pb facs="tcp:17363:5"/>
and to such as Iit belongs not to iest with Gods. Kind-hart would haue his companions esteeme of Estates as starres, on whome meane men maye looke, but not ouer-looke. I haue heard of an elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Orator, that trimly furnished with warres abiliments, had on his shield this <hi>Motto Bona for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuna:</hi> yet at the first meeting of the enimy fled with out fight. For which being reprooued, he replied. If I haue saued my selfe in this battell by flight, I shal liue to chase the enimy in the next. So Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men fares it with mee, If enuious misconsterers arme themselues against my simple meaning, and wrest euery iest to a wrong sense. I thinke it policy to fly at the first fight, till I gather fresh forces to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse their folly. Neither can they what <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuers his dreame; with euery Apparition simply as it was vttered. Its fond for them to fight against ghosts: its fearefull for me to hide an Apparition: by concealing it I might doe my selfe harme and them no good; by reuealing it, ease my hart, and doe no honest men hurt: for the rest (although I would not willingy moue the meanest) they must beare as I doe, or mend it as they may. Well least ye deeme all my dreame but an Epistle. I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to that without any further circumstance.</p>

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:17363:6"/>First after a harsh and confused sound, it seemed there enrered at once <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iue personages, seuerally attired, and diuersly qualified, three bearing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments, their fauours pleasant; two appearing to be Artists, their countenances reuerend.</p>
            <p>The first of the first three was an od old fellow, low of stature, his head was couered with around cap, his body with a fide skirted tawney coate, his legs and feete trust vppe in leather buskins, his gray haires and furrowed face witnessed his age, his treble violl in his hande, assured me of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession. On which (by his continuall sawing ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing left but one string) after his best manner, hee gaue me a huntsvp: whome after a little musing, I assuredly remembred to be no other but old An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony Now now.</p>
            <p>The next, by his sute of russet, his buttond cap, his taber, his standing on the toe, and other tricks, I knew to be either the body or resemblaunce of Tarlton, who liuing for his pleasant conceits was of all men liked, and dying, for mirth left not his like.</p>
            <p>The third (as the first) was an olde fellowe, his beard milkewhite, his head couered with a round lowe crownd rent silke hat, on which was a band knit in many knotes, wherein stucke two round stickes after the Iuglers manner. His ierkin was of leather cut, his cloake of three coulers, his hole paind with y<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>llow drawn out with blew, his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument was a bagpipe, &amp; him I knew to be Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
<pb facs="tcp:17363:6"/>
Cuckoe, better knowne than lou'd, and yet some thinke as well lou'd as he was worthy.</p>
            <p>The other two had in their countenances a reuerent grace, the one which was the elder, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming more seuere, was in habite like a Doctor, in his right hand hee held a Compendium of all the famous Phisitions and Surgions workes beelon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to Theorike, in his lefte hand a table of all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments for mans health, appertaining to prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise.</p>
            <p>At the sight of this Doctor, you maye thinke Gentlemen, Kind-hart was in a pitious case: for I verily beleeued he had beene some rare Artist, that taking me for a dead man had come to anatomize me, but taking comfort that my thrumde hat, had hanging at it the ensignes of my occupation, like a tall fellow (as to me it seemed) I lookte him in the face and beheld him to bee maister Doctor Burcot (though a stranger, yet in England for phisicke fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous.</p>
            <p>With him was the fifth, a man of indifferent yeares, of face amible, of body well proportioned, his attire after the habite of a schollerlike Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, onely his haire was somewhat long, whome I supposed to be Robert Greene, maister of Artes: of whome (howe euer some suppose themselues iniured) I haue learned to speake, considering he is dead, <hi>nill nisi necessarium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was of singuler pleasaunce the verye sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porter, and to no mans disgrace bee this intended,
<pb facs="tcp:17363:7"/>
the only Comedian of a vulgar writer in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
            <p>Well thus these fiue appeared, and by them in post past a knight of the post, whome in times past I haue seen as highly promoted as the pillory: but I haue heard since he was a diuell, that plaide the Cariar of Pierce penilesse packet to Lucifer, and was now returning to contaminate the ayre, with his pestilent periuries, and abhominable false wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse bearing.</p>
            <p>How Pierce his supplication pleased his Patron I know not, but sure I take it this Friend had a foule check for medling in the matter: for when all these fiue before named had made profer of seuerall bills inuectiue against abuses raigning, this diuelish Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger repulsed them wrathfully, and bad them get some other to bee their packet bearer if they list, for he had almost hazarded his credit in hell, by beeing a Broker betweene Pierce Penilesse and his Lord: and so without hearing their reply, flew from them like a whirle wind. With that, (after a small pause) in a round ring they compassed my bed, and thrusting into my hand all their papers, they at once charged mee to awake, and publish them to the world.</p>
            <p>This charge seemed to mee most dreadfull of all the dreame, because in that the distinguishing of their seuerall voices was heard, farre from the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent manner of mens speach.

Fie vppon following plaies, the expence is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous; vpon players speeches, their wordes are full of wyles; vppon their gestures, that are altogether wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton. Is it not lamentable, that a man should spende his two pence on them in an after-noone, heare couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes amongst them daily quipt at, being one of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monest occupations in the countrey; and in liuely ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture see trecherie set out, with which euery man now adaies vseth to intrap his brother. Byr lady, this would be lookt into: if these be the fruites of playing, tis time the practisers were expeld.</p>
                  <p>Expeld (quoth you) that hath been pretily performd, to the no smal profit of the Bouling-allyes in Bedlam and other places, that were wont in the after-noones to be left empty, by the recourse of good fellows vnto that vnprofitable recreation of Stage-playing.</p>

                  <p>But I haue more to say than this; Is it not greate shame, that the houses of retaylers neare the Townes end, should be by their continuance impouerished: Alas good hearts, they pay great rentes, and pittie it is but they be prouided for. While Playes are vsde, halfe the day is by most youthes that haue libertie spent vppon them, or at least the greatest company drawne to the places where they frequent. If they were supprest, the flocke of yoong people would bee equally parted. But now the greatest trade is brought into one street. Is it not as faire a way to <hi>Myle-end by White-chappell,</hi> as by <hi>Shorditch to Hackney?</hi> the Sunne shineth as clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the one place, as in the other; the shades are of a like pleasure: onely this is the fault, that by ouermuch heat sometime they are in both places infectious.</p>
                  <p>As well in this as other things there is great abuse: for in euery house where the venerian virgins are resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, hospitalitie is quite exiled, such fines, such taxes, such tribute, such customs, as (poore soules) after seuen yeares seruice in that vnhallowed order, they are faine to leaue their sutes for offerings to the olde <hi>Lenos</hi> that are shrine-keepers, and themselues (when they begin to break) are faine to seeke harbour in an Hospitall: which chaunceth not (as sometime is thought) to one amongst twentie, but hardly one amongst a hundred haue better ending. And therefore seeing they liue so hardly, its pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Players should hinder their takings a peny.</p>

                  <p>His house beeing in a Uillage through which was no thorough Fare, his men, and sometime his Master<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe in their company at midnight woulde goe into their neighbours seuerall grounds being farre distant from their dwelling houses, and oftentimes driue from thence Horses, Mares, Oxen, Kine, Calues, or Sheepe, what euer came next to hande, a mile per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaunce or more out of the place wherein they were left.</p>
                  <p>Home would they return and leaue the cattel stray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: In the morning, sometime the milke-maids misse their Kine, another day the Plough-hinds their Oxen, their Horses another time, somewhat of some woorth once a weeke lightly. Whither can these poore people go but to the wisemans worship? Perchaunce in a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning two or three come to complaine and seeke reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, who welcommed by one of his men, are seuerally demaunded of their losses.

A while after he stamps and makes a noyse aboue, the seruingman intreats the Suters to go vp, and hee hearing them comming himselfe kindly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens them the dore, and ere euer they speake, salutes them, protesting for their losse great sorrowe, as if hee knew their griefes by reuelation, comforts them with hope of recouery, and such like wordes. They cry out, Iesu blesse your Mastership, what a gift haue you to tel our mindes and neuer heares vs speake. I neighbors saith he, ye may thanke God I trust I am come among ye to doe ye all good. Then knowing which way they were driuen, hee bids them goe either East-ward, or South-warde to seeke neere such an Oake or rowe of Elmes, or water, or such like marke neere the place where the Cattell were left; and hee assures them that by his skill the theeues had no power to carry them farther than that place. They runne and seek their cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, which when they finde, O admirable wise man, the price of a Cow we will not sticke with him for, happy is the shire where such a one dwels.

Which he patiently intending, on a sodaine the sent of the Ploughs waines meate so pierced his senses, that had all India beene the meede of his abstinence, eate he will, or die he must.
